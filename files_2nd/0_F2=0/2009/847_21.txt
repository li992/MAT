The most significant elements of unamortised goodwill arose on the acquisition of AGRA Inc. in April 2000.
The ongoing operations of AGRA Inc. fall into each of the current business segments.
Due to the time elapsed since this acquisition and the restructuring of the Group and its reported business segments over the last few years, it is not possible to allocate this goodwill on a reasonable basis between the current operating segments.
Unallocated net assets liabilities principally comprise assets and liabilities relating to the pension schemes, dividends, derivative financial instruments and taxation and are not directly related to the activities of the segments.

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of GRD Limited has not been tested in 2009 due to the proximity of the acquisition to 31 December 2009.
The group has six acquired cash generating units CGUs with material unamortised goodwill as set out in the table below.
This is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by management.
Unamortised goodwill in the table below may differ from that disclosed in note 24 due to exchange movements between the date of acquisition and 31 December 2009.
The recoverable amount of the CGU has been based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections included in the financial budgets approved by management covering a two year period and pre-tax discount rates as set out in the table below.
Given the current market conditions, management believe that the discount rates chosen are conservative.
For the purposes of the calculation of the recoverable amount, the cash flow projections beyond the two year period include two per cent growth per annum 2008: two per cent, which is in line with long-term average growth rate for the regions in which the CGUs operate.
The value-in-use has been compared to the carrying value for each CGU and an impairment charge of 1.3 million was identified and charged in the year in respect of Bower Damberger Rolseth Engineering Limited.
No impairment is required nor has been charged in respect of the other acquisitions.
The financial budgets are developed using an assumed workload and margin for the following year.
Workload is underpinned by a secured order book for each CGU, and order book remains strong at 3.2 billion as at 31 December 2009.
The margin selected is based on managements review of the margins on orders received and from the results of Operational Excellence.
The group remains firmly on track to deliver its margin target of 8.5 per cent for 2010.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed, at the individual CGU level, in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions.
For example, a 10 per cent decrease in volume, with all other assumptions held constant, or a one per cent decrease in margin, with all other assumptions held constant did not identify any further material impairments.
Similarly, zero growth after the initial two year period, with all other assumptions held constant or a one per cent increase in discount rate did not identify any further material impairments.

14 Retirement benefit assets and liabilities The group operates a number of pension schemes for UK and overseas employees.
Substantially all UK members are in funded defined benefit schemes, with the main schemes being the AMEC Staff Pension Scheme and the AMEC Executive Pension Scheme.
The majority of overseas members are in defined contribution schemes.
Contributions by the group into defined contribution schemes are disclosed in note 6.
Defined benefit schemes The valuations used have been based on the most recent valuation of the two major UK schemes as at 1 April 2008 and updated by the schemes actuaries for the requirement to assess the present value of the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 December 2009.
The assets of the schemes are stated at their aggregate market value as at 31 December.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries in relation to the main UK schemes are as follows: 31 December 31 December 1 January 2009 2008 2008 Per cent Per cent Per cent Rate of discount 5.7 6.0 5.7 Rate of inflation 3.6 2.8 3.2 Rate of increase in salaries 4.6 3.8 4.2 Rate of increase in pensions in payment future past service 2.4 3.6 2.5 2.8 3.2 3.2 Expected rate of return on scheme assets: Equities 7.9 7.3 8.1 Bonds 5.7 6.0 5.7 Gilts 4.4 3.8 4.6 Property 6.4 5.8 6.6 For the main UK pension schemes, the assumed life expectancy is as follows: Male Female years years Member aged 65 current life expectancy 21.3 23.6 Member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 23.2 25.5 The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the company considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets for the portfolio.
This resulted in the selection of the 6.16 per cent assumption as at 31 December 2009.

Factors affecting the tax charge in future years There are a number of factors that may affect the groups future tax charge including the resolution of open issues with tax authorities, corporate acquisitions and disposals, the use of brought-forward losses and changes in tax legislation and tax rates.
88 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2009 Introduction Strategy Sustainability Performance Governance Financials 15 Deferred tax assets and liabilities continued Unrecognised deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items: 31 December 31 December 1 January 2009 2008 2008 million million million Deductible temporary differences 17.0 29.5 34.4 Tax losses 72.5 39.9 45.8 89.5 69.4 80.2 There are tax losses of 7.7 million arising in the US, all of which expire in 2024.
The other tax losses and deductible temporary differences not recognised by the group do not expire under current tax legislation.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the group can utilise these assets.
Unrecognised deferred tax liabilities No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of 336.0 million of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is not probable that such differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities in respect of these unremitted earnings is estimated to be 17.2 million.

19 Financial instruments Details of the groups financial risk management objectives and policies, together with its policies for hedging are provided in the business and financial review on pages 33 and 34.
Hedging of interest rate risk The group remained in a net cash position throughout the year.
As a result, long-term interest rate hedging for periods beyond three to six months is not considered appropriate.
Hedging of foreign currency risk cash flow hedges The group looks to mitigate the foreign exchange risk typically arising where contracts are awarded in, or involve costs, in non-local currency.
Forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps are used for this purpose and are designated as cash flow hedges.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of forward contracts and swaps designated as cash flow hedges are as follows: 2009 2008 2009 2008 Notional Notional Carrying Carrying contract contract amount and amount and amount amount fair value fair value million million million million Current assets 22.3 10.5 0.8 2.2 Current liabilities 39.9 67.4 5.3 13.2 62.2 77.9 4.5 11.0 90 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2009 Introduction Strategy Sustainability Performance Governance Financials 19 Financial instruments continued The following tables indicate the periods in which the cash flows associated with the forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are expected to occur and the periods in which they are expected to impact profit or loss: 2009 Carrying Expected 6 months 6-12 1-2 2-5 More than amount cash flows or less months years years 5 years million million million million million million million Forward exchange contracts Assets 0.8 22.3 13.3 6.7 1.1 1.2 Liabilities 5.3 39.9 16.5 4.6 9.7 9.1 4.5 62.2 29.8 11.3 10.8 10.3 2008 Carrying Expected 6 months 6-12 1-2 2-5 More than amount cash flows or less months years years 5 years million million million million million million million Forward exchange contracts Assets 2.2 10.5 2.8 1.9 3.5 2.3 Liabilities 13.2 67.4 22.9 13.1 12.5 18.9 11.0 77.9 25.7 15.0 16.0 21.2 Certain forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps are not designated as cash flow hedges and changes in their fair value are recognised through the income statement.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of these forward contracts and swaps are as follows: 2009 2008 2009 2008 Notional Notional Carrying Carrying contract contract amount and amount and amount amount fair value fair value million million million million Current assets 58.8 108.6 1.0 7.4 Current liabilities 11.2 28.4 0.2 1.6 70.0 137.0 0.8 5.8 Hedging of foreign currency risk net investment hedges The group uses forward foreign exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps which have been designated as hedges of the net investments in subsidiaries in Canada and the US.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of swaps designated as net investment hedges are as follows: 2009 2008 2009 2008 Notional Notional Carrying Carrying contract contract amount and amount and amount amount fair value fair value million million million million Non-current assets 22.3 1.4 Current liabilities 25.4 25.3 5.1 6.4 Non-current liabilities 148.6 174.0 22.3 33.9 196.3 199.3 26.0 40.3 A net foreign exchange gain for the year of 11.6 million 2008: loss of 38.6 million was recognised in the translation reserve in respect of these forward foreign exchange contracts and swaps.
The investment hedging policy was changed in 2009 to cease translation hedging for core assets of the business.
As a result of this change in policy, existing hedging contracts will not be replaced as they mature.
AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2009 91 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 19 Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk contractual maturity and effective interest rates In respect of interest-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they mature: 2009 Effective 6 months interest rate Total or less Per cent million million Short-term investments 0.59 130.7 130.7 Cash and cash equivalents 0.38 612.0 612.0 742.7 742.7 2008 Effective 6 months interest rate Total or less Per cent million million Cash and cash equivalents 2.3 764.6 764.6 Unsecured bank loans: Sterling fixed rate loan 7.2 0.1 0.1 764.5 764.5 Currency risk The group publishes its consolidated accounts in Sterling.
It conducts business in a range of currencies, including Canadian and US dollars and currencies linked to the US dollar.
As a result, the group is exposed to foreign exchange risks, which will affect transaction costs and the translation results and value of underlying assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The group hedges its material transaction related exposures.
With respect to translation exposure, the group does not hedge the profits generated in non-Sterling currencies but does hedge a proportion of assets denominated in foreign currencies.
The impact of a 10 per cent movement in the average Sterling Canadian dollar and Sterling US dollar rates on post-tax profit for 2009 is 13.0 million 2008: 10.0 million.
The impact of a 10 per cent movement in the closing rates on equity for 2009 is 40.1 million 2008: 22.8 million.
Credit risk The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments recorded in the balance sheet.
The ageing of trade receivables at the year end was: Gross Gross receivables Impairment receivables Impairment 2009 2009 2008 2008 million million million million Not past due 177.6 1.0 171.7 1.6 Past due 0-30 days 45.7 0.2 109.1 2.5 Past due 31-120 days 23.7 1.2 47.2 2.7 Past due 121-365 days 12.5 6.5 54.1 10.0 More than one year 18.6 11.0 11.0 9.8 278.1 19.9 393.1 26.6 The above analysis excludes retentions relating to contracts in progress of 12.8 million 2008: 21.5 million expected to be recovered within one year and 8.9 million 2008: 7.5 million expected to be recovered after one year.
Net receivables as at 31 December 2009 include 7.6 million 2008: 1.2 million in respect of amounts overdue by more than one year.
The group believes there is no material exposure in respect of these balances.
92 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2009 Introduction Strategy Sustainability Performance Governance Financials 19 Financial instruments continued The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows: 2009 2008 million million As at 1 January 26.6 20.0 Exchange movements 0.4 4.9 Additional impairment allowance charged 6.3 1.7 As at 31 December 19.9 26.6 Based on past experience, the group believes that no material impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due.
Trade receivable exposures are typically with large companies and government backed organisations, and the credit ratings of these organisations are monitored.
Credit risks are minimised through the use of letters of credit, parent company guarantees, insurance instruments and forward funding where achievable.
The groups most significant customer is ExxonMobil, which in 2009 accounted for around 15 per cent of continuing revenues.
Cash deposits and financial transactions give rise to credit risk in the event that counterparties fail to perform under the contract.
AMEC manages these risks by ensuring that surplus funds are placed with a diversified range of 25-30 mainstream banks and with each counterparty up to a pre-approved limit.
These limits are set at prudent levels by the board, are based primarily on credit ratings set by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch and have been reviewed in light of the recent market turbulence.
The group treasury department monitors counterparty exposure on a global basis to avoid over concentration of exposure to any one counterparty.
Fair values The fair values together with the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet are as follows: Carrying Carrying amount amount Fair value Fair value 2009 2008 2009 2008 million million million million Current trade and other receivables 305.8 419.3 305.8 419.3 Forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps: Assets 3.2 9.6 3.2 9.6 Liabilities 32.9 55.1 32.9 55.1 Short-term investments 130.7 130.7 Cash and cash equivalents 612.0 764.6 612.0 764.6 Unsecured bank loans 0.1 0.1 Non-current trade and other payables 16.3 28.3 16.3 28.3 Current trade and other payables 440.2 547.2 440.2 547.2 Fair values are determined as follows: Trade and other receivables and payables, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are valued at their amortised cost, which are deemed to reflect fair value.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk free interest rate.
Bank loans and bonds are valued based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.

The provision for indemnities relates to the indemnification of the purchasers of SPIE in 2006, purchasers of the Built Environment businesses and other peripheral businesses in 2007, and to the Wind Developments business which was sold in 2008.
The insurance provision relates to the potential liabilities in the groups captive insurance entity and provisions in relation to risks associated with insurance claims.
Future outflows in respect of the onerous property contracts are expected to occur over the next several years.
Due to the nature of the other liabilities, the timing of any potential future outflows is uncertain.
22 Share capital and reserves Movements in share capital and reserves are shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity on pages 61 and 62.
Reserves The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the accounts of foreign operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities and the cumulative net change in the fair value of instruments that hedge the companys net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
The group has acquired 855,349 shares 2008: 3,200,000 during the year which are held in treasury.

This comprises 700 million 2008: 700 million ordinary shares of 50 pence each.
All the ordinary shares rank parri passu in all respects.
To the companys knowledge and belief, there are no restrictions on the transfer of shares in the company or on voting rights between holders of shares.

Share-based payments Offers are made periodically in certain countries under the UK and International Savings Related Share Option Schemes which are open to all employees in those countries who meet minimum service criteria.
Grants of share options are made to participating employees that entitle them to buy shares in the company normally after three years at up to 20 per cent discount to the market price of the shares at the time of offer.
In the US, to conform with the relevant tax rules, options are granted at a maximum discount of 15 per cent to the share price at the time of grant and are normally exercisable after two years.
In certain countries, awards take the form of cash-settled stock appreciation rights.
Under the Performance Share Plan, annual awards are made to directors and selected senior employees of restricted shares that are subject to both market and non-market based conditions calculated over a three-year period.
During 2008, one-off awards were made under the Transformation Incentive Plan that are subject to non-market based conditions related to 2010 performance.
Detailed terms of these plans are included in the remuneration report on pages 50 and 51.
The Company has a second scheme in place, the Executive Share Option Scheme.
AMECs policy is to grant share options under this scheme only selectively and in exceptional circumstances such as recruitment.
No awards have been made under this scheme since 2004.

27 Contingent liabilities Guarantees and indemnities The borrowings of joint ventures are generally without recourse to AMEC.

Legal claims and actions AMEC has taken internal and external legal advice in considering known legal claims and actions made by or against the company.
Consequently, it carefully assesses the likelihood of the success of a claim or action including those identified in this note.
AMEC makes an appropriate provision for those legal claims or actions against the company on the basis of the likely outcome, but makes no provision for those which are, in its view, unlikely to succeed.
Provisions of 53.8 million 2008: 65.3 million are shown in note 21 in respect of these claims.
It is not practicable to quantify the remaining contingent liability because of the range of possible outcomes and the progress of the litigation.
The information below indicates the quantum of claims against AMEC or where AMEC is unable to quantify the claim, an indication of the gross contract value or the amount in dispute.
As the matters below involve actions by third parties against AMEC, the timing of settlement cannot be determined although AMEC is endeavouring to settle as soon as practicable.
Due to the litigation, there is no work in progress or other receivable recognised in respect of these contracts.
Whilst AMEC believes that certain claims may be covered by insurance, it is not currently practicable to assess the extent to which AMECs insurance policies will respond in the event of a settlement.
After the terrorist attacks in September 2001, AMEC Construction Management Inc. ACMI was one of four construction managers hired by the City of New York to carry out the clean-up and debris removal work at the World Trade Center site.
The customer was responsible for procuring insurance to protect the construction managers and various contractors from lawsuits arising out of the work.
The World Trade Center Captive Insurance Company the WTC Captive was formed and was funded with US$1 billion in Federal money to provide coverage for the City, the construction managers and the contractors who performed the work on site.
Pursuant to the insurance policy that was issued, the WTC Captive is providing a minimum of US$1 billion in insurance coverage.
This amount can increase depending upon investment returns on the US$1 billion but is also being reduced by legal fees incurred.
The WTC Captive is providing a defence and indemnification for claims against ACMI arising out of this work and has recently entered into a contingent settlement agreement with plaintiffs counsel, representing over 10,000 plaintiffs, for between US$575 million and US$657 million provided at least 95 per cent of plaintiffs opt in to this settlement.
AMEC Group Limited AGL is currently the subject of certain ongoing Health and Safety Executive investigations, in respect of separate incidents involving two separate fatalities to subcontractors at the Leftbank Apartments project in Manchester in April 2004 and April 2005.
Two summons have been received with respect to the second fatality and this case will go to trial in September 2010.
If AGL is to be prosecuted in the Crown Court for these cases, it could be liable to unlimited fines.
A prosecution for AGL in relation to fatal accidents in relatively quick succession such as those at the Leftbank Apartments could have an impact on the amount of any penalty.
AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2009 103 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 27 Contingent liabilities continued AGL has also received two summons with regard to an incident involving a fatality at the Aberthaw Power Station.
This accident occurred during work which was outside of AMECs undertaking and control and which involved the death of a subcontractor of the client.
AMEC are still considering their plea, but it is anticipated that this case will go to full trial during 2010.
If found guilty AGL would be liable to unlimited fines.
