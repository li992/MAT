22 REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS INCORPORATING THE BUSINESS REVIEW continued Due to the readily realisable nature of the Companys assets, cash flow does not have the same significance as for an industrial or commercial company.
The Companys principal cash flows arise from the purchase and sales of investments and the income from investments against which must be set the costs of borrowing and management expenses.
Social and Environmental Policies As an investment trust company with no employees, property or activities outside investment management, environmental policy has limited application.
The Manager considers various factors when evaluating potential investments.
Some are financial ratios and measures, such as free cash flow, earnings per share and price-to-book value.
Others are more subjective indicators which rely on first hand research: for example quality of management, innovation and product strength.
The Companys policy is that, subject to an overriding requirement to pursue the best financial interests of the Company, the Manager should take account of social, environmental and ethical factors in making and holding investments and in the use of voting powers conferred by such investments.
At the AGM in 2008, shareholders adopted revised Articles of Association which allow the Company to send or supply documents or information to shareholders in electronic forms e. g. by email or by means of a website.
This will deliver environmental benefits through reduced use of paper and the energy required for its production and distribution.
Substantial Holdings in the Company At 31 May 2009, the Company had been notified of the following holdings of 3% and over of the Companys share capital carrying unrestricted voting rights: HOLDING % AXA Investment Managers 11,659,164 6.10 Brewin Dolphin, Stockbrokers 9,760,041 5.00 Legal & General Investment Management 8,605,863 4.41 Rensburg Sheppards Investment Management 7,818,747 4.01 Rathbones 6,340,459 3.25 JPMorgan Asset Management 6,206,198 3.18 Charles Stanley, Stockbrokers 6,101,384 3.13 Special Business at the Annual General Meeting The notice of the Annual General Meeting AGM of the Company to be held on 17 July 2009 at 10.30 a. m. is on pages 55 to 58.
In addition to the ordinary business, five resolutions are proposed as special business, three as special resolutions and two as ordinary resolutions.
Ordinary Resolution 9 and Special Resolution 10: Authority to Allot Shares Resolution 9 is an Ordinary Resolution to seek authority for the Directors to allot up to 10% of the issued ordinary share capital, this being an aggregate nominal amount of 4,877,918 as at 8 June 2009.
Resolution 10 is a Special Resolution which seeks authority to issue up to 10% of the issued ordinary share capital pursuant to a rights issue or otherwise than in connection with a rights issue, dis-applying pre-emption rights.
This will allow shares to be issued to new shareholders, within the prescribed limits, without having to be offered to existing shareholders first, thus broadening the shareholder base of the Company.
The Directors will not use the authority to dilute the interests of existing shareholders by issuing shares at a price which is less than the Net Asset Value of the existing shares in issue at that time.
These authorities will expire at the next AGM of the Company or fifteen months after the passing of the Resolutions, whichever is the earlier.
Special Resolution 11: Authority to Buy Back Shares Resolution 11 seeks to renew the Directors authority to purchase up to 14.99% of the Companys issued share capital, this being 29,247,998 ordinary shares as at 8 June 2009.
The authority will expire at the Companys next AGM or on 30 September 2010, if earlier.
The principal purpose of share buy backs is to enhance the net asset value for remaining shareholders and purchases will only be made if they enhance the net asset value for the remaining shareholders.
