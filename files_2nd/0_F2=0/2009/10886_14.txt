Actuarial information on pensions The National Grid UK Pension Scheme is funded with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme is subject to independent actuarial valuation at least every three years, on the basis of which the qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers' contribution which, together with the specified contributions payable by employees and the proceeds from the scheme's assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the scheme.
The scheme provides final salary defined benefits for employees who joined prior to 31 March 2002 and defined contribution benefits for employees joining from 1 April 2002.
The latest full actuarial valuation was carried out by Watson Wyatt LLP at 31 March 2007.
The aggregate market value of the schemes assets was 12,923m and the value of the assets represented 97% of the actuarial value of benefits due to members, calculated on the basis of pensionable earnings and service at 31 March 2007 on an ongoing basis and allowing for projected increases in pensionable earnings.
There was a funding deficit of 442m on the valuation date 309m net of tax, in light of which National Grid agreed a recovery plan with the trustees.
The results of the actuarial valuation carried out at 31 March 2007 showed that, based on long-term financial assumptions, the contribution rate required to meet future benefit accrual was 32.4% of pensionable earnings 29.4% employers and 3% employees.
In addition, the employers pay an allowance for administration expenses which was 3.2% of pensionable earnings for 2008 09, giving a total Company rate of 32.6% of pensionable earnings.
These contribution rates will be reviewed as part of the next valuation on 31 March 2010.
In accordance with the recovery plan agreed with the trustees at the 2007 valuation date, NGG paid contributions of 228m 164m net of tax in the year to 31 March 2009 and a further payment of 58m 42m net of tax in April 2009 to ensure that the deficit revealed at the 2007 valuation is paid in full.

Actuarial information on pensions continued Assets allocations and actuarial assumptions The major categories of plan assets as a percentage of total plan assets were as follows: 2009 2008 % % Equities 33.9 33.8 Corporate bonds 34.7 26.7 Gilts 21.0 29.9 Property 5.5 6.8 Other 4.9 2.8 Total 100.0 100.0 The expected long-term rate of return on assets has been set reflecting the price inflation expectation, the expected real return on each major asset class and the long-term asset allocation strategy adopted for the scheme.
The expected real returns on specific assets classes reflect historical returns, investment yields on the measurement date and general future return expectations, and have been set after taking advice from the scheme's actuaries.
The current target asset allocation for the scheme is 34% equities, 58% bonds and 8% property and other.
The principal actuarial assumptions used were: 2009 2008 % % Discount rate i 6.8 6.6 Expected return on plan assets 6.4 6.1 Rate of increase in salaries ii 3.8 4.6 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.0 3.8 Rate of increase in Retail Price Index 2.9 3.7 i The discount rate for pension liabilities has been determined by reference to appropriate yields prevailing in the UK debt markets at the balance sheet date.

Supplementary information on derivative financial instruments Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from the price of an underlying item such as interest rates, foreign exchange, credit spreads, commodities and equity or other indices.
Derivatives enable their users to alter exposure to market or credit risks.
NGG uses derivatives to manage treasury risks.
Treasury financial instruments Derivatives are used for hedging purposes in the management of exposure to market risks.
This enables the optimisation of the overall cost of accessing debt capital markets, and to mitigate the market risk which would otherwise arise from the maturity and other risk profiles of NGGs assets and liabilities.
Hedging policies using derivative financial instruments are further explained in note 27.
Derivatives that are held as hedging instruments are formally designated as hedges as defined in IAS 39.
Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they are fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.
These are described as follows: Fair value hedges Fair value hedges principally consist of interest rate and cross-currency swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of fixed-rate, long-term financial instruments due to movements in market interest rates.
For qualifying fair value hedges, all changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the item in relation to the risk being hedged are recognised in remeasurements within the income statement.
If the hedge relationship is terminated, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the item and is amortised to the income statement as a yield adjustment over the remainder of the hedging period.
Cash flow hedges Exposure arises from the variability in future interest and currency cash flows on assets and liabilities which bear interest at variable rates or are in a foreign currency which is swapped into a fixed sterling rate.
Interest rate and cross-currency swaps are maintained to manage this exposure, and, where they qualify, designated as cash flow hedges.
Fair value changes on designated cash flow hedges are initially recognised directly in the cash flow hedge reserve, as gains or losses recognised in equity.
Amounts are transferred from equity and recognised in the income statement as the income or expense is recognised on the hedged asset or liability.
Forward foreign currency contracts are used to hedge anticipated and committed future currency cash flows.
Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting they are designated as cash flow hedges.
On recognition of the underlying transaction in the financial statements, the associated hedge gains and losses deferred in equity are transferred and included with the recognition of the underlying transaction.
The gains and losses on ineffective portions of such derivatives are recognised immediately in remeasurements within the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement or on the balance sheet.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to remeasurements within the income statement.
Derivatives not in a formal hedge relationship NGGs policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes, however, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement within interest expense and other finance costs.

Financial risk NGGs activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk: fair value interest rate risk: cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors of National Grid plc.
This department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the operating units.
The National Grid plc Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity as discussed further in NGGs treasury policy, described on page 19.
The information provided below in respect of financial risk factors includes financial amounts which are simple apportionments of such amounts in respect of National Grid Gas plc, as reported in its annual report and accounts.
Accordingly, disclosures are only provided in total for the regulatory businesses reported within these regulatory accounting statements.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk NGG raises finance in various currencies and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from related currency exposures.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities.
With respect to near term foreign exchange risk, NGG uses foreign exchange forwards to manage foreign exchange transaction exposure.
Its policy is to hedge a minimum percentage of known contracted foreign currency flows in order to mitigate foreign currency movements in the intervening period.
Where cash forecasts are less certain, NGG generally covers a percentage of the foreign currency flows depending on the level of agreed probability for those future cash flows.
During 2009 and 2008, derivative financial instruments were used to manage foreign currency risk as follows: 2009 2008 Sterling Euro US dollar Other Total Sterling Euro US dollar Other Total m m m m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents ----- 2- -- 2 Financial investments 372 - - - 372 218 - - - 218 Borrowings 2,322 488 292 96 3,198 2,348 141 212 165 2,866 Pre-derivative position 1,950 488 292 96 2,826 2,128 141 212 165 2,646 Derivative effect 464 143 206 165 50 582 490 284 96 288 2,532 2 8 - 2,592 2 6 - Net debt position 2,538 2,596 National Grid Gas plc NTS Regulatory Accounting Statements 2008 09 75 27.
Financial risk continued ii Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from NGGs borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose NGG to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose NGG to fair value interest rate risk.
The interest rate risk management policy, as further explained on page 20, is to minimise the finance costs being interest costs and changes in the market value of debt.
Some of NGGs borrowings issued are index-linked, that is their cost is linked to changes in the UK Retail Prices Index RPI.
We believe that these borrowings provide a good hedge for revenues and regulatory asset values that are also RPI-linked.
Interest rate risk arising from our financial investments is primarily variable being mainly composed of short dated money funds.
The following table sets out the carrying amount, by contractual maturity, of borrowings that are exposed to interest rate risk before taking into account interest rate swaps: 2009 2008 m m Fixed interest rate borrowings In one year or less 259 265 In more than one year but not more than two years - 224 In more than two years but not more than three years - - In more than three years but not more than four years 8 - In more than four years but not more than five years 277 6 In more than five years 1,089 787 1,633 1,282 Floating interest rate borrowings including RPI 1,565 1,584 Total borrowings 3,198 2,866 During 2009 and 2008, net debt was managed using derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk as follows: 2009 2008 Fixed rate Floating rate RPI i Other ii Total Fixed rate Floating rate RPI i Other ii Total m m m m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents ----- -2 - - 2 Financial investments - 372 - - 372 - 218 - - 218 Borrowings 1,633 423 1,142 - 3,198 1,282 426 1,158 - 2,866 Pre-derivative position 1,633 51 1,142 - 2,826 1,282 206 1,158 - 2,646 Derivative effect 517 322 92 1 288 459 412 - 3 50 Net debt position 1,116 373 1,050 1 2,538 823 618 1,158 3 2,596 i Represents financial instruments which are linked to the UK retail prices index.
ii Represents financial instruments which are not directly affected by interest rate risk, including investments in equity or other non-interest bearing instruments.
76 National Grid Gas plc NTS Regulatory Accounting Statements 2008 09 27.
Financial risk continued b Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a portfolio basis for the National Grid group as a whole.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to wholesale and retail customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
Treasury related credit risk Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from the use of derivative instruments.
NGGs limits are managed by National Grid plc, as explained in Treasury policies on page 19.
As at 31 March 2009 and 2008, NGG had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
In accordance with treasury policies and exposure management practices, counterparty credit exposure limits are continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity.
It is not expected that there will be any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
The counterparty exposure under allocated derivative financial contracts as shown in note 11 was 329m 2008: 96m : after netting agreements it was 367m 2008: 76m.
This exposure is further reduced by collateral received as shown in note 14.
Wholesale and retail credit risk The transmission businesss principal commercial exposure is governed by the credit rules within the Uniform Network Code.
These lay down the level of credit relative to the regulatory asset value for each credit rating.
Management does not expect any significant losses of receivables that have not been provided for as shown in note 13. c Liquidity analysis NGG manages its liquidity requirements by the use of both shortand long-term cash flow forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom position which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12-month period.
The following is an analysis of the contractual undiscounted cash flows payable under financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date: At 31 March 2009 At 31 March 2008 Due Due Due Due Due Due Due between between 3 years Due between between 3 years within 1 and 2 2 and 3 and within 1 and 2 2 and 3 and 1 year years years beyond Total 1 year years years beyond Total m m m m m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 561 - - 2,687 3,248 498 299 - 2,175 2,972 Interest payments on borrowings i 101 94 97 1,491 1,783 97 80 72 1,389 1,638 Other non-interest bearing liabilities 153 - - - 153 300 1 - - 301 Derivative financial liabilities Derivative contracts receipts 166 46 21 249 482 38 27 8 1,015 1,088 Derivative contracts payments 15 13 10 157 195 19 10 10 1,293 1,332 876 363 74 3,842 5,155 664 61 86 4,086 4,897 i The interest on borrowings is calculated based on borrowings held at 31 March without taking into account future issues.
Floating rate interest is estimated using a future interest rate curve as at 31 March.
National Grid Gas plc NTS Regulatory Accounting Statements 2008 09 77 27.
Financial risk continued d Sensitivity analysis at 31 March 2009 Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK interest rates and the UK Retail Prices Index.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of provisions.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2008, respectively.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position at these dates and is not representative of the year then ended, as all of these items varied.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates relates only to derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale investments, as debt and deposits are carried at amortised cost and so their carrying value does not change as interest rates move: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments: changes in the carrying value of derivatives from movements in interest rates designated as cash flow hedges are assumed to be recorded fully within equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the income statement: debt with a maturity below one year is floating rate for the accrued interest part of the calculation: the floating leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set.
Therefore, a change in interest rates affects a full twelve-month period for the accrued interest portion of the sensitivity calculations: and sensitivity to the Retail Prices Index does not take into account any changes to revenue or operating costs that are affected by the Retail Prices Index or inflation generally.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the income statement and items that are recognised directly in equity that would result from reasonably possible movements in changes in the UK Retail Prices Index and UK interest rates, after the effects of tax.
2009 2008 Income Income statement Equity statement Equity - m - m - m - m UK Retail Prices Index - 0.5% 4- 4 - UK interest rates - 0.5% 46 2 5 The income statement sensitivities impact interest expense and financial instrument remeasurements.
e Capital and risk management National Grid Gass objective when managing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to remain within regulatory constraints.
The principal measure of its balance sheet efficiency is gearing calculated as net debt expressed as a percentage of regulatory asset value.
The gearing ratio at 31 March 2009 for the NTS business was 59% compared with 54% at 31 March 2008.
We regularly review and maintain or adjust the capital structure as appropriate in order to manage the level of gearing.
Our licence and some of our bank loan agreements impose lower limits for the long-term credit ratings that the Company must hold.
These requirements are monitored on a regular basis in order to ensure compliance.
