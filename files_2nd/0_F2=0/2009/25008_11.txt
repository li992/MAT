COMPANY STATEMENT OF RECOGNISED INCOME AND EXPENSE Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2009 2008 m m Profit for the year 532 45 Total recognised income and expense for the year 532 45 67 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Basis of preparation a Basis of preparation Group and Company The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the EU, IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have also been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified to include the fair value of certain financial instruments in accordance with IFRS.
The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the parent company, ICAP plc, and presented in millions.
The Group maintains a columnar format for the presentation of its consolidated income statement.
This enables the Group to continue its practice of improving the understanding of its results by presenting profit for the year before amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items.
This is the profit measure used to calculate adjusted EPS and is considered to be the most appropriate as it better reflects the Groups underlying cash earnings.
Profit before amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items is reconciled to profit before tax on the face of the income statement.
Items which are of a non-recurring nature and material, when considering both size and nature, are disclosed separately to give a clearer presentation of the Groups results.
These are shown as exceptional items on the face of the income statement.
The Company has taken advantage of section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present its own income statement.
Group Intangible assets arising on consolidation represent goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets on business combinations since 1 April 2004.
The amortisation of separately identifiable intangible assets and any impairment of goodwill together with the unwind of related deferred tax liabilities are included in the income statement within the column amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation.
Prior-year adjustment Group Following a review of the accounting for recent acquisitions, the Group has determined that additional deferred tax liabilities should have been recognised in respect of temporary differences arising on certain intangible assets.
The consequence of recognising such deferred tax liabilities is to recognise goodwill of an equivalent amount.
Comparative amounts for the prior year have been restated.
The impact of the change on the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 March 2008 is to reduce the taxation expense and hence increase profit for the year by 12m: both basic and diluted EPS increased by 1.9p as a result.
The impact on the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2008 is to increase goodwill by 116m, increase investment in associates by 2m, increase deferred tax liabilities by 95m and increase retained earnings by 23m.
The impact on the opening balances as at 1 April 2007 is to increase net assets and retained earnings by 11m.
The changes have no impact on the Groups cash flow or on profit before tax before amortisation and impairments on intangible assets arising on consolidation and exceptional items.
Prior-year adjustment Company The net assets of the employee share trusts, which hold shares to satisfy employee share options, have been deconsolidated from the results of the Company to better reflect the relationship between the Company and the trusts.
Previously the company reported the shares and cash owned by the trust as if they belonged to the Company.
This has been amended to show the loan that exists between the entities, rather than the assets themselves.
The effect on the net assets of the company as at 31 March 2008 is to increase retained earnings by 27m and to increase other receivables by 27m and at 1 April 2007 to increase retained earnings by 15m.
There is no effect on the income statement of the Company.
There is no overall effect on the results or net assets of the Group, as the results of the trusts are fully consolidated in the Groups financial statements.
b Basis of consolidation Group The Groups consolidated financial statements include the results and net assets of the Company, its subsidiaries and the Groups share of joint ventures and associates.
An entity is regarded as a subsidiary if the Group has control over its strategic, operating and financial policies and intends to hold the investment on a long-term basis for the purpose of securing a contribution to the Groups activities.
The results of companies acquired during the year are included in the Groups results from the effective date of acquisition.
The results of companies disposed of during the year are included up to the effective date of disposal.
The Group adopts the parent company model of accounting for minority interests.
Purchases from minority interests result in goodwill being recognised, represented by the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share of the carrying value of net assets acquired.
Where the Group has written a put option over shares held by a minority, the Group derecognises the minority interest and instead recognises a contingent deferred consideration liability for the estimated amount likely to be paid to the minority on exercise of those options.
The residual amount, representing the difference between any consideration paid payable and the minoritys share of net assets, is recognised as goodwill.
Movements in the estimated liability after initial recognition are recognised as either goodwill or within the income statement, depending on whether the contract was written as part of a business combination.
68 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 Basis of preparation continued A joint venture is an entity in which the Group has an interest and, in the opinion of the directors, exercises joint control over its operating and financial policies.
An interest exists where an investment is held on a long-term basis for the purpose of securing a contribution to the Groups activities.
Joint ventures are proportionately consolidated, whereby the Groups income statement and balance sheet include the Groups share of the income and assets on a line-by-line basis.
An associate is an entity in which the Group has an interest and, in the opinion of the directors, can exercise significant influence, but not control, over its operating and financial policies.
Significant influence generally exists where the Group holds more than 20% and less than 50% of the shareholders voting rights.
Associates are accounted for under the equity method whereby the Groups income statement includes its share of their profits and losses and the Groups balance sheet includes its share of their net assets.
c Segmental analysis Primary segment geographic The Group regards its primary reporting segment as geographic as this is substantially the basis on which it manages its operations.
The three geographic business segments are the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific.
Secondary segment business The Groups secondary segmentation is by business type voice, electronic and information divisions.
The voice division represents trades concluded directly by the Groups staff for interest rates, credit, FX, commodities, equities and emerging market products.
The electronic division represents trades concluded via electronic trading platforms and post-trade services.
The information division represents the sale of market data and research services.
d Recent accounting developments IFRIC14 IAS19 The Limit on Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction was adopted by the Group during the year.
There has been no impact on the results or net assets of the Group or Company as a result of this adoption.
Amendments to IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures permit the reclassification of certain non-derivative financial assets out of fair value through the income statement category in periods beginning after July 2008.
These amendments will have no effect on the results and net assets of the Group or Company.
As at the date of approval of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations were in issue but not yet effective.
The Group has not applied these Standards and Interpretations in the preparation of these financial statements: IFRS8 Operating Segments applies to accounting periods beginning after 1 January 2009.
This standard replaces IAS14 Segment Reporting and will not affect the results of the Group but will require a change in the disclosure of segmental information.
The Group will adopt this standard from 1 April 2009.
Amendments to IFRS2 Share Based Payment clarify the vesting and service conditions of certain employee share option schemes and applies to periods beginning after 1 January 2009.
The Group will adopt this amendment from 1 April 2009, and cancellations of share options by employees will be treated in the same way as a cancellation by the Group after that date.
This amendment is not expected to have a material effect on the results and net assets of the Group or Company.
Amendments to IAS1 Presentation of Financial Statements apply to accounting periods beginning after 1 January 2009 and the Group will adopt these changes from the 1 April 2009.
These amendments will not have any effect on the results and net assets of the Group or Company, but may change the presentation of the results.
Amendments to IFRIC9 IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IFRS3 Business Combinations, and IAS27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
The impact on the Groups financial statements of the future adoption of the Standards is still under review.
It is expected that the adoption of IFRS3 revised will alter the manner in which future acquisitions are recognised.
For example all movements to contingent deferred consideration subsequent to initial recognition are required to be re-measured through the income statement, and costs incurred as part of the transaction are required to be expensed through the income statement.
Previously both these amounts have been recognised on the balance sheet.
IAS27 revised requires that all transactions with minorities are recognised in equity instead of movements in goodwill or within the income statement.
The Group expects that this will not have an effect on the current results and net assets of the Group, but that prospectively it will depend on the nature of transactions undertaken by the Group.
A number of other interpretations and amendments to existing standards have been made by the International Accounting Standards Board and IFRIC but are not considered relevant to the Groups or Companys operations.
69 2 Principal accounting policies Group a Revenue Revenue comprises commission from the Groups agency businesses, brokerage from matched principal transactions, execution on exchange transactions, and fees received from the sale of financial information to third parties.
Matched principal business Certain Group companies are involved as principal in the purchase and simultaneous commitment to sell securities between third parties.
Revenue is generated from the difference between the purchase and sale proceeds and is recognised in full at the time of the simultaneous commitment by the counterparties to sell and purchase the financial instrument.
Agency business name give-up transactions The Group acts in a non-advisory capacity to match buyers and sellers of financial instruments and raises invoices monthly for the service provided.
The Group does not act as principal and only receives and transmits orders between counterparties.
Revenue is stated net of rebates and discounts, value added tax and other sales taxes and is recognised in full on the date of the trade.
Amounts receivable at the year end are reported as other trade receivables within trade and other receivables note 18.
For the shipbroking business, the Group acts in a non-advisory capacity to match buyers and sellers of services and recognises revenue, net of rebates and discounts, value added tax and other sales taxes, when the Group has a contractual entitlement to commission, normally the point at which there is a completion of contractual terms between the principals of a transaction.
Execution on exchange business The Group also acts as a broker of exchange listed products, where the Group executes client orders as principal and then novates the trade to the underlying clients respective clearing broker for settlement.
Revenue is generated from either the difference between the purchase and sale proceeds or by invoice, depending on the product, market and agreements in place with the customer and is recognised on trade date.
Information and post-trade services The Group receives fees from the sale of financial information and provision of post-trade services to third parties.
These are stated net of value added tax and other sales taxes and is recognised in revenue on an accruals basis to match the provision of the service.
Amounts receivable at the year end are reported as other trade receivables within trade and other receivables note 18. b Government grants Revenue grants received are credited to the income statement on an accruals basis over the period the related expenditure is charged and are shown separately within other income.
c Intangible assets arising on consolidation Intangible assets arising on consolidation include all goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets identified at the time of acquisition of an entity.
Amortisation or impairment of these assets is disclosed on the face of the income statement.
i Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates and represents the cost of the acquisition in excess of the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets acquired.
Fair values are determined based on an assessment of the value of the individual assets and liabilities acquired, including reference to market prices, discounting expected future cash flows to present value or using replacement cost as appropriate.
Goodwill is initially recognised at cost and is subsequently held at cost less any provision for impairment.
Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested annually for impairment.
Goodwill acquired since 2004 is held in the currency of the underlying assets of the business and is revalued at the closing rate at each balance sheet date.
Goodwill acquired before 2004 is held in sterling and is not revalued.
Goodwill acquired prior to 1998 was immediately eliminated against reserves and was not reinstated on transition to IFRS.
Goodwill held on the balance sheet on transition to IFRS in 2004 has been recognised at its book value at the date of transition and is no longer amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and joint ventures is shown within non-current assets.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is included within their carrying value.
On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal, except for goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1998, which remains eliminated.
70 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2 Principal accounting policies continued ii Separately identifiable intangible assets The Group has recognised separately identified intangible assets on acquisitions where appropriate.
These generally include customer contracts and customer relationships.
Intangible assets acquired by the Group are initially stated at fair value and subsequently adjusted for amortisation and any impairment.
Impairment charges are recognised in the income statement.
Where an impairment has taken place, the asset is reviewed annually for any reversal of the impairment.
Any reversal of impairments are credited to the income statement.
Amortisation of separately identifiable intangible assets is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Customer relationships 210 years Customer contracts Period of contract Other intangible assets Period of contract A deferred tax liability is recognised against the asset where the amortisation is non-tax deductible.
The liability unwinds over the same period as the asset is amortised.
iii Impairment Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually.
The recoverable amount of a Cash Generating Unit CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cashflow projections which extend forward to a terminal value and which take account of the approved budget for the coming year.
The Group applies a suitable discount factor to the future cash flows based on its weighted average cost of capital.
Growth rates are conservatively applied and do not exceed the expected growth in the local economy after the fifth year.
Where the carrying value of the asset exceeds its value-in-use, an impairment charge is immediately recognised in the income statement, and the asset is impaired to its value-in-use.
For goodwill, impairment charges are not reversed and impaired intangible assets are reviewed annually for reversal of previous impairment.
d Intangible assets arising from development expenditure Development expenditure on software for electronic trading platforms is recognised as an intangible asset in accordance with the provisions of IAS38 Intangible Assets.
Amortisation of these assets is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life of the asset of three to five years.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets arising from development expenditure is charged within operating expenses in profit before amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items.
Amortisation is charged against assets from the date at which the asset becomes available for use.
e Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is initially recognised at fair value and is subsequently presented at fair value less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment in its value.
It is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected useful economic life as follows: Short leasehold property Period of lease Furniture, fixtures and equipment 35 years Motor vehicles 34 years The Group reviews its depreciation rates regularly to take account of any changes in circumstances.
These rates are determined on consideration of factors such as the expected rate of technological development and anticipated usage levels.
When a leasehold property becomes surplus to the Groups foreseeable business requirements, provision is made on a discounted basis for the expected future net cost of the property.
f Leased assets Assets financed by leasing arrangements which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group finance leases are capitalised in the balance sheet at fair value.
Lease repayments comprise both a capital element and a finance element.
The capital element of the leasing commitment is shown as an obligation to the lessor in the balance sheet and the finance element is charged to the income statement on a constant periodic rate of change basis.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
71 2 Principal accounting policies continued g Financial assets Financial assets are classified as available-for-sale, loans and receivables or financial assets at fair value through the income statement on initial recognition.
Available-for-sale: available-for-sale financial assets are debt and equity non-derivative financial assets and are initially recognised at fair value.
Any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
When an investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
For equity financial assets, where the fair value cannot be reliably measured, the assets are held at cost less any provision for impairment.
These assets are generally expected to be held for the long term and are included in non-current assets.
Assets such as shares or seats in exchanges, cash-related instruments, and long-term equity investments that do not qualify as associates or joint ventures are classified as available-for-sale.
Fair value through the income statement: fair value through the income statement assets are designated as such where they meet the conditions of IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
They are initially recognised at fair value and any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised directly in the income statement.
These assets are usually held for short-term gain, or are financial instruments not designated as hedges.
The accounting policy for fair value hedges is included in note 2 j.
These assets are included in trade and other receivables note 18.
Loans and receivables: loans and receivables are non-derivative financial instruments which have a fixed or easily determinable value.
They are recognised at cost, less any provisions for impairment in their value.
Financial assets not held at fair value are impaired where there is objective evidence that the value may be impaired.
The amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of any expected future cash flows, with any impairment being recognised in the income statement.
Subsequent recovery of amounts previously impaired are credited to the income statement.
h Matched principal business Certain Group companies are involved as principal in the purchase and simultaneous commitment to sell securities and other financial instruments, between third parties.
Such trades are complete only when both sides of the transaction are settled and therefore the Group is exposed to the risk in the event that one side of the transaction remains unsettled.
Substantially all the transactions settle within a short period of time on a delivery versus payment basis and, as such, the settlement risk is considered to be low.
All amounts due to and payable by counterparties in respect of matched principal business are shown gross as matched principal trade receivables and matched principal trade payables notes 18 and 19, except where a netting agreement, which is legally enforceable at all times exists and the asset and liability are either settled net or simultaneously.
i Matched stock lending business Certain Group companies are involved in collateralised stock lending transactions as an intermediary between counterparties.
Such trades are complete only when both the collateral and stock for each side of the transaction is returned.
The gross amounts of collateral due and receivable are disclosed in the balance sheet as deposits paid for securities borrowed and deposits received for securities loaned notes 18 and 19. j Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses various financial instruments as hedges to reduce exposure to FX movements.
These can include forward FX contracts, currency options and cross currency swaps.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised on the balance sheet at their fair value adjusted for transaction costs.
The fair values of financial instrument derivatives are determined by reference to quoted prices in an active market.
Where no such active market exists, the fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques from observable data, including discounted cash flow analysis and the BlackScholes option pricing model.
The method of recognising the movements in the fair value of the derivative depends on whether the instrument has been designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the exposure being hedged.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the terms of the hedge must be clearly documented at inception and there must be an expectation that the derivative will be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flow of the hedged risk.
Hedge effectiveness is tested throughout the life of the hedge and if at any point it is concluded that the relationship can no longer be expected to remain highly effective in achieving its objective, the hedge relationship is terminated.
Gains and losses on financial instrument derivatives which qualify for hedge accounting are recognised according to the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged.
Hedges are either classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
Fair value hedges: derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge the Groups exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
The hedging instrument and hedged item are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in fair value being taken through the income statement.
72 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2 Principal accounting policies continued Cash flow hedges: derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Groups exposure to changes in cash flows attributable to a particular asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Gains or losses on designated cash flow hedges are recognised directly in equity, to the extent that they are determined to be effective.
Any remaining portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
On recognition of the hedged asset or liability, any gains or losses relating to the hedging instrument that had previously been recognised directly in equity are included in the initial measurement of the fair value of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss in equity remains there and is recognised in the income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Net investment hedges: changes in the value of foreign denominated investments due to currency movements are recognised directly in equity.
The accounting treatment for a net investment hedge is generally consistent with the treatment for a cash flow hedge.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement on the ultimate disposal of the foreign denominated investment.
Where financial instrument derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the fair market value are recognised immediately in the income statement.
k Client money The Group holds money on behalf of clients in accordance with the client money rules of the FSA.
Since the Group is not beneficially entitled to these amounts, they are excluded from the Group balance sheet along with the corresponding liabilities to clients.
The amounts held on behalf of clients at the balance sheet date are included in note 33. l Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, overdrafts and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments which are subject to insignificant risk of change in fair value and are readily convertible into a known amount of cash with less than three months maturity.
m Long-term borrowings Long-term borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of transaction costs incurred.
At subsequent reporting dates long-term borrowings are held at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, with changes in value recognised through the income statement.
Transaction costs are recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
n Pension costs The Group operates defined contribution schemes.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as they fall due.
Any difference between the payments and the charge is recognised as a short-term asset or liability.
The Group also operates defined benefit pension schemes in the US and Germany that are closed to new entrants.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
The expected return on the schemes assets and the interest arising on the pension schemes liabilities is recognised in the income statement within finance income and finance costs.
The pension scheme deficit recognised in the balance sheet represents the difference between the fair value of the assets of the plan and the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of recognised income and expense, net of the deferred tax impact.
The expected return on the schemes assets reflects the estimate made by management of the long-term yields that will arise from the specific assets held within the pension scheme.
o Share-based payments The Group awards share options and other share-based payments as part of employee incentive schemes.
The Group has applied IFRS2 Share-based Payment for all such awards granted since 7 November 2002.
The fair value of services acquired is measured by the fair value of the shares or share options awarded at the time of granting and is charged to staff costs over the period the service is received on a straight-line basis.
A reserve of an equivalent amount is held on the balance sheet as part of the retained earnings.
The fair value of share options awarded is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and takes into account various parameters, including the exercise price, current share price, risk free rate of return and the volatility of ICAPs share price.
The expected lives used in the fair value calculations are adjusted for the estimated effect of non-transferability and exercise restrictions.
A cancellation of a share option by an employee is regarded as a failure to fulfil the performance conditions of the scheme, and all charges relating to that particular grant are credited back to the income statement.
73 2 Principal accounting policies continued p Tax Tax on the profit for the year comprises both current and deferred tax as well as adjustments in respect of prior years.
Tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also included within equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for reporting purposes and the amounts charged or credited for tax purposes.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rate of tax expected to apply when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group where there is both the legal right and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The Group is able to control the timing of dividends from its overseas entities and therefore does not expect to remit overseas earnings in the foreseeable future in a way which would result in a tax charge.
As a consequence deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in the future has been entered into by the subsidiary.
No provision is made in respect of any further tax liability that would arise on the distribution of retained earnings of overseas joint ventures and associates.
q Foreign currencies In individual entities, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of that entity at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences are recognised in the income statement, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where these form part of the net investment of an overseas business or are designated as hedges of a net investment or cash flow, when the changes in value are recognised directly in equity.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
On consolidation, the results of businesses with non-sterling functional currency are translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the average exchange rates for the period where these approximate to the rate at the date of the transactions.
Assets and liabilities of overseas businesses are translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are recognised within equity.
Cumulative translation differences arising after the transition to IFRS are taken to the income statement on disposal of the net investment.
In accordance with IAS29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies, the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures that report in the currency of a hyperinflationary economy are restated in terms of the measuring unit at the balance sheet date before they are translated into the presentational currency of the Group.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Where applicable the Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising before the date of transition to IFRS as denominated in the presentational currency of the Group.
In the cash flow statement, cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the average exchange rate for the year or at the rate prevailing at the time of the transaction where more appropriate.
r Treasury Shares and share ownership trusts Treasury Shares are recognised in equity and are measured at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale and original cost being taken to retained earnings.
Company shares held in connection with the Groups employee share schemes are held in trust and are deducted from consolidated shareholders equity.
Purchases, sales and transfers of the Companys shares are disclosed as changes in consolidated shareholders equity.
The assets and liabilities of the trusts are consolidated in full into the Groups consolidated financial statements.
s Provisions A provision is recognised where there is a present obligation, either legal or constructive, as a result of a past event for which it is probable there will be a transfer of economic benefits to settle the obligation.
Property provisions are recognised where office space is surplus to requirements at the cost of fulfilling the lease obligations less any expected rental income from sub-letting the property.
The provision is discounted when material.
74 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2 Principal accounting policies continued Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based on amounts which differ from those estimates.
Estimates, judgements and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The accounting policies deemed critical to the Groups results and financial position, based upon materiality and significant judgements and estimates, are discussed below.
i Goodwill and intangible assets The Group reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually at the balance sheet date or when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that impairment may have taken place, in line with the Groups accounting policy.
Intangible assets remaining useful lives are reviewed annually and are also reviewed for impairment when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that impairment may have taken place.
This calculation requires the exercise of significant judgement by management: if the estimates made prove to be incorrect or performance does not meet expectations which affect the amount and timing of future cash flows, goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods.
The assumptions and results of the impairment reviews are disclosed in note 14. ii Share-based payments The Group measures the cost of equity settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted.
Determining the value of a grant of equity instruments requires selecting an appropriate valuation model and estimating the required inputs to that model, including the expected life of the option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them.
The assumptions and model used are disclosed in note 26. iii Tax Significant judgement is required in determining the Groups income tax liabilities.
In arriving at the current and deferred tax liability the Group has taken account of tax issues that are subject to ongoing discussions with the relevant tax authorities.
Calculations of these liabilities have been based on managements assessment of legal and professional advice, case law and other relevant guidance.
Where the expected tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax amounts in the period in which such determination is made.
Company In addition to the above accounting policies, the following relate specifically to the Company.
Investment in subsidiaries An entity is regarded as a subsidiary if the Company has control over its strategic, operating and financial policies and intends to hold the investment on a long-term basis for the purpose of securing a contribution to the Groups activities.
The Company recognises investments in subsidiaries initially at fair value, and subsequent changes in value as a result of impairment are recognised in the income statement.
Dividends The Company recognises the final dividend payable only when it has been approved by the shareholders of the Company in a general meeting.
The interim dividend is recognised when the amount due has been paid.
Dividends receivable are recognised when they are received.
Functional and presentational currency The Company considers its functional currency to be sterling as that is the currency of the economic environment in which it operates.
Accordingly the results of the Company and the Group are also presented in sterling.

Descriptions below relate to prior year items.
The EBS related exceptional item relates to the final reorganisation and rationalisation costs following the acquisition of EBS in June 2006.
A sub-custodian made a post-trade settlement adjustment debiting a Group companys account for a total of 23m without notice or the Groups consent.
As a result of the need to resort to litigation to recover the debt, the Group provided in full against this debt 13m after offsetting cost recoveries.
During the year ended 31 March 2007, the Group closed a number of its futures operations.
The gain that arises in the prior year is as a result of the disposal of shares and memberships included within available-for-sale assets whose disposal was restricted in the earlier years.
This is offset by rationalisation and other costs related to the closure of these businesses.
Other exceptional gains arise from the disposal of exchange shares and seats together with litigation settlements in Australia and Hong Kong.

This has not been recognised as a liability of the Group at the year end as it has not yet been approved by shareholders.
Based on the number of shares in issue at the year end, the total amount payable would be 78m.
The right to receive dividends has been waived in respect of the Treasury Shares and shares held in employee share trusts.
12 Earnings per share The Group is required to disclose basic and diluted EPS on the face of the income statement.
The Group continues to calculate adjusted EPS, disclosed below, as it believes that it is the most appropriate measurement since it better reflects the businesss underlying cash earnings.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to the equity holders of the parent of 175m 2008 restated 168m by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 634m shares 2008 635m.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue excludes the weighted average number of shares held as Treasury Shares of 1m 2008 2m and those owned by employee share trusts relating to employee share schemes on which dividends have been waived, being 14m shares 2008 12m.
Diluted EPS takes into account the dilutive effect of share options outstanding under the Companys employee share schemes.

13 Acquisitions a Subsidiaries current year Link On 7 April 2008, the Group completed the acquisition of Link, a global equity derivatives broker for an initial consideration of 135m.
Consideration of 21m has also been paid for their surplus net assets.
Contingent deferred consideration based on the profit after tax for the year ending 31 March 2010 of Link plus certain complementary existing businesses of the Group will be paid in April 2009 and June 2010: currently this is estimated to be 26m, with a net present value at acquisition of 23m of which 14m was paid in April 2009.
Total consideration is capped at 250m, excluding the amount paid for the surplus net assets.
The fair value of the assets acquired is given below.
The fair value adjustments include the recognition of intangible assets arising on consolidation of 110m, the majority of which is in respect of customer relationships that are being amortised over ten years, a related deferred tax provision of 31m, and other provisions of 17m.
The Group considers that the fair value of 91m for the goodwill is reasonable and relates to the value of the future growth potential of the business, its liquidity, and the assembled workforce.
These assets are not separately identifiable.
In the period from acquisition to 31 March 2009, the Link business was integrated with certain complementary Group businesses.
The combined Link businesses contributed 100m to revenue and 13m to profit before tax before amortisation of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items, but after restructuring costs and the impact of the unwinding of discount on the contingent deferred consideration.
It is impracticable to separately disclose the amounts relating solely to the business acquired, as the businesses have been successfully integrated.
If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, the results would not be materially different.
84 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 13 Acquisitions continued a Subsidiaries current year continued ICAP Equities and others On 1 April 2008, the Group acquired 78% of ICAP Equities Limited ICAP Equities for a 1m initial consideration.
The remaining 22% of the share capital consists of two classes of share capital B shares represent 21% and include put call option arrangements and C shares represent the remaining 1% which provide the holders with a right to offer the shares for sale to the Group.
ICAP Equities is a newly incorporated UK company involved in the voice broking of pan-European cash equities.
Subsequent to the year end ICAP Equities will own 91.5% of ICAP Equities Asia Limited ICAP Equities Asia, a Hong Kong company involved in a similar business for Asia Pacific cash equities.
Of the remaining shares in ICAP Equities Asia, 7.5% will be B shares and 1% C shares.
Both classes have similar rights to the equivalent shares in ICAP Equities.
A put call option arrangement exists for the Group to acquire the minority interest in the B shares of both companies, the consideration for which is based on business performance.
The options allow the minority to put up to one third of their equity annually from 2012 to the Group and for the Group to call the equity after 2012.
The cost of the acquisition of ICAP Equities is capped at 220m and ICAP Equities Asia will be capped at 4.99% of the Groups market capitalisation at the time of entering the agreement.
In addition the C shareholders of both companies have the right to offer the shares for sale to the Group annually from 2012.
The expected acquisition of the minority interest in the B shares of both companies is treated as contingent deferred consideration and the Group has recognised a liability of 20m with a net present value at acquisition of 12m.
A fair value adjustment to recognise intangible assets arising from development expenditure of 1m has been recognised on the acquisition of ICAP Equities, and 12m of goodwill has been recognised on the acquisition of both companies.
The Group considers this to be a reasonable value and relates to the assembled workforce and future growth potential of the business.
In the period from acquisition to 31 March 2009, ICAP Equities and ICAP Equities Asia contributed 15m to revenue and a loss before tax before amortisation of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items, but after the impact of the unwind of discount on contingent deferred consideration of 3m.
In December 2008, the Group acquired the remaining 50% stake in Skaarup Shipbrokers Inc Skaarup that it did not previously own by acquiring Bulk Ocean Chartering Inc, a shipbroking company based in the US, for 2m, and the remaining 50% it did not previously own of ICAP Shipping Hong Kong Limited formerly ICAP Hyde China Limited, a shipbroking company based in China, for 0.2m.
There were no fair value adjustments on these investments and goodwill of 2m has been recognised on the acquisition of Skaarup.
Negative goodwill of 0.1m arising on the acquisition of ICAP Shipping Hong Kong Limited has been recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group now owns 75% of these companies through its investment in ICAP Shipping International Limited.
In the period since acquisition, these companies contributed 0.8m in revenue and 0.3m in profit before tax before amortisation of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items.
If the acquisition had been completed on 1 April 2008, it is estimated the contribution would have been 2.2m to revenue and 0.8m in profit before tax before amortisation of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items.
In August 2008, the Group acquired Escorfin SA Escorfin, a Mexican broker of mutual funds, for 3m $4m.
There were no fair value adjustments required on this acquisition and goodwill of 3m has been recognised on the transaction.
In the period since acquisition Escorfin has contributed 0.5m to revenue and 0.3m to profit before tax before amortisation of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items.
If the acquisition had been completed on 1 April 2008, it is estimated Escorfin would have contributed 0.6m to revenue and 0.3m to profit before tax before amortisation of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items In July 2008, the Group acquired Moving Pictures Film and Television LLC Moving Pictures, a US company involved in broking media content, for an initial payment of 0.3m $0.4m with contingent deferred consideration of up to 1m $2m payable within three years.
The Group has the option to resell the company back to the original owners after three years at an amount equal to that originally paid.
No fair value adjustments were required on the transaction and goodwill of 1m $2m has been recognised on the acquisition.
In the period since acquisition Moving Pictures has contributed 0.4m to revenue and a loss before tax before amortisation of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items of 0.1m.
If the acquisition had been completed on 1 April 2008, it is estimated Moving Pictures would have contributed 0.4m to revenue and a loss before tax before amortisation of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items of 0.1m.

In March 2009, the remaining minority shareholder exercised their option to require ICAP to acquire the remaining 15% of Reset.
The cost of the acquisition is expected to be $43m 30m plus costs.
As at 31 March 2009, the Group has recognised 100% of Reset in its balance sheet, with a corresponding liability of $43m 30m in other payables note 19.
Additional goodwill of $40m 27m has been recognised on this acquisition.
Other The provisional fair values of all other acquisitions in the year ended 31 March 2008 are considered to be final with no further adjustments, except for the prior year adjustment to deferred tax liabilities.
The Group has derecognised the minority holdings in ICAP Shipping International Limited and ICAP New Zealand Limited during the year and, in line with the single credit method, now recognises contingent deferred consideration of 4m instead, with a corresponding increase in goodwill.
c Associates and joint ventures The Group acquired a 20% stake in Blockcross Holdings LLC Blockcross, a company incorporated in the US involved in the development of software for trading platforms, for a consideration of 3m.
As the Group has significant influence on the operating and financial policies of Blockcross, this investment is recognised as an associate of the Group.

e Acquisitions announced but not completed On 7 November 2008, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the issued share capital of Arkhe Distribuidora fide Titulos E Valores Mobiliarios SA Arkhe, a broker in Brazil, for an initial consideration of $10m 7m, plus contingent deferred consideration payable three years after closing dependent on future business performance.
This agreement is subject to the regulatory approval of the Banco Central do Brasil.
As this approval has not been received at the balance sheet date, the Group has not recognised the acquisition in the current years results.
The Group expects to receive approval and recognise the acquisition in the year ending 31 March 2010.

It is anticipated that intangible assets arising on the acquisition of voice broking businesses have a finite life.
The Group reviews the performance of the businesses and reassesses the likely period over which the acquired intangible asset is likely to continue to add value to the business each year.
As a result some businesses will have no impairment in a particular year while others will.
The Group has booked an impairment in the year of 7m relating to First Brokers 2008 8m.
88 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 14 Intangible fixed assets continued a Intangible assets arising on consolidation continued Impairment testing of intangible assets arising on consolidation Goodwill and other intangible assets arising on consolidation are allocated to a cash generating unit CGU at acquisition.
A CGU is the smallest segment on which it is practicable to report, each of which represents one of the Groups businesses.
The carrying amounts are presented below: As at 31 March 2009 Customer Net Year of Goodwill relationships book value Analysis of intangible assets Business division acquisition m m m Excos acquisition of Intercapital Voice 1998 23 23 ICAP Energy Voice 2002 18 18 First Brokers Voice 2002 16 16 Acquired Asian Businesses Voice 2002 12 12 ICAP Electronic Broking Electronic 2003 146 146 United Fuels Voice 2005 15 1 16 EBS Electronic 2006 353 210 563 Reset Electronic 2006 147 3 150 Traiana Electronic 2007 106 82 188 ICAP Shipping Voice 2007 08 39 5 44 Link Voice 2009 91 99 190 ICAP Equities UK and Hong Kong Voice 2009 12 12 Others Voice Various 26 26 1,004 400 1,404 Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections which extend forward to a terminal value and which take account of the approved budget for the year ending 31 March 2010 together with assumptions surrounding the expected life of the asset, managements view of the trading cycles and growth profile facing each CGU and any adjustments required to the discount factor to take account of country or business risk.
The value-in-use calculations are sensitive to changes in these assumptions and in particular long-term growth rates.
With the exception of Traiana, ICAP Shipping and First Brokers, the base model assumes that the budgeted cash flows for 2010 grew at 2% per annum to a terminal value in year ten and when discounted showed significant headroom.
The base case was then stress tested using a zero growth assumption and continued to show no impairment.
Management view these assumptions as conservative and do not believe that any reasonable change in the assumptions would cause the carrying value of these CGUs to exceed the recoverable amount.
Traiana, ICAP Shipping and First Brokers each exhibit different trading characteristics from ICAPs other businesses during the forecast period.
First Brokers cash flows have been modelled on the basis of flat performance for a remaining life of six years.
As a result of this analysis the investment in First Brokers was impaired by 7m in 2009 2008 - 8m.
The performance of ICAPs shipping business is influenced by a combination of global trading volumes and imbalances in the world fleet.
The industry has historically exhibited trading peaks and troughs every three to four years and, in modelling the future cash flows, management has assumed that revenues peak in 2012 13 and 2017 18 at levels up 50% and 80% respectively on 2007 08 performance when proforma cash flows were 10m and that the terminal cash flow represents the average achieved over the previous cycle.
While these assumptions are viewed as conservative, it remains unclear when the next cycle will commence.
Management has therefore stress tested its assumptions further by assuming flat trading performance through 2011 and 2012.
Under this scenario the carrying value of the CGU equates to the recoverable amount.
The relatively early stage of development of Traiana makes modelling cash flows difficult and, as such, in determining the value-in-use for this business management commissioned an external review of the business model to determine the likely profile for the next five years and then assumed flat performance thereafter.
In stress testing management noted that the discount factor applied to the cash flows could rise to 29%, or the cash flows fall to 25% of forecast using a 10% discount factor, before any impairment was required.
The Group applied a discount factor of 10% 2008 8% which was weighted to take account of country risk, where investments have been made outside the UK and North America, and or business risk which, in the case of Traiana, was doubled to 20% to take account of the risks associated with modelling a business in its early stage of development.
No assets were impaired, except as noted above.
89 14 Intangible fixed assets continued b Intangible assets arising from development expenditure Intangible assets arising from development expenditure consist of the software development costs of electronic trading platforms and other assets and are generally amortised over three to five years.
The Group reviews the useful economic lives of these assets on a regular basis.
The amortisation and impairment of assets arising on development expenditure is included within profit before amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items in the income statement.

The Group expects this asset to be substantially liquidated in the coming year.
As at 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2008, the fair value of trade and other receivables is not materially different from their book values.
Matched principal transactions are those where the Group acts as principal in the simultaneous commitment to sell securities between third parties.
Such trades have no contractual settlement date and are complete only when both sides of the transaction are settled, and therefore an aged analysis of matched principal trade receivables is not appropriate.
Substantially all matched principal receivables settle within a short period of time, usually within three days of trade date.
Deposits paid for securities borrowed represents the cash paid as collateral in a stock lending transaction.
The Group acts as an intermediary between counterparties for collateralised stock lending transactions.
Such trades are complete only when both the collateral and stock for each side of the transaction are returned.
The gross amounts of collateral paid and received are disclosed on the balance sheet notes 19 and 23.
In March 2009, the Company simplified its intra-Group lending and borrowing by netting amounts owed to or from subsidiaries.
The amount due to the Company of 37m represents the loan to the employee share trusts for the purpose of acquiring the Companys shares to settle commitments under the Groups share schemes.
Other trade receivables represent amounts receivable in respect of agency business and information services.

The issue consisted of $32m floating rate notes and a further $193m of notes with a fixed coupon of 5.84% for the first five years and LIBOR plus 1.95% thereafter.
In June 2007 the Group redeemed the floating rate notes at par.
The fair value of the loan notes is 94m.
The fair value of the amortising term loan is not materially different from its book value.
In April 2008 the Group entered into a 364-day, 150m term loan with The Royal Bank of Scotland to finance the acquisition of Link note 13.
The Group has subsequently restructured the loan into an amortising term loan.
The new facility, which is for 135m, commenced on 17 November 2008 and runs until 31 January 2011, with repayments of 10m after 12, 18 and 24 months.
The loan is priced at LIBOR plus 3.0%, with a step-up to LIBOR plus 3.5% after 12 months.
The weighted average effective interest rate for the year was 6.0%.
In the event that any one of the Companys senior credit ratings fall below BBBBaa3 the margin increases by 2% to LIBOR plus 5% and 5.5% after 12 months.
In June 2008, as part of its long-term objective to diversify its sources of debt capital, the Group obtained investment grade ratings from Fitch Ratings Limited Fitch and Moodys Investor Services Inc Moodys and put in place a 1 billion Global Medium Term Note programme.
At 31 March 2009 the programme remained unutilised.
As at 31 March 2009, the Company was rated BBB by Fitch and Baa2 by Moodys.
On 30 April 2009, the rating from Fitch was reaffirmed.

The short-term revolving credit facility as at 31 March 2009 of 277m 2008 327m is net of capitalised fees of 2m 2008 1m.
To take advantage of lower short-term interest rates, the amounts drawn as at 31 March 2009 were for a one-week period and have been included within short-term borrowings.
The facility carries a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.45% with an additional 0.10% payable dependent on the debt to earnings ratio.
The weighted average effective interest rate for the year was 3.5% 2008 6.1%.
In May 2008, the Group entered into a 75m 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility with Lloyds TSB Bank plc which was subsequently extended on 19 December 2008.
The facility, which is committed, is available for general corporate purposes, including the financing of acquisitions, and carries a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.25%.
The facility remained undrawn throughout the period and will expire on 30 June 2010.
During March 2009, the Group put in place a 500m European Commercial Paper programme to provide access to short-term liquidity to provide an alternative mechanism to finance the Groups working capital and margin requirements.
At 31 March 2009 the programme was undrawn.
Bank overdrafts are for short-term funding and are repayable on demand, and are generally repaid within a very short time period.
The Groups bank facilities contain a number of customary financial and operational covenants.
The Group remained in compliance with the terms of these covenants throughout the year ended 31 March 2009.
The fair value of the short-term borrowings is not materially different from their book values.

Under the terms of the Groups bank financings, the Company is required to remain as the ultimate holding company in the Group.
A change in ownership of the Company could result in the Groups three-year unsecured revolving credit facility, amortising term loan and 75m unsecured revolving credit facility becoming repayable.
In March 2009, the Companys obligations in respect of the Groups bank facilities were novated to its wholly-owned subsidiary company, ICAP Group Holdings Limited.

23 Financial risk management Group The Group operates internationally and is exposed to a variety of financial risks including liquidity, interest rate, currency, credit and market price risk.
The Groups funding and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk are managed by the Groups treasury function in accordance with a policy framework approved by the finance committee.
The framework lays out the Groups appetite for risk and the steps to be taken to manage these risks.
The finance committee receives bi-monthly reports on the activities of the treasury function and is also responsible for approving significant transactions such as new financing arrangements or changes to the Groups hedging strategy.
The group risk committee sets and monitors treasurys counterparty limits.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance by using derivative instruments to lower funding costs, alter interest rate exposures arising as a result of mismatches between assets and liabilities or to achieve greater certainty of future costs.
The use of derivatives forms part of the Groups overall risk management framework as determined by the board through the group risk and group finance committees.

100 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 23 Financial risk management continued b Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties in respect of its agency, matched principal, exchange trades and corporate treasury operations.
The risk in respect of the agency business is limited to the collection of agency commission and is controlled by the establishment and monitoring of credit limits for individual clients.
The exposure to credit loss is limited to the carrying value of the receivable.
Concentration is limited since the customer base is both large and unrelated.
No significant concentrations of risk existed at any time during the year.
The matched principal business involves the Group acting as a counterparty on trades which may involve one or more financial instruments and or counterparties.
The Group manages its credit risk in respect of these transactions by having policies and procedures in place to ensure that the risks inherent in all trades are matched and that appropriate credit limits have been set and are monitored at entity, parent and country level to restrict the exposure to potential loss, transacting on a delivery versus payment basis and settling the majority of trades through a central counterparty.
The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments is limited by the Groups policy of requiring its corporate treasury transactions to be undertaken with financial institutions which have been approved by the group risk committee and which are investment grade rated or better by one or more recognised credit rating agencies.
There were no significant concentrations of risk at the year end.
Trade receivables matched principal trade receivables, deposits paid for securities borrowed and other trade receivables consist of a large number of customers.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty.
The Groups counterparty risk does not exceed 15% of Group capital at any time.
At least 90% of the Groups counterparty risk is with institutions which have an external credit rating of investment grade or better BBB-.
The remaining counterparties are closely monitored and have strict trading limits.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for the Group is represented by the total fair value of the financial assets plus other off-balance sheet items as disclosed below: As at As at 31 March 31 March 2009 2008 m m Financial assets of the Group 32,143 38,397 Guarantees given to counterparties 122 73 32,265 38,470 The Group holds cash deposits from a number of counterparties to guarantee their trading lines with the Group.
The Groups cash balance includes 60m which is collateral placed with exchanges and other bodies to facilitate the Groups trading activities.
Collateral pledged and received as a result of the stock lending business is disclosed in trade and other receivables and trade and other payables notes 18 and 19. c Liquidity risk management Through the finance committee, the board regularly reviews the liquidity demands of the Group and each of its principal subsidiaries with the objective of ensuring that each has access to appropriate forms of liquidity to meet their forecast regulatory, commercial and settlement requirements and that the Group in totality has sufficient headroom to provide constant access, even in periods of market turmoil, to an appropriate level of cash, other forms of marketable securities and committed funding lines to enable it to finance its ongoing operations, proposed acquisitions and other reasonable unanticipated events on cost-effective and attractive terms.
At 31 March 2009, the Group had gross debt of 559m 2008 443m and cash and cash equivalents of 433m 2008 384m.
Approximately 360m of the Groups cash balance is employed by the Groups trading subsidiaries to meet local regulatory, commercial, settlement and short-term working capital requirements, up 100m on 2008 as a result of acquiring the Link business in the UK, North America and Asia, and the impact of weaker sterling on the translation of the balances.
The Group invests its cash balances in a range of instruments including money market deposits, AAA liquidity funds and government bonds with the objective of optimising the return, while having regard to security, liquidity and counterparty risk.
With the exception of small, local cash management balances, surplus cash is invested with strong investment grade institutions which have an equivalent credit rating of A or better.
Counterparty limits applied are reviewed by the finance and group risk committees and, during the recent financial market turmoil, a number of changes have been made to reduce exposure to institutions perceived by the Group as higher risk.
101 23 Financial risk management continued c Liquidity risk management continued Although the Group does not undertake proprietary trading, it is subject to the margin requirements of the clearing houses or exchanges used to settle certain client trades.
The most significant margin requirements arise in North America where, as part of its brokerage business, it provides clearing services to clients and is required to deposit margin with the FICC and NSCC.
During the last three quarters of 2008, these deposits averaged $54m peaking at $156m in September when Lehman Brothers failed but, as a result of managements actions to increase the number of trades capable of being netted together with changes to the margin formulae introduced by the FICC in November 2008, have fallen to $38m in the first quarter of 2009.
The deposits are met through a combination of internal cash resources and the $94m swingline facility note 21.
The Group has no other material margin requirements on a routine basis.
To provide protection against unexpected events, the Group has traditionally maintained minimum core liquidity, in the form of cash and undrawn debt facilities, of 75m and, while the Group has never accessed this liquidity pool, the combination of more volatile markets, increased uncertainty surrounding the impact of volatility on clearers margin requirements and tightening liquidity supply, prompted the Group to increase headroom to 150m in May 2008 through the addition of a 75m revolving credit facility note 21.
The headroom remained undrawn throughout the year.
At 31 March 2009, the Group had committed headroom under its core credit facilities of 336m 2008 192m.
The Group is currently financed from a mix of bank facilities and subordinated loan notes.
Over time, the Group plans to diversify its sources of finance into the public and private debt markets.
The table below shows the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities based on the contractual amount payable on the date of repayment: Maturity of financial liabilities as at 31 March 2009 Less than Three months One to Greater than three months to one year five years five years Total m m m m m Matched principal trade payables 30,446 30,446 Deposits received for securities loaned 865 865 Other trade payables 7 7 Derivative financial instruments 15 29 4 48 Amounts owed to associates 2 2 Other payables 81 3 32 8 124 Accruals 328 27 355 Borrowings and overdrafts 290 270 560 Provisions 3 7 2 12 32,037 39 335 8 32,419 Maturity of financial liabilities as at 31 March 2008 Less than Three months One to Greater than three months to one year five years five years Total m m m m m Matched principal trade payables 36,906 36,906 Deposits received for securities loaned 771 771 Other trade payables 8 8 Derivative financial instruments 3 15 3 21 Amounts owed by associates 3 3 Other payables 73 73 Accruals 268 18 286 Borrowings and overdrafts 347 97 444 Provisions 1 3 1 5 38,307 91 22 97 38,517 The total financial liabilities payable is higher than the amount recognised in trade and other payables as the gross amounts payable have been disclosed, rather than the net present value used in determining trade and other payables.
102 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 23 Financial risk management continued d Currency risk The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and conducts business in a number of other currencies principally the dollar and euro.
Consequently the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the Groups transactional revenues and the translation of the earnings and net assets of its non-sterling operations.
i Transactional exposures The Groups policy is for subsidiaries with sterling functional currency to hedge their two main transactional exposures, which are the dollar and the euro, through a combination of forward FX contracts and options for up to two years forward.
A maximum of 100% of the forecast exposure is hedged for the first 12 months, 75% for the following six months and 25% thereafter.
The Groups other transactional exposures are continually monitored and, where deemed appropriate, hedged for a period of 12 months forward.
The Group aims to achieve hedge accounting wherever possible with any gain or loss on the hedge recognised in equity to the extent it is highly effective and recycled to the income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the income statement.
Any ineffectiveness is taken to the income statement in accordance with IAS39.
Where hedge accounting is not achieved all fair value gains or losses are immediately recognised in the income statement.
The Group has contracts in place, designated as cash flow hedges under IAS39 where appropriate, covering approximately 85% of its forecast dollar transactional exposure for the year to 31 March 2010 at $1.64 and 25% of its forecast exposure for the year ended 31 March 2011 at $1.51.
Approximately 95% of the Groups euro exposure has been hedged for the year to 31 March 2010 at 1.27 and 34% of its exposure to 31 March 2011 at 1.16.
An analysis of the Groups hedging instruments is given below.
ii Balance sheet translational exposures The Group is exposed to balance sheet translational exposures at the local entity level where the local balance sheet may contain monetary assets or liabilities denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency.
It is the Groups policy to hedge up to 100% of these exposures in individual entities using a mix of foreign currency swaps and forward FX contracts and these are designated as fair value hedges under IAS39 where appropriate.
Balance sheet translational exposures also arise on consolidation on the retranslation of the balance sheet of non-sterling operations into sterling, the Groups presentational currency.
The only significant exposure is to the dollar.
These exposures are viewed as short term in nature and hedging could expose the Group to significant net cash flows and therefore the Groups policy is not to actively hedge these exposures.
However, in order to mitigate this exposure the Group has designated the subordinated loan notes as a hedging instrument against the underlying exposure.
Any gains or losses on revaluation are recognised directly in equity to offset the revaluation of the net investment.
As at 31 March 2009 this exposure was $0.8bn 2008 $1.3bn including intangible assets arising on consolidation, but before $0.2bn of hedging 2008 $0.3bn.
During the year ended 31 March 2009, with respect to sterling, the dollar appreciated by 28% and the euro appreciated by 14%.
In accordance with IAS21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, the resulting translational exchange difference is included within the 221m exchange gain taken directly to reserves, as disclosed in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
iii Earnings translation exposures The Group does not hedge the translation of those profits or losses earned by its non-sterling operations.
The table below shows the anticipated impact on the Groups 2010 results of a 10 cent movement in the dollar and euro in terms of transactional and translational exposure before any 2009 10 hedging activity.

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices on the balance sheet date.
e Interest rate risk The Group has an exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on both its cash positions and borrowings which it manages through a combination of sterling and dollar debt drawn on fixed and floating rate terms.
The Groups objective is to minimise interest cost and the impact of interest volatility on the Groups income statement.
In addition to debt, the Groups treasury policies also permit the use of derivatives including interest rate swaps, interest rate options, forward rate agreements and cross currency swaps to meet these objectives.
At 31 March 2009, the Group had 115m of cash and 425m of floating rate debt denominated in sterling, 235m of cash and 135m of fixed rate debt denominated in dollars or currencies closely related to the dollar and 83m of cash denominated in other currencies.
A 100 basis-point parallel movement in sterling LIBOR and LIBID rates would impact profit after tax and equity by 3m with a similar movement in dollar rates impacting profit after tax and equity by 2m.
In the event that LIBOR and LIBID rates diverge, each 100 basis-point movement in sterling and dollar rates will impact profit after tax and equity by 2m and 2m respectively.

Floating rate financial assets bear interest based on relevant national LIBID or equivalents with maturity of less than one year.

The Group is also exposed to market price risk in respect of its available-for-sale investments.
In matched principal transactions, the Group acts as an intermediary by serving as counterparty for identified buyers and sellers in matching, in whole or in part, reciprocal back-to-back trades.
In order to facilitate customer transactions and provide liquidity, however, the Group may participate in certain marketplaces by posting quotations.
On occasion, the act of posting quotations in pursuit of customer orders can result in the Group becoming principal to unmatched trades.
In exchange traded transactions, the Group executes the trade as principal and then novates the contract to its client.
A failure by the client to accept the trade would result in the Group becoming exposed to market price risk.
The risk the Group faces in these situations is restricted to short-term price movements in the underlying instrument temporarily held by the Group and movements in FX rates.
Any such market price risk arising is identified, monitored and reported to senior management on a daily basis and to the group risk committee.
Policies and procedures are in place to reduce the likelihood of such trade mismatches and, in the event that they arise, the Groups policy is to liquidate or hedge and liquidate these principal positions as soon as reasonably practicable.
The Group has limited exposure to market price risk on its available-for-sale financial assets as the majority of the Groups equity investments are not listed.
The Group estimates that its sensitivity to movements in market price is immaterial.
105 23 Financial risk management continued Company The Companys approach to risk is governed by the overall Group policies on risk and the limited activities of the Company limit its exposure to risk.
a Financial assets and liabilities All of the Companys financial assets are classified as loans and receivables and the financial liabilities as held at amortised cost.
The fair value of these assets and liabilities is not materially different from their book values.
b Credit risk The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties.
This risk is considered minimal as all counterparties are Group companies and the risk of non-payment is viewed as low.
c Liquidity risk management The Company seeks to ensure that it has constant access to an appropriate level of cash and funding to enable it to fund its ongoing operations, proposed acquisitions and other reasonable unanticipated events on cost effective and attractive terms.
If the Company has any cash, it is loaned intra-group for further investment.
All of the Companys financial liabilities are payable within one month, with the exception of subordinated loans of 140m, which have a maturity of more than five years.
All of the Company s counterparties are Group companies.
d Currency risk i Transactional exposures The Company has an immaterial exposure to transactional exposure.
ii Balance sheet translational exposures The Company is exposed to balance sheet translational exposures where the balance sheet contains assets or liabilities denominated in a currency other than sterling.
While it is the Groups policy to hedge up to 100% of these exposures at Group level, at Company level these exposures can affect the Companys profit after tax.
The Company has net financial liabilities of 14m 2008 41m denominated in dollars.
The Company estimates that a 10 cent movement in the dollar exchange rate would result in a translational impact of 0.5m on the profit after tax of the Company.
e Interest rate risk The Company is no longer exposed to interest rate movements as a result of the cash and debt formerly held by the Company being simplified or novated to a subsidiary company.
It is estimated that the impact of a 100 basis-point movement in interest rates would have no effect on the profit after tax of the Company.
As at 31 March 2009 the Companys financial assets are all non-interest bearing 2008 restated note 1 a 317m non-interest bearing and 5m at fixed interest rates.

106 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 24 Capital management The Group acts as an interdealer broker in international markets and is supervised by the FSA under the terms of the EU CRD.
In March 2007, the Group obtained a waiver from the consolidated capital adequacy tests which otherwise would have had the effect of removing intangible assets arising on consolidation from the computation of capital resources.
The waiver runs for five years to the end of March 2012.
The Group does not operate any proprietary trading activities and, as such, its capital demands when compared to other financial institutions are both relatively low and stable.
The Groups Pillar 1 regulatory capital surplus calculated in accordance with the waiver is relatively stable and is currently in excess of 700m.
While higher levels of market volatility have resulted in increased demand for the Groups brokerage and post-trade services, the fact that much of this incremental business has occurred in markets which operate on a name give-up basis or are cleared through a central counterparty has had limited impact on the Groups capital resource requirement and, as such, absent a material acquisition or change in the basis of computation, existing capital resources are viewed as sufficient to both operate and grow the business.
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group meet their local regulatory requirements, while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt which includes borrowings note 21, cash and cash equivalents note 32 b and equity note 27.
The Groups finance committee reviews the capital structure on a regular basis.
As part of this review, the committee considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
Based on the recommendations of the committee, the Group balances its overall capital structure through the payment of dividends, new share issues and share buy backs, as well as taking on new debt or refinancing existing debt.
A number of the Groups trading companies are subject to regulation in the jurisdiction in which they operate, principally by the FSA in the UK and the SEC FINRA in the US.
All such companies have complied with their regulatory capital requirements throughout the year.

A charge to the income statement based on the fair value of each option is made each year.
The fair value of each option is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The following assumptions have been applied when calculating the fair value of the options granted in the year: Weighted Weighted Probability average Expected average Average of achieving market share dividend risk free Expected performance Vesting price volatility yield rate life conditions period pence % % % years % years 2008 SAYE 611.0 34 2.5 5.0 3.1 100 3 SEEPP UK 605.1 33 2.3 5.0 4.2 100 4 BSMP 605.1 4.0 90 3 UCSOP 611.0 332.65.03.25.2 10035 LTIP 605.1 3.0 100 3 Estimated share volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Companys shares are expected to fluctuate during the life of an option.
The expected volatility is estimated based on the historic volatility of the share price over the past three years to the date of grant of the option.

The Group expects to contribute 0.5m to its defined benefit pension scheme in the year ending 31 March 2010.
Details of the scheme are provided below.
The actuarial assessment was based on the following principal assumptions: 2009 2008 % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries nil nil Rate of increase in pensions in payment nil nil Discount rate 5.8 5.8 Inflation assumption 3.0 4.0 The average life expectancy in years of an individual retiring at the age of 65 at the balance sheet date is as follows: As at As at 31 March 31 March 2009 2008 Years Years Male 19.8 17.9 Female 19.8 21.3 The average life expectancy in years of an individual retiring 20 years after the balance sheet date at the age of 65 is 21.0 years 2008 in accordance with the above table.
Assumptions regarding mortality rates are calculated based on life expectancy tables and are no longer analysed by gender which reflects US statutory requirements.

116 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 30 Contingent liabilities Group a The highly regulated nature of the Groups business means that from time to time the Group is subject to regulatory enquiries and investigations, particularly in the US.
The Group is currently involved in a number of these.
Some of these regulatory enquiries and investigations are broad and tend to be interdealer industry wide in nature.
In February 2006, in the US, the SEC issued a formal order of investigation to ICAP Securities USA LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, and other interdealer brokers in government and other fixed income securities.
In addition, the SEC has issued several requests for information relating to ICAP Securities USA LLCs voice mortgage-backed securities desk.
The mortgage aspect of the investigation has been in progress since April 2008.
ICAP Securities USA LLC continues to co-operate with the enquiry.
Although ICAP Securities USA LLC has not received notice of an intention by the SEC to bring any charges against ICAP Securities USA LLC or its executives, the potential range of penalties generally available to the SEC include, among other things, financial penalties, disgorgement, fines, actions against individuals, and injunctive and other remedial relief.
Such matters are inherently subject to many uncertainties and the Group cannot predict their outcomes.
However, there are no issues which are currently expected to have a material adverse financial impact on the Groups results or net assets.
b In 2004, the National Australia Bank NAB announced that it incurred FX trading losses of AU$360 million.
NAB subsequently alleged, in correspondence sent to ICAP plc, that one of the Groups subsidiaries helped NAB traders mask these losses.
The Group does not accept any responsibility for NAB's losses and has not received any correspondence from NAB since October 2006. c From time to time the Group is engaged in litigation in relation to a variety of matters.
It is not possible to quantify the extent of any potential liabilities, but there are none currently expected to have a material adverse financial impact on the Groups consolidated results or net assets.
