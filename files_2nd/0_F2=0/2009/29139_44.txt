Categories of investment No investment shall be made on which there is unlimited liability.
The Managers must seek permission of the Board to invest in collective investment schemes managed by Baillie Gifford & Co.
Transactions in futures and options must be consistent with HM Revenue and Customs guidelines so as to ensure maintenance of the Companys Investment Trust status.
23 Financial Instruments As an Investment Trust, the Company invests in equities and makes other investments so as to achieve its investment objective of maximising total return, whilst also generating real dividend growth, from a focused and actively managed global portfolio.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to various types of risk that are associated with the financial instruments and markets in which it invests.
These risks are categorised here as market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board monitors closely the Companys exposures to these risks but does so in order to reduce the likelihood of a permanent loss of capital rather than to minimise the short term volatility.
Risk provides the potential for both loss and gains and in assessing risk, the Board encourages the Managers to exploit the opportunities that risk affords.
The risk management policies and procedures outlined in this note have not changed substantially from the previous accounting period.
