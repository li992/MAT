7792 7bPFP Law Deb R&A 2009 22 2 10 17:58 Page 41 Notes to the accounts 41 for the year ended 31 December 2009 1 Summary of significant accounting policies General Information The Law Debenture Corporation p. l. c. is a public company incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The address of the registered office is given on page 16.
The groups operations and its principal activities are as an investment trust and the provider of independent fiduciary services.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling thousands because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the group operates.
Basis of preparation The financial statements of The Law Debenture Corporation p. l. c. have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the European Union.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of listed instruments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies, January 2009 SORP is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of the financial statements necessarily requires the exercise of judgement both in application of accounting policies which are set out below and in the selection of assumptions used in the calculation of estimates.
These estimates and judgements are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are continually evaluated based on historical experience and other factors.
However, actual results may differ from these estimates.
The most significantly affected components of the financial statements and associated critical judgements is as follows: Defined benefit scheme The estimation of the expected cash flows used in the calculation of the defined benefit schemes liabilities includes a number of assumptions around mortality, discount rates, inflation rates applicable to defined benefits and the average expected service lives of the employees see note 23.
The directors have considered the sensitivity to the mortality assumption and determined that if life expectancy were to increase by one year then the deficit of the scheme would increase by 717,000.
The directors take advice from the Scheme Actuary when selecting these assumptions and when selecting the discount rate used to calculate the defined benefit scheme liabilities.
New IFRSs and interpretations adopted in the financial statements IAS 1 as revised in 2007 Presentation of financial statements has introduced terminology changes including revised titles for the financial statements and changes in the format and content of the financial statements.
The amendments do not have a financial impact for the group.
The group has presented income and expense in two statements: an income statement and a statement of comprehensive income.
IFRS 8 Operating segments has introduced changes in the way operating segments are determined.
The amendments do not have a financial or presentational impact for the group.
Improving disclosures about financial instruments Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial instruments expands the disclosures required in respect of fair value measurement and liquidity risk.
None of the other standards or interpretations introduced from 1 January 2009 has had a material impact on the financial statements.
New IFRSs and interpretations not yet adopted in the financial statements IFRS 3 as revised in 2008 Business combinations provides new guidance on the acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries and is applicable to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
The cost of an acquisition will comprise only consideration for equity: other related costs will be expensed immediately.
The accounting for contingent consideration is amended so that adjustments made subsequent to the acquisition, in certain circumstances, may be recognised in profit or loss.
These changes will affect the groups accounting for future acquisitions and disposals.
No impact is expected from any other standards or interpretations which have been endorsed by the European Union and are available for early adoption, but which have not been adopted.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of The Law Debenture Corporation p. l. c. and entities controlled by the Corporation its subsidiaries made up to the end of the financial period.
Control is achieved where the Corporation has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess consideration over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are adjusted, where necessary, to ensure the accounting policies used are consistent with those adopted by the group.

In accordance with the Corporations status as a UK investment company under Section 833 of the Companies Act 2006, net capital returns may not be distributed by way of dividend.
Additionally, the net revenue is the measure the directors believe appropriate in assessing the groups compliance with certain requirements set out in Section 842 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Corporation has not presented its own income statement.
Segment reporting Operating segments are components of an entity about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regulary by the directors in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
The group comprises two operating segments: the investment trust and independent fiduciary services, this is consistent with internal reporting.
The overseas offices represent less than 10% of the assets and operations and consequently no separate geographical segment information is provided.
Foreign currencies Transactions recorded in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date.
Gains and losses on translation are included in net profit or loss for the period, however exchange gains or losses on investments held at fair value through profit and loss are included as part of their fair value gain or loss.
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of net investment in foreign subsidiaries are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and transferred to the groups translation reserve.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the item.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over the assets estimated useful lives as follows: Leasehold improvements over the remaining lease period Office furniture and equipment 3-10 years Intangible assets Computer software Computer software is capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of between three and five years.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment would be recognised in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
Impairment of assets An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which an assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
Assets are reviewed on a regular basis and tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Financial instruments Investments Listed investments, which comprise the investment trust portfolio, have been designated as investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Purchases and sales of listed investments are recognised on trade date, the date on which the group commits to purchase or sell the investment.
Investments are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Gains and losses arising from listed investments, as assets at fair value through profit or loss, are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
The fair value of listed investments is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The quoted market price used is the bid price.
Gains and losses on investments and direct transaction costs are analysed within the income statement as capital.
All other costs of the investment trust are treated as revenue items.

com 7792 7bPFP Law Deb R&A 2009 22 2 10 17:58 Page 43 43 1 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held with banks, other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
The difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the term of the borrowings using the effective interest method, so as to generate a constant rate of return on the amount outstanding.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
The ordinary shares of the Corporation which have been purchased by the Employee Share Ownership Trust to provide share based payments to employees are valued at cost and deducted from equity.
Taxation Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense which are either never taxable or deductible or are taxable or deductible in other periods.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end date.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each year end date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to recover the asset.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is expected to be settled or the asset is expected to be realised based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the year end date.
Revenue recognition Dividend income Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Interest income Interest income is accrued on a time basis using the effective interest rate applicable.
Sales of services Revenue comprises the fair value of the sales of services net of value added tax and after eliminating sales within the group.
Sales of services are recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered, provided that the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably.
Where the outcome of a transaction can be estimated reliably, sales are assessed on the basis of the actual services provided as a proportion of the total services to be provided.
Where payments are received in advance for trusteeships which extend beyond the period end then the amount relating to future periods is deferred using an appropriate discount rate.
Employee benefits Pension costs The group operates a defined benefit pension plan.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the project unit credit method, with independent actuarial calculations being carried out at each year end date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur through other comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that benefits are already vested, and otherwise amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of the defined benefit plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the year end date less the fair value of the plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised past service costs.

Share based plans The group has awarded share options to executives and the group makes equity based awards to executives.
In accordance with the transitional provisions for the implementation of the standard, the group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments to all grants of equity instruments made after 7 November 2002.
Share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant using an appropriate option valuation technique, which is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Reserves A description of each of the reserves follows: Share premium This reserve represents the difference between the issue price of shares and the nominal value of shares at the date of issue, net of related issue costs.
Capital redemption This reserve was created on the cancellation and repayment of the companys share capital.
Share based payments This reserve represents the fair value cost of share based payments.
Own shares This represents the cost of shares purchased by the ESOT.
Capital reserves The following are dealt with through this reserve: Gains and losses on realisation of investments: Changes in fair value investments which are readily convertible to cash: and Amounts by which other assets and liabilities valued at fair value differ from their book value.
Retained earnings Net revenue profits and losses of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and the fair value costs of share based payments which are revenue in nature are dealt with in this reserve.
Translation reserve This reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries.
Leases Operating leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases, net of incentives received from the lessor, are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Corporations shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders.

The goodwill is identifiable with separate operating companies Safecall Limited 1,419,000 and Delaware Corporate Services Inc. 768,000.
At 31 December 2009 the goodwill in relation to the operating companies was reviewed.
The review assessed whether the carrying value of goodwill was supported by the net present value of future cash flows based on management forecasts for 2010, assumed annual growth based on current expectations of 5% and 8% and a discount rate of 5%.
On this basis the goodwill is not considered to be impaired.
If the assumed annual growth for both operating units were 5% then there would be an implied impairment of 154,000. www.
