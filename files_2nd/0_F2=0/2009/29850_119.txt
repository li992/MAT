22 RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss.
This is mitigated by the Investment Manager reviewing the credit ratings of broker counterparties.
The risk attached to dividend flows is mitigated by the Investment Managers research of potential investee companies.
The Companys custodian bank is responsible for the collection of income on behalf of the Company.
Cash is held either with reputable banks with high quality external credit enhancements or in liquidity cash funds providing a spread of exposures to various underlying banks in order to diversify risk.
Currency risk The income and capital value of the Companys investments and liabilities can be affected by exchange rate movements as some of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than Sterling which is the Companys reporting currency.
The key areas where foreign currency risk could have an impact on the Company are: movement in rates affect the value of investments and liabilities: movements in rates affect the income received: and movements in rates affect short term timing differences.
