Provisions Provisions have been made for onerous leases, dilapidations, restructuring and disposal costs.

Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period when such determination is made.

Income taxes The Group recognises expected liabilities for tax based on an estimation of the likely taxes due, which requires significant judgement as to the ultimate tax determination of certain items.

Restatement of comparative financial statements Company During the year, it was identified that a sale of properties by the Company to a Group entity was incorrectly recognised in the financial statements for the 52 weeks to 25 March 2006.
The accounting for the transaction has now been corrected in the financial statements of the Company with the following impacts: the net book value of land and buildings at 25 March 2007 had been overstated by 132 million: the amounts due to Group entities at 25 March 2007 were overstated by 188 million: retained earnings as at 25 March 2007 were understated by 55 million: and the depreciation charge included in profit for the 52 weeks to 22 March 2008 was overstated by 1 million.
As required by IAS 8 Accounting Policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors, the relevant financial statements and the related notes for the year to 22 March 2008 have been restated.
The restatement has no impact on the consolidated financial statements.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
Underlying earnings per share is provided by excluding the effect of any gain or loss on the sale of properties, impairment of goodwill, investment property fair value movements, financing fair value movements and one-off items that are material and infrequent in nature.
This alternative measure of earnings per share is presented to reflect the Groups underlying trading performance.

Impairment of property, plant and equipment In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the Group has determined that for the purposes of impairment testing, each store is a cash-generating unit CGU.
CGUs are tested for impairment at each reporting date if there are indications of impairment.
The recoverable amounts for the CGUs are based on value in use which is calculated on the cash flows expected to be generated by the units using the latest budget and forecast data, the results of which are reviewed by the Board.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculation are the discount rate, growth rates and expected changes in margin.
Changes in income and expenditure are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long-term growth rates of three per cent to four per cent.
The discount rate is based on the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of ten per cent 2008: ten per cent.
Interest capitalised Interest capitalised included in additions amounted to 15 million 2008: 8 million for the Group and nil 2008: nil for the Company.
Accumulated interest capitalised included in the cost total above net of disposals amounted to 255 million 2008: 255 million for the Group and nil 2008: nil for the Company.
The capitalisation rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation is 6.5 per cent 2008: 5.7 per cent.

The CGUs for this purpose are deemed to be the respective acquired retail chains of stores.
The value of the goodwill was tested for impairment during the current financial year by means of comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU to the carrying value of its goodwill.
To calculate the CGUs value in use, Board approved cash flows for the following financial year are assumed to inflate at the long-term average growth rate for the UK food retail sector and are discounted at a pre-tax rate of ten per cent 2008: ten per cent over a 25-year period.
Based on the operating performance of the respective CGUs, no impairment loss was deemed necessary in the current financial year 2008: nil.

Secured loans Secured loans are secured on 128 2008: 127 supermarket properties note 11 and comprise loans from two finance companies: a fixed rate loan with an outstanding principal value of 1,130 million 2008: 1,159 million at a weighted average rate of 4.97 per cent stepping up to 5.36 per cent from April 2013 effective interest rate of 5.23 per cent and carrying amount of 1,142 million 2008: 1,133 million repayable over nine years: and an inflation linked loan with an outstanding principal value of 872 million 2008: 867 million at a fixed real rate of 2.36 per cent where principal and interest are uplifted annually by RPI subject to a cap at five per cent and floor at nil per cent with a carrying amount of 905 million 2008: 902 million repayable over 22 years.
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to convert 211 million 2008: 602 million of the 1,130 million 2008: 1,159 million loan due 2018 from fixed to floating rates of interest.
These transactions have been accounted for as fair value hedges note 30.
During the year, 391 million of the 602 million swaps accounted for as fair value hedges as at March 2008 were fide-designated from their fair value hedging relationship.
The fair value of the debt previously hedged by these swaps will be amortised over the remaining life of the loans, resulting in an amortisation charge to the income statement in the current financial year of 770,000 2008: 136,000.
Term loans due 2015 On 23 May 2008, the Group entered into a 150 million seven-year term loan.
The coupon on the loan comprises a fixed rate and a floating rate.
The carrying amount of the loan is 162 million and the loan is repayable over six years.
Undrawn borrowing facilities Expiry of facility 400 million revolving credit facility February 2012 1 163 million revolving credit facility May 2011 1 The 163 million revolving credit facility was entered into on 9 May 2008.

Funding and financial risk management are managed by a central treasury department in accordance with policies and guidelines approved by the Board of Directors.
The risk management policies are designed to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance by identifying the various risks and setting appropriate risk limits and controls.
The Finance Committee of the Board of Directors has responsibility for approving specific financial transactions.
The Treasury Committee, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, regularly reviews risk positions and monitors performance.
The Group Audit Committee oversees management compliance with risk management policies and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Group Audit Committee is assisted by Group Internal Audit who regularly review the Groups risk management controls and procedures.
The Group only uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures arising in respect of underlying business requirements and not for any speculative purpose.
Treasury operations in respect of Sainsburys Bank are managed separately through Lloyds Banking Group, the Groups joint venture partner.
Liquidity risk The Groups operational cash flow is largely stable and predictable, reflecting the low business risk profile of the food retail business.
Cash flow forecasts are produced regularly to assist management in identifying future liquidity requirements.
The Groups liquidity policy requires that it maintains committed funding to cover cash flow requirements over an 18-month period.
This is achieved by structuring core debt with long-term maturities, pre-funding operational cash flows and maturing debt obligations and maintaining a portfolio of committed standby credit facilities.
Core funding is mainly comprised of two long-term loans entered into in March 2006 and secured over property assets held in two subsidiary companies.
The loans comprise 1,130 million with a legal maturity of April 2018 and 872 million with a legal maturity of 2031.
During the year the Company also entered into a 150 million loan maturing 2015 and a 35 million bank loan maturing May 2009.
Short-term and seasonal funding is sourced from the wholesale inter-bank money market where interest is charged at various spreads over LIBOR.
The Group also maintains a 35 million net overdraft facility under which debit and credit balances of the various subsidiary accounts covered by the facility are netted for the purpose of charging interest.
The table below includes the gross overdrawn balances within this facility and the offsetting cash balances under this arrangement are included within cash and cash equivalents see note 27b.
Interest arising on any net overdraft balances is charged at a margin above bank base rate.
For standby purposes the Group maintains a 400 million committed revolving credit facility maturing February 2012 and a 163 million committed revolving credit facility maturing May 2011.
Interest on drawings under these facilities is charged at margins above LIBOR.
There are nil drawings under the committed facilities as at 21 March 2009 2008: nil drawings.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.

Credit risk The Groups exposures to credit risk arise from holdings of cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial assets, deposits with banks, investments in marketable securities and trade receivables note 17.
The Group deposits surplus funds on the wholesale inter-bank money markets with approved banks or into pooled money market funds.
The Groups credit policy limits investments to banks or liquid securities which carry minimum short-term credit ratings of A1 from Standard & Poors and P1 from Moodys Investors Service or, in the case of money market funds, AAAm from Standard & Poors and Aaa from Moodys Investors Service.

The Group also has limited exposure in respect of recognised foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The Groups risk management policy seeks to limit the impact of movements in exchange rates on Group income by requiring anticipated foreign currency cash flows in US dollars and euros to be hedged.
The future cash flows, which may be either contracted or un-contracted, are hedged on a layered basis between 80 per cent and 20 per cent using forward contracts.
The Group has limited exposure to currency risk on balances held on foreign currency denominated bank accounts, which may arise due to short-term timing differences on maturing hedges and underlying supplier payments.
A 20 per cent change in the value of the US dollar versus sterling at the balance sheet date with all other variables held constant would have increased or decreased post-tax profit or loss for the year by 2 million ten per cent change 2008: 20,000, as a result of gains or losses on translation of US dollar cash balances and US dollar denominated trade payables and receivables.
A 20 per cent change in the value of euro versus sterling at the balance sheet date with all other variables held constant would have increased or decreased post-tax profit or loss for the year by 1 million ten per cent change 2008: 500,000, as a result of gains or losses on translation of euro cash balances and euro denominated trade payables and receivables.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 J Sainsbury plc 75 Notes to the financial statements continued 29 Financial risk management continued Movements of this magnitude in the other currencies noted above would have an immaterial impact on both the income statement and equity.
b Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its portfolio of interest bearing borrowings and deposits.
The Groups interest rate policy seeks to minimise interest expense and volatility by structuring the interest rate profile into a diversified portfolio of fixed rate, floating rate and inflation-linked liabilities.
Inflation-linked cash flows arising on the Groups long-term borrowings remain an effective source of diversification within the liability portfolio, a hedge of the Groups revenues as well as a means of reducing balance sheet risk.
These cash flows arose as part of a general refinancing exercise undertaken in March 2006. i Fair value sensitivity for fixed rate instruments The Group holds 1,130 million of fixed rate debt 2008: 1,159 million, of which 211 million 2008: 602 million has been swapped into floating rate debt with interest rate swaps.
The remaining 919 million 2008: 557 million portion of fixed rate debt is recorded at amortised cost and a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect the income statement.
ii Cash flow sensitivity for variable rate instruments The 211 million portion of fixed rate debt swapped to floating rates 2008: 602 million and the associated interest rate swaps have been designated as being in a hedging relationship.
The interest rate swaps and the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised at fair value through profit or loss.
The two movements in fair values on the underlying fixed rate debt and the interest rate swaps largely offset one another in the income statement.
A change of 200 basis points in interest rates at the balance sheet date would have increased or decreased post-tax profit or loss by 3 million a change of 100 basis points 2008: 4 million representing the increased cost of the floating rate leg of the swaps.
For the year, the fair value movement in the interest rate swaps has resulted in a credit to the income statement of 35 million 2008: 25 million.
The fair value movement in the underlying fixed rate debt has resulted in a charge to the income statement of 35 million 2008: 25 million.
The net movement is a credit to the income statement of 691,000 which represents the ineffectiveness on the hedging relationship 2008: 282,000.
At the balance sheet date the Group held the following interest rate swaps not in a hedging relationship: a notional value of 256 million 2008: 75 million of fixed rate borrowings into floating rates of interest and a notional value of 391 million 2008: nil of floating borrowings into fixed rates of interest.
Interest rate swaps not held in a hedging relationship are recognised at fair value through profit or loss.
An increase of 200 basis points in interest rates would have decreased post-tax profit or loss by 3 million 2008: 4 million.
A decrease of 200 basis points in interest rates would have decreased post-tax profit or loss by 7 million 2008: 10 million represented by a movement in the fair value and interest rates for the year.
For the year, the fair value movement in the interest rate swaps has resulted in a charge to the income statement of 6 million 2008: 4 million.
iii Cash flow sensitivity for inflation-linked variable instruments The Group holds 872 million of inflation-linked debt 2008: 867 million which is recorded at amortised cost.
A change of 100 basis points in the RPI at the balance sheet date would have increased or decreased post-tax profit or loss by 6 million a change of 50 basis points in the RPI 2008: 3 million.
iv Cash flow sensitivity for term loan due 2015 The Group holds 150 million of borrowings and associated swaps where the variable rate coupon is subject to a cap and floor.
A change of 100 basis points in the coupon would have an immaterial impact on the post-tax income statement taking the loan and swaps as a whole.
v Fair value sensitivity for available-for-sale assets Included within available-for-sale financial assets is 90 million 2008: 105 million relating to the Groups beneficial interest in a property investment pool.
The net present value of the Groups interest in the various freehold reversions owned by the property investment pool has been derived by assuming a property growth rate of 2.8 per cent per annum 2008: 2.8 per cent and a discount rate of ten per cent 2008: ten per cent, see note 15.
A change of 0.8 per cent in the assumed rate of property rental growth to 2.0 per cent and 3.6 per cent, holding other assumptions constant, would result in values for this asset of 77 million 2008: 90 million and 103 million 2008: 121 million respectively.
A change of one per cent in the discount rate to nine per cent and 11 per cent, holding other assumptions constant, would result in values of 103 million 2008: 121 million and 79 million 2008: 92 million respectively.
Commodity risk The Group is exposed to commodity price risk on its own use consumption of electricity, gas and fuel.
The Groups Energy Price Risk Committee seeks to limit the impact of movements in commodity prices on Group income by requiring forecast purchases of power and fuel be hedged.
The Group uses financial derivatives to hedge fuel exposures on a layered basis using contracts for difference.
A 20 per cent change in the fair value of the commodity price at the balance sheet date would have increased or decreased the cash flow equity reserve by 2 million.
The Group hedges electricity and gas exposures via forward purchases under flexible purchasing arrangements with the relevant suppliers.
76 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 Notes to the financial statements Notes to the financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 29 Financial risk management continued Capital risk management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital structure consistent with the size and nature of the Group.
The Groups current credit ratings comprise a Corporate Family rating of Baa3 from Moodys and a Corporate Credit rating of BBBfrom Standard & Poors.
The Board monitors a range of financial metrics including return on capital and gearing to measure the efficiency of the Groups capital structure, the returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
The Board has a policy to maintain the underlying earnings cover for the ordinary dividend at a minimum of 1.50 times and to grow the dividend cover over time to between 1.50 and 1.75 times.
From time to time the Company purchases its own shares in the market for the purpose of issuing shares under the Groups share option programmes.
Outside of this practice the Group does not have a defined share buy-back plan.

The Group had purchased -55 million 2008: -144 million and sold sterling at rates ranging from 0.78 to 0.94 2008: 0.68 to 0.97 with maturities from March 2009 to March 2010 2008: April 2008 to November 2008 and purchased US$161 million 2008: US$237 million and sold sterling at rates ranging from 1.40 to 2.00 2008: 1.93 to 2.05 with maturities from March 2009 to September 2010 2008: April 2008 to May 2009.
At 21 March 2009, an unrealised gain of 17 million 2008: gain of 2 million is included in equity in respect of the forward contracts.
This gain will be transferred to the income statement over the next 18 months.
During the year a credit to the profit or loss of 31 million was transferred from the cash flow equity reserve and included in cost of sales.
Commodity contracts cash flow hedges At 21 March 2009, the Group held a portfolio of commodity forward contracts with a fair value of 7 million 2008: nil to hedge its future own use fuel consumption over the next 12 months.
At 21 March 2009, an unrealised loss of 5 million 2008: nil is included in equity in respect of these contracts.
This loss will be transferred to the income statement over the next 12 months.
Interest rate swaps fair value hedge The Group holds a portfolio of 211 million of interest rate swaps 2008: 602 million to hedge a portion of the fixed rate secured loan due in 2018.
Under the terms of the swaps, the Group receives fixed interest and pays floating rate interest at a fixed spread above three-month LIBOR.
The notional principal amount of the interest rate swaps amortises from 211 million to 111 million from April 2016 to April 2018.
Derivative financial instruments fair value through profit and loss At 21 March 2009, the Group held a portfolio of interest rate swaps at fair value through profit or loss which convert 256 million of the Groups floating rate obligations into fixed rates 2008: 75 million.
Under the terms of these swaps the Group pays fixed rates of interest and receives three-month LIBOR for periods ranging from 19 April 2018 to 19 April 2031.
Included in this portfolio is a 75 million swap under which the counterparty has a once only option to cancel the swap or double the notional principal value of the swap on 19 July 2010 and thereafter a recurring option to cancel the swap on quarterly dates through to August 2030.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 J Sainsbury plc 77 Notes to the financial statements continued 30 Financial instruments continued The Group holds a portfolio of non-designated interest rate swaps which convert 391 million of fixed rate borrowings into floating rates 2008: nil.
Under the terms of the swap the Group receives fixed rates of interest and pays interest at various spreads above three-month LIBOR until 19 April 2018.
The Group maintains a contract for difference with a fair value of 12 million 2008: nil and a non-current interest rate swap with a fair value of 8 million 2008: nil which are related to the 150 million term loan due 2015.
Interest rate risk Financial instruments where interest is repriced at intervals of less than one year or less are classified as floating rate.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until maturity of the instrument.
Foreign currency risk The Group has net euro denominated trade creditors of 9 million 2008: 12 million and US dollar denominated trade creditors of 15 million 2008: 4 million.
Fair value Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements at amounts other than fair values.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are based on prices available from the market on which the instruments are traded where available.
The fair value of all other financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair values of short-term deposits, receivables, overdrafts, payables and loans of a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values, and are excluded from the analysis below.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 J Sainsbury plc 79 Notes to the financial statements continued 31 Retirement benefit obligations Retirement benefit obligations relate to two funded defined benefit schemes, the J Sainsbury Pension and Death Benefit Scheme JSPDBS and the J Sainsbury Executive Pension Scheme JSEPS and an unfunded pension liability relating to senior employees.
The defined benefit schemes were closed to new employees on 31 January 2002.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from the Groups assets.
The defined benefit schemes were subject to a triennial valuation carried out by Watson Wyatt, the schemes independent actuaries, at March 2006 on the projected unit basis.
The results of this valuation were approved by the schemes trustees in June 2007.
The retirement benefit obligations at 21 March 2009 have been calculated, where appropriate, on a basis consistent with this valuation.
A triennial valuation will be carried out at March 2009 by Watson Wyatt, the schemes independent actuaries on the projected unit basis with a statutory completion date of June 2010.
The unfunded pension liability is unwound when each employee reaches retirement and takes their pension from the Group payroll or is crystallised in the event of an employee leaving or retiring and choosing to take the provision as a one-off cash payment.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: 2009 2008 m m Present value of funded obligations 3,610 3,668 Fair value of plan assets 3,310 4,171 300 503 Present value of unfunded obligations 9 8 Retirement benefit obligations assets 309 495 Deferred income tax asset liability 87 129 Net retirement benefit obligations assets 222 366 The retirement benefit assets or obligations and the associated deferred income tax balance are shown within different line items on the face of the balance sheet.

The average expected return on assets has been derived as the weighted average of the expected returns from each of the main asset classes.
The expected return for each asset class reflects a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward-looking view of the financial markets as suggested by the yield available and the views of investment organisations.

The Group operates various share-based payment schemes as set out below: a Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE The Group operates a Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all UK employees with more than three months continuous service.
This is an approved HMRC Scheme and was established in 1980.
Under the SAYE scheme, participants remaining in the Groups employment at the end of the three-year or five-year savings period are entitled to use their savings to purchase shares in the Company at a stated exercise price.
Employees leaving for certain reasons are able to use their savings to purchase shares within six months of their leaving.

The maximum annual option award was two times basic salary and the grants were agreed by the Remuneration Committee according to the assessed performance and potential of participants.
The exercise of options is conditional upon a performance target based on the growth in the Companys underlying earnings per share EPS relative to inflation over a three-year period.
EPS is measured against a fixed starting point over the performance period beginning with the year in which the option was granted.
To the extent that the condition is not satisfied in full after three years, it will be retested on a fixed-point basis over four and then five financial years.
To the extent the condition is not met after five financial years, the option will lapse.
Once the options vest, participants remaining in the Groups employment or leaving for certain reasons, are entitled to exercise the options between vesting date normally at the end of the three-year performance period and the option expiry date, which is ten years from date of grant.

Under the PSP, participants remaining in the Groups employment or leaving for certain reasons, were entitled to receive a grant of options after a performance period of three years to acquire the shares awarded to them, at any time during the ten years following the date of grant.
The participants entitlement to receive the grant depended on the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR being the increase in the value of a share, including reinvested dividends, compared with a peer group of 11 companies namely Ahold, Alliance Boots, Carrefour, Casino, DSG International, Kingfisher, Loblaw, Marks & Spencer, Morrisons, Next and Tesco, over the three-year performance period.
If the median performance of the TSR against the comparator group was not achieved at the end of the three-year performance period, the entitlement to receive the grant of options lapsed.
At median level, shares to the value of 30 per cent of salary will be released and the award would be pro-rated at every position between the median and first position in the comparator group.
The maximum allocation for Directors was a conditional grant of shares equal to 75 per cent of salary.
No further allocations will be made under this plan.
A reconciliation of the number of shares conditionally allocated is shown below: Number Number of shares of shares 2009 2008 million million Outstanding at beginning of year - 0.9 Released to participants - 0.7 Lapsed - 0.2 Outstanding at end of year There were no shares conditionally allocated at 21 March 2009 and at 22 March 2008.
Conditional awards of shares that have fulfilled all conditions at the end of the performance period are represented by options granted to participants to acquire the shares awarded to them.

The free shares are being held in a trust on behalf of participants and will be forfeited if participants cease to remain in the Groups employment for a period of three years.
Shares are released to participants within the first three years for certain reasons.
After the three-year period, the shares continue to be held by the trust for a further holding period of two years, unless they are released to participants upon cessation of employment with the Group.
A reconciliation of shares held in the trust is shown below: Number Number of shares of shares 2009 2008 million million Outstanding at beginning of year 1.4 1.5 Released to participants 1.0 0.1 Outstanding at end of year 0.4 1.4 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 J Sainsbury plc 85 Notes to the financial statements continued 32 Share-based payments continued ii From 18 September 2008, under the Sainsburys share purchase plan, all employees were offered the opportunity to receive one free matching share for every four shares purchased through the savings share purchase plan.
Under this scheme, 95,258 matching shares have been awarded, all of which are outstanding at 21 March 2009.
Options to acquire the award of shares were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The fair value per option granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: 2009 2008 Share price at grant date pence 292 - Exercise price pence - - Expected volatility % 26.8 - Option life years 3.0 - Expected dividends expressed as dividend yield % 2.6 - Risk-free interest rate % 5.7 - Fair value per option pence 271 - The expected volatility is based on the standard deviation of the Groups share price for the period immediately prior to the date of grant of award, over the period identical to the vesting period of the award, adjusted for managements view of future volatility of the share price.
f J Sainsbury plc Share Plan 2005 Under the J Sainsbury plc Share Plan 2005, shares were awarded to participants on the conditional basis that the performance targets are achieved within the four-year performance period, from the financial year beginning 27 March 2005 until the financial year ending March 2009.
The levels of awards are scaled according to seniority and there is an opportunity for Executive Directors and eligible Operating Board members to make a personal investment of up to 50 per cent of salary in the plan.
The awards will vest if stretching sales and earnings per share EPS targets are achieved, as shown in table 1 below.
The relevant performance multiplier, which is on a sliding scale up to a maximum of five times, will be calculated and applied to the core award of shares, as well as the personal investment of shares, i. e. shares acquired by Executive Directors and eligible Operating Board members.
Further, there is an opportunity for partial vesting of up to half the award, if the accelerated performance targets have been met at the end of year three i. e. financial year ending March 2008 as shown in table 2.
No awards will vest unless threshold levels of growth in both sales and EPS are achieved.
Once performance targets have been achieved, options will be granted to participants remaining in the Groups employment or leaving for certain reasons to acquire the shares awarded to them, at nil cost.
The options will expire within a year after the end of the four-year performance period.
Dividends will accrue on the shares that vest in the form of additional shares.
In order to participate in the plan, participants agreed to surrender options granted to them under the Companys Executive Share Option Plan in 2002, 2003 and 2004.

The core awards are calculated as a percentage of the participants salaries and scaled according to grades.
The awards will vest if the threshold levels of two co-dependent performance conditions Return on Capital Employed ROCE and growth in cash flow per share, are achieved over the three-year performance period.
The core award can grow by up to four times, dependent on the level of performance.
Straight-line vesting will apply if performance falls between two points.

h Deferred Annual Bonus Plan The Deferred Annual Bonus Plan applies to the top levels of management including Executive Directors and currently comprises around 40 participants in total.
The first deferral took place in June 2007, in respect of the bonus awards for the financial year ended 22 March 2008.
The second deferral took place in June 2008, in respect of the bonus awards for the financial year ended 22 March 2008.
The next deferral will take place in June 2009.
The Plan measures the Companys TSR performance over a three-year period against a bespoke UK and European retail comparator group comprising: Tesco, Morrisons, DSG International, Kingfisher, Home Retail Group, Marks & Spencer, Next, Ahold, Carrefour, Casino, Delhaize and Metro.
Alliance Boots was removed from the comparator group following its fide-listing.
Up to two matched shares may be awarded for each share deferred depending on the extent to which the TSR measure is achieved.
No shares are awarded for below median performance, and the full match will only apply where the Company achieves first place within the comparator group.
At median position the match will be 0.5 shares for each deferred bonus share and the share match will be pro-rated at every position between median and first place.
To the extent that the performance condition is met at the end of the three-year performance period, the matched shares will be added to the deferred bonus shares.
The deferred bonus shares and half of the matched shares can be accessed immediately, while the remainder will be held over for a further year.
Dividends or their equivalents will accrue on shares that vest.
