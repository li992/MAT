FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK This note presents information about the fair-value of the Groups financial instruments, the Groups exposure to the risks associated with those instruments, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further qualitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Scottish and Southern Energy 129 Annual Report 2009 i Credit risk ii Liquidity risk and Going Concern iii Commodity risk iv Currency risk v Interest rate risk The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Board established the Risk and Trading Committee, a standing committee of the Board comprising three executive directors and senior managers from the Generation and Supply and Finance functions, to oversee the control of these activities.
This committee is discussed further in the Directors Report.
The Groups policies for risk management are established to identify the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
These policies, and the systems used to monitor activities, are reviewed regularly by the Risk and Trading Committee.
Exposure to the commodity, currency and interest rate risks noted arise in the normal course of the Groups business and derivative financial instruments are entered into to hedge exposure to these risks.
The objectives and policies for holding or issuing financial instruments and similar contracts, and the strategies for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the year are explained below.
The Company is required to disclose information on its financial instruments and has adopted policies identical to that of the Group, where applicable.
Separate disclosure is provided where necessary.
Before detailing the relevant qualitative and quantitative disclosures in relation to the potential risks faced by the Group, details on the different categories of financial instrument and the carrying and fair-values of each of those categories is provided below.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Scottish and Southern Energy 130 Annual Report 2009 Notes on the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 March A.
Basis of determining fair-value Certain assets and liabilities designated and carried at amortised cost are loans and receivables.
For certain current assets and liabilities their carrying value is equivalent to fair-value due to short term maturity.
Assets and liabilities designated at fair-value and the fair-value of other financial assets and liabilities have been determined by reference to closing rate market values.
This basis has been used in valuing interest rate instruments, foreign currency hedge contracts and denominated long-term fixed rate debt.
Commodity contracts fair-values are based on published price quotations.
The fair-values are stated at a specific date and may be different from the amounts which will actually be paid or received on settlement of the instruments.
The fair-value of items such as property, plant and equipment, internally generated brands or the Groups customer base are not included as these are not financial instruments.
Scottish and Southern Energy 131 Annual Report 2009 B.
RISKS FROM USE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Credit risk arising from the Groups normal commercial operations is controlled by individual business units operating in accordance with Group policies and procedures.
Generally, for significant contracts, individual business units enter into contracts or agreements with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings only, or where suitable collateral or other security has been provided.
Counterparty credit validation is undertaken prior to contractual commitment.
Credit risk management for the Groups regulated businesses is performed in accordance with industry standards as set out by the Regulator and is controlled by the individual business units.
The Groups greatest credit risks lie with the non-regulated operations of the Generation and Supply business and the activities carried out by the Groups Treasury function, for which specific credit risk controls that match the risk profile of those activities are applied.
Exposure to credit risk in the supply of electricity and gas arises from the potential of a customer defaulting on their invoiced payables.
The financial strength and creditworthiness of business customers is assessed prior to commencing, and for the duration of, their contract of supply.
Domestic customers creditworthiness is reviewed from a variety of internal and external information.
Exposure to credit risk in the procurement of wholesale energy and fuel is managed by reference to agreed transaction credit limits which are determined by whether the counterparty: i holds an investment grade credit rating: or ii can be assessed as adequately creditworthy in accordance with internal credit rules using information from other external credit agencies: or iii can provide a guarantee from an investment grade rated entity or post suitable collateral or provide other acceptable assurances in accordance with group procedures where they have failed to meet the above conditions: or iv can be allocated a non-standard credit limit approved by the Risk Committee within its authorised limits as delegated by the Group Board.
Credit support clauses or side agreements are typically included or entered into to protect the Group against counterparty failure or non-delivery.
Within the Generation and Supply business, increasing volumes of commodity derivative products are now traded through cleared exchanges to further mitigate credit risk.
Such exchanges are subject to strict regulation by the UK Financial Services Authority FSA and participants in these exchanges are obliged to meet rigorous capital adequacy requirements.
Individual counterparty credit exposures are monitored by category of credit risk and are subject to approved limits.
At 31 March 2009, the Groups Generation and Supply business had pledged 221m 2008 135m of cash collateral and letters of credit and had received 28m 2008 74m of cash collateral and letters of credit principally to reduce exposures on commodity price risk.
Bank credit exposures, which are monitored and reported on daily, are calculated on a mark-to-market basis and adjusted for future volatility and probability of default.
Any issues relating to these credit exposures are presented for discussion and review by the Risk Committee.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits which are readily convertible to cash.
These are subject to insignificant risk of change in value or credit risk.
Derivative financial instruments are entered into to cover the Groups market risks commodity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk and are consequently covered elsewhere in this note.
Trade receivables represent the most significant exposure to credit risk and are stated net of collateral held, letters of credit or other credit enhancements.
The trade receivables total includes an allowance for impairment.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Scottish and Southern Energy 132 Annual Report 2009 Notes on the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 March B.
RISKS FROM USE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Concentrations of risk Trade receivables recorded by reported segment held at the 31 March were: 2009 2008 m m Power Systems Scotland 20.0 18.6 England 35.6 19.7 55.6 38.3 Generation and Supply Retail customers 994.6 554.0 Wholesale and trading receivables 1,978.0 1,165.6 Other 113.5 74.7 Other businesses 191.6 209.6 3,333.3 2,042.2 The Generation and Supply segment accounts for 92.6% 2008 87.9% of the Groups trade receivables.
Trade receivables associated with the Groups 9.05 million electricity and gas customers are recorded in this segment.
The Group also has significant receivables associated with its wholesale and trading activities which are generally settled within 2 to 4 weeks from invoicing.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is therefore subject to diversification with no exposure to individual customers totalling 10% of trade receivables.
The Groups biggest customer balance, due from a wholesale electricity customer, is less than 6% 2008 5% of the total.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: 2009 2008 m m Not past due 3,008.1 1,873.8 Past due but not individually impaired: 0-30 days 192.6 106.0 31-90 days 96.0 61.6 Over 90 days 163.3 116.5 3,460.0 2,157.9 Less: allowance for impairment 126.7 115.7 Net trade receivables 3,333.3 2,042.2 The Group has past due debt which has not had an impairment allowance set aside to cover potential credit losses.
The Group has procedures to pursue customers in significant arrears and believes its impairment policy in relation to such balances is appropriate.
Those debts which are neither past due nor impaired are expected to be recoverable.
The Group has other receivables which are financial assets totalling 481.7m 2008 176.0m.
The Company does not have trade receivables.
The movement in the allowance for impairment of trade receivables was: 2009 2008 m m Balance at 1 April 115.7 85.3 Increase in allowance for impairment 35.2 69.5 Impairment losses recognised 39.9 50.2 Recovery of impairment loss previously recognised 15.7 8.6 Acquired allowance 2.5 Balance at 31 March 126.7 115.7 At the end of each reporting period a review of the provision for bad and doubtful debts is performed.
It is an assessment of the potential amount of trade receivables which will not be paid by customers after the balance sheet date.
This amount is calculated by reference to the age, status and risk of each receivable.
Scottish and Southern Energy 133 Annual Report 2009 ii Liquidity risk and Going Concern Liquidity risk, the risk that the Group will have insufficient funds to meet its liabilities, is managed by the Groups Treasury function.
The Group can have significant movements in its liquidity position due to movements in commodity prices, working capital requirements, the seasonal nature of the business and phasing of its capital expenditure programme.
Treasury is responsible for managing the banking and liquidity requirements of the Group, risk management relating to interest rate and foreign exchange exposures, and for managing the credit risk relating to the banking counterparties with which it transacts.
Short term liquidity is reviewed daily by Treasury.
The departments operations are governed by policies determined by the Board and any breaches of these policies are reported to the Risk Committee and Audit Committee.
The longer term liquidity position is reviewed on a regular basis by the Board.
In relation to the Groups liquidity risk, the Groups policy is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Companys reputation.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to seek to ensure that the Group has available committed borrowings and facilities equal to at least 105% of forecast borrowings over a rolling 12 month period.
However due to the level of debt refinancing combined with the deteriorating conditions in the capital and banking markets during the latter half of 2008, the Group decided to temporarily relax this test and focus on a shorter rolling period.
The Directors consider this to be an acceptable funding policy taking into account the carrying cost of long term debt compared to short term debt.
The Group uses a cash flow forecast to monitor its ongoing borrowing requirements.
Typically, the Group will fund any short term borrowing positions by issuing commercial paper or borrowing from uncommitted bank lines and will invest in money market funds when it has a cash surplus.
In addition to the borrowing facilities listed at note 21, the Group has 75m of uncommitted bank lines and a 20m overdraft facility.
On 3 April the Group entered into a new 850m revolving credit facility which will mature in June 2012.
A further 150m of bilateral facilities have been agreed and approved subject to documentation, and these will also mature in June 2012.
At the time of signing the accounts, these facilities were undrawn.
Under the going concern principle, the Group expects to issue medium to long term debt during the year ended 31 March 2010.
In addition, liquidity in the commercial paper market and the availability of undrawn committed bank facilities has enabled the Directors to conclude that the Group has sufficient headroom to continue as a going concern.
In coming to this conclusion the Directors have taken into account the successful issuance of 2.4bn of medium to long term debt during the year ended 31 March 2009, the Groups credit rating, the successful renewal and increase of committed bank facilities and current market conditions.
The statement of going concern is included in the Directors Corporate Governance report on page 61.
Treasury also manage the Groups interaction with its relationship banks defined as those banks that support the companys financing activities through their ongoing participation in the committed lending facilities that are maintained by the Group.
These are each allocated financial limits, subject to the maintenance of a minimum credit rating of A or equivalent allocated by a recognised major ratings group.
In respect of short-term cash management, counterparties are subject to review and approval according to defined criteria.
High volatility in commodity prices during the year has resulted in substantially increased cash amounts being posted in respect of mark-to-market related margin calls on exchange traded positions.
As at 31 March 2009, the value of outstanding cash collateral posted totalled 86.9m 2008 5.6m, representing a net cash outflow during the year of 81.3m.
The contractual cash flows shown in the following tables are the contractual undiscounted cashflows under the relevant financial instruments.
Where the contractual cashflows are variable based on a price, foreign exchange rate or index in the future, the contractual cashflows in the following tables have been determined with reference to the relevant price, foreign exchange rate, interest rate or index as at the balance sheet date.
In determining the interest element of contractual cashflows in cases where the Group has a choice as to the length of interest calculation periods and the interest rate that applies varies with the period selected, the contractual cashflows have been calculated assuming the Group selects the shortest available interest calculation periods.
Where the holder of an instrument has a choice of when to redeem, the amounts in the following tables are on the assumption the holder redeems at the earliest opportunity.
The numbers in the following tables have been included in the Groups cash flow forecasts for the purposes of considering Liquidity Risks as noted above.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Scottish and Southern Energy 134 Annual Report 2009 Notes on the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 March B.
RISKS FROM USE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued The following are the contractual liabilities of financial liabilities excluding the impact of netting agreements.
It should be noted that cash flows associated with future energy sales and commodity contracts which are not IAS 39 financial instruments are not included in this analysis, which is prepared in accordance with IFRS 7.
This arises from the Groups requirement to source gas or electricity to supply customers, or to procure fuel to produce electricity from its generation assets.
The Groups strategy is to manage all exposures to commodity risk through volumetric limits and to measure the exposure by use of a Value at Risk VaR model.
The exposure is subject to financial limits established by the Board and managed by the Risk and Trading Committee and is reported to the Committee on a monthly basis and to the Board when certain trigger levels are exceeded.
Within this approach, only certain of the Groups energy commodity contracts are deemed to constitute financial instruments under IAS 39.
As a result, while the Group manages the commodity price risk associated with both financial and non-financial commodity contracts, it is only the fair-value of IAS 39 financial instruments which represents the exposure of the Groups commodity price risk under IFRS 7.
This is a consequence of the accounting policy which requires that commodity contracts which are designated as financial instruments under IAS 39 should be accounted for on a fair-value basis with changes in fair-value reflected in profit or equity.
Conversely, commodity contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39 are accounted for as own use contracts.
As fair-value changes in own use contracts are not reflected through profit or equity, these do not represent the IFRS 7 commodity price risk.
Therefore, as the overall Group VaR associated with the Generation and Supply business is monitored for internal risk management purposes and is outside the scope of IAS 39, these measures are not required to comply with IFRS 7.
Operationally, the economic risks associated with this exposure are managed through a selection of longer and shorter term contracts for commodities such as gas, electricity, coal and oil, and also the flexibility of the Groups fleet of generation assets.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Scottish and Southern Energy 136 Annual Report 2009 Notes on the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 March B.
RISKS FROM USE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Short-term exposures arise from the requirement to match volumes of procured gas, electricity and power station fuel with demand for gas and electricity by its customers, which can vary from expectations and result in a requirement to close the resulting positions at unfavourable prices.
This aspect of commodity risk is managed through the ability to increase or decrease energy production either in the form of flexible purchase contracts or assets such as pumped storage generating plant, flexible hydro generating plant, standby oil plant and gas storage.
Longer-term exposures are managed through the Groups generation plant and longer term contracts including forwards, futures contracts and other financial instruments.
These, in turn, are used to reduce short-term market exposures.
Certain commodity contracts are entered into primarily for own use purposes to supply to existing customers or to fuel existing power stations.
However, as noted, a number of these contracts do not qualify for own use treatment under IAS 39 and are subject to fair-value measurement through the income statement.
In addition to this, the Group enters into certain contracts to manage commodity price and volume risk.
These are also subject to fair-value measurement through the income statement.
Finally, certain other physical contracts are treated as the hedging instrument in documented cash flow hedging relationships where the hedged item is the forecast future purchase requirement to meet production or customer demand.
The accounting policies associated with such items are explained in note 1.
The consequential commodity risk which derives from these activities is quantified by the use of a Value at Risk VaR model which considers exposures in all commodities and provides an estimate of the potential change to the Groups forecast profits over a given period and to a given confidence level.
The calculated financial risk is controlled through the imposition of a number of risk limits approved by the Board and monitored and managed by the Risk Committee.
The Groups exposure to Commodity risk is reported to and monitored by the Risk Committee and to the Board by exception.
The Groups exposure to commodity price risk according to IFRS 7 is measured by reference to the Groups IAS 39 commodity contracts.
IFRS 7 requires disclosure of a sensitivity analysis for market risks that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Groups financial position and performance to changes in market variables impacting upon the fair-value or cash flows associated with the Groups financial instruments.
Therefore, the sensitivity analysis provided discloses the effect on profit or loss and equity at the balance sheet date assuming that a reasonably possible change in the relevant commodity price had occurred, and been applied to the risk exposures in existence at that date.
The reasonably possible changes in commodity prices used in the sensitivity analysis were determined based on calculated or implied volatilities where available, or historical data.
The sensitivity analysis has been calculated on the basis that the proportion of commodity contracts that are IAS 39 financial instruments remains consistent with those at that point.
Excluded from this analysis are all commodity contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39.

The impacts of reasonably possible changes in commodity prices on profit after taxation based on the rationale described are as follows: 2009 2008 Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on profit m equity m profit m equity m Incremental profit loss Commodity prices combined increase 417.4 28.9 0.8 Commodity prices combined decrease 417.4 28.9 0.8 The sensitivity analysis provided is hypothetical and is based on the Groups commodity contracts under IAS 39.
This analysis should be used with caution as the impacts disclosed are not necessarily indicative of the actual impacts that would be experienced.
It should also be noted that these sensitivities are based on calculations which do not consider all interrelationships, consequences and effects of such a change in those prices.
iv Currency risk The Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling but also conducts business in foreign currencies.
As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk arising from exchange rate movements which will be reflected in the Groups transaction costs or in the underlying foreign currency assets of its foreign operations.
Scottish and Southern Energy 137 Annual Report 2009 The Groups policy is to use forward contracts, swaps and options to manage its exposures to foreign exchange risk.
All such exposures are transactional in nature, and relate primarily to procurement contracts, commodity purchasing and related freight requirements, commodity hedging, long term plant servicing and maintenance agreements, and the purchase and sale of carbon emission certificates.
The policy is to seek to hedge 100% of its currency requirements arising under all committed contracts excepting commodity hedge transactions, the requirements for which are significantly less predictable.
The policy for these latter transactions is to assess the Groups requirements on a rolling basis and to enter into cover contracts as appropriate.
Following the acquisition last year of the Airtricity business, the Group has foreign operations with consequent currency exposure issues.
The refinancing in the current financial year has sought to match the Groups net assets whose functional cash flows are denominated in euros, with borrowings held in euros.
For net assets whose functional cash flows are in sterling, the Group has ensured sterling denominated borrowings are in place.
Significant exposures are reported to, and discussed by, the Risk and Trading Committee on an ongoing basis and additionally form part of the bi-annual Treasury report to the Audit Committee.
At the balance sheet date, the total nominal value of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group has committed to is: 2009 2008 m m Forward foreign exchange contracts 1,286.1 916.3 The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows: 2009 2008 DKK DKK m million m $m m million m $m Loans and borrowings 28,000.0 1,092.0 97.5 1,115.0 100.0 Purchase and commodity contract commitments 181.3 673.6 1,906.3 241.2 203.6 1,936.6 Gross exposure 181.3 1,765.6 2,003.8 241.2 1,318.6 2,036.6 Forward exchange swap contracts 28,000.0 181.3 333.9 967.5 241.2 202.4 1,458.9 Net exposure in currency 1,431.7 1,036.3 1,116.2 577.7 Net exposure in m 1,324.7 724.7 888.1 290.8 This represents the net exposure to foreign currencies, reported in pounds sterling, and arising from all group activities.
All sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the relative proportions of instruments in foreign currencies being consistent as at the balance sheet date.
This includes only monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than sterling and excludes the translation of the net assets of foreign operations but not the corresponding impact of the net investment hedge.
The sensitivity analysis is indicative only and it should be noted that the Groups exposure to such market rate changes is continually changing.
The calculations are based on linear extrapolations of rate changes which may not reflect the actual result which would impact upon the Group.
A 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would have had the following impact on profit after taxation, based on the assumptions presented above: Equity Income Statement At At At At 31 March 2009 31 March 2008 31 March 2009 31 March 2008 m m m m US Dollars 58.0 23.3 Euro 51.9 39.8 54.1 31.3 DKK 51.9 39.8 112.1 54.6 The impact of a decrease in rates would be an identical reduction in the annual charge.
There is no impact on equity as the analysis relates to the Groups net exposure at the balance sheet date.
Contracts qualifying for hedge accounting are, by definition, part of the Groups covered position.
v Interest rate risk Interest rate risk derives from the Groups exposure to changes in the value of an asset or liability or future cash flows through changes in interest rates.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Scottish and Southern Energy 138 Annual Report 2009 Notes on the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 March B.
RISKS FROM USE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued The Groups policy is to manage this risk by stipulating that a minimum of 50% of Group borrowings be subject to fixed rates of interest, either directly through the debt instruments themselves or through the use of derivative financial instruments.
Such instruments include interest rate swaps and options, forward rate agreements and, in the case of debt raised in currencies other than sterling, cross currency swaps.
These practices serve to reduce the volatility of the Groups financial performance.
Although interest rate derivatives are primarily used to hedge risk relating to current borrowings, under certain circumstances they may also be used to hedge future borrowings.
Any such pre-hedging is unwound at the time of pricing the underlying debt, either through cash settlement on a net present value basis or by transacting offsetting trades.
The floating rate borrowings mainly comprise commercial paper issued at interest rates of LIBOR plus a variable margin and cash advances from the European Investment Bank EIB.
The impact of a change in interest rates is dependent on the specific details of the financial asset or liability in question.
Changes in fixed rate financial assets and liabilities, which account for the majority of cash, loans and borrowings, are not measured at fair-value through the income statement.
In addition to this, changes to fixed-to-floating hedging instruments which are recorded under cash flow hedge accounting also do not impact the income statement.
Changes in variable rate instruments and hedging instruments and hedged items recorded under fair-value hedge accounting are recorded through the income statement.
The exposure measured is therefore based on variable rate debt and instruments.
The net exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date can be summarised thus: 2009 2008 Carrying Carrying amount amount m m Interest bearing earning assets and liabilities: Fixed 4,735.9 2,381.4 Floating 553.5 1,320.4 5,289.4 3,701.8 Represented by: Cash and cash equivalents 295.9 255.3 Derivative financial liabilities 155.7 35.9 Loans and borrowings 5,429.1 3,920.6 Finance lease obligations 0.5 0.6 5,289.4 3,701.8 Following from this, the table below represents the expected impact of a change in 100 basis points in short term interest rates at the reporting date in relation to equity and income statement.
The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
An increase in exchange rates would be a change to either the income statement or equity.
The assessment is based on a revision of the fair-value assumptions included in the calculated exposures in the previous table.
All sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the proportion of fixed to floating instruments being consistent as at the balance sheet date and is stated after the effect of taxation.
2009 2008 m m Income Statement 6.1 13.2 Equity 6.1 13.2 The impact of a decrease in rates would be an identical reduction in the annual charge.
Contracts qualifying for hedge accounting are, by definition, part of the Groups net exposure.
vi Income statement disclosures For financial reporting purposes, the Group has classified derivative financial instruments into two categories, operating derivatives and financing derivatives.
Operating derivatives include all qualifying commodity contracts including those for electricity, gas, oil, coal and carbon.
Financing derivatives include all fair-value and cash flow interest rate hedges, non-hedge accounted mark-to-market interest rate derivatives, cash flow foreign exchange hedges and non-hedge accounted foreign exchange contracts.
Non-hedge accounted contracts are treated as held for trading.
Scottish and Southern Energy 139 Annual Report 2009 The net movement reflected in the Income Statement can be summarised thus: 2009 2008 m m Operating derivatives Total result on operating derivatives i 3,964.8 135.7 Less: amounts settled ii 2,673.1 323.5 Movement in unrealised derivatives 1,291.7 187.8 Financing derivatives and hedged items Total result on financing derivatives i 70.5 116.8 Less: amounts settled ii 44.7 137.5 Movement in unrealised derivatives 25.8 20.7 Net income statement impact 1,265.9 167.1 i Total result on derivatives in the income statement represents the total amounts charged or credited to the income statement in respect of operating and financial derivatives.

Cash flow hedges are contracts entered into to hedge a forecast transaction or cash flow risk generally arising from a change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates and which meet the effectiveness criteria prescribed by IAS 39.
The Groups accounting policy on cash flow hedges is explained in note 1.
The following table indicates the contractual maturities of the expected transactions and the qualifying cash flow hedges associated: Cash flow hedges 2009 2009 2009 2009 2009 2009 2008 2008 2008 2008 2008 2008 Carrying Expected 0-12 1-2 2-5 5 Carrying Expected 0-12 1-2 2-5 5 amount cash flows months years years years amount cash flows months years years years m m m m m m m m m m m m Interest rate swaps: Liabilities 10.0 10.0 4.2 2.6 3.2 5.9 5.9 1.8 1.7 2.2 0.2 Forward exchange contracts: Assets 52.2 556.3 489.1 10.9 23.0 33.3 13.1 114.4 32.9 21.8 19.9 39.8 Liabilities 0.3 21.9 20.6 0.6 0.7 3.4 88.4 57.9 21.6 8.9 51.9 578.2 509.7 11.5 23.7 33.3 9.7 202.8 90.8 43.4 28.8 39.8 Net investment hedge The Groups net investment hedge consists of debt issued in the same currency as the net investment in Airtricity.
The hedge compares the element of the net assets of Airtricity whose functional cash flows are denominated in to the matching portion of the borrowings held by the Group.
This therefore provides protection against movements in foreign exchange rates.
