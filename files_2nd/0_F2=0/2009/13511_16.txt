Robert Wiseman Dairies F12 Directors Remuneration Report continued Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 The vesting of the remaining 50% of an award will be dependent on the extent to which the growth in the Companys EPS over the same period exceeds the growth in RPI.
For the awards granted in the years ended 29 March 2008 and 4 April 2009, the required levels of EPS performance are as follows: EPS growth achieved Proportion of EPS element of award vesting Less than RPI 3% p. a. Nil RPI 3% p. a.
Pro-rata between 25% and 100% Notwithstanding the above, the extent to which the award vests as a consequence of the operation of these conditions can be reduced where, in exceptional circumstances, the Committee considers that the level of TSR and or EPS growth achieved is not a genuine reflection of the underlying performance of the Company over the period in question.
It is currently anticipated that the above levels of EPS and TSR performance will also be applied to the LTIP awards to be made shortly after the announcement of the Companys results for the year ending 3 April 2010.
For future awards, the Committee will review, and may amend, the required performance levels in order to ensure they remain appropriately stretching.
Long Term Incentive Plan Awards Vesting During the Year Ended 4 April 2009 The performance period applicable to the LTIP awards granted in June 2005 ended on 31 March 2008 and 100% of these awards vested shortly thereafter.
Over the period, the Company achieved an upper quartile ranking amongst the selected comparator group and delivered average EPS growth in excess of RPI 3% per annum.
Further details in relation to this vesting can be found on page F16.
Share options schemes Overview and Details of Directors Participation The Company currently operates the following share option schemes: The 1994 Employee Share Option Scheme the 1994 Scheme : The 1996 Employee Share Option Scheme the 1996 Scheme : The 2003 Approved Share Option Scheme the 2003 Approved Scheme : The 2003 Unapproved Share Option Scheme the 2003 Unapproved Scheme : and The Sharesave Schemes.
Summaries of each of these arrangements are set out below.
It should, however, be noted that RT Wiseman does not participate in any of the Companys share option schemes.
In addition, individuals who receive awards under the LTIP in any year are not eligible to be granted options under the 2003 Approved Scheme or the 2003 Unapproved Scheme in the same period.
Accordingly, on the basis that, since its introduction in the year ended 29 March 2003, the LTIP has been used as the mechanism for providing long-term incentives to Executive Directors, no options have been granted to them under the 2003 Approved Scheme or the 2003 Unapproved Scheme and it is not intended that options will be issued to them under these schemes in the future.
WG Keane and D Dobbins only hold outstanding options under the Sharesave Schemes.
M Mulcahy holds options under the 1994 Scheme and the Sharesave Schemes.
The 1994 and 1996 Schemes The 1994 and 1996 Schemes which have subsequently been superseded by the 2003 Approved Scheme and the 2003 Unapproved Scheme were formerly used by the Company to grant options to a broad selection of employees in the Group.
Although a number of options granted under these plans currently subsist, no further awards will be granted.
The 2003 Approved Scheme and the 2003 Unapproved Scheme These arrangements which were established during the year ended 3 April 2004, following approval at the Annual General Meeting, are used to grant options across the Group which are normally exercisable between three and ten years following their grant.
The total market value at date of grant of shares over which an individual may be granted options under these Schemes in any financial year is limited to 100% of basic salary.
The principal difference between these two plans is that the approval of HM Revenue and Customs was sought and obtained for the 2003 Approved Scheme, whereas no such approval was sought in relation to the 2003 Unapproved Scheme.
Options granted under these Schemes will not be exercisable unless there has been a sustained improvement in the performance of the Group over a three or more year period.
Currently, the performance condition that applies to options granted under these Schemes requires a minimum growth in the Companys EPS equal to the growth in RPI plus 3% per annum, tested over an initial three year period from grant.
As noted above, there is no intention to award options under either of these Schemes to any of the Executive Directors.
The Sharesave Schemes Under the Sharesave Schemes, employees can accumulate funds which can be used to fund the purchase of shares under an option that becomes exercisable after the fifth anniversary of its date of grant.
Share Incentive Plan In August 2002, the Group established an HM Revenue and Customs Approved Share Incentive Plan SIP which came into operation on 1 May 2003.
During the year ended 4 April 2009, awards were made under the SIP which is available to all employees of the Group with continuous service of 3 months.
These awards were under the Matching Share scheme, whereby participants could contribute up to 125 per month towards the purchase of shares in the Company which were then matched on a 1 for 4 basis.
Shares acquired under the Matching Share scheme are solely conditional upon the relevant participant remaining in the Groups employment for 3 years from the date of award.
Except for RT Wiseman, all of the Executive Directors participate in the SIP.
Robert Wiseman Dairies Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 Directors Remuneration Report continued F13 Impact of One-off Accounting Items on Long-term Incentive Arrangements In the same way as disclosed above in relation to the annual bonus scheme, the Committee was required to consider the impact of a number of one-off accounting items on the EPS targets attached to awards and options granted under the Companys various long-term incentive arrangements including awards made under the LTIP.
The decisions reached by the Committee included the following: in relation to the one-off tax credits of 2.1 million, the Committee concluded that its positive effects on EPS should be disregarded for the purposes of the incentive plan performance conditions this approach reflects the Committees belief that the purpose of these targets is to measure and reward long-term, sustainable growth in the underlying EPS performance of the Group: it should also be noted that it is entirely consistent with the stance taken by the Committee in relation to a benefit that was previously derived from the same source and which was recognised in the Companys accounts for the financial year to 2 April 2005: and in relation to the charge on earnings in the year to 4 April 2009 arising from the abolition of Industrial Buildings Allowances, the Committees view was that this item should be excluded for long-term incentive plan purposes on the basis that it was an event entirely outwith the control of management.
It should be noted that the above decisions will apply for the purposes of assessing the EPS targets attaching to both existing long-term incentive awards and those awards that will be granted in the forthcoming year.
Ongoing Review of Certain Long-term Incentive Arrangements The Committees review of the Executive Directors remuneration packages see page F8 includes an assessment of the current structure of the LTIP and the way in which it is operated in practice.
The review of this arrangement is focused on the need to ensure that the level of reward opportunity is competitive, reasonable and reflective of enhanced shareholder returns over the longer term.
However, the Committee is also mindful of the importance of the LTIP as a device for retaining the services of the Companys key executives.
For the avoidance of doubt, the outturn from the above review will not include proposals to adjust the terms of awards that have already been granted under the LTIP.
Similarly, it should be noted that, at this stage, the Committee does not envisage increasing the maximum award levels under the LTIP beyond those that are currently in place i. e. 100% of basic salary in any financial year.
Pensions Current Arrangements Executive Directors are members of money purchase pension schemes.
Their dependants are eligible for the payment of a lump sum in the event of death in service equivalent to four times basic salary.
The Executive Directors, excluding the Chief Executive, are entitled to a Company contribution of 5% of basic salary to a money purchase pension scheme.
As explained on page F15, some of the Directors have sacrificed a proportion of their salary and or bonus in return for the Group making supplementary pension contributions over and above the contractual requirements.
As explained in previous years, the changes in the pension scheme regulations which came into effect on 6 April 2006 have affected the Companys provision of pension scheme benefits to the Chief Executive.
The Company has maintained his historic pension framework and paid an equivalent contribution of 30% of salary directly to RT Wiseman from which he can make his own retirement provision.
The Company is not responsible for compensating for changes in personal tax liability.
Pensions Ongoing Review The final element of the Committees ongoing review described on page F8 is an assessment of the pension benefits provided to the Executive Directors.
This part of the process is designed to assess whether the levels of Company contribution are fair and reasonable when compared to other similar organisations although it should be noted that any decisions made in relation to such contributions will take into account the total value and cost of the Executive Directors remuneration packages.
Performance Review The graph below shows the Companys performance, measured by TSR, compared with the performance of the FTSE Food Producers Index also measured by TSR both rebased to 100.
The FTSE Food Producers Index has been selected for this comparison because it is a broad equity market index comprising many of the companies against which the Group benchmarks its performance internally.

Depending on the circumstances of termination, the Executive Director may be entitled, or the Committee may exercise its discretion to allow the Executive Director, to exercise a proportion of their outstanding awards under long-term incentive arrangements but only to the extent that any applicable performance conditions have been met.
The Committees policy on early termination is to emphasise the duty of the terminated party to mitigate any loss caused by the early termination to the fullest extent practicable.
With the exception of the Chairman, Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts or notice periods although under the Companys Articles of Association all Directors must retire by rotation and seek re-election at least every three years.

The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Committee, based on external advice and a review of current practices in other companies.
Non-executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Companys long-term incentive arrangements and are not entitled to a bonus or pension contributions.
The basic fee paid to each Non-executive Director, excluding the Chairman, in the year was 32,000 2008: 30,000.
NL Murray, as Senior Independent Non-executive Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee received a further payment at a rate of 7,000 2008: 7,000 per annum.

2 Fees for the services of EJ Finch and NL Murray as Non-executive Directors were paid to DFA Solutions Ltd and Ettrick Management Services respectively.
Basic salary is the only component of the remuneration package which is pensionable.
As in the prior year, some of the Executive Directors have agreed with their employing company that they will give up their rights to part of their basic salary and part of or the whole of their annual bonus payments in order for supplementary pension contributions to be made to a personal pension plan.
The supplementary contributions on salary amounted to 95,000 2008: 100,000 in the case of WG Keane and 28,195 2008: 20,301 in the case of D Dobbins.
For the sake of simplicity, and to allow a valid comparison to be made with the basic salary and bonus figures paid in prior years, the amounts of these supplementary pension contributions have been included in the fees basic salary columns of the preceding table, as appropriate.
As on page F13, changes in pension scheme regulations affected the Companys provision of pension scheme benefits to the Chief Executive, RT Wiseman.
In order to allow a valid comparison to be made with the basic salary and pension payment figures paid in prior years, the amount of the equivalent contribution which has been paid directly to RT Wiseman from which he can make his own retirement provision has been included in the pension payment table on page F17 rather than the table of Directors emoluments above.

GENERAL iNFoRmATioN Robert Wiseman Dairies PLC is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is given on the inside back cover of this document.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in Note 3 and in the Business and Financial Review on pages 8 to 13.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in the issue but not yet effective: IFRS 1 amended IAS 27 amended Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate IFRS 2 amended Share-based Payment Vesting Conditions and Cancellations IFRS 3 revised 2008 Business Combinations IFRS 8 Operating Segments IAS 1 revised 2007 Presentation of Financial Statements IAS 23 revised 2007 Borrowing Costs IAS 27 revised 2008 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements IAS 32 amended IAS 1 amended Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 1 of the EU IAS Regulation.
In their consideration of going concern, the Directors have reviewed the Groups cashflow forecasts and associated risks: these forecasts extend for a period beyond one year from the date of approval of these financial statements.
Additional details are set out on page F7.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.
SiGNiFiCANT ACCoUNTiNG PoLiCiES The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments in accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results, cash flows and financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year to 4 April 2009.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
All intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation.
No income statement is presented for Robert Wiseman Dairies PLC, as provided by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
The Companys profit for the financial year, determined in accordance with the Act was 59,310,000 2008 loss: 13,000.
The separate financial statements of the Company, excluding the Income Statement, are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985.
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and on the historical cost basis.
The principal accounting policies adopted are the same as those set out in this note.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Robert Wiseman Dairies F24 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 2.
SiGNiFiCANT ACCoUNTiNG PoLiCiES CoNTiNUED Goodwill continued Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal, but is recorded as a movement on reserves.
Revenue Recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the date of acquisition or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly through the income statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Foreign Currencies Transactions in currencies other than pounds Sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation of monetary items are included in net profit or loss for the period.
The transactions referred to are primarily purchases of plant and equipment along with packaging materials.
These represent non-monetary assets which were recorded at the historic rate and are not re-translated.
Borrowing Costs All borrowing costs are recognised in the profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Operating Profit Operating profit is stated after any gains on the sale of property but before investment income and finance costs.
Retirement Benefit Costs The Group operates a Group Personal Pension Scheme and a small defined contribution pension scheme.
Contributions to these schemes are charged as an expense in the period during which they fall due.
The Group was responsible for the Aberdeen Milk Services Limited Pension Scheme which is a hybrid scheme: however, the Scheme commenced a wind up process on 23 October 2007 following transfer of the liability to Legal & General.
Further details are set out in Note 33.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or negative goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is dealt with in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Deferred tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

SiGNiFiCANT ACCoUNTiNG PoLiCiES CoNTiNUED Property, Plant and Equipment Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in the balance sheet at their historical cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
Properties in the course of construction for production or administrative purposes, or for purposes not yet determined, are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
All other tangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Buildings 2%-4% Plant and machinery 10%-33% Motor vehicles 10%-20% Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Software Development Costs An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Groups software development is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: An asset is created that can be separately identified such as software and new processes : It is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and The development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of 3 to 5 years.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets Excluding Goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cashgenerating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Other intangible assets are recognised if it is probable that there will be future economic benefits attributable to the asset, the cost of the asset can be measured reliably, the asset is separately identifiable and there is control over the use of the asset.
Where the Group acquires a business, other intangible assets such as customer lists are identified and evaluated to determine the carrying value on the acquisition balance sheet.
Other intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of between 1 and 10 years.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs comprise direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the First In First Out method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Trade Receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Financial Instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Robert Wiseman Dairies F26 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 2.
SiGNiFiCANT ACCoUNTiNG PoLiCiES CoNTiNUED Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other Financial Liabilities Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Trade Payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates.
The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge these exposures.
Such derivatives are initially recorded at cost, if any, and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Changes in the fair value of hedges and derivative financial instruments are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Share-based Payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of the grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value of share options is measured using either the Black Scholes model or a Monte Carlo Simulation dependent upon whether the shares have an external criterion or not.
Fair value of LTIPs is measured using the Binomial model.
A liability equal to the portion of the goods or services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date for cash settled share-based payments.
The Group estimates the expected value of share-based payments and this is charged through the income statement over the vesting period of the relevant instrument.
The valuations are calculated using either the Black Scholes method or a Monte Carlo Simulation dependent upon whether the shares have an external performance criterion or not.
These valuations are based upon a number of assumptions which are detailed in Note 32 and amended only to take account of the estimated levels of share vesting and exercise.
Any changes in these assumptions over the period of vesting can affect the actual number of shares which vest and are exercised at the end of the vesting period.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Key Estimations and Assumptions The Group has used estimates and assumptions in arriving at certain figures within the financial statements.
The resulting accounting estimates may not equate with the actual results, which will only be known in time.
Those areas believed to be key areas of estimation are noted below, with further details of the assumptions used listed at the relevant note.

Robert Wiseman Dairies F32 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 14.
GooDWiLL CoNTiNUED The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
Given the current volatility in the debt and equity markets, this has led to an increase in the cost of capital and therefore the discount rate applied to future cash flows has increased from 7.9% in 2008 to 8.4% in 2009.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts of 0.7% growth in liquid milk sales volume.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management and extrapolates cash flows based on a changing dynamic in the way in which consumers purchase milk.
This rate varies dependent on the market in which the customers operate.
The present value of the cash flows is then compared to the carrying value of the asset.
The fair value of goodwill is substantially in excess of book value in both 2008 and 2009.
The Directors have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions that would have caused an impairment write down to be recorded at the year end.

The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The Group has a large percentage of business and trade receivables concentrated in a small number of customers.
The credit risk associated with the Groups trade receivables balance is limited as the customers are either large corporations with high credit ratings or the Group has credit insurance in place to mitigate the risk of exposure.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.

An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods of 1.0 million 2008: 1.0 million.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience and managements assessment of the current economic environment.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Robert Wiseman Dairies F34 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 18. oTHER FiNANCiAL ASSETS CoNTiNUED The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 25 days 2008: 25 days.
No interest has been charged on the receivables.
Provision is made for receivables which are over 60 days past due.
Trade receivables which are past due but less than 60 days past due are provided for on a specific invoice by invoice basis.
This is based on previous experience and factors relevant to the specific customer and invoice.
Before accepting any new customer, the Group assesses the potential customers credit quality and the potential credit limit of each customer.
New customers are subdivided into two groups, cash sales customers and credit accounts.
Cash sales customers settle their accounts in cash on a daily or weekly basis.
The quantities involved are usually small with minimal credit exposure for the Group.
Credit checks are not generally carried out on these customers unless payment is to be made by cheque rather than cash.
For credit accounts all customers are credit checked using external credit agencies.
Credit ratings are used to allocate a credit rating to each new account or when applicable decline credit.
For any customer seeking a credit level above 100,000 an application is made to a credit insurance provider for an authorised credit limit and once approved this would allow credit clearance up to the level agreed with the insurer.
Credit limits are reviewed on a weekly basis with changes to insurance limits being notified to the Group on a daily basis.
Of the trade receivables balance of 57,130,000 2008: 53,310,000, 37,594,000 2008: 23,691,000 is due from Tesco, Sainsbury, Iceland, Arla Foods, the Co-operative Group and Somerfield 2008: Tesco, Sainsbury, Iceland and Somerfield, each of whom represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
Within the Groups total trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 5,453,000 2008: 524,000 which are overdue for payment at the reporting date and which the Group has not made any provision for, on the basis that there has not been a change in the credit worthiness of the customer, and the Group considers that the amounts will be recovered.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The weighted average age of these receivables past due is 45 days 2008: 51 days.

After taking into consideration the interest rate swaps in place in 2009 20,073,000 of borrowings were arranged at fixed interest rates 2008: 10,000,000.
After taking into consideration the interest rate cap entered into by the Group, bank overdraft, loans and other loans of 10,000,000 had exposure to a maximum rate of 6.50%.
Other borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Directors estimate that the fair value of the Groups borrowings is not significantly different from the balance sheet values for all borrowings.
Liquidity Risk Management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors which has built appropriate processes and controls for monitoring and managing the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The main processes used by the Group to manage its liquidity risk are to maintain adequate reserves of cash, suitable banking facilities and available facilities.
The Group continuously monitors forecast and actual cashflows and as disclosed below the Group has suitable undrawn facilities to manage and further reduce the level of liquidity risk.
The other principal features of the Groups borrowings are as follows: i Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.
The average effective interest rate on bank overdrafts approximates 3.97% 2008: 6.25% per annum.
ii The Group has one principal bank loan of 35.0 million 2008: 40.0 million.
This loan was advanced on 27 March 2008 and is due for repayment in full on 1 November 2011.
The loan carries an interest rate at 0.5% above LIBOR 2008: 0.5% above LIBOR per annum.
As at 4 April 2009, the Group had available 65.0 million 2008: 46.6 million of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
Of the undrawn committed borrowing facilities 20.0 million expires in one year or less 2008: 11.6 million.
The disclosures in respect of the ageing of trade receivables are provided in Note 18.
The trade payables balance is due to be paid within one month of the year end.
Capital Risk Management The Group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, as detailed above, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Notes 25 to 29.

Twice a year the Group reports on the level of gearing to its shareholders as part of the reporting process.
Managements view on the current level of debt is detailed in the Chairmans statement on page 2 and the Business and Financial Review on page 12.
The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Borrowings 35,073 43,818 Cash and cash equivalents 9,287 4,284 Net debt 25,786 39,534 Equity 134,521 139,509 Net debt to equity ratio 19.2% 28.3% Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to equity holders of the parent.

DERiVATiVE FiNANCiAL iNSTRUmENTS Interest Rate Risk Management The Group is exposed to risk of fluctuations in interest rates as result of its level of borrowings in the current year and a significant amount of the borrowings have floating interest rates.
This risk is managed by the Group maintaining an appropriate level of fixed and floating rates which it does with the use of interest rate swap contracts.
In the current year, following an evaluation of the Groups borrowing requirement, the Group put in place a further 10.0 million interest rate swap in order to reduce the Groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and align the borrowings with the Groups risk appetite.
The Group shall continue to regularly evaluate its arrangements re interest rate swaps and hedging activities to ensure that these are aligned with the Group interest rate views and risk appetite.
The Groups exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities is detailed in the liquidity risk management section in Note 20.
Interest Rate Swaps The Group used interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings during 2008 and 2009.
On 25 June 2008 the Group entered into an interest rate swap with Clydesdale Bank with an effective date of 25 June 2008, for a period of 5 years.
On 20 November 2007 the Group entered into an interest rate swap with an effective date of 22 November 2007, for a period of 3 years.
Under these contracts the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
These contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of the variable rate debt held by the Group such as term loans, overdrafts etc.
The fair value of the interest rate swap at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract as disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based upon the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.

The Group shall settle the difference between the fixed swap rate and the notional LIBOR rate on a net basis.
This arrangement is designed to reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
Robert Wiseman Dairies Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements continued F37 22.
DERiVATiVE FiNANCiAL iNSTRUmENTS CoNTiNUED Interest Rate Cap In 2007 the Group entered into a 10,000,000 interest rate cap of 6.50%.
As at the year end and prior year end none of the Group borrowings were above the interest cap rate, and the fair value of the cap is considered to be nil.
Interest Rate Sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the Groups exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date.
In calculating the sensitivity management have assumed that for floating rate liabilities the amount of liability outstanding as at the balance sheet date is the same throughout the year.
When management have assessed interest rate risk they have assessed it based upon their best estimate of reasonably possible changes in interest rates which for the current year is 0.5%.
Had interest rates been 1.0% higher or lower whilst all other variables such as quantum of net debt were constant throughout the period, then the impact upon the Group profit for the 53 weeks ended 4 April 2009 would be 350,000 2008: 219,000.
The Groups sensitivity to interest rates has decreased during the current period as there has been a fall in borrowings through the period as a result of a fall in the capital expenditure programme along with the interest rate swap taken out in the current year.

SHARE-BASED PAYmENTS Equity-settled Share Option Plan The Group plan for share options, excluding the sharesave scheme, provides for a grant price equal to the average quoted market price of the Group shares over the three days prior to the date of grant.
The vesting period is generally three years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Furthermore, options generally lapse if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
The employee sharesave schemes are open to all employees and provide for a purchase price equal to the average market price on the three days prior to the date of invitation, less 20%.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 5.5 years from the date of grant, the options expire.

The options outstanding at 4 April 2009 had a weighted average exercise price of 3.256 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 6.0 years.
In the year ended 4 April 2009, options were granted on 18 June 2008, with the aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on that date being 750,000.
Share options have been granted under various employee schemes.
Under this scheme a maximum of 437,281 shares could be issued to participants in 2008 period from 30 March 2008 to 4 April 2009, 401,469 shares in 2009, 310,620 shares in 2010 and 484,696 in 2011, upon the achievement of prescribed performance criteria.
Under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP conditional awards of shares can be made to selected employees, including the Executive Directors but excluding the Chief Executive.
This scheme is intended to incentivise the participants to create shareholder value whilst retaining due focus on the underlying financial performance of the Group and to more closely align their interests with those of the shareholders.
The performance criteria that must be met in order for the award to vest are detailed on pages F11 and F12 of the Directors Remuneration Report.

SHARE-BASED PAYmENTS CoNTiNUED The options outstanding are as follows: 2009 2008 options options Outstanding LTIP options at beginning of year 1,149,370 1,281,505 Granted during the year 484,696 310,620 Exercised during the year 437,281 442,755 Lapsed during the year Outstanding at the end of the year 1,196,785 1,149,370 Exercisable at the end of the year The valuation of the LTIP scheme is calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation and the inputs into this model are as follows: 2009 2008 Weighted average share price 3.14 4.99 Weighted average exercise price nil nil Expected volatility 25.0 25.0 Expected life 3 years 3 years Risk-free rate % 5.70% 5.70% Expected dividend yields 2.50% 2.50% The inputs into the Black-Scholes model which apply to share options and the Share Incentive Plan are as follows: 2009 2008 Weighted average share price 3.14 4.99 Weighted average exercise price 3.14 4.99 Expected volatility 25.0 25.0 Expected life 3.2 years 3.2 years Risk-free rate % 5.70% 5.70% Expected dividend yields 2.50% 2.50% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous eight years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of 961,000 and 843,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions on share options in 2009 and 2008 respectively: 961,000 and 845,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions on share-based payments under the LTIP scheme in 2009 and 2008 respectively.
Other Share-based Payment Plans Share Incentive Plan In August 2002, the Group established an Inland Revenue Approved Share Incentive Plan SIP which came into operation on 1 May 2003.
During the year ended 2 April 2005, two different forms of awards were made under the SIP, both of which were available to all employees of the Group with continuous service of 3 months.
Under the Matching Share scheme, participants could contribute up to 125 per month towards the purchase of shares in the Company which were then matched on a 1 for 4 basis.
In addition, and in order to celebrate the 10th anniversary in 2004 of the Companys flotation in 1994, each eligible employee was offered the chance to apply for a one off award under the SIP of 100 Free Shares in the Company.
Shares acquired under both the Matching Share scheme and the Free Share award are solely conditional upon the relevant participant remaining in the Groups employment for three years from the date of award.
RETiREmENT BENEFiT SCHEmES Defined Contribution Schemes The Group operates a group personal pension scheme for its employees and a small defined contribution scheme.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The pension cost charged in respect of these schemes for the 53 weeks ended 4 April 2009 was 1,997,000 2008: 1,581,000.
Contributions, including employee contributions, due but not yet paid in respect of the current reporting period amounted to 258,000 2008: 212,000.
Defined Benefit Schemes Following the acquisition of Aberdeen Milk Services Limited in May 1999, the Group assumed responsibility for the Aberdeen Milk Services Limited Pension Scheme.
In the prior year the Group sought to transfer the responsibility for the liability and on 23 October 2007 the pension scheme wind up was triggered.
The Trustees accepted a quote from Legal & General L&G on 30 November 2007 and locked into the assumptions used by L&G at that date.
Assets of 5,421,990 were received by L&G on 5 December 2007.
L&G assumed the mortality risk for the deferred pensioners from 30 November 2007 and for the pensioners from 1 November 2008.
Whilst the assets transferred in the prior year, the final settlement and consequent wind-up of the Scheme cannot occur until all parties have confirmed the pension obligations.
Robert Wiseman Dairies Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements continued F43 33.
RETiREmENT BENEFiT SCHEmES CoNTiNUED As in the prior year, at the year end, the liabilities have therefore been taken as the value at the year end date of the assets transferred to L&G resulting in a zero net balance sheet position.
Although there may be a further payment to L&G this is unlikely to be material for the purposes of these Group accounts.

CoNTiNGENT LiABiLiTY Office of Fair Trading OFT In December 2007 the Company entered into an Early Resolution Agreement with the OFT in relation to its investigation into Dairy Retail Prices under Chapter I of the Competition Act 1998 the Agreement.
The Company, and other parties, were subject to a provisional finding by the OFT in respect of the disclosure of commercially sensitive retail pricing intentions in respect of fresh liquid milk in 2003 the 2003 Retail Price Initiative.
The matters reviewed by the OFT related to Retail Price Initiatives which resulted in additional monies being returned to farmers.
The Companys support for the 2003 Retail Price Initiative was driven by a wish to provide support for its farmer suppliers.
All monies paid to the Company following the Retail Price Initiatives were returned to farmers and no profit was generated by the Company from such initiatives.
Further to entering into the Agreement the Company reached a settlement with the OFT.
As part of this settlement the Company agreed to pay a sum of 6.1 million and as a result the OFT resolved its investigation in relation to Wiseman, on condition it continues to provide full co-operation to the OFT.
The sum of 6.1 million represents an imposed penalty of 9.4 million less a 35% discount for co-operation: the Company intends to continue to co-operate fully with the OFT and as such the Company considers that 6.1 million accurately reflects the amount of money that shall be paid, with the balance of 3.3 million representing a contingent liability.
