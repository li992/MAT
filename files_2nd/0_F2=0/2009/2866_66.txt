On occasion where there is a commercial driver to do so, the Group will take an equity holding in a Corporate Member a limited liability company operating in the Lloyds market.

This was exacerbated by unprecedented market turmoil post the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
Since the suspension, CFM, has been working with specialist advisers to conduct a detailed review of the underlying assets of the OEICs and options for their future.
This review was completed in December 2009.
The underlying assets of the OEICs have fallen in value and remain illiquid.
CFM has advised investors that the only feasible option in the best interests of investors as a whole is for the OEICs to be wound up, with the underlying assets being realised in an orderly manner over a period of time, and the proceeds being returned to investors in the OEICs.
In addition, CFM has informed investors in the OEICs that it is undertaking a review to determine whether such investors have suffered any detriment and, if so, to what extent any of the parties involved should be responsible for compensating them.
This is a complex exercise and it is taking longer than anticipated, but we are determined to ensure that the matter is concluded in a way that takes appropriate account of the results of the review and the interests of investors in the OEICs, but also recognises the interests of Capitas shareholders.
The detailed work undertaken since March 2009 has resulted in significant costs.
We have set aside estimated costs of 30m both incurred and potentially to be incurred in respect of resolving this matter.
This figure has been disclosed separately from the Groups underlying profit in our accounts for the year ended 31 December 2009.
It is expected that an outcome will be reached in 2010.
