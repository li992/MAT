The exceptional credit recognised during the year to 31st January, 2009 of 130,000 is the release of a restructuring provision see note 21 that is no longer required.
During the year to 26th January, 2008 the Atherton production sites activities were scaled down in advance of the site closure.
During the closure period a new can line was installed at the Cumbernauld production site.
Due to technical difficulties with the commissioning of the line the Atherton site remained operational longer than had been planned, resulting in excess costs of 440,000.
A further 47,000 was incurred in moving the IT infrastructure out of Atherton and into the Cumbernauld facility.
An impairment charge of 96,000 was recognised in respect of a bottling line at the Pitcox production site in addition to redundancy costs of 56,000 relating to the site.
These exceptional costs were offset by the release of 171,000 of the restructuring provision see note 21 no longer required.

The Vitsmart and Vitaminsmart brands were acquired in the year to 26th January, 2008 with 15,000 of goodwill provisionally being recognised on the acquisition.
The adjustment of 3,000 to the goodwill cost has arisen due to the finalisation of the costs for the acquisition of the Vitsmart and Vitaminsmart brands.
During the year to 31st January, 2009 further negotiations took place over the purchase price of the Vitsmart and Vitaminsmart brands.
The initial purchase price, including legal fees, was 390,000 due to be paid over a period of three years.
Subsequent negotiations with the seller resulted in the purchase being completed in April 2008 for a total reduced consideration, including legal fees, of 290,000.
This has resulted in a 100,000 reduction in the carrying value of the Brands balance.
The opening customer relationships balance was an intangible asset recognised on the acquisition of the Strathmore Water business.
The amortisation charge represents the spreading of the cost over the duration of the contractual period and has a further estimated life of three years.
The amortisation costs for the year have been included in the administration costs for the two years presented.
66 Annual Report and Accounts January 2009 Accounts Notes to the accounts 10 Intangible assets continued Impairment tests for goodwill and brands For impairment testing, goodwill and brands are allocated to the cash generating unit CGU at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each unit are: 2009 2008 Goodwill Brands Water rights Total Goodwill Brands Water rights Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Groupe Rubicon Limited 21,036 42,986 64,022 Strathmore operating unit 1,902 7,000 8,902 1,902 7,000 8,902 Findlays operating unit 742 742 742 742 Taut operating unit 318 318 Vitsmart operating unit 18 290 308 15 390 405 Total 23,274 50,276 742 74,292 1,917 7,390 742 10,049 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use a pre-tax cash flow projection based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three year period.
Cash flows beyond the three years are extrapolated using the growth rates stated below: Growth rate Discount rate Key assumptions % % Groupe Rubicon Limited 2.25 8.63 Strathmore operating unit 8.63 Findlays operating unit 4.00 8.63 Taut operating unit 2.25 8.63 The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The discount rates used are pre-tax.
The impairment of the water rights arose following declining volumes in the sales of Findlays water.
The decline was anticipated following the decision to change the focus for the Pitcox production site to the filling of 19 litre water containers.
Further reductions in the water markets have resulted in a lower return on the investment in the water rights resulting in the recognition of an impairment in the carrying value of 742,000.
No other class of asset other than the water rights was impaired.
The carrying amount of the Findlays segment has been reduced to its recoverable amount through the recognition of an impairment charge of the water rights.
This impairment loss has been included in the administration costs in the income statement.
If the budgeted gross margin used in the value-in-use calculation for the Findlays CGU had been 10% lower than managements estimates at 31st January, 2009, the group would have recognised a further impairment of the water rights by a further 114,000.
If the estimated pre-tax discount rate applied to the discounted cash flows for the Findlays CGU had been 1% higher than managements estimates, at 9.63% rather than 8.63%, the group would have recognised a further impairment of the water rights of 16,000.

Trade and other payables are detailed in note 20.
The hedging derivative is an interest rate swap and is accounted for under hedge accounting.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months.
At 31st January, 2009 the financial instrument liability represented an interest rate swap relating to the outstanding borrowings at that date.
The balance of the swap was classified as a non-current liabilities in line with the expected maturity of the borrowings see note 18.
No ineffectiveness from the interest rate swap was recognised in the income statement during the year.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31st January, 2009 were 29,250,000.
Gains and losses recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve on interest rate swap contracts as of 31st January, 2009 will be continuously released to the income statement until the repayment of the bank borrowings note 18.
As the closing interest rate swap at 31st January, 2009 is a liability there is no credit risk at the reporting date.
Cash and cash equivalents held by the group have an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair values.

The land and buildings qualifies as an asset classified as held for sale.
Despite the downturn in the property market, management are confident that they will be able to dispose of the property for proceeds in excess of the carrying value.
The Pitcox production site changed its focus to the filling of 19 litre water containers in the year to 26th January, 2008.
This resulted in a bottling line at the site being taken out of use during the year and transferred to assets available for sale.
The assets were sold shortly after 26th January, 2008 for 46,000 resulting in an impairment charge being recognised in the year to 26th January, 2008.
The disposal for no gain or loss was recorded in the results for the year to 31st January, 2009.
There are no other assets or liabilities associated with the non-current assets held for sale other than a government grant of 59,000 held in respect of the Atherton site.
This deferred credit was previously released in line with the depreciation rate for the property whilst the site was in use.
As the site is no longer being depreciated the grant is no longer being released.
This will be released to the income statement on the sale of the Atherton site as part of the gain on disposal.

Taut incurred a net loss of 1,374,000 for the 13 months to January 2008, prior to the acquisition by the group.

K. Limited is a trading subsidiary of Taut International Limited.
Taut U. K. Limited formed part of the acquisition detailed above.
It has tax losses of approximately 4,457,000.
Under IFRS 3 a deferred tax asset should be recognised if A. G. BARR p. l. c. can use the unrelieved tax losses.
At the date of approval of these statements the management of A. G. BARR p. l. c. was unable to conclude with reasonable certainty that the tax losses can be utilised and therefore the group has not recognised a deferred tax asset at the Balance Sheet date in respect of these losses.
The unrecognised deferred tax asset would be approximately 1,248,000.

For both acquisitions made in the year the value recognised as goodwill is the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature are included in the goodwill recognised.
These include an assembled workforce, the anticipated synergies expected to arise from the combination and for Groupe Rubicon the favourable market position it enjoys.
