Credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables relating to tenants but also from the Groups holdings of assets with counterparties such as cash deposits, loans and derivative instruments.
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed: tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously monitor and work with tenants, anticipating and, wherever possible, identifying and addressing risks prior to default.
Prospective tenants are assessed via a review process, including obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information which is conducted internally.
As a result deposits or guarantors may be obtained.
The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2009 is 2.2 million 2008 0.8 million.
Due to the nature of tenants being managed individually by asset managers, it is Group policy to calculate any impairment specifically on each contract.
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables is as follows: Group Group 2009 2008 m m Up to three months 15.0 11.9 Three to six months 1.3 0.9 Greater than six months 1.3 0.8 Trade receivables 17.6 13.6 In 2009 trade receivables impaired amounted to 3.7 million 2008 9.7 million, this is considered to be an immaterial amount and within budgeted levels given current economic conditions.
