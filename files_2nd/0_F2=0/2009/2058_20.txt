118 Financial Statements Supplementary information gas and oil unaudited On 20 December 2007, BG Group ceased to be a United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC registered company and the Groups SEC reporting obligations also ceased with effect from that date.
BG Group continues voluntarily to use the SEC definition of proved reserves to report proved gas and oil reserves and disclose certain unaudited supplementary information detailed on pages 119 to 125.
BG Group also now uses SEC definitions introduced by the SEC in 2009 for probable reserves.
BG Groups strategy aims to connect competitively priced gas to high-value markets.
Hydrocarbon reserves, and gas in particular, are developed in relation to the markets that they are intended to supply.
Information in this section is therefore grouped as shown below to reflect the nature of the markets supplied by BG Group.
UK Atlantic Basin Canada, Egypt, Nigeria, Trinidad and Tobago and the USA Asia and the Middle East Areas of Palestinian Authority, Australia, China, India, Kazakhstan, Oman and Thailand Rest of the World Algeria, Bolivia, Brazil, Italy, Libya, Madagascar, Norway and Tunisia Dr Richard Wheaton, as BG Groups Head of Corporate Reserves Group, has primary responsibility for overseeing the preparation and review of all reserves and resources disclosures.
He has a degree in Chemistry, a PhD in Chemical Physics and has been a petroleum engineer for 30 years.
He has been involved in reserves estimation for 15 years and Head of Corporate Reserves Group for the last five years.
Total additions and revisions to proved reserves during the year were 376 mmboe.
This includes revisions due to new data and improved reservoir performance 342 mmboe increase, developments and sales 140 mmboe increase, acquisitions and disposals 97 mmboe increase and the net effect of price movements 203 mmboe decrease.
Production in the period was 234.9 mmboe.
Gas and oil reserves cannot be measured exactly since estimation of reserves involves subjective judgement.
Therefore, all estimates are subject to revision.
Changes in gas and oil prices in fields subject to Production Sharing Contracts PSCs may result in changes to entitlements and therefore proved reserves.
Proved reserves BG Group utilises the SEC definition of proved reserves.
Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, that, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations.
Proved developed reserves are those reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells and with existing equipment and operating methods.
Proved undeveloped reserves comprise total proved reserves less total proved developed reserves.
Probable reserves BG Group adopted the SEC definition of probable reserves in 2009.
Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.
Probable developed reserves are those reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells and with existing equipment and operating methods.
Probable undeveloped reserves comprise total probable reserves less total probable developed reserves.
Discovered resources Discovered resources are defined by BG Group as the best estimate of recoverable hydrocarbons where commercial and or technical maturity is such that project sanction is not expected within the next three years.
Risked exploration Risked exploration resources are defined by BG Group as the best estimate mean value of recoverable hydrocarbons in a prospect multiplied by the chance of success.

Future cash inflows have been computed by reference to the Groups estimate of future production of net proved gas and oil reserves at the end of each year and estimates of third-party prices.
2009 prices are calculated using a 12-month average price in line with the revised SEC methodology effective for the year ended 31 December 2009.
Prior year prices include calculations based on year end prices for 2008 and 2007.
The standardised measure of discounted future net cash flow information presented below is not intended to represent the replacement cost or fair market value of the Groups gas and oil properties.
The disclosures shown are based on estimates of proved reserves, future production schedules and costs, which are inherently imprecise and subject to revision.
