21 Acquisitions There were no acquisitions in 2009, but the following acquisition was made in 2008.
Logipard AB On 16 December 2008, the Group purchased the entire share capital of Logipard AB Logipard, a video IP company incorporated in Sweden for total consideration of 5.7 million, comprising 5.5 million cash consideration and 0.2 million of related acquisition expenses.
This purchase has been accounted for as an acquisition.
Logipard develops power-efficient video encode and decode acceleration technologies for the mobile and consumer markets and enables ARM to bring to market the ARM Mali-five multi standard video engine family of products.
The acquisition adds world class video and imaging technology to the ARM portfolio, making ARM the only IP provider with the in-depth experience and understanding required to meet the market need for an entire range of system elements, from memory controllers, interconnect, application and embedded processors to graphics processors, video engines, physical IP and embedded firmware.
For the reasons given above, combined with the ability to hire the entire workforce of Logipard and synergistic benefits that may arise, the Group paid a premium on the Logipard acquisition, giving rise to goodwill.
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
At 31 December 2008, the accounting for the Logipard acquisition was determined on a provisional basis because the fair values assigned to the acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities were only provisional.
At 31 December 2009, final adjustments to these provisional values had been recognised as a result of completing work on the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired.
As these adjustments are not considered material, they have been recognised in the current year.
