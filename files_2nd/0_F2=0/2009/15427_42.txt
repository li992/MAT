Retirement benefit schemes Retirement benefit obligation comprises gross pension liability of 406.4m 2008: 277.2m and gross post-retirement healthcare liability of 2.9m 2008: 2.6m.
The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
In the UK, the Taylor Woodrow Group Pension and Life Assurance Fund TWGP&LAF and the George Wimpey Staff Pension Scheme GWSPS are funded defined benefit schemes.
The Taylor Woodrow NHS Pension Scheme TWNHSPS, which was also a defined benefit scheme, was disposed of as part of the disposal of the Construction business on 9 September 2008.
The TWGP&LAF merged with the Bryant Group Pension Scheme BGPS on 24 June 2002 and with the Wilson Connolly Holdings Pension Scheme WCHPS, the Wainhomes Ltd Pension Scheme WHLPS and the Prestoplan Pension Scheme PPS on 27 August 2004.
These schemes are managed by boards of trustees.
The Groups defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants.
The TWGP&LAF was closed to future pension accrual with effect from 30 November 2006.
An alternative Defined Contribution arrangement, the Taylor Wimpey Personal Choice Plan, is offered to new employees and from 1 December 2006 to employees who previously accrued benefits in the TWGP&LAF.
Legacy George Wimpey staff are members of a UK Stakeholder arrangement.
The Group also operates a number of small overseas pension schemes including defined benefit schemes in the US and Canada.
Of the defined benefit pension scheme net deficit of 406.4m 2008: 277.2m at 31 December 2009, 401.4m 2008: 268.3m related to the TWGP&LAF and GWSPS schemes in the UK and 5.0m 2008: 8.9m related to defined benefit schemes in the US and Canada.
The pension scheme assets of the Groups principal defined benefit pension schemes, TWGP&LAF and GWSPS are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The trustees of the schemes are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
The appointment of trustees is determined by each schemes trust documentation.
The Group has a policy that at least one-third of all trustees should be nominated by members of the scheme.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the TWGP&LAF was carried out at 1 June 2007.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the GWSPS was carried out at 31 March 2007.
The projected unit method was used in all valuations and assets were taken into account using market values.
The next formal valuations of the TWGP&LAF and GWSPS are taking place as at 31 March 2010.
The statutory funding objective is that each scheme has sufficient and appropriate assets to pay its benefits as they fall due.
The general principles adopted by the trustees will be that the assumptions used, taken as a whole, will be sufficiently prudent for pensions and benefits already in payment to continue to be paid, and to reflect the commitments which will arise from members accrued pension rights.
Contributions of 10.6m 2008: 8.9m were charged to income in respect of defined contribution schemes.
In 2008 the Group agreed revised funding schedules with the Trustees of both schemes under which the Group will make annual funding contributions of 20m over eight years in respect of the TWGP&LAF and 25m over 10 years in respect of the GWSPS.
Following the last valuation of the GWSPS, the ordinary contribution rate was set at 18% of pensionable salaries.
The main financial assumptions, which were used for the triennial funding valuation and are all relative to the inflation assumption, are as set out below: Assumptions TWGP&LAF GWSPS RPI inflation 3.15% 3.15% Discount rate pre post-retirement 5.60% 6.75%-4.75% General pay inflation 5.15% Real pension increases 0.00% 0.00% Valuation results TWGP&LAF GWSPS Market value of assets 764m 668m Past service liabilities 926m 883m Scheme funding levels 82% 76% The valuations of the Groups pension schemes have been updated to 31 December 2009 and the position of overseas schemes has been included within the IAS 19 disclosures.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of the disclosure items are as follows: United Kingdom North America 2009 2008 2009 2008 As at 31 December Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.70% 6.30% 5.94%-6.00% 5.80-7.00% Expected return on scheme assets 5.90%-6.20% 5.80-6.45% 6.50%-8.00% 5.50-8.00% General pay inflation 4.30% 4.30% 3.00%-3.50% 3.00% Deferred pension increases 3.30% 2.80% 0.00% 0.00% Pension increases 2.30%-3.20% 2.15-3.35% 0.00%-3.00% 0.00-3.00% The basis for the above assumptions are prescribed by IAS 19 and do not reflect the assumptions that may be used in future funding valuations of the Groups pension schemes.

The expected return on scheme assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the financial period for returns over the life of the related obligation.
The expected yield on bond investments with fixed interest rates can be derived exactly from their market value.
Some of these bond investments are issued by the UK Government.
The risk of default on these is very small.
The trustees also hold bonds issued by public companies.
There is a more significant risk of default on these which is assessed by various rating agencies.
The trustees also have a substantial holding of equity investments.
The investment return related to these is variable, and they are generally considered riskier investments.
It is generally accepted that the yield on equity investments will contain a premium, the equity risk premium, to compensate investors for the additional risk of holding this type of investment.
There is significant uncertainty about the likely size of this risk premium.
