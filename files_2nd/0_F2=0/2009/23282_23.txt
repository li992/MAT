Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 August 2009 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified to include the revaluation of investments and in accordance with the applicable UK Accounting Standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts issued in January 2009 and adopted early.
The early adoption of the January 2009 SORP had no effect on the financial statements of the Company, other than the requirement to separately disclose capital reserves that relate to the revaluation of investments held at the reporting date.
These are disclosed in note 13.
This new requirement replaces the previous requirement to disclose the value of the capital reserve that was unrealised.
They have also been prepared on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The Directors believe this is appropriate for the reasons outlined in the Directors Report on page 30.
The financial statements, and the net asset value per share figures, have been prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
b Investments Listed investments have been designated upon initial recognition as fair value through profit and loss.
Investments are recognised and fide-recognised on the trade date at cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments are valued at fair value, which for listed investments is deemed to be bid market prices.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included as a capital item in the Income Statement and are ultimately recognised in the capital reserve except to the extent where they are readily convertible to cash.
c Income Dividends other than special dividends, including taxes deducted at source, are included in revenue by reference to the date on which the investment is quoted ex-dividend.
Special dividends are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and may be credited to capital, if circumstances dictate.
Dividends receivable on equity shares where no exdividend date is quoted are brought into account when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Fixed returns on non-equity shares are recognised on a time-apportioned basis so as to reflect the effective yield on shares.
Other returns on non-equity are recognised when the right to return is established.
The fixed return on a debt security, if material, is recognised on a time apportioned basis so as to reflect the effective yield on each security.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of cash dividend is recognised in capital reserves.
Interest receivable on bank balances is dealt with on an accruals basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged through the revenue column of the Income Statement with the exception of expenses directly relating to the acquisition or disposal of an investment, in which case, they are added to the cost of the investment or deducted from the sale proceeds.
Such transaction costs are disclosed in accordance with the SORP.
These expenses are charged to the capital column of the Income Statement and are separately identified and disclosed in note 9. e Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences, that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay less tax in future have occurred at the Balance Sheet date, measured on an undiscounted basis and based on enacted tax rates.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the accounts which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue to meet the conditions required to obtain approval for the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
Edinburgh Dragon Trust plc 39 Notes to the Financial Statements continued f Capital reserves Gains and losses on investments and changes in fair values of investments which are readily convertible to cash, without accepting adverse terms, are transferred to the capital reserve.
g Foreign currency Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling on the Balance Sheet date.
Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Gains and losses on the realisation of foreign currencies are recognised in the Income Statement and are then transferred to the capital reserve.

The amount of any repayment of VAT for the Company is immaterial, and the Company has made no provision in these financial statements for any such repayment.
Capital management policies and procedures The Companys capital management objectives are: to ensure that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern: and to maximise the capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate balance of equity capital and debt.
The Board normally seeks to limit gearing to 20% of net assets.
The Board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes the nature and planned level of gearing, which takes account of the Managers views on the market, and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Company has no externally imposed capital requirements.
Edinburgh Dragon Trust plc 45 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 19.
Financial instruments Risk management The Companys financial instruments comprise securities and other investments, cash balances, loans and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations: for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement, and debtors for accrued income.
The Manager has a dedicated investment management process, which ensures that the investment policy explained on page 3 is followed.
Stock selection procedures are in place based on the active portfolio management and identification of stocks.
The portfolio is reviewed on a periodic basis by a Senior Investment Manager and also by the Managers Investment Committee.
The Companys Manager has an independent Investment Risk department for reviewing the investment risk parameters of the Companys portfolio on a regular basis.
The department reports to the Managers Performance Review Committee which is chaired by the Managers Chief Investment Officer.
The departments responsibility is to review and monitor exante predicted portfolio risk and style characteristics using best practice, industry standard multi-factor models.
Additionally, the Managers Compliance department continually monitors the trusts investment and borrowing powers and reports to the Managers Risk Management Committee.
The main financial risks that the Company faces from its financial instruments are market price risk comprising interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks.
The Managers policies for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the year.
The numerical disclosures exclude shortterm debtors and creditors.
Market price risk The fair value of or future cash flows from a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk.
Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect : the level of income receivable on cash deposits: interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment and borrowing decisions.
Interest risk profile The interest rate risk profile of the portfolio of the Companys financial assets and liabilities, excluding equity holdings which are all non-interest bearing, at the Balance Sheet date was as follows: Weighted average Weighted period for which average Fixed Floating rate is fixed interest rate rate rate At 31 August 2009 Years % 000 000 Assets Hong Kong Dollar 1,227 UK Sterling 0.25 235 Taiwanese Dollar 64 US Dollar 1,782 n a n a 3,308 46 Edinburgh Dragon Trust plc Weighted average Weighted period for which average Fixed Floating rate is fixed interest rate rate rate Years % 000 000 At 31 August 2008 Assets UK Sterling 4.75 2,369 Taiwanese Dollar 10 US Dollar 2.18 12,690 Certificates of deposit US Dollar 0.29 2.81 27,419 n a n a 27,419 15,069 Liabilities Bank loan US Dollar 0.33 7.26 43,861 The weighted average interest rate is based on the current yield of each asset, weighted by its market value.
The weighted average interest rate on bank loans is based on the interest rate payable, weighted by the total value of the loans.
The Companys Loan Notes were repaid on 30 December 2008.
The floating rate assets consist of cash deposits on call earning interest at prevailing market rates.
The Companys equity portfolio and short-term debtors and creditors excluding bank loans have been excluded from the above tables.
Interest rate sensitivity Movements in interest rates would not significantly affect net assets attributable to the Companys shareholders and total profit.
Foreign currency risk All of the Companys investment portfolio is invested in overseas securities and the Balance Sheet, therefore, can be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
It is not the Companys policy to hedge this risk on a continuing basis but the Company may, from time to time, match specific overseas investments with foreign currency borrowings.
The Companys borrowings, as detailed in note 11, are also in foreign currency.
The revenue account is subject to currency fluctuation arising on dividends paid in foreign currencies.
The Company does not hedge this currency risk.
Foreign currency sensitivity There is no sensitivity analysis included, as the Companys significant foreign currency financial instruments are in the form of equity investments, which have been included within the other price risk sensitivity analysis, so as to show the overall level of exposure.
Other price risk Other price risks ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted investments.
It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular country or sector.
Both the allocation of assets and the stock selection process, as detailed on page 13, act to reduce market risk.
The Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to review investment strategy.
The investments held by the Company are listed on various stock exchanges worldwide.
Other price risk sensitivity If market prices at the Balance Sheet date had been 10% higher or lower while all other variables remained constant, the return attributable to Ordinary shareholders for the year ended 31 August 2009 would have increased decreased by 41,077,000 2008 increased decreased by 37,817,000 and equity reserves would have increased decreased by the same amount.
Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk is not considered to be significant, as the Companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions, and reviews these on a regular basis.
Borrowings comprise a revolving multi-currency credit facility.
The Board has imposed a maximum gearing level, measured on the most stringent basis of calculation after netting off cash equivalents, of 20%.
Details of borrowings at 31 August 2009 are shown in note 11.
48 Edinburgh Dragon Trust plc Liquidity risk is not considered to be significant as the Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of loan and overdraft facilities, details of which can be found in note 11.
Under the terms of the loan facility, the Investment Manager provides the lender with loan covenant reports on a monthly basis, to provide the lender with assurance that the terms of the facility are not being breached.
The Investment Manager will also review the credit rating of a lender on a regular basis.
Details of the Boards policy on gearing are shown in the interest rate risk section of this note.
Liquidity risk exposure The Companys US$80 million of Loan Notes was repaid on 30 December 2008.
At 31 August 2009 the Company had no borrowings 2008 43,861,000. Credit risk This is the risk of failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction that could result in the Company suffering a loss.
The risk is not considered to be significant, and is actively managed as follows: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit-standing is reviewed periodically by the Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: the risk of counterparty exposure due to failed trades causing a loss to the Company is mitigated by the review of failed trade reports on a monthly basis.
In addition, the Custodian carries out a stock reconciliation to third party administrators records on a monthly basis to ensure discrepancies are picked up on a timely basis.
The Managers Compliance department carries out periodic reviews of the Custodians operations and reports its finding to the Managers Risk Management Committee.
This review will also include checks on the maintenance and security of investments held: cash is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit enhancements.
None of the Companys financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
Credit risk exposure In summary, compared to the amounts in the Balance Sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 August was as follows: 2009 2008 Balance Maximum Balance Maximum Sheet exposure Sheet exposure Current assets 000 000 000 000 Loans and receivables 1,371 1,371 2,614 2,614 Cash at bank and in hand 3,308 3,308 15,069 15,069 Certificates of deposit 27,419 27,419 4,679 4,679 45,102 45,102 None of the Companys financial assets is past due or impaired.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The Companys Loan Notes were repaid on 30 December 2008.
For the prior year the fair value of borrowings US$80,000,000 had been calculated at 44,984,000 as at 31 August 2008 compared to an accounts value in the financial statements of 43,861,000 note 11.
Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 31 August was as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 In less than one year 43,861 Edinburgh Dragon Trust plc 49
