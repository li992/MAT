FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS RISK PROFILE Market Risks The potential market risks are i currency risk, ii interest risk, and iii other price risk.
Each considered in turn below.
i Currency Risk The Company invests in global equity markets and therefore is exposed to currency risks as it affects the value of the shares in the base currency.
These currency exposures are not hedged.
Currency exposures for the Company as at 31 December 2009 are detailed in the table at the end of this note.
ii Interest Rate Risk The Company is typically fully invested in global equities but will from time to time hold interest bearing assets.
These assets are cash balances that earn interest at a floating rate and UK Treasury Bills when large amounts of cash are held.
At the year end the Companys only interest bearing investments were the Ensyn Corporation, Emergya and Turbo Power Systems but a very limited amount of income is receivable on these investments.
The Company does not have interest bearing liabilities.
iii Other Price Risk The principal price risk for the Company is the price volatility of shares that are owned by the Company.
The Company is well diversified across different sub-sectors and geographies and has a volatility level similar to global stock market indices such as the MSCI World Index to which the Company has an expected tracking error of 10%.
The historic 3-year volatility of the Company to 31 December 2009 is 22%.
