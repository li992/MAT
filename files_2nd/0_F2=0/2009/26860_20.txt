The Mercantile Investment Trust plc formerly JPMorgan Fleming Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 33 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31st January 2009 1.
Accounting Policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in January 2009.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investments at fair value.
The Company has a dormant, wholly owned subsidiary Mercantile Management Limited.
Consolidated accounts have not been prepared as exemption under S229 of the Companies Act 1985 has been exercised due to the immateriality of the subsidiary.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off to capital at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value which is bid market price for listed investments.
Unlisted and restricted investments are valued at fair value by the Board.
In making its valuations, the Board takes into account, where appropriate, latest dealing prices, valuations from reliable sources, asset values and other relevant factors.
Changes in the fair value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss and gains and losses on sales are included in capital within Losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Gains and losses on sales of investments and exchange differences of a capital nature are accounted in capital reserves within Gains on sales of investments.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end are accounted for in capital reserves within Investment holding losses.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in the revenue column of the income statement on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in the capital column.
UK dividends are included net of any tax credits.
Overseas dividends are included gross of any withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in the revenue column of the income statement.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in the capital column.
Interest receivable from debt securities, together with any premiums or discounts on purchase, are allocated to the revenue column on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective interest rate of those securities.
Deposit interest receivable is taken to the revenue column on an accruals basis.
Stock lending income and underwriting commission are taken to the revenue column on a receipts basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to the revenue column of the income statement with the following exceptions: management fees are allocated 50% to the revenue column and 50% to the capital column in line with the Boards expected long term split of revenue and capital return from the Companys investment portfolio.
expenses incidental to the purchase and sale of an investment are charged to the capital column.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and comprise brokerage commission and stamp duty.
Details of transaction costs are given in note 10 on page 39.
34 The Mercantile Investment Trust plc formerly JPMorgan Fleming Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued e Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Finance costs are allocated 50% to the revenue column of the income statement and 50% to the capital column in line with the Boards expected long term split of revenue and capital return from the Companys investment portfolio.
Breakage costs incurred on the early repayment of loans are charged 100% to the capital column in accordance with the SORP.
f Financial instruments Cash at bank and in hand may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other receivables and payables do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The debentures in issue, bank loans and overdrafts are classified as loans and receivables and are measured at amortised cost.
They are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance costs, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method.
g Taxation Deferred tax is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Tax relief is allocated to expenses charged to the capital column of the income statement on the marginal basis.
On this basis, if taxable income is capable of being entirely offset by revenue expenses, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital column.
h VAT Irrecoverable VAT is expensed to capital or income in the proportions in which it has been suffered.
The basis on which it has been calculated is the partial exemption method using the proportion of taxable supplies to non taxable supplies.
Further information regarding VAT on management fees is given in note 4 on page 36. i Foreign currency In accordance with FRS23: The effects of changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that sterling is the functional currency.
Sterling is the also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets, liabilities and equity investments held at fair value, denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising on monetary assets from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in revenue or capital, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.
Gains and losses on investments arising from a change in exchange rates are included in gains from investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
j Dividends payable In accordance with FRS 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends are included in the accounts in the year in which they are paid.

This has arisen from deductible expenses exceeding taxable income.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future.
Given the Companys status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust the Company invests in equities for the long term so as secure its investment objective stated on page 17.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These financial risks include market risk comprising interest rate risk and market price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these financial risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close cooperation with the Board and the Manager, coordinates the Companys risk management.
The Company has no material exposure to foreign currencies.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys classes of financial instruments are as follows: investments in equity shares, which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: and debentures issued by the Company, the purpose of which is to finance the Companys operations.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises two elements interest rate risk and market price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these two elements of market risk is given in parts i and ii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, which policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and the interest payable on variable rate borrowings when interest rates are re-set.
Interest rate exposure The two series of debentures issued by the Company both carry fixed rates of interest and were issued as a planned level of gearing.
This debenture stock is carried in the Companys balance sheet at amortised cost rather than fair value.
Hence movement in interest rates will not affect equity but may have an impact on the share price and discount which is not likely to be material.
The Company has no holdings of fixed interest rate securities whose fair value would be affected by interest rate movements.
The Company does not normally hold a significantly high level of cash balances with an overdraft facility used when required.
Therefore the Company would not normally have any significant exposure to interest rate risk.
However the Company was holding high levels of cash and short term deposits at the year end due to unusual market conditions.
The Companys exposure to cash flow interest rate risk due to cash and deposit balances at the year end was as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates Cash at bank and short term deposits 171,392 287,985 Interest received on cash balances, or paid on overdrafts, is at a margin below or above LIBOR respectively 2008: same.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year as the level of cash balances has fluctuated.
The maximum and minimum cash balances during the year are as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Maximum cash at bank and short term deposits 292,272 287,985 Minimum cash at bank and short term deposits 143,647 20,583 Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and net assets to a 1% 2008: 1% increase or decrease in interest rates applied to the Companys cash balances.
This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys cash balances at the balance sheet date with all other variables held constant.

ii Market price risk Market price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk, which may affect the value of equity investments.
Management of market price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objective and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
The Board has used FTSE 100 index put options during the year to protect part of the portfolio from market falls.
Market price risk exposure The Companys total exposure to changes in market prices at 31st January comprises its holdings in investments as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Investments at fair value through profit or loss 716,891 1,145,680 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to market price risk during the year.
Concentration of exposure to market price risk An analysis of the Companys investments is given on pages 14 to 15 This shows that the majority of the investments value is in the UK.
Accordingly there is a concentration of exposure to that country.
However it should be noted that an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.

Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
The Boards policy is for the Company to remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings be used to manage short term liabilities and working capital and to gear the Company as appropriate.

Management of credit risk Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate DVP Delivery Versus Payment settlement.
The process of DVP mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during the settlement process.
The Manager continuously monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, a process that involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.

This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Managers views on the market: the need to buy back equity shares, either for cancellation or to hold in Treasury, which takes into account the share price discount or premium: the need for issues of new shares, or sale of shares from Treasury: and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
