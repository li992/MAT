SEGMENTAL REPORTING The Group reports on six operating segments in its internal management reports.
The Groups segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services to international oil and gas companies, the aviation and shipping sector.
As indicated in the Chief Executives Review in the Annual Report and Accounts for 2008, a new segment, Well Intervention, has been identified and reported in internal management reports.
Although the Well Intervention segment does not currently meet the requirements of a reportable segment, management has concluded that this segment should be reported separately as it is an area of strategic focus of the business and is expected to materially contribute to Group revenue in the future.
The Well Construction segment provides products and services used by customers for the drilling phase of oil and gas wells along with associated equipment used by the underground construction industry for telecommunication infrastructure build-out.
The Well Completion segment provides products and services used by customers for the completion phase of oil and gas wells.
The Well Intervention segment provides products and services used by customers for the production, maintenance and restoration of existing oil and gas wells.
The Exploration and Production segment includes the Groups oil and gas exploration and production activities in the Southern US and offshore Gulf of Mexico.
Gibson Shipbrokers is a global energy shipping broker headquartered in London.
Crude oil, fuel oil and bio fuels are actively shipped along with dry bulk such as coal, iron ore and grain.
The company is also involved in the shipping of liquefied petroleum gas LPG, petrochemicals and liquefied natural gas LNG.
Field Aviation is an aircraft service organisation providing modification, installation, distribution, maintenance and manufacturing services for regional, business and government operators worldwide.
The following tables present the results of the operating segments on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes to Dennis Proctor, the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The information for the year ended 31 December 2008 has been re-presented to show the Well Intervention operating segment and to take into account the change in accounting policy from carrying property at valuation to carrying these at historical cost.
The Group measures the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and profit from operations, before any exceptional items.
Accounting policies used for segment reporting reflect those used for the Group.
Inter-segment sales are priced on an arms-length basis.
Costs and overheads incurred centrally are apportioned to the operating segments on the basis of time attributed to those operations by senior executives.

These have been agreed in 2009 and result in an additional cash consideration payable by the purchaser of 17.6m, which was received on 20 April 2009.
Provisions held in respect of the Gibson Energy disposal have been reassessed and result in additional provisions for tax indemnities and warranties of 16.0m.
Foreign exchange losses of 0.6m have also been recognised.
These offset the additional consideration received and result in an additional profit on disposal before tax of 1.0m.
The gains on the disposal of Gibson Energy and Hunting Energy France are exempt from taxation due to the availability of the Substantial Shareholding Exemption.
Tax relief is available on certain costs included in the profit on disposal of Hunting Energy France but which are not included in the taxable gain.
RESULTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR In accordance with the exemption allowed by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own income statement.
A profit of 24.6m 2008 37.0m has been dealt with in the accounts of the Company.

EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of outstanding Ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary shares.
The dilution in respect of share options applies where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary shares during the year and the possible issue of shares under the Groups long term incentive plans.

The impairment charge of 16.8m in 2008 includes 16.2m for the write down of oil and gas development expenditure included in the Exploration and Production operating segment following a fall in commodity prices during the year.
The recoverable amount of the oil and natural gas development expenditure is based on value in use.
These calculations used discounted pre-tax cash flow projections based on estimated oil and gas reserves and future production and income attributable to such reserves.
Reserve determinations were made utilising geological maps in conjunction with volumetric calculations, material balance extrapolations and exponential decline curve analysis.
Cash flows were based on reserve production lives varying from one to fifteen years.
Cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax rate of 8%.
The long term price of oil was assumed to be an average of US$55 per barrel bbl and the average price of gas US$5.89 per 1,000 cubic feet mcf.
Oil and gas exploration and development includes expenditure on the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources, which is recognised at cost and is not depreciated.
The amount recognised in cost at 31 December 2009 is nil 2008 nil, including additions during the year of nil 2008 2.2m, an impairment loss of nil 2008 2.9m and an exchange gain of nil 2008 0.1m.

GOODWILL continued Impairment of goodwill The impairment charge of 16.3m in 2008 relates to two cash-generating units, namely US Trenchless operations included in the Well Construction operating segment, a supplier of drill rods and Canada Manufacturing included in the Well Completion operating segment, a specialised API coupling manufacturer.
The impairment of goodwill arises due to a downturn in business activity levels during 2008.
Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill as follows: 2009 2008 m m Continuing operations: Well Construction 15.6 15.7 Well Completion 6.3 3.3 Well Intervention 31.0 5.9 Gibson Shipbrokers 1.2 1.2 54.1 26.1 Discontinued operations: Hunting Energy France 3.2 Total 54.1 29.3 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use discounted pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three year period and are based on past experience.
Cash flows beyond the three year period are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 5%.
The growth rate reflects the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU operates.
Cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax rate of 8% 2008 8%.
In determining the discount rate, management considered the Groups weighted average cost of capital and the Groups incremental borrowing rates.
The discount rate best reflects the risks associated with the cash flows and the likely external rate of borrowing of the cash generating units.
Consideration has also been given to other risks such as currency risk and country risk.
Despite operating in different markets, the Group considers the risk profiles to be similar.
Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any cash generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.

The Directors believe that the carrying value of the investments is supported by their underlying net assets.
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost, which is the fair value of the consideration paid, less impairments.
The impairment charge of 1.5m relates to a non-trading subsidiary that has incurred losses and which the directors do not expect to be recovered in the foreseeable future.
The investment has therefore been written down to the subsidiarys net asset value, being the Directors estimate of the recoverable amount.

The fair value of the equity warrant is based on managements best estimate of the recoverable amount given current global market conditions and their assessment of the recoverability under the contractual terms of the instrument.
Oil and gas prices continue to remain volatile, interest rates are expected to remain low, while credit spreads are expected to tighten.
Although the global economy has improved since the beginning of 2009, uncertainty exists about the future of the global economy in 2010.
The fair value of the equity warrant is sensitive to assumptions made about its recoverability.
Under reasonably possible alternative assumptions, the fair value of the instrument could vary between 35.5m and 23.7m.

The carrying values of available for sale unlisted investments are based on the Directors best estimate of fair value as there is no active market in which these are traded.
The fair values of non-sterling denominated financial instruments are translated into sterling using the year end exchange rate.
FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS The Groups activities expose it to certain financial risks, namely market risk including currency risk, fair value interest risk, cash flow interest risk and commodity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups risk management strategy seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on its financial performance.
As part of its strategy, both primary and derivative financial instruments are used to hedge its risk exposures.
There are clearly defined objectives and principles for managing financial risk established by the Board of Directors, with policies, parameters and procedures covering the specific areas of funding, banking relationships, foreign currency and interest rate exposures, cash management and the investment of surplus cash.
The Groups treasury function is responsible for implementing the policies and providing a centralised service to the Group for funding, the investment of surplus cash, foreign exchange, interest rate management and counterparty risk management.
It is also responsible for identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating companies.
uk 95 annual report & accounts 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 28.
FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS continued a Foreign exchange risk The Groups international base is exposed to foreign exchange risk from its investing, financing and operating activities, particularly in respect of US dollars.
Foreign exchange risks arise from future transactions and cash flows and from recognised monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the Groups local operations.
i Transactional risk The exposure to exchange rate movements in significant future transactions and cash flows is hedged by using forward foreign exchange contracts, currency options and currency swaps.
Certain forward foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedging instruments of highly probable forecast transactions.
Operating companies prepare quarterly rolling twelve month cash flow forecasts to enable working capital currency exposures to be identified.
Exposures arising from committed long-term projects beyond a twelve month period are also identified.
The currency flows to be hedged are currently set at 250,000 equivalent for monthly transactions and 500,000 equivalent for annual transactions.
No speculative positions are entered into by the Group.
The table below shows the carrying values of the Groups financial instruments at 31 December, including derivative financial instruments, on which exchange differences would potentially be recognised in the income statement in the following year.
The table excludes available for sale financial assets, derivatives designated in a cash flow hedge and loans to subsidiaries that are considered to be part of the net investment in a foreign operation, as exchange differences arising on these are recognised directly in equity.

uk 96 annual report & accounts 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 28.
FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS continued ii Translational risk Foreign exchange risk also arises from the Groups investments in foreign operations.
Average rate options are used to reduce translation risk on the Groups consolidated profit before tax by hedging the translation of approximately 50% of budgeted US dollar earnings into sterling.
These derivatives are not designated as a hedge.
b Interest rate risk Variable interest rates on deposits and overdrafts expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and fixed interest rates on loans and deposits expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The treasury function manages the Groups exposure to interest rate risk and has used interest rate swaps, caps and floors, when considered appropriate.
The Group needs to ensure that sufficient liquid funds are available to support its working capital and capital expenditure requirements and to fund acquisitions.
Cash was, therefore, invested by the treasury function in AAA rated, instant access Money Market Funds and in fixed-rate bank deposits, with terms of between overnight and three months.
As the funds were invested for short periods of time, the interest yield on these was relatively low.
However, the preservation of the Groups net cash took priority over earning high interest yields.
c Credit risk The Groups credit risk arises from its cash and cash equivalents, deposits, derivative financial instruments and outstanding receivables.
At the year end, the Group had credit risk exposures to a wide range of counterparties.
Credit risk exposure is continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered to be significant in the context of the ordinary course of the Groups activities.
Financing transactions are with leading financial institutions, which have Fitch long-term ratings between A and AA, and no losses are expected from non-performance of these counterparties.
Cash is only invested with financial institutions approved by the Board.
Exposure limits are set for each approved counterparty, as well as the types of transactions that may be entered into.
Approved institutions all have a minimum of an A1, P1 or F1 short-term rating and AAA rating for Money Market Funds from Standard and Poors, Moodys or Fitch rating agencies.
The credit risk of foreign exchange contracts is calculated before the contract is acquired and compared to the credit risk limit set for each counterparty.
Credit risk is calculated as a fixed percentage of the nominal value of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables are continuously monitored.
Credit account limits are primarily based on the credit quality of the customer and past experience through trading relationships.
To reduce credit risk exposure from outstanding receivables, the Group has taken out credit insurance with an external insurer, subject to certain conditions.
The majority of the Companys defined benefit section of the UK Scheme is now covered by insurance company annuity policies, meaning the pensions-related risks have largely been eliminated.
The pension buy-in has been affected by using three insurers, so as to spread its credit risk.
The credit ratings of these insurers is monitored.
d Liquidity risk The Group needs to ensure that is has sufficient liquid funds available to support its working capital and capital expenditure requirements and to fund acquisitions.
All subsidiaries submit weekly, bi-monthly and quarterly treasury reports to the treasury function to enable them to monitor the Groups requirements.
The Group has sufficient net cash and credit facilities to meet both its long and short-term requirements.
The credit facilities totalled 181.9m 2008 194.4m and comprise 135.0m 2008 142.5m of committed facilities and 46.9m 2008 51.9m of uncommitted facilities.
All of these facilities are unsecured and are provided by a variety of funding sources.
The committed facilities comprise a 125.0m multi-currency loan facility from a syndicate of five banks and one bilateral facility totalling 10.0m.
The 125.0m multi-currency loan facility expires on 22 September 2010, on which renewal discussions will commence later in the year.
A commitment fee of 0.15% is payable on the undrawn amount.
The bilateral facility matures on 31 March 2010.
A commitment fee of 0.2% is payable on the undrawn amount.

FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS continued e Sensitivity analysis The following sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Groups and Companys financial instruments and show the impact on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at 31 December 2009.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net cash, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the cash and derivatives and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from the hedge designations in place at 31 December 2009.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement obligations, provisions but including onerous leases and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of foreign operations.
The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have an asymmetric impact on the Groups results, that is, an increase in rates does not result in the same amount of movement as a decrease in rates.
The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost do not change as interest rates change.

The provision for onerous contracts reflects the uncertainty of future conditions in the sub-letting market.
It is expected that 2.8m of the provision will be utilised in 2010, 2.5m in 2011 and the remaining balance of 14.2m utilised from 2012 to 2023.
Provision is made on a discounted basis, at a risk-free rate of 4% pa, for the net rental deficit on these properties to the end of the lease term.
Asset decommissioning & remediation obligations relate to the Groups obligation to dismantle, remove and restore items of property, plant and equipment.
The provision reflects uncertainty in the timing and amounts of the costs expected to arise in meeting this obligation.
The provision is expected to be utilised over a period of 3 to 5 years.
Following the disposal of Gibson Energy in 2008, the Group recognised a provision for tax indemnities.
These provisions are expected to be utilised in 2010.
The Group expects the other provisions of 0.1m to be fully utilised in 2010. www.

POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS Pensions Within the UK, the Group operates a funded defined benefit plan with benefits linked to final salary and a defined contribution plan.
With effect from 31 December 2002, the defined benefit plan was closed to new UK employees who are offered membership of the defined contribution plan.
The majority of UK employees are members of one of these arrangements.
During the year, the trustees of the Scheme, with the support of the Company, purchased an annuity policy in relation to the active members of the Scheme.
The effect of this is recognised in actuarial gains losses on plan assets in the statement of other comprehensive income.
The majority of the Schemes benefits are now covered by insurance policies, meaning that pensions-related risks have largely been eliminated demonstrated by the stability of the pension asset from year to year.
However, the obligation ultimately rests with the Group.
A valuation of the defined benefit section of the Scheme is produced and updated annually to 31 December by independent qualified actuaries.
The main assumptions used for IAS 19 purposes at 31 December were: 2009 2008 Annual rates Rate of increase in salaries 5.7% 4.9% Rate of increase in pensions 3.7% 2.9% Discount rate 5.6% 6.4% Inflation 3.7% 2.9% The post-employment mortality assumptions allow for future improvements in mortality.
The mortality table implies that a 65 year old male currently has an expected future lifetime of 24.0 years 2008 23.8 years and an expected future lifetime of 27.1 years 2008 26.9 years for a male reaching 65 in 20 years time.
Based upon past experience, pension increases have been assumed to be in line with inflation.

The expected rate of return on the insurance policies has been set equal to the discount rate.

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups capital consists of equity.
At the year end, total equity was 561.8m 2008 557.3m.
It is managed with the aim of maintaining an appropriate level of financing available for the Groups activities, having due regard to interest rate and currency risks and the availability of borrowing facilities.
The gearing ratio, which is net debt expressed as a percentage of total equity, is monitored regularly against both internal targets and external covenant requirements.
The Group needs to ensure that banking and other borrowing covenants are complied with to ensure that borrowing facilities remain in place.
The covenants are monitored on a monthly basis and all external covenant requirements were met during the year.
Changes in equity arise from the retention of earnings and, from time to time, rights issues of share capital.
The Groups net cash debt is monitored on a daily basis and is managed by the control of working capital, dividend and capital expenditure payments and the purchase and disposal of assets and businesses.

SHARE BASED PAYMENTS Equity-settled share option plans Executive share options The Company operates an executive share option scheme which grants options to eligible employees.
Vesting of options granted is subject to the achievement of performance targets, as described in the Remuneration Committees Report, over a three year period.
Thereafter the employee, subject to continued employment, has seven years in which to exercise the option.
Options are valued using an option pricing model based on the binomial model, but adjusted to model the particular features of the options.
The assumptions used in calculating the charge to the income statement, which only relates to options granted after November 2002 as permitted by IFRS 2, are as follows: Date of grant 04.03.2008 06.03.2007 08.03.2006 09.03.2005 Exercise price p 784.5 640.0 383.0 220.7 Share price at grant p 784.5 640.0 383.0 236.0 Expected volatility % pa 32 36 38 38 Dividend yield % pa 1.1 1.17 1.31 1.59 Risk-free interest rate % pa 4.3 4.9 4.3 4.9 Turnover rates % pa 5 555 Fair value at grant p 294.9 248.4 149.8 91.0 Fair value adjusted for rights issue p n a n a n a 85.1 Assumed likelihood of satisfying performance condition at: 31 December 2008 75% 75% 100% 100% 31 December 2009 75% 75% 100% 100% The assumption for early exercise is 50% when options are 20% in the money.
The expected volatility is calculated as the historic volatility of the Hunting PLC share return over the 5 years prior to each grant date.
The charge to the income statement attributable to Executive Share Options is 1.0m 2008 2.4m and is recognised as part of operating expenses.

Long Term Incentive Plan The Group operates a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for key executives.
LTIP awards may be settled in shares or cash.
Details of awards made under this plan are contained within the Remuneration Committees report on page 29.
The charge to the income statement attributable to the LTIP is 2.5m 2008 5.4m.
Performance Share Plan PSP Under the PSP annual conditional awards of shares may be made to executive directors and senior employees.
Awards are subject to performance conditions and continued employment during the vesting period.
The PSP awards made in the year will vest subject to total shareholder return TSR performance over a three year period from date of grant, relative to comparator companies from the Dow Jones US Oil Equipment and Services sector index and the DJ STOXX TM Oil Equipment and Services sector index.

The assumptions used in the model were as follows: Assumptions: 2009 Weighted average share price at grant 444.25p Expected volatility Hunting PLC 44.4% Expected volatility Comparator group 57.1% Risk free rate 1.9% Expected life 3 years Fair value 251.47p The expected volatility was calculated using historic weekly volatility over 3 years prior to grant, equal in length to the performance period at the date of grant.
The expected volatilities of each constituents of the comparator group are calculated on the same basis and input into the model individually and the average of these figures is shown in the table above.
The expected life of the award has been calculated as 3 years, commensurate with the vesting period.
The risk free rate is based on the UK gilt rate commensurate with the vesting period prevailing at the date of grant.
Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent over the number of shares which make up their award.
It is accumulated over the vesting period and released subject to the achievement of the performance condition.
This is factored into the fair value calculation and as a result the dividend yield assumption is set to zero.
The accounting charge of the PSP is adjusted for an estimate of the number of shares that are expected to lapse for those participants who cease employment during the vesting period and forfeit a proportion of their award.
The estimate of the expected forfeiture lapse rate is 2.5% per annum.
The charge to the income statement attributable to the PSP is 0.1m 2008 nil, which is recognised in operating expenses.
Restricted Share Plan RSP Under the RSP, annual conditional awards of shares may be made to employees subject to continued employment during the vesting period.
There are no performance conditions attached to these awards.
