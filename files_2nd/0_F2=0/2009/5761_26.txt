Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date and is determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply when the timing differences reverse.

Own shares The Experian plc Employee Share Trust and the Experian UK Approved All-Employee Share Plan are separately administered trusts.
Liabilities of these trusts are guaranteed by the Company and the assets of the trusts mainly comprise shares in the Company.
The assets, liabilities and expenses of the trusts are included in the Companys financial statements as if they were the Companys own with shares in the Company held by the trusts shown as a deduction from total equity shareholders funds at cost.
Share-based payments The Group has a number of equity settled, share-based employee incentive plans.
These include options and awards in respect of shares in the Company made at or after demerger in October 2006 together with options and awards previously granted in respect of shares in GUS plc which were rolled over into options and awards in respect of shares in the Company at demerger.
The fair value of such options and awards granted to employees of the Company is recognised after taking into account the Companys best estimate of the number of options and awards expected to vest.
The Company revises the vesting estimate at each balance sheet date and non-market performance conditions are included in the vesting estimates.
Amounts are recognised over the vesting period.
Fair value is measured at the date of grant using whichever of the Black-Scholes model, Monte Carlo model and closing market price is most appropriate to the award.
Market based performance conditions are included in the fair value measurement on grant date and are not revised for actual performance.
The issuance by the Company of share incentives to employees of its subsidiaries represents additional capital contributions and the fair value of such options and awards is therefore recognised as an increase in the Companys investment in group undertakings with a corresponding increase in total equity shareholders funds.
