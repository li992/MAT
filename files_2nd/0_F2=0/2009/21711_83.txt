BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued for the year ended 31 December 2009 13 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Companys main financial instruments comprise: a Cash and cash equivalents that arise directly from the Companys operations: and b Shares held in AllBlue Limited.
14 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments concern its holding of shares in AllBlue Limited and the risks attaching to those shares, which are market price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and increased volatility due to leverage employed by the underlying funds as explained below.
The Company is not exposed to foreign exchange risk as each class of Shares in the Company is directly invested in shares of AllBlue Limited denominated in the same corresponding currency.
So far as the Company is concerned, the only risk the Board can monitor and control is the liquidity risk attaching to its ability to realise shares in AllBlue Limited for the purpose of meeting ongoing expenses of the Company.
Thereafter the Board recognises that the Company has via its holding of shares in AllBlue Limited an indirect exposure to the risks summarised below though it must be noted that there is little or nothing which the Board can do to manage each of these risks within AllBlue Limited AllBlue or the underlying funds in which AllBlue invests the underlying fund s. a Price Risk The success of AllBlues and the underlying funds and, therefore, the Companys activities will be affected by general economic and market conditions, such as interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws, trade barriers, currency exchange controls and national and international political circumstances.
These factors may affect the level and volatility of securities prices and the liquidity of the underlying funds investments.
Volatility or illiquidity could impair the underlying funds profitability or result in losses.
Details of the Companys Investment Objective and Policy are set out on pages 1 and 2.
Price sensitivity The Company invests substantially all its assets in AllBlue and does not undertake any significant borrowing or hedging activity at the Company level.
Its performance is therefore directly linked to the net asset value of AllBlue, which itself is driven by the net asset values of the underlying funds, each of which hold a large number of positions in listed and unlisted securities.
At 31 December 2009, if the net asset value of AllBlue had been 10% higher with all other variables held constant, the increase in net assets attributable to shareholders for the year would have been 43,976,086 2008: 28,141,240 greater, arising due to the increase in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
