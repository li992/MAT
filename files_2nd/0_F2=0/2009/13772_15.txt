Financial statements The Sage Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 76 Notes to the accounts Group 6 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust note 22, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups long-term incentive plan.
At 30 September 2009, the performance criteria for the vesting of the awards under the incentive scheme had not been met in all cases and consequently the shares in question are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below: Basic EPS 2009 2008 Weighted Weighted average average number number Per share Per share Earnings of shares Earnings of shares amount amount m millions pence m millions pence Basic EPS Earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders 189.5 1,310.6 14.46 166.3 1,306.5 12.73 Effect of dilutive securities Options 3.7 0.04 3.8 0.04 Diluted EPS 189.5 1,314.3 14.42 166.3 1,310.3 12.69 Adjusted EPS Non GAAP measure 2009 2008 Weighted Weighted average average number Per share number Per share Earnings Earnings of shares amount of shares amount m millions pence m millions pence Basic EPS Earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders 189.5 1,310.6 14.46 166.3 1,306.5 12.73 Non GAAP items: Intangible asset amortisation excluding amortisation of computer software 40.1 32.4 Taxation 11.6 10.0 Net adjustments 28.5 2.17 22.4 1.71 Adjusted basic EPS 218.0 1,310.6 16.63 188.7 1,306.5 14.44 Exchange adjustments Exchange adjustments 41.4 Taxation 12.8 Net exchange adjustments 28.6 2.19 Adjusted basic EPS after exchange adjustments 218.0 1,310.6 16.63 217.3 1,306.5 16.63 Effect of dilutive securities Options 3.7 0.04 3.8 0.04 Adjusted diluted EPS after exchange adjustments 218.0 1,314.3 16.59 217.3 1,310.3 16.59 Exchange adjustments relate to the retranslation of prior year results to current year exchange rates as shown in the table on page 14 within the Financial review.

During the year, goodwill was reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36.
For the purposes of this impairment review, goodwill has been valued on the basis of discounted future cash flows arising in each relevant cash-generating unit.
Goodwill impairment tests Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to one or more cash-generating units CGUs.
CGUs represent the operations of a country or, in more material operations, divisions within a country.
The following table shows the allocation of the carrying value of goodwill at the balance sheet date by geographic area: 2009 2008 m m UK & Ireland 212.4 213.2 France 293.6 251.9 Germany 28.8 24.8 Switzerland 38.6 32.1 Poland 7.4 8.0 Spain 142.3 116.1 North America Sage Business Solutions Division 754.2 695.6 Sage Payment Solutions Division 163.8 141.8 Sage Healthcare Division 307.5 266.3 South Africa 36.3 34.1 Australia 26.6 24.7 Asia 19.3 16.9 2,030.8 1,825.5 Financial statements The Sage Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 78 Notes to the accounts Group 7 Goodwill continued The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the recoverable amount of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations are the discount rate applied, the long-term operating margin and the long-term growth rate of net operating cash flows.
In all cases, the approved budget for the following financial year formed the basis for the cash flow projections for a CGU.
The approved cash flow projections in the four financial years following the budget year reflected managements expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the CGU and growth prospects in the CGUs market.
The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre-tax rate that reflects the market assessment of the time value of money at the balance sheet date and the risks specific to the CGU.
The long-term operating margin assumed for a CGUs operations is primarily based on past performance.
For some CGUs, those for which management has strong reason to believe that past operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins, expected future improvements from sustainable operating cost savings are also included in managements assessment of the longterm operating margin.
The long-term operating margin applied to CGUs was in the range of 10% 2008: 8% to 50% 2008: 47%.
Long-term growth rates of net operating cash flows are assumed equal to the long-term growth rate in the gross domestic product of the country in which the CGUs operations are undertaken and were in the range of 1.3% 2008: 1.0% to 5.7% 2008: 5.0%.
Goodwill impairment tests were conducted separately for each CGU.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Management believes that no reasonable potential change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
Intangible assets other than internally generated IPR&D and computer software relate to identifiable assets purchased as part of the Groups business combinations.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic life.

The Group considers the credit quality of trade and other receivables by geographical location.
The Group consider that the carrying value of the trade and other receivables that is disclosed below gives a fair presentation of the credit quality of the assets.
This is considered to be the case as there is a low risk of default due to the high number of recurring customers and credit control policies, thus the carrying value is expected to be the final value received.

The directors believe that there is no further provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The creation and release of provision for impaired receivables have been included in selling and administrative expenses in the income statement.
Amounts charged to the allowance account are generally written-off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.

The Group does not engage in speculative trading in financial instruments and transacts only in relation to underlying business requirements.
The Groups treasury policies and procedures are periodically reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee and are subject to regular Group Internal Audit review.
Capital risk The Groups objectives when managing capital defined as net debt note 24 plus equity are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while optimising return to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding.
The Group regularly reviews net debt and its ratio to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA to ensure that it does not exceed the covenant contained within the Groups banking facilities being 3.0 times.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, with respect to changes in economic conditions and the strategic objectives of the Group.
Financial statements The Sage Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 84 Notes to the accounts Group 16 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by regularly reviewing net debt and forecast cash flows to ensure that current cash resources are available to meet its business objectives.
The Group also regularly monitors its compliance with its debt covenants.
During the financial year, all covenants have been complied with.
The Group has committed facilities which are available to be drawn for general corporate purposes including working capital see below.
The Groups Treasury function has a policy of optimising the level of cash in the business in order to minimise external borrowings.

All these facilities incur commitment fees at market rates.
In addition, the Group maintains overdraft and uncommitted facilities to provide short-term flexibility.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty may default on their obligation to the Group in relation to lending, settlement and other financial activities.
The Groups principal financial assets are trade and other receivables and bank balances and cash.
The Groups credit risk primarily arises from trade and other receivables.
The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The Group has a very low credit risk due to the transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with the exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Financial statements The Sage Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 85 The credit risk on liquid funds is considered to be low, as the Audit Committee approved Group Treasury Policy limits the value that can be invested with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Group does not hold collateral over any of these financial assets.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.
At 30 September 2009, the Group had drawn down 460.6m 2008: 575.4m from its committed revolving credit facilities.
It is the Groups policy to regularly review interest rates and forecast debt to monitor its interest rate exposure.
The profile of fixed and floating interest rates is then managed accordingly using interest rate swaps or other hedging instruments approved by the Board.
At 30 September 2009, the Group had fixed the interest rate on 93.8m of borrowings 2008: nil using interest rate swaps, with all other outstanding debt held at variable rates.
Foreign currency risk Foreign exchange rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows will fluctuate because of the changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups foreign currency exposures are principally to the US Dollar and Euro.
The Group has US Dollar, Euro and Swiss Franc denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of the net investment in its subsidiaries in the US, France, Spain, Germany and Switzerland.
The fair value of the US Dollar borrowings at 30 September 2009 was 227.9m 2008: 290.6m, the Euro borrowings 148.1m 2008: 203.5m and Swiss Franc borrowings 12.8m 2008: 13.9m.
The foreign exchange loss of 71.3m 2008: loss of 71.7m on translation of the borrowings into Sterling has been recognised in exchange reserves.
The Groups other currency exposures comprise only those exposures that give rise to net currency gains and losses to be recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures reflect the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
At 30 September 2009 and 30 September 2008, these exposures were immaterial to the Group.
Derivative financial instruments 2009 2008 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Interest rate swaps cash flow hedge: Current Non-current 0.3 The fair values of derivatives have been calculated using market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Their designation depends on the contractual maturity of the derivative.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 30 September 2009 was 93.8m 2008: nil.
At 30 September 2009, the average fixed interest rate is 1.70%, excluding margin 2008: n a and the main floating rates are 0.35% above LIBOR.
Losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity note 21 on interest rate swap contracts as of 30 September 2009 will be continuously released to the income statement until the repayment of the bank borrowings.
Sensitivity analysis Financial instruments affected by market risks include borrowings and deposits.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK, US Dollar and Euro interest rates, and US Dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis assumes reasonable movements in foreign exchange and interest rates before the effect of tax.
The Group considers a reasonable interest rate movement in LIBOR to be 1%, based on interest rate history.
Similarly, sensitivity to movements in US Dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates of 10% are shown reflecting changes of reasonable proportion in the context of movement in those currency pairs over the last year.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Consolidated income statement and equity.

No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.

ESOS There have been no grants of executive share options under the 1999 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS since June 2008.
Long-term incentive awards are made under The Sage Group plc Performance Share Plan.
The performance targets governing the vesting of existing options are based on stretching EPS growth measured over a fixed threeyear period from the start of the financial year in which the grant is made.
30% of options will vest at the end of the period if the increase in EPS exceeds Retail Prices Index RPI by 15% an average of 5% per year and 100% of those options will vest at that time only if RPI is exceeded in that period by 27% an average of 9% per year.
Between those targets, options will vest on a straight-line basis.
If those targets are not met at the end of the three-year period, then no further retesting of the performance criteria will be undertaken and the options will lapse.
Financial statements The Sage Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 90 Notes to the accounts Group 19 Share-based payments continued Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

Financial statements The Sage Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 91 The Sage Group PSP The Performance Share Plan the Plan was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2005 and amended at the Annual General Meeting in 2009.
Annual grants of performance shares will normally be made to executive directors and senior executives across the Group after the preliminary declaration of the annual results.
Following the amendments to the scheme, annual awards under the Plan are limited to shares worth up to 300% of base salary.
In practice, annual grants to executive directors are limited to shares with a maximum value on award of 210% of base salary except in exceptional circumstances, such as a promotion or recruitment or to reflect local market practice.
The performance shares are subject to performance conditions on a sliding scale based on EPS.
25% of the award will vest at the end of the period if the increase in EPS exceeds RPI by 9% an average of 3% per year : 100% of the award will vest at that time only if RPI is exceeded in that period by 27% an average of 9% per year.
Between those targets, awards will vest on a straight-line basis, and if those targets are not met there is no opportunity for re-testing.
Awards are then subject to a TSR multiplier whereby the level of vesting based on EPS achievement will be adjusted according to TSR performance over the same three-year period compared with a group of international software and computer services companies.
The comparator group for awards made in 2009 comprised the following companies: Adobe Systems Cegid Logica Salesforce.
com ARM Holdings Dassault Systemes Micro Focus International SAP Autonomy Exact Microsoft Software AG Blackbaud Intuit Misys Cap Gemini Lawson Software Oracle If Sages TSR is ranked at lower quartile in the group, the multiplier is 0.75.
If Sages TSR is ranked at median in the group, the multiplier is 1.
If Sages TSR is ranked at upper quartile in the group, then the multiplier is 1.5.
Straight-line pro-rating applies between 0.75 and 1, and between 1 and1.5, but the multiplier cannot be higher or lower than these figures.
Awards were valued using the Monte Carlo option-pricing model.

The acquisition of the Shares was funded by the proceeds of a savings account with a bank or building society.
The original scheme adopted in 1996 continued in accordance with its terms for ten years and expired in February 2006.
A new scheme was approved by the members at the Annual General Meeting held on 2 March 2006.
Eligibility All UK employees, including executive directors, of the Company and its participating subsidiaries who have completed at least one years continuous service and are assessable to employment income tax are eligible to participate in the SAYE Plan.
The directors may offer participation to other employees and may alter the length of service required to qualify to a different period, not exceeding five years.
Employee contributions An employee who wishes to participate in the SAYE Plan will enter into a contract the SAYE contract with a savings body, designated by the directors for the purpose of the SAYE Plan, to make monthly contributions by deduction from their pay of not more than the maximum contribution permitted from time to time by HMRC currently 250.
A tax-free bonus currently equivalent to 1.4x or 4.4x the monthly contribution will be paid on completion of 36 or 60 monthly savings contributions respectively and another tax-free bonus currently 8.4x the monthly contribution including the payment at the end of 60 months will be paid after a further two years if the savings plus the initial bonus are not withdrawn prior to that date.
Exercise price An employee who applies for the grant of an option to acquire Shares will do so at a price the Exercise Price which is determined by the directors but which is not less than the greater of: 80% of the middle market quotation of a Share on the dealing day prior to the date of invitation as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List or, if the directors so decide, 80% of the average of the middle market quotations over the three dealing days prior to the date of the invitation or 80% of the middle market quotations at such other time or times agreed in advance with HMRC, and: In the case of an option over unissued Shares, the nominal value of a Share.
Financial statements The Sage Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 93 Grant of options Each option is granted over a number of Shares which, when multiplied by the Exercise Price, does not exceed the total monthly contributions plus the bonus payable on the maturity of the SAYE contract.
There will be no payment for the grant of an option.
Invitations to apply for options must be made within a period of 42 days after: Approval of the SAYE Plan by HMRC: or The publication by the Company of its interim or final results each year: or The day after the Companys Annual General Meeting: or Any day on which any change to the savings-related share option schemes legislation is announced or made: or If the directors resolve that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the operation of the SAYE Plan.
Exercise of options In normal circumstances, an option may be exercised at any time within six months following maturity of the SAYE contract, using the proceeds of the SAYE contract and the applicable bonus.
Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Performance conditions were not included in the fair value calculations.
