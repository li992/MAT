Annual Bonus The Committee seeks to structure annual bonus arrangements so as to encourage sustainable growth in the Companys profits: and is satisfied that the structure will not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently encouraging irresponsible behaviour.
Each executive director has a personal objective to ensure they monitor and take appropriate action to minimise key business risks.
The Committees policy is that all bonus payments to executive directors should be nonpensionable.
For 2009 the maximum target bonus levels were established on the following basis: Maximum 2009 bonus achievable Financial Target Financial Target Personal Objectives Percentage of basic Profit Sales related to functional salary KPIs Kennedy McMeikan 60% 20% 20% 90% Richard Hutton 60% 20% 20% 70% Raymond Reynolds 60% 20% 20% 70% Whilst each element could be measured separately, failure to exceed the profit level achieved in 2008 would have resulted in no bonus being earned for either the profit or sales elements in 2009.
Against the 2009 Annual Bonus targets a payment of 27% of annual salary has been earned by Kennedy McMeikan, 21% by Richard Hutton and 20% by Raymond Reynolds.
Following the benchmarking exercise against median level payments made to executives in comparator companies it was noted that we had fallen significantly behind the market in the maximum earning opportunity for executive directors.
We have therefore reviewed the maximum earning opportunity for 2010 for Richard Hutton and Raymond Reynolds and increased the level to 90% of base salary.
The maximum earning opportunity for Kennedy McMeikan remains unchanged at 90%.
For 2010 the maximum target bonus levels will be established on the following basis, which the Remuneration Committee consider to be suitably challenging: Maximum 2010 bonus achievable Financial Target Financial Target Personal Objectives % of base salary Profit Sales related to functional KPIs Kennedy McMeikan 60% 20% 20% 90% Richard Hutton 60% 20% 20% 90% Raymond Reynolds 60% 20% 20% 90% Whilst each element can be measured separately, failure to exceed the profit level achieved in 2009 will result in no bonus being earned for either the profit or sales elements in 2010.
