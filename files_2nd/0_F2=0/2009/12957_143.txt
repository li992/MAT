This comprises payments totalling US$32 million which have been capitalised as part of the cost of the project, US$15.2 million in respect of damages arising from the delayed completion of the project, and advances of US$10.5 million net of a present value and impairment provision of US$1.1 million 2008: US$12.1 million included in receivables.
Of this latter amount, US$7 million is secured by performance bonds and the remainder is secured by various personal guarantees and other assets.
As part of the groups efforts to recoup the monies owed, MDM was put into liquidation on 1 February 2006.
This resulted in a South African Companies Act Section 417 investigation into the business and the financial activities of MDM, its affiliated companies and their directors.
This investigation was concluded in June 2007 and the liquidators are expected to release a statement of MDMs assets and liabilities shortly.
The directors believe that the group will be able to recover the US$10.5 million included in receivables.
However, this is dependent on the amounts which can be recovered from the performance bonds, personal guarantees and other assets provided as security.
Any shortfall is expected to be recovered from any free residue accruing to the insolvent estate.
The recovery process has commenced with summons being issued against creditors who received payment from MDM in terms of the Insolvency and Companies Acts and against the insurance company which issued the performance bonds.
The aggregate amount which will ultimately be recovered cannot presently be determined.
Recovery of the other US$47.2 million is dependent on the extent to which the groups claim is accepted by the liquidators and the amount in the free residue.
The ultimate outcome of this claim cannot be determined at present.
The financial statements do not reflect any adjustment to the cost of the Loulo development that may arise from this claim, or any additional income that may arise from the claim for damages, or any charge that may arise from MDMs inability to settle amounts that are determined to be payable by MDM to the group in respect of the Loulo development.
