HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued Notes 11, 12 and 13 investments.
No amount is disclosed for the unrecognised deferred tax or the 2009 temporary differences associated with such investments, as it is impracticable to determine the amount of income taxes that would be payable when any temporary differences reverse.
Of the total net deferred tax assets of US$8.6 billion at 31 December 2009 2008: US$7.0 billion, US$5.1 billion 2008: US$5.1 billion arose in respect of HSBCs US operations where there has been a recent history of losses.
Managements analysis of the recognition of these deferred tax assets significantly discounts any future expected profits from the US operations and relies to a greater extent on capital support to the US operations from HSBC, including tax planning strategies implemented in relation to such support.
US legislation enacted on 6 November 2009 allowed for an extended carryback period for certain federal tax net operating losses.
This had the effect of reducing the net deferred tax assets related to such losses at 31 December 2009 by approximately US$1.6 billion.
Managements updated analysis is consistent with the assumption that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable income to support the resulting deferred tax assets that have been recognised in respect of the US operations as at 31 December 2009.
The deferred tax asset relating to HSBCs Brazil operation is US$1.3 billion 2008: US$0.9 billion.
On the evidence available, including management projections of income and the state of the Brazilian economy, there will be sufficient taxable income generated by the business to support this asset.
