Significant accounting policies IMI plc the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and applicable law IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 111 to 117.
The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 3 March 2010.
The following standards and interpretations were adopted by the Group during 2009.
IAS23 Borrowing Costs Revised IAS23 Borrowing Costs removed the option to expense borrowing costs and requires that an entity capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset.
The revised IAS23 became mandatory for the Groups 2009 consolidated financial statements and constitutes a change in accounting policy for the Group.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, the Group has applied the revised IAS23 to qualifying assets for which capitalisation of borrowing costs commenced on or after 1 January 2009.
Therefore there is no impact on prior periods in the Groups 2009 consolidated financial statements.
The impact of adopting IAS23 in the current year is not material.
Revised IAS1 Presentation of Financial Statements Revised IAS1 Presentation of Financial Statements 2007 introduces the term total comprehensive income, which represents changes in equity during a period other than those changes resulting from transactions with owners in their capacity as owners.
Total comprehensive income may be presented in either a single statement of comprehensive income effectively combining both the income statement and all non-owner changes in equity in a single statement, or in an income statement and a separate statement of comprehensive income.
The Group has elected to adopt the latter option.
The statement of changes in equity has been presented as a primary statement for the first time where previously it was presented in the notes to the financial statements.
IFRS2 Share-based payment The IASB issued an amendment to IFRS2 which clarifies the definition of vesting conditions, introduces the concept of non-vesting conditions, requires non-vesting conditions to be reflected in grant date fair value and provides the accounting treatment for non-vesting conditions and cancellations.
The Group adopted this amendment as of 1 January 2009.
It did not have a material impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
IFRS7 Financial Instruments : Disclosures The amended standard requires additional disclosures about fair value measurement and liquidity risk.
Fair value measurements for all items recorded at fair value are to be disclosed by source of inputs using a three level fair value hierarchy.
In addition, a reconciliation between the beginning and ending balance for level 3 fair value measurements is now required, as well as significant transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy.
The amendments to the standard also clarify the requirements for liquidity risk disclosures with respect to derivative transactions and assets used for liquidity management.
The fair value measurement disclosures are presented in note 18.5.
The liquidity risk disclosures are not significantly impacted by the amendments and are presented in note 18.6.
IFRIC13 Customer Loyalty Programmes addresses the accounting by entities that operate, or otherwise participate in, customer loyalty programmes under which the customer can redeem credits for awards such as free or discounted goods or services.
IFRIC13 became mandatory for the Groups 2009 consolidated financial statements, but does not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements.
IFRIC14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction clarified when refunds or reductions in future contributions in relation to defined benefit assets should be regarded as available and provided guidance on the impact of minimum funding requirements MFR on such assets.
It also addresses when a MFR might give rise to a liability.
IFRIC14 became mandatory for the Groups 2009 financial statements, with retrospective application required.
The effect of adopting IFRIC14 is not material.
IMI plc Annual Report 2009 67 68845 IMI AR pp61-75:Layout 1 20 3 10 07:13 Page 9 notes to the financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies continued The following relevant standards and interpretations were issued but are not effective for the year ended 31 December 2009: Revised IFRS3 Business Combinations 2008 incorporates the following changes that are likely to be relevant to the Groups operations: - The definition of a business has been broadened, which may result in more acquisitions being treated as business combinations.
- Contingent consideration will be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes therein recognised in profit or loss.
- Transaction costs, other than share and debt issue costs, will be expensed as incurred.
- Any pre-existing interest in the acquiree will be measured at fair value with the gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
- Any non-controlling minority interest will be measured at either fair value, or at its proportionate interest in the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree, on a  basis.
Revised IFRS3, which becomes mandatory for the Groups 2010 consolidated financial statements, will be applied prospectively and therefore there will be no impact on prior periods in the Groups 2010 consolidated financial statements.
The adoption of the standard will increase the volatility of reported profits and it is anticipated that transaction costs, if material, will be reported within exceptional items in future periods.
Amended IAS27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 2008 requires accounting for changes in ownership interests by the Group in a subsidiary, while maintaining control, to be recognised as an equity transaction.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, any interest retained in the former subsidiary will be measured at fair value with the gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
The amendments to IAS27, which become mandatory for the Groups 2010 consolidated financial statements, are not expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
The annual improvements project to IFRSs provides a vehicle for making non-urgent but necessary amendments to IFRSs.
The 2009 annual improvements project made amendments to a number of standards, these amendments were issued but not effective for the year ended 31 December 2009.
These amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group financial statements.
a Basis of accounting The financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling which is the Companys functional currency, rounded to the nearest hundred thousand, except revenues which are rounded to the nearest whole million.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments: available-for-sale financial assets: and financial assets and liabilities identified as hedged items.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale, where applicable, are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the Group for the purposes of these consolidated financial statements.
b Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
68 IMI plc Annual Report 2009 68845 IMI AR pp61-75:Layout 1 20 3 10 07:13 Page 10 The nature of the markets in which the Group operates leads, from time to time, to a variety of possible legal and other claims from customers.
Whenever such matters are notified to the Group, they are investigated and any liability which results is recognised in the accounts as soon as a reliable estimate can be made.
Where it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of any future liability, a contingent liability is disclosed.
The Company has disposed of a number of its previous businesses.
The sale agreements contained various warranties and indemnities.
In some cases, the agreements also include the potential for adjustment to the purchase price, sometimes contingent on future events.
At the time of disposal, the accounts reflect the best estimate of the likely future impact of these agreements.
Estimates are updated at each reporting date to reflect the latest information available.
Information about other areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant affect on the amount recognised in the financial statements are described in the notes which follow, on Intangible Assets: Deferred Tax assets and liabilities: Financial risk management: Employee benefits: Share-based payments: Provisions for liabilities and charges: Contingencies and Revenue.
c Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities which the Company has the power to control.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
d Foreign currencies i Foreign currency transactions Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translating transactions at the exchange rate ruling on the transaction date are reflected in profit before taxation in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
ii Foreign operations The income statements of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the appropriate average rate of exchange for the year and the adjustment to year end rates is taken directly to reserves.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly as a separate component of equity.
Since 1 January 2004, the Groups date of transition to IFRSs, such differences have been recognised in the translation reserve.
When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the translation reserve is transferred to profit or loss.
e Financial instruments and fair value hedging Financial instruments are recorded initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument, which follows the categories in IAS39: Fixed deposits, comprising principally funds held with banks and other financial institutions are classified as available for sale assets under IAS39, and held at fair value.
Short term borrowings and overdrafts are classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost.
IMI plc Annual Report 2009 69 68845 IMI AR pp61-75:Layout 1 20 3 10 07:13 Page 11 notes to the financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies continued e Financial instruments and fair value hedging continued Derivatives, comprising interest rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts and options, metals futures contracts and any embedded derivatives, are classified as fair value through profit or loss under IAS39, unless designated as hedges.
Derivatives not designated as hedges are recognised initially at fair value: attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss when incurred.
Subsequent to initial recognition changes in fair value of such derivatives and gains or losses on their settlement are recognised in net financial income or expense.
Long term loans and other interest bearing borrowings are generally held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Where the long term loan is hedged, generally by an interest rate swap, and the hedge is regarded as effective, the carrying value of the long term loan is adjusted for changes in fair value of the hedge.
Trade receivables are stated at their amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables are stated at amortised cost.
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet only when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Available for sale assets are carried at fair value with gains and losses being recognised in equity, except for impairment losses.
f Other hedging i Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities, financial commitments or forecast transactions Where a derivative financial instrument is used as an economic hedge of the foreign exchange or metals commodity price exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, or financial commitment or a forecast transaction, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss resulting from changes in fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in net financial income or expense.
For segmental reporting purposes, changes in the fair value of economic hedges that are not designated hedges, which relate to current year trading, together with the gains and losses on their settlement, are allocated to the segmental revenues and operating profit of the relevant business segment.
ii Hedge of net investment in foreign operation Where a foreign currency liability or derivative financial instrument is a formally designated hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, foreign exchange differences arising on translation of the foreign currency liability or changes in the fair value of the financial instrument are recognised directly in equity to the extent the hedge is effective.
The Company assesses the effectiveness of its net investment hedges based on fair value changes of its net assets, including relevant goodwill designated as foreign currency assets, and the fair value changes of both the debt designated as a hedge and the relevant financial instrument.
g Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions from 1 January 2004 is recognised as an intangible asset at the date of acquisition.
The cost of the asset recognised is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired entity and associated costs.
On an ongoing basis the goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment.
Fair value adjustments are calculated at the earliest opportunity within 12 months of acquisition.
Goodwill is allocated to the cash generating unit acquired, or in the case of an acquisition of multiple cash generating units, goodwill is apportioned to each cash generating unit in proportion to the earnings multiple used for the business valuation at the time of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998 was deducted from reserves in the year of acquisition.
In accordance with IFRS1 First time adoption of IFRS such goodwill continues as a deduction from reserves and is not recognised in the income statement in the event of disposal of the cash generating unit to which it relates.
70 IMI plc Annual Report 2009 68845 IMI AR pp61-75:Layout 1 22 3 10 12:18 Page 71 Goodwill arising on acquisitions after 1 January 1998 was previously capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised on a straight-line basis over a maximum 20 years.
The unamortised goodwill under UK GAAP at 31 December 2003 became the opening goodwill under the Groups transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary represents the excess of the cost of the additional investment over the carrying amount of the net assets acquired at that date.
ii Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised provided benefits are probable, cost can be reliably measured and if, and only if, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources and intention to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and directly attributable overheads.
Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment.
iii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group as part of a business combination are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy on Impairment.
Cost reflects managements judgement of the fair value at the date of acquisition of the individual intangible asset calculated by reference to the net present value of future benefits accruing to the Group from utilisation of the asset, discounted at an appropriate discount rate.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
iv Amortisation of intangible assets other than goodwill Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis unless such a basis is not aligned with the anticipated benefit over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets.
Amortisation commences from the date the intangible asset becomes available for use.
The estimated maximum useful lives are as follows: Capitalised development costs 5 years Customer relationships Life of the intangible asset up to 10 years Order book Period of the outstanding order book Other intangible assets Life of the intangible asset up to 10 years h Property, plant and equipment Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment.
Where an item of property, plant and equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Costs in respect of tooling owned by the Group for clearly identifiable new products are capitalised net of any contribution received from customers.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis unless such a basis is not aligned with the anticipated benefit so as to write down the cost of assets to residual values over the period of their estimated useful lives within the following ranges: Freehold buildings 25 to 50 years Plant and machinery 3 to 20 years Tooling Life of related product maximum 10 years IMI plc Annual Report 2009 71 68845 IMI AR pp61-75:Layout 1 22 3 10 12:19 Page 72 notes to the financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies continued i Leased assets Leases where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Plant and equipment acquired by way of finance lease is stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation see previous page and impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
The majority of leasing transactions entered into by the Group are operating leases.
j Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In respect of work in progress and finished goods, cost includes all direct costs of production and the appropriate proportion of production overheads.
k Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
l Impairment The carrying values of the Groups non-financial assets other than inventories see accounting policy Inventories and deferred tax assets see accounting policy Income tax, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or all assets within its cash generating unit is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is evaluated at each balance sheet date.
i Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of the Groups receivables other than financial assets held at fair value is calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate inherent in the asset.
Receivables with a short duration of less than one year are not discounted.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use an individual assessment is made of the estimated future cash flows generated for each cash generating unit based upon the latest Group three year plan and extrapolated using an appropriate long-term growth rate for each cash generating unit in perpetuity consistent with long term GDP growth are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Management believe that this approach, including the use of the indefinite cash flow projection, is appropriate based upon historical experience and as this is one of the bases management utilise to evaluate the fair value of investment opportunities.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the smallest cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
ii Reversals of impairment As required by IAS36 Impairment of Assets, any impairment of goodwill or available for sale financial assets is non-reversible.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if at the balance sheet date there are indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists following a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
72 IMI plc Annual Report 2009 68845 IMI AR pp61-75:Layout 1 20 3 10 07:13 Page 14 An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
m Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by the Companys shareholders or by the subsidiary shareholders in respect of dividends to non-controlling interests.
n Employee benefits i Defined contribution pension plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
ii Defined benefit pension plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds of the appropriate currency that have durations approximating those of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in a net asset to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the net total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan and restricted by any relevant asset ceiling.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised in profit or loss in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in equity and disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income.
iii Long-term service benefits The Groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on high quality bonds of the appropriate currency that have durations approximating those of the Groups obligations.
iv Equity and equity-related compensation benefits The Group operates an Executive Share Option Scheme, a SAYE Share Option Scheme, an All Employee Share Ownership Plan, a Deferred Bonus Plan, a Share Matching Plan and a Performance Share Plan.
For options granted on or after 7 November 2002, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense each year.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, profitability and sales growth targets.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
The fair value of the options is determined based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
IMI plc Annual Report 2009 73 68845 IMI AR pp61-75:Layout 1 22 3 10 12:21 Page 74 notes to the financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies continued o Provisions Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are valued at managements best estimate of the amount required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly.
p Revenue i Sale of products Revenue from the sale of products is recognised in the income statement net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer and reliable measurement is possible.
No revenue is recognised where recovery of the consideration is not probable or there are significant uncertainties regarding associated costs, or the possible return of goods.
Transfers of risks and rewards vary depending on the nature of the products sold and the individual terms of the contract of sale.
Sales made under internationally accepted trade terms, Incoterms 2000, are recognised as revenue when the Group has completed the primary duties required to transfer risks as defined by the International Chamber of Commerce Official Rules for the Interpretation of Trade Terms.
Sales made outside of Incoterms 2000 are generally recognised on delivery to the customer.
ii Services Revenue from services rendered is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the service at the balance sheet date.
The stage of completion is assessed by reference to the contractual agreement with each separate customer.
Installation fees are recognised as revenue by reference to the stage of completion on the installation unless they are incidental to the sale of the goods, in which case they are recognised when the goods are sold.
iii Construction contracts Revenue from significant machinery or valve contracts is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract by reference to the specific contract terms unless the contract contains discrete components separately transferring risks and rewards to the customer.
Where separate components are present revenue is recognised on each component in accordance with the policy on the sale of products.
q Exceptional items Exceptional items are disclosed separately where either the quantum, the one-off nature or volatility of these items would otherwise distort the underlying trading performance.
The following items of income and expense are considered to be exceptional in these financial statements: Restructuring costs, which comprise significant costs associated with the closure of activities or factories and the cost of significant reductions in workforce due to excess capacity or the reorganisation of facilities: Costs and fines associated with the US Department of Justices investigation in respect of certain irregular payments within the Severe Service Business: The amortisation of acquired intangible fixed assets and impairment of assets: Gains and losses including fair value adjustments on derivative financial instruments and the reversal of economic hedge contract gains and losses within segmental profit.
The tax impact of the above items is also shown within exceptional items.
74 IMI plc Annual Report 2009 68845 IMI AR pp61-75:Layout 1 20 3 10 07:13 Page 16 r Financial income and expense Financial income comprises interest receivable on funds invested, assumed returns on employee benefit plan assets, income from investments and gains on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on the asset.
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date that the dividend is declared.
Financial expense comprises interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, the interest related element of derivatives, assumed interest on employee benefit plan liabilities and losses on financial instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
The interest expense component of finance lease payments is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
s Income tax Current tax represents the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and taking into account any adjustments in respect of prior years.
Deferred tax is provided, using the balance sheet method, on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that the timing of the reversal of the differences can be controlled and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse, based on the tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
t Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Where applicable, on initial classification as held for sale, non-current disposal groups are recognised at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment losses on the initial classification of assets as held for sale are included in profit or loss, even for assets measured at fair value, as are gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business that has been disposed of, is held for sale or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale or if directly related to the disposal of a discontinued operation in a prior period.
Reclassifications To assist the user of the accounts, the consolidated income statement has been presented in a columnar format with exceptional items shown on the face of the statement.
Items included within exceptional items are described in note 1 q of these accounts.
The 2008 comparative consolidated income statement has been reclassified on a comparable basis.
There is no change to total revenue, operating profit, profit before tax, earnings per share or net assets as a result of this reclassification.
There is no change in the value or nature of items, reported on the face of the statement other than the amount described as profit before tax before restructuring, investigation costs and fines, acquired intangible amortisation and impairment, other income and financial instruments excluding economic hedge contract gains and losses is now described as profit before tax and exceptional items.
The reconciliation of the tax effective tax rate note 8 c has been reclassified to be consistent with the income statement format.
IMI plc Annual Report 2009 75 68845 IMI AR pp76-93:Layout 1 20 3 10 07:14 Page 1 notes to the financial statements 3.
Segmental information Segmental information is presented in the consolidated financial statements for each of the Group's operating segments.
The operating segment reporting format reflects the Group's management and internal reporting structures.
The Group includes the following five operating segments and activities: Fluid Controls Severe Service Design, manufacture, supply and service of high performance critical control valves and associated equipment for power generation plants, oil & gas producers and other process industries.
Fluid Power Design, manufacture and supply of motion and fluid control systems, principally pneumatic devices, for original equipment manufacturers in commercial vehicle, life science, process, rail, packaging, print and other industries.
Indoor Climate Design, manufacture and supply of indoor climate control systems, principally balancing valves for large commercial buildings and thermostatic radiator valves for residential buildings.
Retail Dispense Beverage Dispense Design, manufacture and supply of still and carbonated beverage dispense systems and associated merchandising equipment for brand owners and retailers.
Merchandising Design, manufacture and supply of point of purchase display systems for brand owners and retailers.
Information regarding the operations of each reporting segment is included below.
Performance is measured based on segmental operating profit before restructuring, Severe Service investigation costs and fines and acquired intangible amortisation and impairment.
Segmental operating profit is also reported to the Chief Executive as if economic currency and metals hedges were effective for financial reporting purposes.
Businesses enter into forward currency and metal contracts to provide economic hedges against the impact on profitability of swings in rates and values in accordance with the Group's policy to minimise the risk of volatility in revenues, costs and margins.
Segmental operating profits are therefore charged credited with the impact of these contracts.
In accordance with IAS39, these contracts do not meet the technical provisions required for hedge accounting and gains and losses are reversed out of segmental profit and are recorded in net financial income and expense for the purposes of the statutory consolidated income statement.

Acquisitions 4.1 Controlling interests On 17 December 2009 the Group acquired the assets of NASS Parts and Service for a consideration of 1.4m.
The fair value of the net assets acquired was 0.4m resulting in goodwill of 1.0m.
The result of this acquisition will be reported within Beverage Dispense, however there was no impact on the 2009 results.
Had NASS Parts and Service been acquired at the beginning of the year Group revenue would have been 3m higher and the impact on profit before tax would not have been material.
There were no acquisitions in 2008.
4.2 Non-controlling interests On 1 January 2009 the remaining 19.1% non-controlling interest in Display Technologies LLC, part of the Merchandising group, was acquired by the Group under the terms of the original purchase agreement.
At that date the net assets of the company were 6.3m.
Based on the contracted pricing mechanism the cash consideration paid was 18.1m, resulting in goodwill of 16.9m.
Display Technologies LLC was originally acquired in June 2001.
In December 2009 the Group exercised its option to purchase the remaining 30% non-controlling interest in Pneumatex AG, the controlling interest in which was originally acquired on 28 December 2007.
The exercise of the purchase option in December was unconditional and the whole controlling interest accordingly passed to IMI at that date.
It is expected that this acquisition will be finalised in the first half of 2010.
The consideration of 12.2m is accrued at 31 December 2009 resulting in goodwill of 6.1m.

Earnings per ordinary share The weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, net of shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares or to satisfy share option vesting, was 318.8m, 321.0m diluted for the effect of outstanding share options 2008: 319.3m, 321.6m diluted.
Basic and diluted earnings per share have been calculated on earnings of 130.2m 2008: 112.9m.
The directors consider that adjusted earnings per share figures, using earnings as calculated below, give a more meaningful indication of the underlying performance because either the quantum, the one off nature, or volatility of these items would otherwise distort the underlying performance.

Management believe that the key assumptions on which the carrying value of goodwill is based are appropriate and any reasonable change in these assumptions would not lead to a materially different conclusion.
Each cash generating unit reviewed for impairments is assessed to identify appropriate assumptions to use when carrying out any impairment test.
Following this review the key assumptions to be used in the year are the forecast year three cash flows and the pre-tax discount rates.
For goodwill impairment reviews the recoverable amount is based on value in use.
Forecast year three cash flows are extrapolated into perpetuity at a 2.25% growth rate which is considered to be consistent with the long term average growth rate for the industry because the Group has a three year planning cycle which assumes each individual business continues in operation for the foreseeable future.
For the reviews undertaken in the year the recoverable amount was assessed on the basis of discounted forecast cash flows.
Pre-tax discount rates of between 10% and 15% are applied in determining the recoverable amounts of cash generating units.
The discount rates are estimated based on the Groups cost of capital, which is calculated after consideration of market information and are risk adjusted for individual units circumstances.
The Group has approximately 30 cash generating units to which goodwill is attached and no single cash generating unit represents a significant proportion of the total goodwill.
The Groups estimates of impairments of goodwill are most sensitive to increases in the discount rate used and the long term growth rates used in the forecast cash flows.
These growth rates vary significantly depending on the circumstances of each cash generating unit and have been based on the business reviews carried out in the year.
The aggregate amount of goodwill arising from acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004 which had been deducted from the profit and loss reserves and incorporated into the IFRS transitional balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 amounted to 364m.
IMI plc Annual Report 2009 85 68845 IMI AR pp76-93:Layout 1 22 3 10 13:23 Page 86 notes to the financial statements 12.
Depreciation for the year on these assets was 0.6m 2008: 0.3m.
The majority of the tax losses have no expiry date, and the assets have not been recognised due to uncertainty over their recoverability.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 198.3m 2008: 192.3m.
It is likely that the majority of the overseas earnings would qualify for the UK dividend exemption and therefore the tax liability that would arise is not expected to exceed 3.0m 2008: 3.5m.

Financial risk management Overview The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
As described in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 44 and 45, this responsibility has been assigned to the Executive Committee with support and feedback from the Audit Committee and the IMI Group Assurance Department as described below.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The IMI Group Assurance Department undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
The Groups funding and liquidity as well as its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange and base metal price movements are managed centrally by IMIs treasury function.
Treasury uses a combination of derivatives and conventional financial instruments to manage the underlying risks.
These derivatives and financial instruments themselves introduce exposure to the following risks: Credit risk Liquidity risk Market risk This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, including each of the above risks, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers, cash and cash equivalents held by the Groups banks and other financial assets.
Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
Approximately 3% 2008: 4% of the Groups revenue is attributable to sales transactions with our largest single customer.
Geographically there is no unusual concentration of credit risk.
The Groups contract approval procedure ensures that large contracts are signed off at executive director level at which time the potential credit risks are reviewed.
Credit risk is minimised through cash flow management and the use of documentary credits where appropriate.
Counterparty risk A group of relationship banks provides the bulk of the banking services with pre-approved credit limits set for each institution.
Financial derivatives are entered into with these core banks and the underlying credit exposure to these instruments is included when considering the credit exposure to the counterparties.
At the end of 2009 credit exposure including cash deposited did not exceed 8m with any single institution 2008: 20m.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have adequate resources, to meet its liabilities when due, with sufficient headroom to cope with abnormal market conditions.
This position is formally reviewed on a quarterly basis.
Funding for the Group is co-ordinated centrally by the treasury function and comprises committed bilateral facilities with a core group of banks, and a series of US Loan Note issues.
The level of facilities is maintained such that facilities and term loans exceed the forecast peak gross debt of the Group over a rolling 12 month view by an appropriate level taking into account market conditions and corporate activity.
At the end of 2009 the Group had undrawn committed facilities totalling 277m 2008: 154m and was holding cash and cash equivalents of 81.0m 2008: 123.9m.
As described in the Financial Review the Group was successful during 2009 in raising additional medium and long term funding to maintain its funding headroom.
IMI plc Annual Report 2009 89 68845 IMI AR pp76-93:Layout 1 22 3 10 13:27 Page 90 notes to the financial statements 18.
Financial risk management continued Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holding of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters.
Under the management of the central treasury function, the Group enters into derivatives in the ordinary course of business, and also manages financial liabilities, in order to mitigate market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Executive Committee.
Currency risk The Group publishes consolidated accounts in Sterling but conducts much of its global business in other currencies.
As a result it is subject to the risks associated with foreign exchange movements affecting transaction costs transactions, translation of foreign profits profit translation and translation of the underlying net assets of foreign operations asset translation.
Transactions The Groups wide geographic spread both in terms of cost base and customer locations helps to reduce the impact on profitability of swings in exchange rates as well as creating opportunities for central netting of exposures.
It is the Groups policy to minimise risk to exchange rate movements affecting sales and purchases by economically hedging or netting currency exposures at the time of commitment, or when there is a high probability of future commitment, using currency instruments primarily forward exchange contracts.
A proportion of forecast exposures are hedged depending on the level of confidence and hedging is topped up following regular reviews.
On this basis up to 50% of the Groups annual exposures are likely to be hedged at any point in time.
The Groups net transactional exposure varies from time to time, but at the end of 2009 its forecast exposure for 2010, net of existing hedging derivative instruments, was short Continental European currencies, Mexican Pesos and Chinese Yuan, but long US Dollar and other non-Sterling currencies.
Profit translation The Group is exposed to the translation of profits denominated in foreign currencies into the Sterling based income statement.
The interest cost related to the currency liabilities hedging the asset base provides a partial hedge to this exposure.
Short term currency option contracts may be used to provide limited protection against Sterling strength on an opportunistic basis.
The translation of US Dollar and Euro based profits remain the primary risk to the Group.
Asset translation The Group hedges its net investments in its major overseas operations by way of external currency loans and currency forward contracts.
The intention is to manage the Groups exposure to gains and losses in Group equity resulting from retranslation of currency net assets at balance sheet dates.
To the extent that an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation is determined to be an effective hedge, the gain or loss arising is recognised directly in reserves.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Detail of the quantum and management of this exposure is provided in note 18.1.
Interest rate risk As a result of the Groups management of its asset translation risks, it is exposed to a number of global interest rates the most important of which are US, Eurozone and UK rates.
The analysis of this exposure is shown in note 18.2 of these financial statements.
The Group adopts a policy of maintaining a portion of its liabilities at fixed interest rates and reviewing the balance of the floating rate exposure to ensure that if interest rates rise globally the effect on the Groups income statement is manageable.
90 IMI plc Annual Report 2009 68845 IMI AR pp76-93:Layout 1 22 3 10 13:28 Page 91 The Group has raised US Dollar debt through the issuance of medium to long term fixed rate Loan Notes.
In order to manage its exposure to interest rates, US$30m of this fixed rate exposure was hedged back to floating through the use of interest rate swaps in 1999 covering loan notes with a maturity of 2014.
The interest component of the fair value of this portion of the Loan Notes has been designated as a hedged item and has been revalued accordingly in the accounts.
The fair value of these interest rate swaps is included in the balance sheet at 4.0m 2008: 5.9m.
The hedged item is included in the value of the debt as an increase in liability of 4.0m 2008: increase 6.0m.
Exposure to other interest rate volatility is managed through a combination of fixed rate debt and derivative instruments where appropriate.
Commodity risk The Groups operating companies purchase metal and metal components with an annual base metal material value of approximately 20m 2008: 30m.
It manages this exposure through a centralised process hedging copper, zinc, aluminium and nickel designed to protect short term margins.
The exposure is managed using a combination of financial contracts and local supply agreements in order to minimise the short term impact of metal price volatility.
Balance sheet management The Boards policy is to maintain a balance sheet with a broad capital base and the strength to sustain the future development of the business.
The Board monitors both the demographic spread of its shareholders and employees are encouraged to hold shares in the Company.
The Board also monitors economic profit created and seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages of security afforded by a sound capital position.
The primary financial covenants in the Groups banking arrangements relate to Net Debt to EBITDA and Net Interest to EBITDA ratios.
The Group comfortably complied with these covenants during 2009.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to balance sheet management during the year.

Floating rate liabilities comprise short term debt which bears interest at short term bank rates and the liability side of exchange contracts where the interest element is based primarily on three month inter bank rate.
All cash surpluses are invested for short periods and are considered as floating rate investments.
Non-interest bearing financial assets and liabilities including short term trade receivables and payables have been excluded from the above two analyses.

Under IAS39, all derivative financial instruments not in a hedge relationship are classified as derivatives at fair value through the income statement.
The Group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes and transacts all derivatives with suitable investment grade counterparties.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
94 IMI plc Annual Report 2009 68845 IMI AR pp94-109:Layout 1 20 3 10 07:23 Page 95 Valuations Cash and cash equivalents, bank overdrafts, short term borrowings, trade payables, trade receivables and other assets are carried at their book values as this approximates to their fair value due to the short term nature of the instruments.
Long term borrowings, apart from any which are subject to hedging arrangements, are evaluated by the Group based on parameters such as interest rates and relevant credit spreads.
Based on this analysis these liabilities are carried at amortised cost as the fair values are not materially different.
Long term borrowings which are subject to hedging arrangements are valued using appropriate discount rates to value the relevant hedged cash flows.
Derivative assets and liabilities, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and metal commodity hedges, are valued using comparable observed market prices and a valuation model using foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves for the underlying commodities.
Investments are primarily in publically quoted pooled funds held to fund overseas unfunded pension liabilities.
The fair value is based on the price quotation at the reporting date.
Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
All long term borrowings which are subject to hedging arrangements and derivative assets and liabilities are valued by Level 2 techniques.
Investments are valued by Level 1 techniques.

96 IMI plc Annual Report 2009 68845 IMI AR pp94-109:Layout 1 22 3 10 18:54 Page 97 18.7 Market risk sensitivity analysis on financial instruments As described elsewhere in this note 18, the Group uses financial instruments including debt and derivatives to reduce its underlying balance sheet and income statement exposure to volatility in interest rates, currency rates and base metal commodity prices.
In estimating the sensitivity of the financial instruments we have assumed a reasonable potential change in interest rates, currency rates or metal prices.
The method used assumes that all other variables are held constant to determine the impact on profit before tax and equity.
The analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.
The outputs from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the impact of market risk assuming that the specified changes occur only to the financial instruments and do not reflect the opposite movement from the impact of the specific change on the underlying business.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimates due to the movements in the underlying transactions, actions taken to mitigate any potential losses, the interaction of more than one sensitivity occurring, and further developments in global financial markets.
As such this table should not be considered as a projection of likely future gains and losses in these financial instruments.

As noted, it is the Groups policy to use financial instruments to manage its underlying exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange and base metal price movements.
In accordance with this policy, the Group is confident that the underlying risks that these financial instruments have been acquired to hedge will move in an opposite direction.
To the extent that the underlying currency, interest rate or metals price exposure is not fully hedged, the Group will remain exposed to movements in these variables.

The mortality assumptions used for the Fund reflect its experience, together with an allowance for improvements over time.
The experience was reviewed as part of the formal triennial actuarial valuation carried out as at 31 March 2008, and the assumptions used as at 31 December 2009 reflect the results of this review.
The table below shows the implied life expectancy from age 65 for the Funds current and future pensioners based on the assumptions adopted.
The allowance for future improvements in mortality rates from 2008 is in line with the published medium cohort rates, with a minimum annual rate of improvement of 1%.

As set out in a above the IMI Pension Fund constitutes 85% of the total liabilities and 89% of the total assets for the Groups long-term employee benefit arrangements as at 31 December 2009.
It is therefore appropriate to consider the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions in respect of the Fund and these are illustrated below.
Increase in defined benefit liability as at 31 December 2009 m Real discount rate 0.1% pa lower 17 Increase of one year in life expectancy from age 65 30 10% fall in equity markets 50 in each case all other assumptions are unchanged.
Share-based payments The Group operates the following share-based payment schemes: SAYE savings-related share option scheme This scheme is open to the majority of the Groups UK employees, including the executive directors, and allows the grant of options to all participants at a discount of up to 20% below the market price.
Such schemes are not subject to performance conditions and offer tax incentives to encourage employees to use their own money to purchase shares in the business.
SAYE options are exercisable within 6 months of the exercise date and otherwise expire.
Executive Share Option Scheme Executive share options were last awarded to executive directors in 2004 and to certain other employees in 2005 under the Executive Share Option 1995 Scheme which expired in May 2005.
All outstanding options granted under this scheme were granted subject to stretching tiered performance conditions related to growth in earnings per share above inflation over a fixed period of three financial years.
Executive share options expire if not exercised or lapsed within the periods shown below.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP awards were made in 2005 as part of the transition to new long term incentive arrangements introduced in 2005.
The LTIP allows cash awards to executive directors and selected senior managers within the Group subject to certain performance conditions.
At the end of the performance period, the net of tax value of any LTIP payments can or in the case of executive directors, must normally be invested in market purchases of the Companys ordinary shares pursuant to a deferred share plan.
Such share purchases are to be made through an employee trust and held for a further three year period.
After that period, matching shares are awarded of one additional share for every four with no further performance conditions.
Performance Share Plan PSP These are open to the executive directors and selected senior managers within the Group.
For awards granted prior to April 2009, 50% of these PSP shares vest subject to EPS growth, based on internal financial performance conditions.
Hence, for purposes of IFRS2, the fair value of the shares does not include any performance related discount.
The plan uses TSR total shareholder return as a performance condition for the other 50% of shares granted.
As TSR is a market based performance condition, the accounting treatment differs from that for shares subject to internal performance conditions.
This means that the TSR performance condition must be incorporated into the calculation of the fair value, that is, there is a TSR related discount in calculating the fair value.
For awards granted in 2009, 100% of the shares granted vest subject to TSR as the performance condition.
The accounting treatment is in line with that outlined above, but for 100% of the award.
Deferred Bonus Plan DBP Under the DBP, for executive directors and selected senior managers, a proportion of earned annual bonus will be mandatorily deferred for three years, and delivered in shares in the Company.
Qualifying employees may also elect to voluntarily defer all or part of the remainder of their annual bonus.
Additional shares, in the form of a matching award, may be earned to a maximum of 100%, or 125% for the Chief Executive, of the deferred bonus at the entry share price level if stretching performance conditions are met by the Company over the three year deferral period.
Share Matching Plan SMP In 2009, the DBP was amended and renamed, to become the SMP.
Under this plan, executive directors and selected senior managers cash incentive payments are governed by their achievement of a Share Ownership Guideline SOG.
The SOG is a requirement to hold a percentage of salary as IMI shares, and if achieved, any incentive payment is made in cash.
If not achieved, a proportion of earned annual bonus will be mandatorily deferred for three years, and delivered in shares in the Company.
Qualifying employees may also elect to voluntarily defer all or part of the remainder of their annual bonus, and invest personal funds, up to a maximum of 100% of incentive opportunity.
Additional shares, in the form of a matching award, may be earned to a maximum of 200% of the investment made at the entry share price level if stretching performance conditions are met by the Company over the three year deferral period.
Share Option Plan SOP Share Option awards were made in 2009 to selected senior managers and certain other employees under the Share Option Plan, adopted in 2009.
These awards are not subject to performance conditions, but are subject to a three year vesting period.

The options previously reported as Long Term Incentive Plan options, Performance Share Plan options and Deferred Bonus Plan options have been combined within Options with performance conditions.
In both cases these schemes have substantially similar arrangements.
Options with performance conditions were granted with an option price of nil.
The weighted average remaining contractual life for the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2009 is 7.46 years 2008: 6.35 years.
Included in these balances are share options that have not been recognised in accordance with IFRS2 as the options were granted on or before 7 November 2002.
These options have not been subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS2.
The number of these share options outstanding was as follows: 1 January 2008: 326,534 31 December 2008 and 1 January 2009: 258,131 31 December 2009: 78,772 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise of share options exercised during the period was 3.94 2008: 4.72.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The assumptions used for grants in 2009 included a dividend yield of 7.6% 2008: 5.1%, expected share price volatility of 30% 2008: 30%, a weighted average expected life of 3.7 years 2008: 3.7 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.0% 2008: 4.5%.
The expected volatility is wholly based on the historic volatility calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the share options, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
The total expenses recognised for the period arising from share-based payments are as follows: 2009 2008 m m Equity settled share-based payment expense in employee cost in the income statement including 2.5m 2008: 2.0m in respect of directors 4.1 3.9 IMI plc Annual Report 2009 105 68845 IMI AR pp94-109:Layout 1 22 3 10 16:08 Page 106 notes to the financial statements 21.

The provision balance reflects residual amounts committed but not spent in relation to a number of specific projects to reorganise operations and facilities.
On 3 August 2009 the Group announced its agreement to a settlement with the US Department of Justice in respect of certain irregular payments by a US subsidiary Control Components Inc CCI.
As part of a plea agreement CCI has paid a fine of $18.2m, which has been utilised against the provision for investigation costs and fines.
CCI is also subject to oversight by an independent compliance monitor.
Provision has been made for the costs associated with the monitor over the three year monitor appointment period.
Related to this same matter CCI continues to liaise with customers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions outside the US and the cost of resolving certain investigation related legal matters has been provided for.
Also related to the activities of the former management team of CCI, an investigation has been completed into possible incidental breaches of US trade law by CCI.
The likelihood of further penalties in this matter is now considered remote and accordingly this element of the provision made at 31 December 2008 has been released.
Trade warranties are given in the normal course of business and cover a range of periods, typically of 1-2 years but can be longer, with the expected amounts falling due less than one year included in creditors.
Other provisions are mainly environmental provisions, recognising the Group's obligation to remediate contaminated land at a number of current and former sites.
Because of the long term nature of the liability, the timescales are uncertain and the provision represents management's best estimates of these costs.

Commitments Group contracts in respect of future capital expenditure which had been placed at the balance sheet date amounted to 13.9m 2008: 9.2m.
Contingencies Following completion of the European Commission investigations into allegations of anti-competitive behaviour in the EU among certain manufacturers of copper tube and copper fittings, the Company has paid fines of 31.3m in February 2005 and 32.8m in January 2007.
Both of these fines are the subject of ongoing appeals.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors have not anticipated the outcome of either appeal due to the inherent uncertainty of such processes.
Group contingent liabilities relating to guarantees in the normal course of business and other items amounted to 76m 2008: 80m.
Related party transactions Transactions between the company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.
Directors are considered to be the key management personnel and detailed information concerning directors emoluments, shareholding, options and retirement benefits are shown in the audited section of the Remuneration Report.
There are no other related party transactions.
Post balance sheet events On 3 March 2010 the Group and the Trustee of the IMI Pension Fund which constitutes around 85% of the total liabilities of the Groups long term employee benefit arrangements as at 31 December 2009 entered into consultation with the active members of the fund concerning a proposal to close the fund to future accrual with effect from 30 September 2010.
If the consultation does result in closure to future accrual it is estimated that there would be a curtailment gain of approximately 10m.
The overall impact on the income statement, cash flows and balance sheet will be dependent on the outcome of the consultation.
