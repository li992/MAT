Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements h Convertible bond The 112m 3.625% convertible bond due 2014 was issued in May 2007.
Unless previously redeemed, converted, purchased or cancelled the bond is convertible at any time up to 12 May 2014 into fully paid up ordinary shares at a conversion price of 8.64.
The convertible bond is a compound financial instrument and the carrying amount has been allocated to its equity and liability components in the group balance sheet.
The liability component has been determined by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component.
The discount rate used for this was based on a rate of 7.5% compounded semi-annually.
The liability component has been deducted from the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the residual element has been assigned to the equity component.
The liability element is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
i Share-based payments Under the share-based compensation arrangements set out in Note 1 l iii on page 56, employees of Grainger Employees Limited have been awarded options and conditional shares in the company.
These share-based arrangements have been treated as equity-settled in the Group consolidated financial statements.
In the company accounts the share-based payment charge has been added to the cost of investment in subsidiaries with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
