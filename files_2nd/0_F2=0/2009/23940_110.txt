FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS EXPOSURE TO RISK AND RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES CONTINUED The Board with the assistance of the Investment Manager monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This includes a review of: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Investment Managers view of the market: the need to buy back equity shares, either for cancellation or to hold in treasury, in light of any share price discount to net asset value per share in accordance with the Companys share buyback policy: the need for new issues of equity shares, including issues from treasury: and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
The Company is also subject to several externally imposed capital requirements and are as follows: as a public company, the Company has a minimum share capital of 50,000: and in order to be able to pay dividends out of profits available for distribution, the Company has to be able to meet one of the two capital restriction tests imposed on investment companies by company law.
These requirements are unchanged since last year and the Company has complied with them.

Securities listed on a recognised stock exchange are generally regarded as being readily convertible into cash.
However, under the terms of the Companys Articles of Association, sums with Other capital reserves are available for distribution only by way of redemption or purchase of any of the Companys own shares.
In addition, in order to maintain investment trust status, the Company may only distribute by way of dividend accumulated revenue profits.
CONTINGENT ASSETS On 5 November 2007 the European Court of Justice ruled that management fees should be exempt from VAT.
HMRC has announced its intention not to appeal against this case to the UK VAT Tribunal.
The Companys previous Investment Manager is currently in the process of quantifying any potential repayment that might be due.
However, the amount the Company may receive and the time scale for receipt are all uncertain and hence the Company has made no provision in these financial statements for any such repayment.
