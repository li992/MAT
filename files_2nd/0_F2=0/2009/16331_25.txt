These are calculated as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Profit from operations 76,036 64,074 Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition 26,303 13,017 Profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment net of property-related provisions 5,009 - Headline operating profit 97,330 77,091 Profit loss before tax 107,898 2,888 Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition 26,303 13,017 Profit loss on fair value movements on derivatives 55,630 62,069 Profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment net of property-related provisions 5,009 - Loss on closing out foreign currency hedging contracts 15,924 - Headline profit before tax 89,486 72,198 Cash generated by operations see note 27 120,944 94,579 Purchase of property, plant and equipment 10,042 14,198 Proceeds on disposal of property, plant and equipment 3,062 1,231 Expenditure on product development and other intangibles 2,352 1,941 Purchase of Long-Term Incentive Plan shares - 674 Operating cash flow 111,612 78,997 Headline operating profit has been shown before the amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions, which relates to acquired intellectual property, customer relationships and profit in acquired order book.
To maintain a consistent presentation of financial performance over the longer term, this charge has been excluded from headline operating profit.
In addition, headline operating profit is stated before the profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment net of property-related provisions, which includes the net profit recognised on the disposal of the Armitage Road, Rugeley property and is after deducting a dilapidations provision relating to a number of properties that are approaching their lease expiry dates.
Headline profit before tax and headline earnings per share see note 12 are also presented before these adjustments.
60 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 2 Additional performance measures continued IAS 39 requires the Group to fair value the derivative instruments used to manage Ultras foreign exchange exposures.
This creates volatility in the valuation of the outstanding instruments as exchange rates move over time.
This will have minimal impact on profit over the full term of the instruments, but can cause significant volatility on particular balance sheet dates.
Following the significant exchange rate movements that occurred in the latter part of 2008, the Group reviewed its level of hedging cover for the next two years and reduced it to match the expected net inflow of US dollars.
In doing so, during 2009, the Group incurred oneoff costs of 15.9m associated with closing out the hedging contracts.
These costs do not affect the underlying operating performance of the Group.
Ultra is therefore stating headline profit before tax and headline earnings per share see note 12 before changes in the valuation of its foreign currency derivative instruments and the costs associated with the reduction in the level of hedging cover so that the headline operating performance of the Group can be seen more clearly.
The Group is cash generative and reinvests funds to support the continuing growth of the business.
It seeks to use an accurate and appropriate measure of the funds generated internally while sustaining this growth.
For this, Ultra uses operating cash flow, rather than cash generated by operations, as its preferred indicator of cash generated and available to cover non-operating expenses such as tax and interest payments.
The Group believes that using cash generated by operations, with the exclusion of net expenditure on property, plant and equipment and outflows for capitalised product development and other intangibles, would result in an understatement of the true cash cost of sustaining a growing business.

The amortisation of intangible assets charge is included within administrative expenses.
Purchase price adjustments relating to acquisitions made during 2008, together with a re-assessment of the fair value of net assets for acquisitions made during 2008 and a reduction to the fair value of deferred consideration payable has resulted in adjustments to goodwill of 1,458,000.
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, typically as follows: Intellectual property 5 to 10 years Customer relationships 3 to 10 years Development costs 2 to 10 years Software 3 to 5 years Patents and trademarks 10 to 20 years Profit in acquired order book 1 to 3 years 66 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 13 Intangible assets continued Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the Cash Generating Units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
These consist of the Groups operating businesses.
Goodwill has been allocated to CGUs as set out below: 2009 2008 000 000 Dascam 8,804 7,792 Electrics 9,117 9,358 Other 12,992 15,685 Aircraft & Vehicle Systems 30,913 32,835 Airport Systems 27,803 24,888 Command & Control Systems 16,542 13,849 NSPI 11,666 11,500 ProLogic 28,084 26,343 Other 6,101 7,625 Information & Power Systems 90,196 84,205 DNE Technologies 17,053 19,131 Maritime Systems 13,770 14,752 Tactical Communication Systems 19,402 19,398 UnderSea Sensor Systems Inc 18,353 18,847 Other 22,025 20,394 Tactical & Sonar Systems 90,603 92,522 Total Ultra Electronics 211,712 209,562 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Following a detailed review, no impairment losses have been recognised in the year.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
In determining the value-in-use for each CGU, the Group prepares cash flows derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plan.
These plans, which have been approved by the Board, include detailed financial forecasts and market analysis covering the expected development of each CGU over the next five years.
The cash flows beyond this period are then extrapolated for the next five years using a growth rate of nil per cent.
The goodwill allocated to eight CGUs is considered to be individually significant.
Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations for these CGUs were as follows: Tax rate Post tax applied to discount rate cash flows Airport Systems 8.5% 28% Command & Control Systems 8.5% 28% Dascam 8.5% nil% Electrics 8.5% 28% NSPI 8.5% 35% ProLogic 8.5% 35% DNE Technologies 8.5% 35% Maritime Systems 8.5% 33% Tactical Communication Systems 8.5% 32% UnderSea Sensor Systems Inc 8.5% 35% There was significant headroom within all the value-in-use calculations.
Additionally, sensitivity analysis has indicated that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used would result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.
The net book value of plant and machinery held under finance leases was nil 2008: 115,000.
Depreciation charged in the year on assets held under finance leases was 25,000 2008: 33,000.

The average credit period on sale of goods is 43 days 2008: 46 days.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are major high street banks.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Group has only one customer that individually accounted for greater than 10% of sales.
This customer is considered to have low credit risk.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements see note 22 net of any allowances for losses represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The ageing profile of unprovided overdue debtors was as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 1 to 3 months 8,774 14,070 4 to 6 months 1,851 1,893 7 to 9 months 416 294 Over 9 months 257 38 Total overdue 11,298 16,295 The Group provides against its trade receivables where there are serious doubts as to future recoverability which is based on the length of time that the receivable has been overdue.
All trade receivables that have been overdue for more than a year are provided for in full.
Movement in the provision for trade receivables was as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Balance at beginning of year 1,908 527 Foreign exchange differences 40 31 Increase in provision for trade receivables regarded as potentially uncollectable 70 1,388 Decrease in provision for trade receivables recovered during the year 826 38 Balance at end of year 1,112 1,908 70 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 19 Trade and other payables 2009 2008 000 000 Amounts included in current liabilities: Trade payables 54,877 61,350 Amounts due to contract customers note 17 39,105 32,562 Other payables 24,655 38,674 Accruals and deferred income 50,916 38,573 169,553 171,159 Amounts included in non current liabilities: Amounts due to contract customers note 17 2,467 4,545 Other payables 11,946 15,970 Accruals and deferred income 3,610 1,349 18,023 21,864 20 Finance leases Minimum lease payments 2009 2008 000 000 Amounts payable under finance leases: Within one year 5 109 Between one and five years - 5 5 114 Less: future finance charges - 4 Present value of finance lease liabilities 5 110 Present value of finance lease liabilities payments due: Within one year 5 105 Between one and five years - 5 5 110 21 Bank loans 2009 2008 000 000 Bank loans are payable as follows: Less than one year 70,797 - Between one and two years - 107,832 70,797 107,832 Less: unamortised finance costs of debt 308 618 70,489 107,214 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 71 Financials Group Notes to accounts Group continued 22 Financial instruments and financial risk management Derivative financial instruments Exposure to currency and interest rate risks arise in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to all significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted unadjusted active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that includes inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

The Groups banking facilities are provided by a small syndicate of banks, led by The Royal Bank of Scotland.
During the year there were two facilities in place, one which was renewed in 2005, providing 120 million of revolving credit over a five year period, and a second which was put in place in 2008, providing a further 80 million of revolving credit over a three year period.
Both facilities are denominated in sterling, US dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros and are used for balance sheet and operational needs.
A further 10 million overdraft is available for short-term working capital funding.
All bank loans are unsecured.
Interest was predominantly charged at 0.375% 2008: 0.375% over base or contracted rate.
At 31 December 2009, the Group had available 129,203,000 2008: 92,168,000 of undrawn, committed borrowing facilities.
Subsequent to the year end the 2005 facility was replaced with a new three year facility see note 32.
The 80 million facility expires in September 2011.

The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros.
At 31 December 2009, the net fair value of the Groups currency derivatives is estimated to be a liability of approximately 4,504,000 2008: liabilities of 60,134,000, comprising 5,902,000 assets 2008: 8,255,000 and 10,406,000 liabilities 2008: 68,389,000.
The gain on derivative financial instruments included in the Groups consolidated income statement for the period was 55,630,000 2008: loss of 62,069,000.

The value of the borrowings does not exceed the net investments, meeting the conditions required to qualify as effective hedges.
Interest rate risk During the year the Group used interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
The interest rate swaps, denominated in US dollars and Canadian dollars, have been entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure reflecting the Groups policy.
The swaps will mature in December 2011 and have fixed swap rates ranging from 3.93% to 4.30%.
The floating rates are US dollar LIBOR and Canadian dollar LIBOR.
At the year end the nominal amounts of the interest rate swaps were US dollar 80 million 2008: US dollar 100 million and Canadian dollar 20 million 2008: Canadian dollar 20 million.
The interest rate swaps are designated effective cash flow hedges and the change in fair value has been charged to equity.
At 31 December 2009, the net fair value of interest rate swaps was a liability of 2,829,000 2008: liability of 4,472,000.
The amount recycled from the income statement during the year was 1,759,000 and has been charged to interest cost in the year 2008: 195,000.
The fair value will be realised in the income statement on a quarterly basis over the next two years 2008: three years.

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic volatility of the Groups share price.
Share options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year.
The weighted average share price during the year was 11.86.
The fair value of options granted during the year was 2,238,628 2008: 1,470,425.
The Groups equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value for all schemes other than the 2007, 2008 and 2009 LTIP schemes are measured by use of the Black Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP 2009 Weighted average share price 12.53 11.75 11.58 10.21 Weighted average exercise price 10.82 11.66 11.59 n a Expected volatility % 24.9 21.0 22.0 17.4 Expected option life years 3.6 6.0 5.0 3.0 Risk free interest rate % 3.3 4.1 3.7 4.2 Expected dividends % 1.8 1.7 1.8 1.4 Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP 2008 Weighted average share price 12.30 10.40 10.23 8.53 Weighted average exercise price 10.39 10.24 10.13 n a Expected volatility % 21.9 19.8 19.8 18.6 Expected option life years 3.8 6.0 5.0 3.0 Risk free interest rate % 4.9 4.8 4.6 4.5 Expected dividends % 1.6 1.7 1.7 1.6 Figures in the above table show an average across the schemes.
For the 2007, 2008 and 2009 LTIP awards, the stochastic model has been used to calculate the fair value of the awards at grant date as this is the most accurate way of modelling the TSR performance condition.
The fair value of these schemes has been calculated using the following assumptions: 2009 2008 Exercise price n a n a Share price at grant 12.16 12.02 Expected option life years 3.0 3.0 Expected volatility % 26.6 23.9 Expected dividend yield % 0.0 0.0 Risk free interest rate % 3.2 4.7 Figures in the above table show an average across the schemes.

A new defined contribution plan was introduced for other employees and new joiners in the UK.
The Group also operates two defined contribution schemes for overseas employees.
In addition to these schemes, the Groups Tactical Communication Systems business based in Montreal, Canada, has three defined benefit schemes.

Relatively small changes in some of these variables can have a significant impact on the level of the total obligation.
For the UK scheme, a 0.1% reduction in the inflation assumption to 3.4% and a 0.1% increase in the discount rate to 5.9% would decrease the schemes liabilities by 2.1% and 1.9% respectively.
If the members were to experience the mortality of an individual one year older the scheme liabilities would drop by 1.7%.
The key demographic assumption used was in relation to the mortality rates of current and future pensioners.
Due to the size of the scheme the mortality rates were based on standard tables namely: Current pensioners 92 Series tables with medium cohort projections Future pensioners 92 Series tables with medium cohort projections The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of the UK scheme make appropriate allowance for future improvements in longevity and are set out below: 2009 2008 Current pensioners at 65 males 22 years 22 years Current pensioners at 65 females 25 years 25 years Future pensioners at 65 males 23 years 23 years Future pensioners at 65 females 26 years 26 years Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes were as follows: UK Canada Total UK Canada Total 2009 2009 2009 2008 2008 2008 m m m m m m Current service cost 5.2 0.2 5.4 5.9 0.2 6.1 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 9.5 0.5 10.0 9.4 0.4 9.8 Expected return on pension scheme assets 6.7 0.4 7.1 8.5 0.5 9.0 8.0 0.3 8.3 6.8 0.1 6.9 Of the current service cost for the year, 4.3 million 2008: 4.3 million has been included in cost of sales, and 1.1 million 2008: 1.8 million has been included in administrative expenses.
