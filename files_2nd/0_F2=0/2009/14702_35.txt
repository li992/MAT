The following table shows the aggregate movement in the Groups financial assets during the year: 26 april 2009 27 april 2008 000 000 At beginning of period 65,714 75,447 Additions 4,887 565,392 Disposals 12,772 554,554 Derecognition of investments held with KSF 26,219 - Revaluation through the income statement 2,443 - Revaluation through equity 28,586 20,571 At end of period 5,467 65,714 We have previously reported that our strategic stake were held by Kaupthing Singer & Freidlander KSF and partly financed by them.
On 8 October 2008, KSF went into administration and we are in dispute with the administrators concerning the ownership of the shares they hold.
We now have concluded that, while we continue to maintain that the shares are ours and should be delivered to us, we may not control the shares for accounting purposes.
We have therefore treated them in the accounts as having been derecognised.
Doing so has no impact on net assets as the value of the shares 26,219,000 has been replaced by a derecognition of a liability 20,298,000 owed to KSF and the recognition of a 5,921,000 debtor.
This derecognition has resulted in the transfer of historic losses, previously recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense, of 53,156,000 into the income statement.
The financial assets at 26 April 2009 relate to strategic investments held of between 1.5% and 29.9% in share capital or contracts for difference including shares held by KSF.
