Close Brothers Annual Report 2009 95 Financial Statements The Notes d Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to meet liabilities as they fall due and arises mainly in our Banking division.
The groups policy has been to finance customer loans and advances by capital and reserves, longer term deposits and committed facilities with only limited financing from short-term deposits.
This policy is kept under review and compliance is monitored on a daily basis.
This policy, the average duration of the groups borrowings 24 months versus 12 months for the loan book and the groups success in raising term retail funds since 31 July 2008 all lead the group to believe it is in a strong position with respect to liquidity risk.
The group measures liquidity risk with a variety of measures including regular stress testing and regular cash flow monitoring, and reporting to both the group and divisional boards.
