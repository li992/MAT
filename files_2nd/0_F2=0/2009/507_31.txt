Shareholder Information Payment of dividends by BACS Many Shareholders have already arranged for dividends to be paid by mandate directly to their bank or building society account.
The Company mandates dividends through the BACS Bankers Automated Clearing Services system.
The benefit to Shareholders of the BACS payment method is that the Registrar posts the tax vouchers directly to them, whilst the dividend is credited on the payment date to the Shareholders bank or building society account.
Shareholders who have not yet arranged for their dividends to be paid directly to their bank or building society account and wish to benefit from this service should request the Companys Registrar to send them a Dividend Interest mandate form or alternatively complete the mandate form accompanying their dividend warrant and tax voucher in May 2010.
Overseas dividend payments Capita Registrars has partnered with Travelex, the worlds largest specialist provider of commercial international payment services, to provide you with a service that will convert your Sterling dividends into your local currency.
Your dividend will then be conveniently paid directly into your local bank account.

Online shareholder services and share dealing Shareholders may wish to take advantage of the Online enquiry service offered by the Registrar.
This service allows a Shareholder to access his her own account to verify address details and the number of shares held.
The service can be obtained on http: shares.
The Registrar also offers a share dealing service to existing Shareholders.
Sharegift We value all our Shareholders, no matter how many shares they own, but we do realise that some Shareholders hold on to small quantities of shares because they believe that the cost of selling them would make the transaction uneconomic.
A free service is available to enable Shareholders with small holdings, should they so wish, to donate their shares to charity, and gain the benefit of tax relief on this donation.
This scheme has been successfully adopted by several large quoted companies, and further details are available from the Secretary.
