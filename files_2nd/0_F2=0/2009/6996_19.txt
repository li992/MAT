The underlying tax rate on trading was 29.7% 2008: 31.7%, principally due to the non-deductibility of depreciation charged on capital expenditure in respect of mezzanine floors and other store infrastructure.
This level of tax non-deductibility is anticipated for the foreseeable future.
The lower tax rate of 28.0% 2008: 29.0% in this financial period is mainly due to the release of prior year tax provisions following the favourable settlement of tax computations, in particular relating to capital allowance claims.
The lower tax rate in the previous financial period was mainly due to the financing structure put in place as part of the re-finance on 14 July 2006, the benefit of which ceased on 15 November 2007.
The tax charge of 21.7m includes a 4.6m credit in respect of the tax on exceptional costs, as detailed in note 5.
Dividends For the period 53 weeks to 52 weeks to 3 April 2009 28 March 2008 m m Equity ordinary shares Final for the 52 weeks to 28 March 2008 paid 10.35p per share 2008: 9.5p 21.8 21.0 Interim for the 53 weeks to 3 April 2009 paid 5.0p per share 2008: 4.75p 10.5 10.4 32.3 31.4 In addition, the Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial period ended 3 April 2009 of 10.90p per share 2008: 10.35p per share, which will absorb an estimated 22.7m 2008: 21.8m of shareholders funds.
It will be paid on 5 August 2009 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 18 June 2009.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
The weighted average number of shares excludes shares held by an Employee Benefit Trust see note 20 and has been adjusted for the issue purchase of shares during the period.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the 53 weeks to 3 April 2009.
For the period 53 weeks to 52 weeks to 3 April 2009 28 March 2008 Number Number m m Weighted average number of shares in issue 210.6 219.3 Less: shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust 1.1 0.9 Weighted average number of shares for calculating basic earnings per share 209.5 218.4 Weighted average number of dilutive shares 0.3 Total number of shares for calculating diluted earnings per share 209.8 218.4 For the period 53 weeks to 52 weeks to 3 April 2009 28 March 2008 m m Basic earnings attributable to equity shareholders 55.8 64.0 Exceptional items see note 5 : Operating expenses 12.3 Finance costs 4.6 Tax on exceptional items 4.6 Underlying earnings before exceptional items 68.1 64.0 Earnings per share is calculated as follows: For the period 53 weeks to 52 weeks to 3 April 2009 28 March 2008 Basic earnings per ordinary share 26.6p 29.3p Diluted earnings per ordinary share 26.6p 29.3p Basic earnings per ordinary share before exceptional items 32.5p 29.3p Diluted earnings per ordinary share before exceptional items 32.5p 29.3p The alternative measure of earnings per share is provided because it reflects the Groups underlying performance by excluding the effect of exceptional items.
In the 52 weeks to 27 March 2009 the Groups underlying earnings before exceptional items was 66.7m.
This converts to a basic earnings per ordinary share before exceptional items, using a consistent number of shares in issue, of 31.8 pence 2008: 29.3 pence.

The goodwill arose on the acquisition of Halfords Holdings Limited by the Company on 31 August 2002.
The goodwill relates to a portfolio of sites, which have been allocated to groups of cash-generating units on a regional basis within the UK according to the level at which management monitors that goodwill.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period with growth no higher than past experience and after consideration of all available information.
The key assumptions used to determine value-in-use of goodwill held at 3 April 2009 and 28 March 2008 are as follows: Note 2009 2008 Discount rate 1 12.6% 12.6% Growth rate 2 0.0% 0.0% Notes: 1.

Financial instruments and related disclosures Treasury policy The Groups treasury departments main responsibilities are to: n Ensure adequate funding and liquidity for the Group: n Manage the interest risk of the Groups debt: n Invest surplus cash: n Manage the clearing bank operations of the Group: and n Manage the foreign exchange risk on its non-sterling cash flows.
Treasury activities are delegated by the Board to the Finance Director FD.
The FD controls policy and performance through the line management structure to the Group Treasurer and by reference to the Treasury Committee.
The Treasury Committee meets regularly to monitor the performance of the Treasury function.
Monthly Treasury Reports provide management information relating to treasury activity.
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved policies and procedures, which are reviewed on an annual basis.
The Groups debt management policy is to provide an appropriate level of funding to finance the Business Plan over the medium term at a competitive cost and ensure flexibility to meet the changing needs of the Group.
The Group has a syndicated five-year term facility totalling 300m that provides the Group with committed bank facilities until July 2011.
The key risks that the Group faces from a treasury perspective are as follows: Financial risk The Business Plan and cash flow forecasts are subject to key assumptions such as interest rates and the significance of these risks is dependent upon the level of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and the strength of the balance sheet.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of the Business Plan and its financial covenants.
The Groups borrowings are currently subject to floating rate and the Group will continue to monitor movements in the swap market.
Foreign currency risk The Group has a significant transaction exposure with increasing, direct source purchases of its supplies from the Far East, with most of the trade being in US dollars.
The Groups policy is to manage the foreign exchange transaction exposures of the business to ensure the actual costs do not exceed the budget costs by 10% excluding increases in the base cost of the product.
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling businesses whilst they remain immaterial.
During the 53 weeks to 3 April 2009, the foreign exchange management policy was to hedge between 75% and 80% of the material foreign exchange transaction exposures on a rolling 1518 month basis.
Hedging is performed through the use of foreign currency bank accounts, spot rates and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Credit risk The Groups policy is to minimise the risk that foreign exchange and interest rate derivative counterparties, the holders of surplus cash and the providers of debt will be unable to fulfil their obligations and also, in the case of lenders, unwilling to extend the loan facilities when they expire.
The Group ensured that such counterparties used for credit transactions held at least an A credit rating at the time of syndication July 2006.
Ancillary business, in the main, is directed to the eight banks within the syndicated group.
The Treasurer is responsible for determining creditworthiness of each counterparty, based on the overall financial strength of the counterparty.
The counterparty credit risk is reviewed in the Treasury report, which is forwarded to the Treasury Committee and the Treasurer reviews credit exposure on a daily basis.

Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Liquidity risk The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when required.
The Group ensures that there is sufficient cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash requirements of the Group for the current Business Plan.
The minimum liquidity level is currently set at 30.0m.
Forecast liquidity is reviewed each month by the Treasurer to determine whether there are sufficient credit facilities to meet forecast requirements.
Covenants are monitored on a regular basis to ensure there are no significant breaches, which would lead to an Event of Default.
Calculations are submitted at least bi-annually to the syndication agent.
Reporting on covenant compliance forms part of the Treasury Report.
There have been no breaches of covenants during the reported periods.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Since June 2006 and until September 2009, the Group managed its capital structure partly through a share buy-back scheme, details of which are given in note 20.
The Group manages capital by operating within debt ratios.
These ratios are lease adjusted net debt to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation EBITDA and fixed charge cover.
Lease adjusted net debt is calculated as being net debt and leases capitalised at eight times, as a multiple of EBITDA plus operating lease charges.
Fixed charge cover is calculated as being EBITDA plus operating lease charges as a multiple of interest and operating lease charges.
As a result of the current economic conditions and the attitude towards debt the Group has decided to reduce the level of net debt and operates favourably to these target metrics.
The following table is a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 3 April 2009 and 28 March 2008.

Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Fair value assumptions Trade receivables, trade payables The fair value on these items approximate to their carrying value.
and finance lease obligations Short-term deposits and borrowings The fair value of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Long-term borrowings The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the majority are floating rate where payments are reset to markets rates at intervals of less than one year.
Forward currency contracts The fair value of forward currency contracts are calculated by using the closing spot rate and respective forward points as of the balance sheet date and comparing this to the outright contract rate.
Interest rate swaps The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated by taking the closing UK market rate for the outstanding period and comparing this to the outright contract rate.
Trade and other receivables The following table reconciles trade and other receivables that fall within the scope of IAS 39 to the relevant balance sheet amounts.
Other assets include prepayments and accrued income that are outside the scope of IAS 39.

Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Sensitivity analysis Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits, trade payables and derivative financial instruments.
The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of such financial instruments to changes in relevant foreign exchange and interest rates.
Foreign exchange sensitivity The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates on its US dollar financial instruments, the major currency in which the Groups financial instruments are denominated.
2009 2008 Increase Increase decrease decrease in equity in equity m m 10% appreciation of the US dollar 11.5 10.0 10% depreciation of the US dollar 9.4 8.2 There are no material movements in the income statement.
The movements in equity relates to the fair value movements on the Groups forward contracts that are used to hedge future stock purchases.
It should be noted that the sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on income and equity on all financial instruments held at the balance sheet date.
It does not reflect changes in sales or costs that may result from changing interest or exchange rates.
Interest rate sensitivity The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to interest rates changes.
2009 2009 2008 2008 Increase in Reduction Increase in Reduction finance cost in equity finance cost in equity m m m m 1% increase in sterling interest rates 1.8 1.1 1.8 A 1% decrease in interest rates would have an equal and opposite effect.
The movement in the income statement reflects the effect on finance costs on the unhedged borrowings of the Group as shown in the table below.
In 2008 the movement in equity includes the fair value movement on the fixed leg of the Groups interest rate swap: this swap was closed out on 1 April 2009 see note 5.
Interest rate movements on deposits, obligations under finance leases, trade payables, trade receivables, and other financial instruments do not present a material exposure to the Groups balance sheet.

Share-based payments At present the Group has three share award plans: 1.
Halfords Company Share Option Scheme CSOS 2.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP 1.
Halfords Company Share Option Scheme The CSOS was introduced in June 2004 and the Company has made annual grants since.
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant.
The contractual life of an option is ten years.
Options granted will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the achievement of a three year performance condition.
For grants up to 150% of basic salary the options can only be exercised if the increase in earnings per share EPS over the period is not less than the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 5% per year for the 2005 scheme and 3.5% for options granted in 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively.
In the case of grants in excess of 150% of basic salary, the excess can only be exercised in full if the increase is not less than RPI plus 10% per year.
Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies since the IPO in June 2004.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds.
Share-based payments continued Options were valued using the BlackScholes option-pricing models.
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
Halfords Sharesave Scheme The SAYE is open to all employees with eligible employment service.
Options may be exercised under the scheme if the option holder completes his saving contract for a period of three years and then not more than six months thereafter.
Special provisions allow early exercise in the case of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the company or business which employs the option holder is transferred out of the Group, or in the event of a change in control, reconstruction or winding-up of the Company.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations were as follows: 7 August 7 August 1 August 11 August Grant date 2008 2007 2006 2005 Share price at grant date 2.4083 4.02 3.01 3.07 Exercise price 1.9267 3.22 3.01 3.07 Number of employees 821 1,064 343 573 Shares under option 1,491,586 929,890 173,558 269,037 Vesting period years 3 3 3 3 Expected volatility 29% 22% 22% 36% Option life years 3 3 3 3 Expected life years 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.5 Risk-free rate 4.58% 5.54% 4.75% 4.68% Expected dividend yield 4.83% 4.10% 4.10% 4.00% Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting 44% 44% 44% 53% Expectations of meeting performance criteria 100% 100% 100% 100% Fair value per option 0.61 1.01 0.44 0.81 Number of options outstanding at 3 April 2009 1,349,562 287,118 65,082 1,370 15953HALFORDS.

The Long-Term Incentive Plan The introduction of a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP was approved at the Annual General Meeting in August 2005 awarding the executive Directors and certain senior management conditional rights to receive shares.
To date four schemes have been approved for 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008.
The extent to which such rights vest will depend upon the Companys performance over the three-year period following the award date.
The vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the Companys relative total shareholder return TSR performance and the vesting of the other 50% by the Companys absolute EPS performance against RPI.
The Companys TSR performance will be measured against the FTSE 350 general retailers as a comparator Group.
No retesting will be permitted.
The TSR element of the options granted under the 2007 scheme has been valued using a model developed by Deloitte.
The Deloitte model uses the Groups share price volatility, the correlation between comparator companies and the vesting schedule attaching to the LTIP tranche rather than generating a large number of simulations of share price and TSR performance to determine the fair value of the award using a Monte Carlo model.
For the 2005 and 2006 schemes the TSR element of the options were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation were as follows: 7 August 12 July 11 July 8 August Grant date 2008 2007 2006 2005 Share price at grant date 2.962 4.02 3.01 3.07 Number of employees 20 21 18 17 Shares under option 866,340 539,893 596,908 537,417 Vesting period years 3 3 3 3 Expected volatility 30% 22% 22% 31% Option life years 3 3 3 3 Expected life years 3 3 3 3 Expected dividend yield 4.83% 4.10% 4.25% 4.00% Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting 30% 30% 30% 30% Expectations of meeting performance criteria 100% 100% 100% 50% Fair value per option 1.97 2.69 1.82 2.19 Number of shares outstanding 3 April 2009 796,719 352,914 351,102 As the LTIP awards have a nil exercise price the risk free rate of return does not have any effect on the estimated fair value and therefore is excluded from the above table.
A reconciliation of option movements for the CSOS, SAYE and LTIP performance plans over the year to 3 April 2009 are shown below: 3 April 2009 28 March 2008 Number Weighted average Number Weighted average 000 exercise price 000 exercise price Outstanding at start of year 4,558 2.59 7,455 2.32 Granted 4,239 2.04 3,070 3.05 Forfeited 173 553 1.07 Exercised 126 0.07 4,756 2.61 Lapsed 1,555 2.58 658 2.79 Outstanding at end of year 6,943 2.36 4,558 2.59 Exercisable at end of year 294 2.60 334 2.60 15953HALFORDS.

Pensions Employees are offered membership of the Halfords Pension Plan.
During the period the Group changed its pension arrangements to prepare for the governments introduction of Personal Accounts.
The Halfords Pension Plan moved from a defined contribution scheme to a contract based plan, where each member has their own individual pension policy, which they monitor independently.
The costs of contributions to the scheme are charged to the income statement in the period that they arise.
The contributions to the scheme for the period amounted to 3.2m 2008: 3.2m.
Contingent liabilities The Groups banking arrangements include the facility for the bank to provide a number of guarantees in respect of liabilities owed by the Group during the course of its trading.
In the event of any amount being immediately payable under the guarantee, the bank has the right to recover the sum in full from the Group.
The total amount of guarantees in place at 3 April 2009 amounted to 2.9m 2008: 2.9m.
The Groups banking arrangements are subject to a netting facility whereby credit balances may be offset against the indebtedness of other Group companies.
