Financial instruments by category continued Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total As at 31st December 2009 000 000 000 000 Assets Derivatives used for hedging - 14,396 - 14,396 Available-for-sale financial assets - equity securities 75 - 1,282 1,357 - debt investments 233 11,604 - 11,837 - fixed deposits 68,411 -- 68,411 Total assets 68,719 26,000 1,282 96,001 Liabilities Derivatives used for hedging - 3,750 - 3,750 Total liabilities - 3,750 - 3,750 The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
These instruments are included in level 1.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
