107 Smiths Group plc Annual report 2009 20 Financial risk management The Groups international operations and debt financing expose it to financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in debt market prices, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks.
Treasury and risk management policies are set by the Board.
The policy sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of financial instruments to manage risk.
The instruments and techniques used to manage exposures include foreign currency derivatives, debt and other interest rate derivatives.
The central treasury function monitors financial risks and compliance with risk management policies.
The management of operational credit risk is discussed in note 16. a Foreign exchange risk Transactional currency exposure The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional currency.
It is Group policy that, when such a sale or purchase is certain or highly probable, the net foreign exchange exposure is hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The net exposure is calculated by adjusting the expected cash-flow for payments or receipts in the same currency linked to the sale or purchase.
This policy minimises the risk that the profits generated from the transaction will be affected by foreign exchange movements which occur after the price has been determined.
Hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing are only undertaken if it is cost effective.
The following table shows the currency of financial instruments.
It excludes loans and derivatives designated as net investment hedges.

108 Smiths Group plc Annual report 2009 Notes to the accounts continued 20 Financial risk management continued Cash-flow hedging The Group uses foreign currency contracts to hedge future foreign currency sales and purchases.
At 31 July 2009 contracts with a nominal value of 310.7m 2008: 222.2m were designated as hedging instruments.
In addition, the Group had outstanding foreign currency contracts with a nominal value of 121.7m 2008: 130.1m which were being used to manage transactional foreign exchange exposures, but were not accounted for as cash-flow hedges.
The fair value of the contracts is disclosed in note 21.
The majority of hedged transactions will be recognised in the income statement in the same period that the cash-flows are expected to occur, with the only differences arising as a result of normal commercial credit terms on sales and purchases.
Of the foreign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments 99% are for periods of 12 months or less 2008: 99%.
The movements in the cash-flow hedge reserve during the period are summarised in the table below: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2009 31 July 2008 m m Brought forward cash-flow hedge reserve at start of period 1.1 1.4 Exchange adjustments 0.3 0.2 Gains and losses on effective cash-flow hedges recognised in equity 8.0 1.0 Amounts removed from the hedge reserve and recognised in the following lines on the income statement: revenue 9.6 0.2 cost of sales 2.8 0.3 administrative expenses 1.6 Carried forward cash-flow hedge reserve at end of period 1.8 1.1 Translational currency exposure The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in the United States and Europe.
As a result, the sterling value of the Groups balance sheet can be significantly affected by movements in exchange rates.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of these translational currency exposures by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies, except where significant adverse interest differentials or other factors would render the cost of such hedging activity uneconomic.
This is achieved by borrowing primarily in the local currency or in some cases indirectly through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps.
Net investment hedges The table below sets out the currency of loans and swap contracts designated as net investment hedges: At 31 July 2009 Sterling US$ Euro Other Total m m m m m Loans designated as net investment hedges 551.3 36.9 588.2 Cross-currency swap contracts 59.9 59.9 Currency swap contracts 380.8 92.6 207.4 80.8 380.8 584.0 267.3 117.7 588.2 At 31 July 2008 Sterling US$ Euro Other Total m m m m m Loans designated as net investment hedges 139.6 70.6 210.2 Currency swap contracts 371.4 150.6 163.0 57.8 371.4 290.2 233.6 57.8 210.2 Currency loans in other currencies hedge the Groups exposure to Canadian dollars and Australian dollars and the swap contracts hedge the Groups exposure to Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi.
Of the contracts designated as net investment hedges, 53% are current and the balance matures over the next four years.
The contracts maturing within one year include 150m of contracts maturing on the same day as the 2010 Sterling Eurobond.
