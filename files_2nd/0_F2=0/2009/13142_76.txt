Adjusted figures are stated before amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, exceptional restructuring and acquisition related costs, disposals and other non operating items, acquisition related finance costs, related tax effects and movements in deferred taxation assets and liabilities that are not expected to crystallise in the near term.

Acquisition related costs relate to acquisition integration and fees incurred in acquisition financing.
Adjusted operating cash flow is measured after net capital expenditure and dividends from joint ventures but before payments in relation to exceptional restructuring and acquisition related costs.
