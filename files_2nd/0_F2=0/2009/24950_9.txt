12 HICL ANNUAL REPOR T & ACCOUNTS 2009 Gearing The Group has a committed 200m five year revolving facility from Bank of Scotland plc BoS expiring in December 2012, which has been used to fund acquisitions.
The interest rate has been partially hedged for the duration of the facility.
Foreign exchange risk from Euro income from the Dutch High Speed Rail Link has been managed in the period through financial derivatives and by drawing Euros under the debt facility.
As at 31 March 2009, the Group had drawn down 68.7m of this debt facility, and had net debt on an Investment basis of 57.7m 2008: 105.6m.
The BoS facilities are on a recourse basis to the Group and are 15.4% excluding cash and cash equivalents of the Directors Valuation of 445.7m as at 31 March 2009.
There are no outstanding equity subscription obligations on any project and the Group no longer has any outstanding letters of credit, the investment subscription in Colchester Garrison PFI project having now been paid.
On a consolidated IFRS basis, the Group had net debt of 562.9m at 31 March 2009 2008: 248.8m.
This increase in net debt primarily results from the consolidation of 370.3m of net debt in relation to the recognition of four projects as subsidiaries rather than as investments following the acquisitions of incremental stakes in four projects in the year, which has been partially off-set by the decrease in recourse net debt analysed in the summary cashflow table above.
As previously reported, all the PFI projects have either long term bank borrowings with interest rate hedges, or bonds with fixed or indexed coupon payments.
This ensures the Groups investments have minimal exposure to interest rate volatility or debt market appetite.
The Companys Articles of Association limit the Groups recourse debt to 50% of Adjusted Gross Asset Value of its investments and cash balances.
