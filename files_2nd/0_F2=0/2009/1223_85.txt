Consistent with such practice, the Group provides such indemnification to its licensees but subject, in all cases, to a limitation of liability.
The obligation for the Group to indemnify its licensees is subject to certain provisos and is usually contingent upon a third party bringing an action against the licensee alleging that the technology licensed by the Group to the licensee infringes such third partys intellectual property rights.
The indemnification obligations typically survive any termination of the licence and will continue in perpetuity.
The Group does not provide for any such guarantees unless it has received notification from the other party that they are likely to invoke the guarantee.
The provision is made if both of the following conditions are met: i information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements: and ii the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated.
Any such provision is based upon the directors estimate of the fair value of expected costs of any such claim.
