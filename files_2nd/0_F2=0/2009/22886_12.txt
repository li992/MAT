DEXION ABSOLUTE LIMITED 2009 REPOR T & ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
General information Dexion Absolute Limited the Company was incorporated with limited liability in Guernsey, Channel Islands as a closed-ended investment company on 26 November 2002.
The Companys ordinary shares were initially listed on the London Stock Exchange on 19 December 2002.
The Company is authorised in Guernsey, Channel Islands under The Companies Guernsey Law 2008.
Significant accounting policies a Statement of Compliance The financial statements which give a true and fair view prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and are in compliance with The Companies Guernsey Law, 2008.
Changes in accounting policies The Company has adopted IAS 32 amendment, Financial instruments: presentation and consequential amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of financial instruments, as of 1 January 2009.
The objective of the standard is to enhance financial statement users understanding of the significance of financial instruments to an entitys financial position, performance, and cash flows.
In particular, the standard addresses classification of a financial instrument issued by an enterprise as a liability or as equity and disclosures about financial instruments, including information as to their fair values.
The Company has adopted IFRS 7 amendment Financial instruments: Disclosures as of 1 January 2009.
The amendment requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurement and liquidity risk.
In particular, the amendment requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of a fair value measurement hierarchy.
The adoption of the amendment results in additional disclosures but does not have an impact on the Companys financial position or performance.
Determination and presentation of operating segments The Company has adopted IFRS 8, Operating segments as of 1 January 2009.
The new standard requires a management approach, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
The Board has considered the requirements of IFRS 8 Operating Segments, and is of the view that the Company is engaged in a single segment of business, being investment in hedge funds.
The Board, as a whole, has been determined as constituting the chief operating decision maker of the Company.
The key measure of performance used by the Board to assess the Companys performance and to allocate resources is the total return on the Companys net asset value, as calculated under IFRS, and therefore no reconciliation is required between the measure of profit or loss used by the Board and that contained in these financial statements.
The Board of Directors have overall management and control of the Company.
Material changes to the investment objective or investment policy can only be made by Shareholders.
The Board of Directors have delegated the day to day implementation of this strategy to its Investment Adviser but retain responsibility to ensure that adequate resources of the Company are directed in accordance with their decisions.
The investment decisions of the Investment Adviser are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure compliance with the policies and legal responsibilities of the Board.
The Investment Adviser has been given full authority to act on behalf of the Company, including the authority to purchase and sell securities and other investments on behalf of the Company and to carry out other actions as appropriate to give effect thereto.
Whilst the Investment Adviser may make the investment decisions on a day to day basis re the allocation of funds to different investments, any changes to the investment strategy or major allocation decisions have to be approved by the Board, and any material changes to the investment strategy have to be approved by Shareholders, even though they may be proposed by the Investment Adviser and Manager.
The Board therefore retains full responsibility as to the major allocations decisions made on an ongoing basis.
The Investment Adviser will always act in accordance with the investment policy and investment restrictions set out in the Company's latest Prospectus which cannot be radically changed without the approval of the Shareholders.
Presentation of financial statements The Company has applied revised IAS1 Presentation of Financial Statements 2007, which became effective as of 1 January 2009.
As a result, the Company presents in the Statement of Changes in Shareholders Equity all owner equity changes, whereas all non-owner changes in equity are presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Significant accounting policies continued a Statement of Compliance continued This presentation has been applied in these financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009.
Comparative information has been represented so that it also is in conformity with the revised standard.
Since the change in accounting policy only impacts presentation aspects, there is no impact on earnings per share.
Applicable new standards and interpretations not yet effective In November 2009, the IASB issued IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which becomes effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2013.
This represents the first of a three part project to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement.
The objective of the standard is to enhance the ability of investors and other users of financial information to understand the accounting of financial assets and to reduce complexity.
The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the potential effect of this standard.
The standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the financial statements since the majority of the Companys financial assets are designated at fair value through profit or loss.
b Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared in pounds sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency, rounded to the nearest thousand pounds.
Previous financial statements were rounded to the nearest pound.
They are prepared on a fair value basis for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and derivative financial instruments.
Other financial assets and financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2008 have been restated due to a revision of methodology.
The 2008 earnings loss per share for the, , US$ and A$ shares were 0.3759, 0.6938, US$0.7143 and A$1.1730 respectively.
However as a result of the revised methodology the revised earnings loss per shares were 0.3748, 0.1959, US$0.1696 and A$0.9549 respectively.
The return on a share class basis up to 31 December 2008 was calculated as a comparison of the net asset value at the beginning and end of the period excluding capital transactions.
In 2009, it was deemed more appropriate to ensure that the total return on a share class basis used to calculate earnings per share reconciled to the statement of comprehensive income returns.
The revised methodology, is considered to be more appropriate and transparent in that it reconciles the returns on a share class basis to the total included in the statement of comprehensive income in the audited financial statements.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements: c Revenue recognition Interest income is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as it accrues using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Income distributions from investment funds are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as dividend income when declared.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
30 DEXION ABSOLUTE LIMITED 2009 REPOR T & ACCOUNTS 2.
Significant accounting policies continued e Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss i Classification The Company designates all of its investments upon initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss as they are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis.
These include financial assets that are not held for trading purposes and which may be sold and represent a group of financial assets which is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the group is provided internally on that basis to the entitys key management personnel.
These are principally investments in unlisted open-ended hedge funds.
Financial instruments held for trading include forward foreign currency deals awaiting settlement.
Financial assets that are classified as loans and receivables include sales awaiting settlement and other receivables.
Financial liabilities that are not at fair value through profit or loss include purchases awaiting settlement, accounts payable and accrued expenses.
The table in Note 3 details the categories of financial assets and liabilities held by the Company at the reporting date.
ii Recognition The Company recognises financial assets and financial liabilities on the date it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A regular way purchase and sale of financial instruments is recognised using trade date accounting.
From this date any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities are recorded.
iii Measurement Financial instruments are measured initially at fair value transaction price.
Transaction costs on financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are expensed immediately.
Subsequent to initial recognition, all instruments classified as fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with changes in their fair value recognised in the statement in of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Financial assets classified as loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less impairment losses, if any.
Financial liabilities, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
iv Fair value measurement principles Investments in underlying funds which are not quoted on a recognised stock exchange or other trading facility are valued at the NAVs provided by such entities or their administrators.
These values may be unaudited or may themselves be estimates.
In addition, these entities or their administrators may not provide values at all or in a timely manner and, to the extent that values are not available, those investments will be valued by the Investment Adviser using valuation techniques appropriate to those investments.
In determining fair value, the Investment Adviser takes into consideration, where applicable, the impact of suspensions, of redemptions, liquidation proceedings, investments in side pockets and other significant factors.
Actual values may differ from these estimates.
Open forward foreign currency contracts at the statement of financial position date are valued at forward currency rates at that point.
The unrealised appreciation or depreciation on open forward foreign currency contracts is calculated by reference to the difference between the contracted rate and the rate to close out the contract.
Options are fair valued at last traded market prices.
For open option contracts, changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognised as unrealised gains or losses by fair valuing the contract at the statement of financial position date and are included in the movement in unrealised gain or loss on securities in the statement of comprehensive income.
When the contract is closed, the difference between the proceeds from or cost of the closing transaction is recorded as a realised gain or loss.
31 DEXION ABSOLUTE LIMITED 2009 REPOR T & ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
Significant accounting policies continued e Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss continued For open futures contracts, changes in fair value of the contracts are recognised as unrealised gains or losses by marking to market the value of the contract at the statement of financial position date.
When the contract is closed, the difference between the proceeds from or cost of the closing transactions and the original transaction is amended as a realised gain or loss.
v Realised and unrealised gains and losses Realised gains and losses arising on disposal of investments are calculated by reference to the proceeds received on disposal and the average cost attributable to those investments, and are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Unrealised gains on investments are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
vi Impairment Financial assets that are stated at cost or amortised cost are reviewed at each statement of financial position date to determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment.
If any such indication exists, an impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets effective interest rate.
If in a subsequent period the amount of an impairment loss recognised on a financial asset carried at amortised cost decreases and the decrease can be linked objectively to an event occurring after the write-down, the write-down is reversed through the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
vii Derecognition The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition in accordance with IAS 39.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired.
The Company uses average cost method to determine the gain or loss on derecognition.
f Foreign currency transactions The financial statements of the Company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates its functional currency.
The Directors have considered the primary economic currency of the Company and considered the currency in which the original capital was raised, distributions are to be made and ultimately the currency capital would be returned on a break up basis.
The Directors have also considered the currency to which the underlying investments are exposed.
On balance, the Directors believe that pounds sterling best represents the functional currency.
For the purpose of the financial statements the results and financial position of the Company are expressed in sterling which is the presentation currency of the Company.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate prevailing at the Statement of Financial Position date.
Realised and unrealised gains or losses on currency translation are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Foreign currency differences relating to investments at fair value through profit or loss are included in gains and losses on investments note 3. g Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents, which include bank overdrafts, are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant changes in value.
Cash, deposits with banks and bank overdrafts are stated at their principal amount.
h Issue costs Expenses associated with the issue of ordinary shares other than those arising on the issue or conversion of C shares are borne exclusively by the holders of ordinary shares.
These expenses, when incurred, are written off against share capital.
During the year, there were no ordinary shares issued.
i Treasury Shares Where the Company purchases its own share capital whether into treasury or for cancellation, the consideration paid, which includes any directly attributable costs net of income taxes is recognised as a deduction from equity shareholders funds through the special reserve, which is a distributable reserve.
32 DEXION ABSOLUTE LIMITED 2009 REPOR T & ACCOUNTS 2.
Significant accounting policies continued i Treasury Shares continued When such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is recognised as an increase in equity, and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to from the special reserve.
Shares held in treasury are not taken into account in determining NAV per share detailed in Note 9 and earnings per share detailed in Note 12.

Financial Risk Management The Company seeks to achieve its investment objective through investment in an actively managed portfolio of hedge funds, diversified by investment strategy, style and manager, in order to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns, with little correlation to equity and fixed interest benchmarks.
a Capital risk management The company manages its capital to ensure that it is able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to equity holders through the optimisation of equity balance.
The capital structure of the Company consists of shareholders equity which comprises issued share capital, and other reserves.
The Company adheres to the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
The techniques and instruments utilised for the purposes of efficient portfolio management are those which are reasonably believed by the Investment Adviser to be economically appropriate to the efficient management of the Company.
The Companys financial instruments include cash and currency hedging.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, currency risk and liquidity risk.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to moderate certain risk exposures.
b Market price risk management Market risk embodies the potential for both losses and gains and includes currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk.
Price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents both gains and losses suffered through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Companys investment portfolio is exposed to market price fluctuations which are monitored by the Investment Adviser in pursuance of its investment objective and policy.
Adherence to the Companys investment restrictions set out on page 15 in the Directors Report mitigates the risk of excessive exposure to any particular type of security or issuer.
Details of the Companys investment portfolio at the statement of financial position date are disclosed in summary form in the Managers Report.
Details of the nature and terms of derivative financial instruments outstanding at the statement of financial position date are set out in note 13.
Price Sensitivity Analysis If the price of the underlying hedge funds increased decreased by 10% the NAV of the Company would increase decrease by 79,047,419 2008: 142,501,560.
Actual trading results may differ from the above sensitivity analysis and these differences may be material.
c Interest rate risk management Substantially all of the Companys assets are non-interest bearing investments and its exposure to interest rate changes is limited.
The Company has cash and cash equivalents of 64,885,640 2008: 798,124, and has a bank overdraft of 10,326,047 2008: 242,947,995 at the year end and is therefore subject to cashflow interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.
The short term investments included within cash equivalents and bank overdraft have an overnight maturity, and as a result they have a limited exposure to fair value interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.

The Company started 2009 with a temporary facility agreement with Northern Trust Guernsey Limited for up to the lower of 404 million and 30% of its net assets.
The temporary extension of the credit limit expired on 31 January 2009.
From 1 February 2009 the facility was reduced to up to the lower of 220 million and 20% of its net assets, on a rolling basis with three months notice.
Interest on all amounts accrued at a rate of 0.75% per annum, and 1.25% for the temporary increase in facility, above the official rates applicable to the Company from time to time.
On 14 September 2009 the credit facility with Northern Trust Guernsey Limited was terminated and replaced by a secured variable funding note agreement with Credit Suisse International of up to a maximum of 200 million or 25% of Net Assets whichever is the lower.
This secured variable funding note matures on 30 August 2010 unless such date is extended.
The Company has delivered an extension request to roll the secured variable funding note for a further 12 months with effect from 30 August 2010.
The amount drawn down at 31 December 2009 was 10,326,047 2008: 242,947,995. Credit facility and secured variable funding note fees incurred amounted to 968,582 2008: 1,775,228.
The secured variable funding note is secured against the Companys cash accounts, cash balances, custody accounts, charged property, the custodial agreement, any derivative asset and the contract rights.

A decrease of 100 basis points would have had an equal and opposite effect.
d Credit risk management Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company.
Credit risk is generally higher when a non-exchange traded financial instrument is involved because the counterparty for non-exchange traded financial instruments is not backed by an exchange clearing house.
The Company is also exposed to credit risk on the financial assets with its brokers.
The carrying amounts of financial assets best represent the maximum credit risk exposure at the statement of financial position date.
This relates also to financial assets carried at amortised cost, as they have a short-term to maturity.
At the reporting date, the Companys financial assets exposed to credit risk amounted to the following: 2009 2008 000 000 Financial assets at fair value 790,474 1,425,015 Cash and cash equivalents 64,886 798 Forward currency contracts 899,017 Options 276 Balances due from broker 118,561 12,206 Other receivables 68 65 Total 1,873,282 1,438,084 Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are usually with counterparties with whom the Company has signed master netting agreements.
Master netting agreements provide for the net settlement of contracts with the same counterparty in the event of default.
Credit risk arising on transactions with brokers relates to transactions awaiting settlement.
Risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered small due to the short settlement period involved and the credit quality of the brokers used.

Financial Risk Management continued d Credit risk management continued Investments made by the Company and the funds in which it invests may not be regulated by the rules of any stock exchange or investment exchange or other regulatory body or authority.
The counterparties to such investments have no obligation to make markets in such investments.
Furthermore, the Company will be subject to the risk of bankruptcy of, or the inability or refusal to perform with respect to such investments by, the counterparties with which the Company deals.
The Investment Adviser carries out due diligence procedures before investing in an underlying managers fund.
Procedures are also in place to monitor the managers on a regular basis, thereby ensuring that the Company limits its exposure to credit risk on its underlying funds.
The Company monitors the credit rating and financial positions of the brokers used to further mitigate this risk.
Substantially all of the assets of the Company are held by Northern Trust Guernsey Limited.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the Custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the Custodian to be delayed or limited.
The Company monitors its risk by monitoring the credit quality and financial position of the Custodian.
All of the cash held by the Company is held by the Custodian and certain other financial institutions.
Bankruptcy or insolvency by the Custodian and financial institutions may cause the Companys rights with respect to the cash held by the Custodian and financial institutions to be delayed or limited.
The Company monitors its risk by monitoring the credit rating of the Custodian.
If the credit quality or the financial position of the Custodian deteriorates significantly the Investment Adviser may move the cash holdings to another bank.
The credit rating of the Northern Trust Corporation at the year end was AA 2008: AA per Standard and Poors.
Credit Suisse have a charge over assets of the Company in the event of default of payment.
The Investment Adviser analyses credit concentration based on the counterparty of the financial assets that the Company holds.
Details of the Companys ten largest holdings at 31 December 2009 are detailed in the Managers Report on page 11.
The Companys financial assets exposed to credit risk were concentrated in the following industries: 2009 2008 %% Banks 6.61 0.06 Hedge Funds 80.59 99.09 Other 12.80 0.85 Total 100.00 100.00 e Currency risk The Company may invest in financial instruments and enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than its functional currency.
Consequently the Company is exposed to risks that the exchange rate of its currency relative to other foreign currencies may change in a manner that has an adverse effect on the value of that portion of the Companys assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
The Companys operating activities include investing in derivative financial instruments that involve varying degrees of currency risk.
The derivative contracts that the Company holds from time to time are forward contracts on foreign currencies for hedging non-sterling share classes and an index option.
Details of forward contracts on foreign currencies and the index options held at 31 December 2009 are set out in note 13.
The Companys currency risk is managed on a daily basis by the Investment Adviser in accordance with policies and procedures in place as outlined in the prospectus of the fund.
The Companys overall currency positions and exposures are monitored on a quarterly basis by the Directors.

Sensitivity Analysis At 31 December 2009, had sterling strengthened by 5% in relation to the above currencies, with all other variables held constant, net assets attributable to shareholders and the change in net assets attributable to shareholders per the statement of comprehensive income would have decreased by the amounts shown below.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2008.

f Liquidity risk management The Company may not be able to liquidate quickly some of its investments in instruments at an amount close to their fair value in order to meet liquidity requirements.
At 31 December 2009, approximately 40.1% had expected liquidity within 3 months, 34.2% between 3 and 12 months and 25.7% 12 months plus.
From time to time, the counterparties with which the Company effects transactions might cease making markets or quoting prices in certain of the instruments.
In such instances, the Company might be unable to enter into a desired transaction in currencies or other financial instruments, or to enter into any offsetting transaction with respect to an open position, which might adversely affect its performance.
Similarly, it may not always be possible for the Company to execute a buy or sell order on exchanges at the desired price or to liquidate an open position either due to market conditions or due to the operation of daily price fluctuation limits the maximum fluctuation permitted by some exchanges in the price of a futures or options contract during any trading day.
If trading on an exchange is suspended or restricted, the Company may not be able to execute trades or close out positions on terms which the Investment Adviser believes are desirable.

Upon raising fresh capital, the Manager seeks to arrange increased facilities as required.
On a quarterly basis or more frequently, if deemed appropriate the Board reviews and considers the overall liquidity risk of the portfolio.
The Company started 2009 with a combined temporary overdraft and foreign exchange facility with Northern Trust Guernsey Limited of the lower of 404 million and 30% of net assets.

Financial Risk Management g Fair value measurements The Company adopted the amendment to IFRS 7, effective 1 January 2009.
This requires the Company to classify fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
IFRS 7 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritises the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3 measurements.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7 are as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices : Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
For this purpose, the significance of an input is assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety.
If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 measurement.
Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability.
The determination of what constitutes observable requires significant judgment by the Company.
The Company considers observable data to be that market data that is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market.
The following table presents the Companys financial assets and liabilities by level within the valuation hierarchy as of 31 December 2009.

The Investee Funds classified in Level 2 were fair valued using the net asset value of the Investee Fund, as reported by the respective Investee Funds administrator.
For these Investee Funds, Management believes the Fund could have redeemed its investment at the net asset value per share at the statement of financial position date.
Level 3 is comprised of 28 Investee Funds which were fair valued with reference to the net asset value as reported by the Investee Funds administrator.
23 of these 28 funds have sidepockets and amount to 6.93% of net asset value.
The remaining 5 Funds have discounts applied due to recoverability and liquidity and amount to 1.16% of net asset value.
