Service agreements The policy of the Company is to have service contracts for Executive Directors with notice periods of one year.
It is sometimes necessary when recruiting a new Executive Director to give a service contract with an initial term of longer than one year.
In such circumstances it is the policy of the Company that the notice period should reduce to one year after the initial period of service.
Toby Courtaulds compensation in lieu of notice, payable at the Companys discretion, is 12 months basic salary.
Compensation in lieu of notice of Robert Noel, Timon Drakesmith and Neil Thompson, payable at the Companys discretion, is 12 months basic salary, pension allowance and the value of benefits in kind provided in the previous year, or the actual provision of those benefits.
At the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, LTIP, SMP and other awards may be permitted to vest based upon the applicable performance conditions being tested.
The Companys policy on termination payments is to consider the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the relevant contractual terms, the circumstances of the termination and any applicable duty to mitigate.
It is the Committees policy not to reward poor performance.
On a change of control, under the terms of the Bonus Plan, the LTIP and the SMP, all the Executive Directors would also be entitled to pro rata bonuses and outstanding awards subject to the meeting of the appropriate performance conditions for the period concerned.
