When exercised, holders receive a number of shares calculated by reference to the increase in the market price at that time over the option as shown in the table above.
Any remaining share appreciation rights are shown in the table above as lapsed.
Information relating to all option schemes The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 326.22 pence 2008: 350.52 pence.
The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.8 years 2008: 5.1 years for executive and management options and 1.5 years 2008: 0.9 years for employee schemes.
For 2009, options were granted on 31 March 2009 and 30 September 2009.
The estimated fair value of options granted on these dates was 76.40 pence and 100.62 pence respectively.
For 2008, options were granted on 28 March 2008 and 30 September 2008.
The estimated average fair value of these options was 71.52 pence and 80.44 pence respectively.
Fair values for the executive and management schemes were calculated using a binomial distribution option pricing model so that proper allowance is made for the presence of performance conditions and the possibility of early exercise.
In addition, a Monte Carlo simulation model was used to estimate the probability of performance conditions being met.
Fair values for options granted under employee savingsrelated schemes are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant.
The expected volatility is calculated with reference to weekly movements in the Compass share price over the three years prior to the grant date.

For options granted after 30 September 2006, 25% of the awards will vest if the threshold GFCF target is met and 100% of the awards will vest if the maximum GFCF target is met.

The comparator group used for the award for the year commencing 1 October 2006 comprised all companies within the FTSE 100 index, whereas for subsequent years only non-financial companies have been included.
This performance condition is treated as a market-based condition for valuation purposes and an assessment of the vesting probability is built into the grant date fair value calculations.
This assessment was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model.
The remaining 50% of LTIP awards made from 1 October 2005 onwards depend on the achievement of the Group Free Cash Flow GFCF target.
25% of that part of the award will vest if the threshold GFCF target is met and 100% of that part of the award will vest if the maximum GFCF target is met.
