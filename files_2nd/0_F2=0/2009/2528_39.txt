A decision was made to further improve the presentation of the Groups intangible assets by disaggregating software development external and software licenses from the other intangible assets category.
The prior year comparatives have been re-presented accordingly.
The Groups internally generated intangible assets relate to software development associated with our customer management systems and set-top boxes.
The Groups other intangible assets mainly include copyright licences, customer lists and relationships, patents and brands acquired in business combinations.
The estimated future amortisation charge on intangible assets with nite lives for each of the next five years is set out below.
It is likely that future amortisation will vary from the gures below as the estimate does not include the impact of any future investments, disposals or capital expenditure.
2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Estimated amortisation charge 116 102 72 32 13 For intangible assets acquired in business combinations the average amortisation period is 3 years.
