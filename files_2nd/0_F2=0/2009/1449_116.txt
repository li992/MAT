AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2009 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2009 200 Additional Information In 1999, in connection with the merger between Astra and Zeneca through which the Company was formed, the Companys share capital was redenominated in US dollars.
On 6 April 1999, Zeneca shares were cancelled and US dollar shares issued, credited as fully paid on the basis of one dollar share for each Zeneca share then held.
