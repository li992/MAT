IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 Group Operating and Financial Review 21 Nature, objectives and strategies continued Expanding the Groups international reach The Group continues to expand its non-UK client base and in the year ended 31 May 2009 revenue from non-UK clients grew to 43% of total revenue 2008: 27%.
It has been a significant year for international expansion with the acquisition of FXOnline Japan KK in October and the opening of offices in Luxembourg and Milan.
A Portuguese desk was launched from our Madrid office and a number of white label arrangements were established, most notably in France with two of the countrys leading online stockbrokers, providing access to extensive client bases.
Shortly after the year end, the Group re-launched its US based CFTC-regulated exchange under the new name North American Derivatives Exchange Nadex with an expanded product set.
Nadex is the only regulated, retail-focussed, online futures exchange in the US.
The Group will continue to explore the feasibility of other branches or offices where local regulation permits and market conditions are suitable.
In addition, the Group continues to extend the range of third parties who introduce clients to the Group and this is an effective way of establishing a presence for the Groups regulated financial business in territories which do not merit the establishment of a local office.
The Group has a complete CFD offering, including website, dealing application, customer support and telephone dealing in nine languages, in addition to offering a website and dealing application in a small number of additional languages.
Continuing to deliver product and technological innovation The Group recognises the benefits it has experienced as a result of the introduction of innovative products.
During the year, a new charting package was launched providing clients with the facility to monitor trends and set parameters to trade from charts.
February and March saw the launch of PureDeal our browser-based financial dealing platform and CFDs respectively in Japan.
The introduction of automated margin calling and the close-out monitor process has led to a significant reduction in the number of clients going into deficit and has allowed a reduction in margin requirements on forex and index products.
This culture of innovation is one which the Group intends to maintain in order to continue to be at the forefront of the market in terms of product offering and technology platforms.
