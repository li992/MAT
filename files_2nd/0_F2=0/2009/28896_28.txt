The calculation is performed for the dilutive potential ordinary shares to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the Parent Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the dilutive potential ordinary shares.

These calculations use cashflow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period.
Cashflows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates which do not exceed the long term average past growth rate for the insurance business in which the CGU operates.
A number of other assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of a cashflow model to forecast operating cashflows, premium volumes, expenses and working capital requirements.
Forecasts of future cashflows are based on the best estimates of future premiums, operating expenses using historical trends, general geographical market conditions, industry trends and forecasts and other available information.
These assumptions are subject to review by management and the Group Audit Committee.
The cashflow forecasts are adjusted by appropriate discount rates.
Discount rates used are within a range of 8% to 14% 2008: 8% to 16%, are pre tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments at the date of evaluation.
The weighted average growth rates used in 2009 are within a range of 1.0% to 3.5% 2008: 0.9% to 3.5%.
No material impairments have been recognised during the year, or in prior years.

A deferred tax asset of 41m 2008: 16m has been recognised in respect of losses included within other temporary differences at 31 December 2009.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 1,428m 2008: 1,523m tax losses and unused tax credits of 11m 2008: 14m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of 115m 2008: 68m which will expire between 2010 and 2027.
Other tax losses and unused credits may be carried forward indefinitely.
The Group does not recognise deferred tax on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, as the Group is able to control the remittance of earnings to the UK and there is no intention to remit any such earnings to the UK in the foreseeable future if the remittance would trigger a material incremental UK tax liability.
The temporary difference in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries is 748m 2008: 1,410m.
Temporary differences at 31 December 2009 are significantly reduced from the previous year as a result of the repatriation of funds during the year and a change to UK tax legislation which largely exempts from UK tax overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009.
Deferred tax assets of 129m 2008: nil, which are in excess of profits arising from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and that relate to tax jurisdictions in which the Group has suffered a loss in either the current or preceding period, have been recognised on the basis that future taxable profits will be available against which these can be utilised.

The liabilities arising under the ADC contract comprise an insurance component and a deposit component.
The liability arising under the insurance component of 0.1bn represents the timing risk on the settlement of those liabilities.
The financial liability arising under the deposit component is offset by the value of funds held in a trust fund whose trust deed only permits the trust fund assets to be used to settle amounts due under the ADC.
The value of the funds held in trust at 31 December 2009 is 0.4bn and the value of the liability of the deposit component is 0.4bn.
The insurance component is accounted for within insurance liabilities and the deposit component, offset by the value of the funds held in the trust account, is recognised under other liabilities.

The Groups Swedish subsidiaries are part of a multi employer defined benefit scheme along with other financial institutions in Sweden.
As it is not possible to determine the assets and liabilities in respect of any one employer under this scheme, it is included in these accounts as a defined contribution scheme.
Contributions of 9m 2008: 9m were paid to this scheme during 2009 and are included in the costs shown above.
The latest information regarding the funding of this scheme is taken from the interim report for the first half of 2009, when the scheme funding rate was 113% 2008: 119%.
The Groups Swedish subsidiaries share of the total multi employer scheme was less than 2% 2008: less than 2%.

RetIRement benefIt oblIGAtIonS contInued defined benefit pension schemes and other post retirement benefits The major defined benefit pension schemes are located in the UK.
The assets of these schemes are held mainly in separate trustee administered funds.
In April 2002, the primary UK defined benefit schemes were effectively closed to new entrants and in 2005, following discussions with the Trustees and consultation with the members, the UK defined benefit schemes were altered from providing benefits on a final salary basis to benefits on a revalued average salary basis with effect from 1 January 2006.
Under the new benefit formula, the accrued benefits of current active members are based on salaries at the date of change and will increase in line with inflation each year limited to 5% in any year up to their retirement date.
Benefits earned in each year from 1 January 2006 are based on salaries in that year and are revalued up to retirement.
In addition to these changes, the 2002 Scheme which was the scheme to which new UK employees had been admitted following the closure of the defined benefit schemes to new members has been closed to further accrual from 1 January 2006.
It has been replaced by a stakeholder arrangement and members of the 2002 Scheme and future new employees in the UK accrue future benefits on a defined contribution basis under the stakeholder scheme.
During the year the Group entered into arrangements that insured 55% of the retirement obligations relating to pensions in payment in the two main UK schemes.
The arrangements comprise of assets and interest rate swaps combined with an insurance contract that provide for the full payment of the pensions in return for the actual investment return on a segregated portfolio of assets held by the pension funds at the inception of the arrangement.
The pension schemes continue to benefit from the assets held in the portfolio and retain the obligation to meet the insured pension obligations.
The assets and pension obligations are therefore not derecognised in the financial statements and an asset representing the recovery of the insured pension obligations and a liability to pay the investment return on the portfolio of assets to the insurer are recognised.
For the two main UK defined benefit schemes, the level of contributions in 2009 were 23% and 22% of pensionable salaries 2008: 23% and 22%.
Additional contributions totalling 45m 2008: 38m were made to the schemes, in accordance with the plan to reduce their funding deficits.
Expected contributions to pension and post retirement benefit schemes for the year ending 31 December 2010 are approximately 67m, including a further 31m of additional contributions.
The major defined benefit schemes are subject to regular valuation using the projected unit method which is the basis used to determine the pension cost in the consolidated income statement.
Independent, qualified actuaries carry out valuations of the major defined benefit schemes for the purposes of assessing pension costs.
The Group also provides post retirement healthcare benefits to certain current and retired Canadian employees.
The benefits are not prefunded.
Life insurance benefits, which provide varying levels of coverage, are provided at no cost to retirees.
Healthcare benefits, which also provide varying levels of coverage, require retiree contributions in certain instances.
Benefits are generally payable for life.
The estimated discounted present values of the unfunded accumulated obligations are calculated in accordance with the advice of independent, qualified actuaries.

The expected return on schemes assets are determined for each asset class by considering both market conditions at the beginning of the reporting period and any expectations for longer term changes in current returns.
All returns are net of investment expenses.
mortality rate The mortality assumptions are set following investigations of the main schemes recent experience by the schemes actuaries for the funding valuations.
In 2009 the mortality assumptions adopted for the main UK schemes used the SAPS Light Normal base table with percentage adjustments to reflect the schemes recent experience compared with that expected under these tables.
Reductions in future mortality rates are allowed for by using 80% males and 60% females of the long cohort improvements.
The weighted average assumptions imply that a current pensioner aged 60 has an expected future lifetime of 27.5 years males and 28.1 years females and a future pensioner aged 60 in 15 years time has a future expected lifetime from age 60 of 28.2 years males and 28.6 years females.
In 2008 the mortality assumptions adopted for the main UK schemes used the PMA92 and PFA92 mortality tables for males and females respectively, with age ratings to reflect the schemes recent experience compared with that expected under these tables.
Reductions in future mortality rates are allowed for using the medium cohort projection and using the projected mortality rates applicable to calendar year 2014 for current pensioners and 2032 for future pensioners.
The weighted average assumptions imply that a current pensioner aged 60 has an expected future lifetime of 25.8 years males and 27.0 years females and a future pensioner aged 60 in 15 years time has a future lifetime of 27.2 years males and 28.2 years females.

RetIRement benefIt oblIGAtIonS contInued commutation Each of the UK defined benefit pension schemes has changed its rules to allow for increased commutation following A day in April 2006.
The commutation factors are broadly cost neutral i. e. when valued on the IAS 19 basis, the amount of cash taken is approximately equal to the value of the pension being given up.
For this reason there is no change made to previous practice whereby the accounting valuation makes no allowance for commutations.
post retirement medical benefits The valuation of liabilities for non pension post retirement liabilities in Canada assumes health care cost trend rates of 4.5% per annum for hospital, other medical and vision care, 4.0% per annum for dental, and 9.0% per annum in 2009 grading down to 4.5% per annum in and after 2029 for prescription drugs 2008: 7% decreasing to 5% in 2017.
Sensitivity analysis The discount rate, the assumed inflation rate and the mortality assumptions all have a significant effect on the IAS 19 accounting valuation.
A 0.1% increase in the discount rate would reduce the defined benefit obligations in the UK not covered by the insurance arrangement by 49m.
A 0.1% increase in the inflation rate assumption would increase the defined benefit obligations in the UK not covered by the insurance arrangement by 43m.
An increase of one year in life expectancy would increase the defined benefit obligations in the UK not covered by the insurance arrangement by approximately 68m.
The effect of an increase of one percentage point and the effect of a decrease of one percentage point in the assumed medical cost trend rates in Canada on the following is set out below: 1% increase 1% decrease 2009 2008 2009 2008 m m m m Aggregate of the current service cost and interest components of net periodic post employment medical costs 0.4 0.5 0.3 0.4 Accumulated post employment benefit obligation for medical costs 5.4 3.5 4.3 2.8 27.
ShARe bASed compenSAtIon The Group has five types of share based payment plans which are settled in the form of ordinary shares: the Executive Share Option Scheme: the Sharesave Plan: the Share Matching Plan: the Long Term Incentive Plan and the Sharebuild Plan.
Dilution levels for all schemes are held strictly within Association of British Insurers limits.
The total employment cost recorded in the income statement for all plans was 27m in 2009 2008: 25m.
executive Share option Scheme The Group operates an Executive Share Option Scheme, which provides options to purchase ordinary shares to officers and other key employees at prices not less than the fair value of the ordinary shares at the date of grant.
The performance conditions in respect of awards under the Executive Share Option Scheme are described on page 63.
The exercise price of all options is the fair value of the ordinary shares on the date of grant.
All options expire 10 years after the date of the grant.
The weighted average share price on the dates the options were exercised in 2009 was 115.44p 2008: 147.57p.
Sharesave plan Under the Groups Sharesave Plan savings related eligible employees can receive options to purchase ordinary shares at a price equal to 80% of the fair value of the ordinary shares on the date of grant.
All options vest either three or five years from the grant date and expire six months after vesting.
The number of shares available for purchase from the plan by each participant is limited to the whole number of shares purchasable from the aggregate value of the individuals savings contract upon maturity.
An individuals maximum monthly contribution to all current savings contracts is 250.

The weighted average share price on the dates the options were exercised in 2009 was 133.66p 2008: 147.21p.
Fair values for the options granted under the Sharesave Plan were estimated as of the date of grant using the Black Scholes pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: dividend yields of 6.0% 2008: 5.7% : expected volatilities of 37% 2008: 30% : ordinary share price of 123.50p 2008: 158.10p : risk free interest rates of 2.2% 2008: 4.3% : and expected terms equal to the vesting terms of three or five years.
An estimate based on past experience is made of the number of forfeitures during the vesting period due to employees leaving the Group.
The expected volatility is determined by reference to the actual volatility of the share price over the appropriate term ending on the grant date.
Share matching plan The Groups Share Matching Plan for executive directors and other selected executives was adopted following approval obtained at the 2004 AGM.
Awards were made between 2004 and 2006.
The performance conditions in respect of awards under the Share Matching Plan are described in the footnote to the long term incentive schemes table audited part on page 66.
Under the plan, Deferred Share awards granted are held in trust for three years and are normally forfeited upon an employee leaving the Group.
No further performance conditions apply.
Participants may also receive Matching Share awards up to a maximum of three times the number of Deferred Shares awarded.
Matching Share awards are subject to the achievement of total shareholder return targets over a single two year period, with performance measured by comparison against other UK listed companies.
Matching Share awards vest with the Deferred Share awards on the third anniversary of the date of grant to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.

Awards have been made each year since 2006 following shareholder approval.
The structure of the plan allows for a number of different types of awards to be made.
Voluntary Deferred Shares are purchased by participants from net bonus payable limited to a maximum value of 33% of net bonus : in addition, for senior executives, the Remuneration Committee may defer a portion of an individuals gross bonus limited to 33% of that bonus into an award over shares referred to for the purpose of the plan as Compulsory Deferred Shares.
Voluntary Deferred Shares are held in trust for three years.
Compulsory Deferred Shares awards are normally forfeited on an employee leaving the Group.
The Remuneration Committee may make a conditional award of shares on a matched basis to Voluntary and Compulsory Deferred Shares Matching Shares up to a maximum of 2.5:1 and these are normally forfeited on an employee leaving the Group.
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee may make conditional awards of Performance Shares to senior executives and conditional awards of Restricted Shares to other executives and senior managers.
Awards of Performance Shares and Matching Shares related to Compulsory Deferred Shares are subject to a performance condition consisting of a combination of a return on equity target and a total shareholder return target with performance measured by comparison against other European insurance companies over a single three year performance period.
Matching Shares related to Voluntary Deferred Shares are subject only to the return on equity performance condition.
Restricted Shares are not subject to performance conditions.
All awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
Performance Shares and Restricted Shares are normally forfeited on an employee leaving the Group.

A dividend yield of 6.0% 2008: 5.7% was assumed.
Market related performance criteria were based on an arithmetic mean estimate of performance against a specified group of 13 competitors and it is assumed that all non market related performance criteria would be met such that all awards would be exercisable.
Sharebuild Sharebuild a HMRC approved Share Incentive Plan was adopted by shareholders at the 2009 AGM and launched in August 2009 with the first Partnership Shares purchased in December 2009.
Sharebuild is available to all UK based employees employed at 30 June each year.
In 2009 one Matching Share was allotted and held in trust for every one Partnership Share acquired with participants contributions.
The total potential share awards issued during the year and outstanding at 31 December 2009 is 126,682 shares.
Under the Sharebuild plan, the weighted average estimated fair value of each Matching Share award granted by the Company in 2009 was 98.80p.

other share based payments Certain employees of the Groups former US operation held entitlements under the Equity Incentive Scheme for US Employees prior to the disposal of the operation.
On disposal of the US operation the options under the scheme became cash settled and the majority of the options vested.
There are also other plans under which awards have been granted to certain employees in the form of cash settled share based awards.
Under these plans, if the vesting conditions are satisfied, cash awards are made based upon the underlying performance of the Parent Companys ordinary shares.
Awards were made in 1999 and 2001 under old schemes and during 2004 and 2005 on terms that provide the same potential benefits as the Share Matching Plan.
The liability in respect of these plans at 31 December 2009 was 1m 2008: 1m.
The intrinsic value of awards that had vested at 31 December 2009 was 1m 2008: 1m.

Fair value adjustments to the book value of the net assets of the subsidiaries acquired immediately before the combinations resulted in the recognition of 33m of intangible assets.
The intangible assets recognised as a result of the combinations consist of a brand and customer lists.
If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2009, Group net written premiums for the year would have increased by 38m and the Groups profit after tax would have decreased by 13m.
The total loss after tax of the acquired entities since the acquisition dates included in the Groups profit for the period is 9m.
Goodwill is individually assessed on each acquisition.
The goodwill on the acquisition of Intouch arose from the premium paid for acquiring market leading businesses in direct insurance in Poland, Russia and the Czech Republic, their future growth opportunities, and for acquiring the skilled workforce to drive future profitability in these markets.
The goodwill in Canada and Ireland arose from the premium paid for strengthening the Groups market position in targeted business segments and acquiring the skilled workforce to drive future profitability in those segments.
Goodwill also represents the future cost saving from expected synergies and economies of scale.
