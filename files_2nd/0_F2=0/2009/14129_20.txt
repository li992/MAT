This change is being introduced by reducing the rate of allowances that may be claimed from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2011 at which point the allowances will be removed.
The removal of these allowances has resulted in an exceptional deferred tax charge of 185.6 million in the period.
The Finance Act 2007 implemented a reduction in the corporation tax rate from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008.
The impact of this rate reduction on the deferred tax provision was reflected in the prior year and resulted in deferred tax credits of 54.7 million in the profit and loss account and 5.4 million in reserves.

72 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 16 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Severn Trent Employee Share Ownership Trust, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys shares during the year.
Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are calculated on the basis of profit from continuing operations attributable to the equity holders of the company.
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: Earnings 2009 2008 m m Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations being: Loss profit for the period attributable to the equity holders of the company 57.8 209.5 Adjustment to exclude: Profit for the period from discontinued operations 0.8 Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 57.8 208.7 Number of shares 2009 2008 m m Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic earnings per share 234.9 233.6 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares: Share options and LTIPs 0.7 1.7 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted earnings per share 235.6 235.3 Adjusted earnings per share 2009 2008 Pence Pence Adjusted basic earnings per share 92.7 97.8 Adjusted diluted earnings per share 92.4 97.1 Adjusted earnings per share figures are presented for continuing operations.
These exclude the effects of deferred tax, gains losses on financial instruments and exceptional items in both 2009 and 2008.
The directors consider that the adjusted figures provide a useful additional indicator of performance.
The denominators used in the calculations of adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share are the same as those used in the unadjusted figures set out above.
The adjustments to earnings are as follows: Adjustments to earnings 2009 2008 m m Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 57.8 208.7 Adjustments for: Exceptional items 18.9 68.8 Current tax related to exceptional items at 28% 30% 1.8 5.6 Losses on financial instruments 87.0 31.0 Deferred tax 171.5 74.4 Earnings for the purpose of adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share 217.8 228.5 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 73 Group financial statements 17 Goodwill 2009 2008 m m Cost and net book value At 1 April 50.2 49.1 Additions 0.4 Exchange adjustments 13.1 0.7 At 31 March 63.3 50.2 Goodwill impairment tests Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash generating units CGUs identified according to country of operation and business segment.

These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period.
The key assumption underlying these budgets is the revenue growth.
Assumptions are determined by management of each CGU based on past experience, current market trends and expectations of future developments.
Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using an estimated nominal growth rate stated below.
The growth rate does not exceed the long term average growth rate for the economy in which the CGU operates.
The assumptions used in relation to growth rates beyond the five year period and discount rates were: Nominal growth rate Discount rate 2009 2008 2009 2008 % % % % Water Purification US 3.0 3.0 8.7 11.5 Contract Operations US 3.0 3.0 9.2 11.5 UK Services 3.0 3.0 9.5 11.5 UK Laboratories 3.0 3.0 9.5 11.5 Services Italy 3.0 3.0 11.7 11.5 The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the CGU.
Changes in the growth rate outside the five year period or in the discount rate applied to the cash flows could cause the CGUs carrying amounts to exceed their recoverable amounts.
The amount by which the recoverable amount of each CGU exceeded its carrying value and the amount by which the growth rate or discount rate would have to change in order to reduce the recoverable amount of the CGU to its carrying value is set out below.

The group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
Discounted future cash flows are used to determine fair values for debt.
Discount rates are derived from yield curves based on quoted interest rates.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
Cross currency swaps and forward exchange contracts are valued by reference to quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the contracts.
The fair values of available for sale financial assets, which comprise unquoted equity instruments, cannot be measured reliably since there is no active market in the instruments.
Hence the investments are held at cost.
It is not possible to determine a range of estimates within which the fair values are highly likely to lie.
The nominal values less impairment provisions of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the group for similar financial instruments.

The groups overall risk management programme addresses the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potential adverse effects on the groups financial performance or position.
Financial risks are managed by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the board of directors.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the groups operating units.
The board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas such as exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivative and non derivative financial instruments and the investment of surplus funds.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and interest rates.
The groups policy is that derivative financial instruments are not held for trading.
80 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 22 Financial instruments continued f Financial risk factors continued i Market risk The principal market risk that the group is exposed to is fluctuations in interest rates.
Since substantially all of the groups profits and net assets arise from Severn Trent Water, which has very limited and indirect exposure to changes in exchange rates, the sensitivity of the groups results to changes in exchange rates is not material.
Interest rate risk The groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group policy is to maintain 45-90% of its net debt in fixed rate instruments.
At 31 March 2009 some 82% of the groups net debt was fixed 2008: 70%.
The group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.
Under the terms of the interest rate swaps, the group agrees with other parties to exchange, semi annually, the difference between fixed contract and floating rate interest rates calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts.
The group has entered into a series of long dated interest rate swaps to hedge future debt.
Economically these act to fix debt within the group which is denominated as floating rate, but do not achieve hedge accounting under the strict criteria of IAS 39.
This has led to a 80.5 million charge 2008: charge of 24.3 million in the income statement.
Some of the groups debt is index linked, that is its cost is linked to changes in the Retail Price Index RPI.
This debt provides an economic hedge for Severn Trent Waters revenues and regulatory asset values that are also RPI linked under its regulatory regime.
The principal outstanding under index linked debt is adjusted by the change in RPI at regular intervals.
Interest is charged at fixed rates on the adjusted amount.

However, since substantially all of the groups profits and net assets arise from Severn Trent Water, which has very limited and indirect exposure to changes in exchange rates, the sensitivity of the groups results to changes in exchange rates is not material.
The group has a significant value of foreign currency debt, primarily in yen and euros.
Foreign exchange risk arises when transactions are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
To manage the foreign exchange risk arising from foreign currency debt the group enters into cross currency swaps with external parties.
The groups risk management policy is to hedge 100% of all foreign currency denominated debt.
At 31 March 2009 all foreign currency denominated debt was hedged 2008: 100%.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis Since substantially all of the groups profits and net assets arise from Severn Trent Water which has no exposure to changes in exchange rates, the sensitivity of the groups results to changes in exchange rates is not material.

Amounts provided against accounts receivable and movements on the provision during the year are disclosed in note 24.
For financing purposes, derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions.
The group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.

Hedge accounting is adopted for such instruments where the criteria set out in IAS 39 are met.
i Fair value hedges The group raises debt denominated in currencies other than sterling principally Japanese Yen and Euro.
Cross currency swaps are entered into at the time that the debt is drawn down to swap the proceeds into sterling debt bearing interest based on LIBOR in order to mitigate the groups exposure to exchange rate fluctuations.
The terms of the receivable leg of the swap closely match the terms of the underlying debt hence the swaps are expected to be effective hedges.
At the year end the amounts of cross currency swaps designated as fair value hedges was as follows: Notional principal amount Fair value 2009 2008 2009 2008 m m m m US Dollar 27.0 55.5 9.9 6.7 Euro 550.0 581.0 108.9 21.8 Yen 205.9 251.8 85.7 2.0 Czech Krona 65.7 100.3 25.6 24.6 Other 11.4 14.7 7.0 1.9 860.0 1,003.3 237.1 39.6 ii Cash flow hedges The group has entered into interest rate swap contracts under which it has agreed to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the future cash flow exposures arising from issued variable rate debt.
The group has also entered into a number of interest rate swap contracts with start dates set at annual intervals throughout the AMP4 regulatory period.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on debt which is highly probable to be issued over the AMP4 period to fund Severn Trent Waters capital programme and have been accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the balance sheet date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves prevailing at the balance sheet date and the credit risk inherent in the contract.
The interest rate swaps settle net on a biannual basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is six months LIBOR.
Details of interest rate swaps that have been accounted for as cash flow hedges are summarised below: Average contract Notional fixed interest rate principal amount Fair value 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 Period to maturity % % m m m m Less than 1 year 1 to 2 years 4.74 106.0 3.3 2 to 5 years 4.76 142.0 0.1 More than 5 years 5.18 5.18 40.5 14.7 6.3 1.5 146.5 156.7 9.6 1.6 86 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 22 Financial instruments continued g Hedge accounting continued Changes in the amounts deferred in equity during the period relating to cash flow hedges were as follows: 2009 2008 m m Fair value gains deferred in equity at start of the period 6.4 4.1 Fair value losses gains recognised in equity in the period 7.8 2.3 Fair value losses transferred to finance costs in the period 4.9 4.6 Fair value gains deferred in equity at end of the period 3.5 6.4 During the period the group has ceased to account for certain forward start swaps as cash flow hedges because the group was not able to identify specific debt instruments that would enable the strict hedge accounting criteria of IAS 39 to be met when the swaps started.
Fair value losses amounting to 0.3m relating to these swaps that had been taken directly to equity will be transferred to the income statement on a straight line basis over the remaining lives of the swaps.
Any future changes in the fair values of the swaps will be recorded in the income statement.
Details of interest rate swaps that have not been accounted for as cash flow hedges, including those where hedge accounting has been discontinued in the period, are summarised below: Average contract Notional fixed interest rate principal amount Fair value 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 Period to maturity % % m m m m Less than 1 year 1 to 2 years 5.66 249.0 18.6 2 to 5 years 5.34 213.0 1.8 5 to 10 years 6.32 6.32 225.0 235.0 33.3 18.8 10 to 20 years 20 to 30 years 5.65 4.83 446.7 560.0 110.1 42.7 920.7 1,008.0 162.0 63.3 Contracts where the group receives fixed interest are summarised below: Average contract Notional fixed interest rate principal amount Fair value 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 Period to maturity % % m m m m 5 to 10 years 5.18 5.18 200.0 200.0 18.1 0.8 23 Inventory 2009 2008 m m Inventory and work in progress 30.6 24.8 24 Trade and other receivables 2009 2008 m m Trade receivables 294.1 282.8 Less provision for impairment of receivables 93.0 83.4 Trade receivables net 201.1 199.4 Receivables from related parties 0.2 0.2 Other amounts receivable 18.4 24.9 Prepayments and accrued income 227.4 209.6 447.1 434.1 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 87 Group financial statements 24 Trade and other receivables continued The carrying values of trade and other receivables are reasonable approximations of their fair values.
Prepayments and accrued income include 24.2 million 2008: 13.3 million in respect of amounts due from customers for contract work and 44.2 million 2008: 42.4 million which is recoverable after more than one year.
Credit control policies and procedures are determined at the individual business unit level.
By far the most significant business unit of the group is Severn Trent Water Limited, which represents 80% of group turnover and 60% of trade receivables.
Severn Trent Water has a statutory obligation to provide water and sewerage services to customers within its region.
Therefore there is no concentration of credit risk with respect to its trade receivables and the credit quality of its customer base reflects the wealth and prosperity of all of the commercial businesses and domestic households within its region.
None of the other business units are individually significant to the group.

c Background The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, covering the majority of UK employees.
The defined benefit schemes are funded to cover future salary and pension increases and their assets are held in separate funds administered by trustees.
The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
A formal actuarial valuation of each scheme is carried out on behalf of the trustees at triennial intervals by an independent professionally qualified actuary.
Under the defined benefit schemes, members 1 1 are entitled to retirement benefits calculated as a proportion varying between and for each year of service of their salary for the 30 80 final year of employment with the group or, if higher, the average of the highest three consecutive years salary in the last ten years of employment.
The final salary sections of all of the pension schemes listed below are closed to new entrants and the age profile of scheme participants is expected to rise and hence service costs are also expected to rise in the future.
The UK defined benefit schemes and the date of their last formal actuarial valuation are as follows: UK defined benefit scheme Date of last formal actuarial valuation Severn Trent Pension Scheme STPS 31 March 2007 Severn Trent Water Mirror Image Pension Scheme 31 March 2006 The STPS is by far the largest of the groups UK defined benefit schemes.
The Severn Trent Senior Staff Pension Scheme was merged with the STPS on 31 March 2009.
The group has an obligation to pay pensions to a number of former employees, whose benefits would otherwise have been restricted by the Finance Act 1989 earnings cap.
Provision for such benefits amounting to 6.2 million 2008: 6.4 million is included in an unfunded scheme within the retirement benefit obligation.
d Actuarial assumptions The major assumptions used in the valuation of the STPS also the approximate weighted average of assumptions used for the valuations of all group schemes were as follows: 2009 2008 % % Price inflation 2.90 3.40 Salary increases 3.90 4.90 Pension increases in payment 3.00 3.40 Pension increases in deferment 2.90 3.40 Discount rate 6.70 6.40 Long term rate of return on: Equities 8.00 8.00 Gilts 4.20 4.55 Corporate bonds 6.70 6.40 Property 6.10 6.30 Cash 0.50 5.25 The assumption for price inflation is derived from the difference between the yields on longer term fixed rate gilts and on index linked gilts.
The discount rate is based on the annualised yield from the iBoxx over 15 year AA rated sterling corporate bond index.
At 31 March 2008 the yield on this index was distorted by certain bonds that were exhibiting unusually high yields.
These bonds were excluded from the calculation of the discount rate at that date.
The expected rate of return on scheme assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the period for returns over the life of the benefit obligation.
For gilts and corporate bonds the expected rates of return are based on market yields.
For equities, an equity risk premium has been added to the gilt rate.
Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 93 Group financial statements 29 Retirement benefit schemes continued d Actuarial assumptions continued The mortality assumptions adopted are based on mortality tables applicable to the sex and year of birth of individual members, with the medium cohort allowance for future improvements in longevity.
For men the assumptions are based on the 00 series tables and for women the 92 series, both projected to calendar year 2005 with medium cohort improvements to 2005 and a two year age rating applied.
These have been based on a mortality investigation carried out in conjunction with the valuation of the STPS, carried out on behalf of the trustees, as at 31 March 2007.
The life expectancies implied by the mortality assumptions adopted at each year end are as follows 2009 2008 Age to which current pensioners aged 65 are expected to live men years 85.1 85.1 women years 88.2 88.2 Age to which future pensioners aged 45 at the balance sheet date are expected to live men years 85.9 85.9 women years 88.9 88.9 The calculation of the scheme liabilities is sensitive to the actuarial assumptions and in particular to the assumptions relating to discount rate, price inflation and mortality.
The following table summarises the estimated impact on scheme liabilities and service cost resulting from changes to key actuarial assumptions whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 21 million Price inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 21 million Mortality Increase life expectancy by 1 year Increase by 28 million e Contributions to the schemes Contribution rates are set in consultation with the trustees for each scheme and each participating employer.
It is anticipated that normal contributions to the scheme in the year ending 31 March 2010 will be in the order of 32 million and lump sum deficit reduction contributions of 10 million are planned.

This was closed to new entrants on 1 April 2005 and replaced by the Severn Trent Stakeholder Pension Scheme.
The total cost charged to operating costs of 5.1 million 2008: 1.5 million represents contributions payable to these schemes by the group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes.
As at 31 March 2009, all contributions 2008: 100% due in respect of the current reporting period had been paid over to the schemes.

Weekly volatility in the observed data varied between 10% and 20%.
For the 2008 09 LTIP award and the 2007 08 award the comparator group is the companies ranked 51 150 in the FTSE index.
Comparator group volatility was therefore based on observed volatility for the FTSE 250 index.
Correlation between Severn Trent and the comparator group was based on the average pairwise correlation for companies in the FTSE 250.
The share price at the grant date was 12.80 2008: 13.70.
The vesting period commences before the grant date.
Performance in the vesting period prior to the grant date is taken into account in determining the fair value of the award.
Dividends paid on shares during the vesting period are accumulated during the vesting period and released subject to achievement of the performance condition, in the same manner as the underlying shares.
As a result a dividend yield assumption is not required.
The Services LTIP is based entirely on non market based conditions and hence market assumptions are not required to determine the fair value of the award.
For 2008 09 it has been assumed that performance against the Services LTIP non market vesting conditions will be 80%.
Details of the basis of the LTIP schemes are set out in the remuneration report on page 46. ii Employee Sharesave Scheme Under the terms of the Sharesave Scheme, the board may grant the right to purchase ordinary shares in the company to those employees who have entered into an HMRC approved Save As You Earn contract for a period of three or five years.
