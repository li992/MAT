Provisions Total Group m At 26 April 2008: Current 3.5 Non-current 0.2 3.7 Currency retranslation 0.1 Provisions utilised 2.9 Charged during the year 3.9 At 25 April 2009 4.8 Analysed as: Current 4.6 Non-current 0.2 4.8 Provisions almost entirely consist of amounts in respect of store closures and restructuring.
The utilisation of provisions in the current year largely reflects store closures and the rental costs, net of sublet income, of previously closed stores.
Of the 3.9m provision created in the year 1.6m 2008: 4.6m was in respect of store closures in the combined Waterstones store portfolio following the acquisition of Ottakars and 2.3m 2008: nil was in respect of store restructuring costs as a result of the implementation of the Waterstones book hub.
The remaining provisions are expected to be largely utilised in the next two years.
The Company did not have any provisions at either 25 April 2009 or 26 April 2008.
Derivatives and financial instruments Currency derivatives The Group uses derivative instruments in order to manage foreign currency exchange risk arising on expected future purchases of internationally sourced products in the Groups subsidiaries.
In all cases the implementation of these derivative instruments has been negotiated to match expected purchases and qualify for hedge accounting.
The fair value of cash flow hedges in place at 25 April 2009 is 0.1m asset 2008: 0.4m liability, which has been recognised in the hedging reserve.
Interest rate hedging Based on its current debt levels, the Group moves to a net cash position during its third quarter and therefore interest rate exposure is limited.
Consequently, no interest rate hedging instruments have been utilised.
Interest rate exposures continue to be monitored in accordance with the Groups treasury policies.
