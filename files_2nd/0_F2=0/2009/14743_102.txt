Deferred tax recognised on full acquisition of Greater Gabbard Offshore Winds was derecognised on disposal of 50% of the shareholding.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset, including the asset balances analysed the tables above.
The following is an analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: Consolidated Company 2009 2008 2009 2008 m m m m Deferred tax liabilities 594.7 967.3 9.6 Deferred tax assets 100.1 43.1 32.7 Net deferred tax liabilities assets 494.6 924.2 32.7 9.6 The deferred tax assets disclosed relate to the Groups pension scheme liabilities.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 1.7m 2008 2.1m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and jointly controlled entities are recorded as part of the Groups share of investment in those entities.
The aggregate amount of these is a charge of 1.0m 2008 10.1m credit.
