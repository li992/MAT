This was calculated using the Black-Scholes share option pricing model, except for awards which have market-based performance conditions, where a Monte-Carlo simulation model was used, and for grants of nil-priced options, which were treated as the award of a free share.
The fair value of nil-priced options granted during the year was measured on the basis of the market-price of the Companys shares on the date of grant, discounted for expected dividends which would not be received over the vesting period of the options.
i Sharesave Schemes The weighted average fair value of equity-settled share awards granted during the year under the Sharesave Schemes, as estimated at the date of grant, was 1.98 2008: 2.23.
For those awards with exercise prices, this was calculated using the Black-Scholes share option pricing model.
Awards granted as nil-priced options were treated as the award of a free share.
The following weighted average assumptions were used in calculating these fair values: 2009 2008 Share price 4.38 6.93 Exercise price 2.49 5.38 Expected volatility 22.4% 23.0% Expected life 3.7 years 4.1 years Expected dividends 3.9% 2.2% Risk-free interest rate 4.1% 5.0% ii Senior Management Schemes The weighted average fair value of equity-settled share awards granted during the year under the Senior Management Schemes, as estimated at the date of grant, was 3.49 2008: 5.54.
For those awards with market-based performance conditions, this was calculated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model.
The Monte-Carlo simulation model reected the historical volatilities of the Companys share price and those of all other companies to which the Companys performance would be compared, over a period equal to the vesting period of the awards.
The following weighted average assumptions were used in calculating these fair values: 2009 2008 Share price 4.54 6.53 Exercise price 0.00 0.00 Expected volatility 21.9% 18.9% Expected life 3.0 years 1.9 years Expected dividends 3.7% 2.4% Risk-free interest rate 4.7% 5.3% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price, over a period equal to the expected life of the options.
Expected life was based on the contractual life of the awards and adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
