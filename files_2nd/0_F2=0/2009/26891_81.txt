The Merchants Trust PLC Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 January 2009 The Companys taxable income is exceeded by its tax allowable expenses, which include both the revenue and capital elements of the management fee and finance costs of borrowing.
The Company has surplus expenses carried forward of 125.6 million 2008 114.2 million.
Given the Companys current investment strategy, it is unlikely to generate sufficient UK taxable profits to relieve these expenses.
As at 31 January 2009 there is an unrecognised deferred tax asset measured of 35.1 million 2008 32.0 million.
This deferred tax asset relates to the current and prior year unutilised expenses.
It is considered unlikely that there will be a liability in the future against which the deferred tax asset can be offset.
Therefore the asset has not been recognised.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust and the intention to continue meeting the conditions to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the disposal of investments.
