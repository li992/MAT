Financial statements IFRS 151 Performance review Aviva plc Corporate responsibility Notes to the consolidated Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information financial statements Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 1 Exchange rates The Groups principal overseas operations during the year were located within the Eurozone and the United States.
The results and cash flows of these operations have been translated into sterling at an average rate for the year of 1 0.88 2008: 1 0.80 and 1 US$1.57 2008: 1 US$1.85.
Total foreign currency movements during 2009 resulted in a gain recognised in the income statement of 154 million 2008: 327 million loss.
2 Presentation changes a Changes to presentation i The Group has adopted IAS 1 Revised, Presentation of Financial Statements, as of 1 January 2009.
The principal impact of this has been in the following areas: a The titles of some of the prime statements have changed, so that the consolidated statement of recognised gains and losses is now called the consolidated statement of comprehensive income: the reconciliation of movements in consolidated shareholders equity is now called the consolidated statement of changes in equity: the consolidated balance sheet is renamed the consolidated statement of financial position: and the consolidated cash flow statement is renamed the consolidated statement of cash flows.
b The standard requires the income tax effect of each component of comprehensive income to be disclosed.
This information is given in note 13. c Changes in the year in each element of equity must now be shown on the face of the consolidated statement of changes in equity, rather than in the notes.
d The standard requires entities to present a comparative consolidated statement of financial position as at the beginning of the earliest comparative period when the entity has applied an accounting policy retrospectively, makes a retrospective restatement or reclassifies items in the financial statements.
As we have restated certain prior year figures, explained in section b below, we have presented three consolidated statements of financial position and supporting notes in these financial statements.
ii The Group has also adopted Amendments to IFRS 7, Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments, as of 1 January 2009.
The principal impact of these amendments is to require the following additional disclosures: a An analysis of financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs used in making the fair value measurements.
b An analysis of transfers of financial assets and liabilities between different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
c A reconciliation from beginning to end of period of financial assets and liabilities whose fair value is based on unobservable inputs.
d An enhanced discussion and analysis of liquidity risk, including a maturity analysis of financial assets held for managing liquidity risk, if that information is necessary to enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and extent of liquidity risk.
Comparative information for the disclosures required by the IFRS 7 amendments is not needed in the first year of application.
However, the Group has provided comparatives for the analysis of financial assets according to a fair value hierarchy, which we had previously reported.
iii As explained in note 3 c, the Group completed the Initial Public Offering IPO of its subsidiary, Delta Lloyd NV Delta Lloyd, in November 2009.
Although the Group has remained the majority shareholder after the IPO, Delta Lloyd is now managed separately from our other European operations, reflecting the change in shareholder base.
For this reason, the segmental information given in note 4 a has been modified to show Delta Lloyd and the Aviva Europe operations separately, with comparatives analysed in the same way for consistency.
b Restatement of prior year figures i During 2009, the Group undertook a review of our accounting policy for cash and cash equivalents.
Previously, we defined these as normally having a maturity of three months or less from date of acquisition.
To avoid ambiguity, our accounting policy has been refined to impose a cut-off date of exactly three months, allowing us to delete normally from the policy wording.
This refinement of policy has resulted in a reclassification of certain short-dated instruments between cash and cash equivalents and financial investments.
The impact of this refinement has been to increase financial investments and reduce cash and cash equivalents in 2008 by 538 million 2007: 430 million compared to the amounts previously stated.
As a consequence of this, cash flows from operating activities in 2008 have decreased by 58 million, with the effect of exchange rate movements accounting for the remaining 50 million.
ii During 2009, the Groups Dutch subsidiary, Delta Lloyd, carried out a review of the way it had been applying IAS 19, Employee Benefits, in its own financial statements where the corridor method of smoothing actuarial gains and losses in its pension schemes is followed: in accounting for its self-insured pension obligations and intercompany eliminations: and in its reporting to Group where the corridor accounting is reversed.
The review concluded that errors had been made locally in applying IAS 19 on the transition to IFRS and in subsequent years, such that gains on certain assets had been reported in provisions, to be released over time, rather than through other comprehensive income.
The impact of correcting these errors is to reduce other liabilities by 129 million as at 1 January 2008, increase deferred tax liabilities by 33 million and increase retained earnings at that date by 96 million.
152 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 3 Subsidiaries This note provides details of the acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries that the Group has made during the year, together with details of businesses held for sale at the year end.
The principal Group subsidiaries are listed on pages 33 to 34. a Acquisitions i Material acquisitions There were no material acquisitions in the year ended 31 December 2009. ii Other goodwill arising As disclosed in the 2008 financial statements, on 30 June 2008 the Group acquired Swiss Life Belgium SLB.
At 30 June 2009, the fair values of the assets and liabilities were updated from their provisional values to reflect decreases in the value of acquired in-force business and deferred acquisition costs, and increases in insurance and investment contract liabilities.
This has given rise to an increase in goodwill of 72 million 64 million to 132 million 117 million.
Other goodwill of 5 million has arisen on smaller acquisitions and increases in shareholdings in existing subsidiaries, together with a 16 million reduction for changes in contingent consideration payable on previous acquisitions.
None of these is considered material for separate disclosure.
iii Non-adjusting subsequent event Acquisition of River Road Asset Management On 5 January 2010, the Group announced that it had agreed to acquire 100% of River Road Asset Management, a US equity manager, to support the expansion of Aviva Investors third party institutional asset management business.
Completion took place on 24 February 2010 for an estimated total consideration of 79 million US$122 million, of which 37 million US$57 million was paid in cash on completion.
The balance comprises contingent consideration.
The contingent consideration arrangement requires the Group to pay amounts over the next five years, based on a multiple of the earnings during that period, up to a maximum total purchase price of 70 million US$108 million.
The potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that the Group could be required to make under the contingent consideration arrangement is between 26 million US$41 million and 53 million US$82 million.
In view of the recent timing of this transaction, accounting for this acquisition is not yet complete and it is currently impractical to comply with the requirements of IFRS 3, Business Combinations and to state with any certainty the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired, and therefore to estimate the goodwill arising on the transaction.

Under the terms of the agreement, CZ purchased the Delta Lloyd health insurance business and took on its underwriting risk and policy administration.
Delta Lloyd continues to market and distribute health insurance products from CZ to its existing customers and continues to provide asset management for the transferred business.
Delta Lloyd also has exclusive rights to market life, general insurance and income protection products to CZs customers.

The total sale proceeds were fixed by reference to the net assets of the businesses at 31 December 2008, adjusted to reflect the results in the period from 1 January 2009 to completion.
The profit on disposal of these wholly-owned subsidiaries was 122 million, calculated as follows: m Assets Goodwill and intangible assets 1 Investments and property and equipment 2,530 Receivables and other financial assets 60 Deferred acquisition costs and other assets 20 Tax assets 26 Cash and cash equivalents 175 Total assets 2,812 Liabilities Gross insurance liabilities and liabilities for investment contracts 2,083 Payables and financial liabilities 59 Other liabilities 249 Tax liabilities and other provisions 45 Total liabilities 2,436 Net assets disposed of 376 Cash consideration 443 Less: transaction costs 16 Less: other costs of disposal 25 Total consideration 402 Transfer from currency translation reserve 96 Profit on disposal before tax 122 The Group hedged its exposure to A$900 million of the sale proceeds through the purchase of foreign currency forward contracts.
Other costs of disposal have arisen from the agreement of a call option to purchase the shares of an associate of the Australian businesses in 2010. iii UK non-core operations On 11 February 2009, the Group sold The British School of Motoring Limited and its subsidiaries to Arques Consulting GmbH for a consideration of 4 million.
The resultant loss on disposal of 9 million was provided for in the 2008 financial statements.

154 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 3 Subsidiaries continued c Listing of minority shareholding in Delta Lloyd On 3 November 2009, Aviva plc and Delta Lloyd completed the Initial Public Offering IPO of Delta Lloyd, which commenced trading on Euronext Amsterdam on that date.
The IPO consisted of a public offering to institutional and retail investors of Delta Lloyds ordinary shares, including the over-allotment option also referred to as a greenshoe taken up on 24 November 2009.
The Group has remained the majority shareholder after the IPO, retaining 58% of the ordinary share capital in Delta Lloyd.
The transaction has been treated as an equity transaction with minorities, resulting in the following transfers between reserves: Transfers from to m Currency translation reserve note 34 351 Owner-occupied property reserve note 34 26 Investment valuation reserve note 34 156 Retained earnings note 35 3 Minority interests note 36 1,460 Net cash proceeds 930 d Operations and assets classified as held for sale Assets held for sale as at 31 December 2009 comprise: 2009 2008 2007 m m m Property and equipment held for sale see i below 102 Assets of operations classified as held for sale see ii below 53 1,448 1,128 Total assets classified as held for sale 53 1,550 1,128 i Property and equipment held for sale Property and equipment held for sale at 31 December 2008 related to the UK data centres which were sold during 2009. ii Assets and liabilities of operations classified as held for sale The assets and liabilities of operations classified as held for sale as at 31 December 2009 relate to RAC France and an Australian associate, and are as follows: 2009 2008 2007 m m m Goodwill and intangible assets 14 Investments and property and equipment 32 396 316 Receivables and other financial assets 20 386 554 Deferred acquisition costs and other assets 1 Prepayments and accrued income 1 158 145 Tax assets 17 Cash and cash equivalents 493 96 Total assets 53 1,448 1,128 Gross insurance liabilities 20 709 627 Borrowings 12 Payables and financial liabilities 22 72 Other liabilities 13 478 220 Tax liabilities and other provisions 12 11 Total liabilities 33 1,221 942 Net assets 20 227 186 On 2 December 2009, the Group announced that it had agreed to sell RAC France SA to its existing management team.

For the year ended 31 December 2009, this comprised: A net exceptional profit before tax of 207 million as a result of the reattribution of the inherited estate see note 44, of which 674 million is included in other expenses and 881 million credit is included in changes in unallocated divisible surplus: A 60 million expense for the strengthening of reserves in respect of several specific discontinued commercial liability risks written in Canada a significant number of years ago, which is included in change in insurance liabilities: and A 102 million expense for the migration of all remaining local brands, except Delta Lloyd and RAC, to the single global Aviva brand, which has been implemented over the two year period 2008 to 2009.
The cost is included in other expenses.
For the year ended 31 December 2008, this comprised: A 142 million expense for closing or exiting non-core business operations such as the lifetime wrap platform and The British School of Motoring in the UK and the structured settlement business in the United States: A 304 million expense after reinsurance for the discounted cost of strengthening latent claims provisions, mainly in the UK see note 38 : A 126 million expense for the settlement agreed by our Netherlands life business for its unit-linked policyholders, following an industry-wide challenge on the level of fees: Brand migration costs of 37 million referred to above : and A 58 million credit from settlement of a disputed Australian tax liability and the consequent release of a provision for interest charges.

The Group focuses instead on an operating profit measure that incorporates an expected return on investments supporting its long-term business.
This note explains the methodology behind this.
a Definitions Operating profit for long-term business is based on expected investment returns on financial investments backing shareholder and policyholder funds over the reporting period, with consistent allowance for the corresponding expected movements in liabilities.
Operating profit includes the effect of variance in experience for non-economic items, such as mortality, persistency and expenses, and the effect of changes in non-economic assumptions.
Changes due to economic items, such as market value movements and interest rate changes, which give rise to variances between actual and expected investment returns, and the impact of changes in economic assumptions on liabilities, are disclosed separately outside operating profit.
b Economic volatility The investment variances and economic assumption changes excluded from the long-term business operating profit are as follows: Long-term business 2009 2008 m m Investment variances and economic assumption changes 75 1,631 The limited economic variance in 2009 reflects the recovery in investment markets, with positive variances on fixed interest assets in Europe and the United States driven by the narrowing of credit spreads towards the end of the year, offset by losses from equity derivatives in the Netherlands.
Investment variances include the reversal of 160 million of losses incurred in 2008 relating to assets backing participating business in Spain.
Additional credit default provisions for corporate bonds and commercial mortgages were maintained at 550 million in the UK and increased by 97 million in Europe.
This compares to a significantly negative impact in 2008 driven by the global financial crisis.
c Methodology The expected investment returns and corresponding expected movements in long-term business liabilities are calculated separately for each principal long-term business unit.
The expected return on investments for both policyholder and shareholders funds is based on opening economic assumptions applied to the expected funds under management over the reporting period.
Expected investment return assumptions are derived actively, based on market yields on risk-free fixed interest assets at the end of each financial year.
The same margins are applied on a consistent basis across the Group to gross risk-free yields, to obtain investment return assumptions for equities and properties.
Expected funds under management are equal to the opening value of funds under management, adjusted for sales and purchases during the period arising from expected operating experience.
The actual investment return is affected by differences between the actual and expected funds under management and changes in asset mix, as well as movements in interest rates.
To the extent that these differences arise from the operating experience of the long-term business, or management decisions to change asset mix, the effect is included in the operating profit.
The residual difference between actual and expected investment return is included in investment variances, outside operating profit but included in profit before tax.
The movement in liabilities included in operating profit reflects both the change in liabilities due to the expected return on investments and the impact of experience variances and assumption changes for non-economic items.
The effect of differences between actual and expected economic experience on liabilities, and changes to economic assumptions used to value liabilities, are taken outside operating profit.
For many types of long-term business, including unit-linked and with-profits funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
For other long-term business the profit impact of economic volatility depends on the degree of matching of assets and liabilities, and exposure to financial options and guarantees.
d Assumptions The expected rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return and asset classification under IFRS.
Within the 2008 results, the expected rate of investment return was calculated by reference to the one year swap rate in the relevant currency plus an appropriate risk premium for equities and properties.
For 2009, the Group considers that the return over the typical duration of the assets held is more appropriate and is more consistent with our expectation of long-term rates of return.
The expected return on equities and properties has therefore been calculated by reference to the 10 year swap rate in the relevant currency plus an appropriate risk premium.
If the IFRS operating profit had been calculated by reference to the one year swap rate, this profit would have been 200 million lower.
There is no impact on IFRS profit before tax.
168 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 8 Long-term business economic volatility continued The principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the expected investment return for equities and properties are: Equities Properties 2009 2008 2009 2008 % % % % 7.0 9.2 5.5 7.7 United Kingdom Eurozone 7.3 8.3 5.8 6.8 For fixed interest securities classified as fair value through profit or loss, the expected investment returns are based on average prospective yields for the actual assets held.
Where such securities are classified as available for sale, such as in the United States, the expected investment return comprises the expected interest or dividend payments and amortisation of the premium or discount at purchase.
The Group has applied the same economic assumptions for equities and properties as are used under MCEV principles to calculate the longer-term investment return for its long-term business in 2008 and 2009.
9 Longer-term investment return and economic assumption changes for non-long-term business For non-long-term business, the total investment income, including realised and unrealised gains, is split between a calculated longer-term return and short-term fluctuations from this.
This note gives details of the longer-term return calculation and the relevant assumptions, as well as the economic assumption changes on our general insurance and health business.
a The short-term fluctuations in investment return and economic assumption changes attributable to the non-long-term business result and reported outside operating profit were as follows: Non-long-term business 2009 2008 m m Short-term fluctuation in investment return see b below 95 819 Economic assumption changes see g below 57 94 152 913 b The longer-term investment return and short-term fluctuation are as follows: Non-long-term business 2009 2008 m m Net investment income 1,373 522 Internal charges included under other headings 193 73 1,180 449 Analysed between: Longer-term investment return, reported within operating profit 1,085 1,268 Short-term fluctuation in investment return, reported outside operating profit 95 819 1,180 449 c The longer-term investment return is calculated separately for each principal non-long-term business unit.
In respect of equities and properties, the return is calculated by multiplying the opening market value of the investments, adjusted for sales and purchases during the year, by the longer-term rate of investment return.
The longer-term rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return.
The allocated longer term return for other investments is the actual income receivable for the year.
d The total assets supporting the general insurance and health business, which contribute towards the longer-term return, were 22,844 million 2008 restated: 23,398 million.
For other operations, the longer-term return reflects interest income earned in the Netherlands bank and retail mortgage divisions.

As explained in accounting policy K, provisions for latent claims are discounted, using rates based on the relevant swap curve, in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement of the claims.
The discount rate is set at the start of the accounting period, with any change in rates between the start and end of the accounting period being reflected below operating profit as an economic assumption change.
The range of discount rates used is disclosed in note 38 c. 10 Employee information This note shows where our staff are employed throughout the world and analyses the total staff costs.

a Tax charged credited to the income statement i The total tax charge credit comprises: 2009 2008 m m Current tax For this year 617 527 Prior year adjustments 164 284 Total current tax 453 243 Deferred tax Origination and reversal of temporary differences 231 1,814 Changes in tax rates or tax laws 2 7 Write-down of deferred tax assets 21 95 Total deferred tax 254 1,726 Total tax charged credited to income statement note 13d 707 1,483 ii The Group, as a proxy for policyholders in the UK, Ireland, Singapore and Australia prior to disposal, is required to record taxes on investment income and gains each year.
Accordingly, the tax benefit or expense attributable to UK, Irish, Singapore and Australian life insurance policyholder returns is included in the tax charge.
The tax charge attributable to policyholders returns included in the charge above is 217 million 2008: 1,068 million credit.
iii The tax charge credit can be analysed as follows: 2009 2008 m m UK tax 225 1,482 Overseas tax 482 1 707 1,483 iv Unrecognised tax losses and temporary differences of previous years were used to reduce current tax expense and deferred tax expense by 59 million and 10 million respectively 2008: 139 million and 19 million respectively.

The table below does not include the final dividend proposed after the year end because it is not accrued in these financial statements.
The impact of shares issued in lieu of dividends is shown separately in note 35.
2009 2008 m m Ordinary dividends declared and charged to equity in the year Final 2008 19.91 pence per share, paid on 15 May 2009 527 Final 2007 21.10 pence per share, paid on 16 May 2008 554 Interim 2009 9.00 pence per share, paid on 17 November 2009 248 Interim 2008 13.09 pence per share, paid on 17 November 2008 348 775 902 Preference dividends declared and charged to equity in the year 17 17 Coupon payments on direct capital instrument 61 56 853 975 Subsequent to 31 December 2009, the directors proposed a final dividend for 2009 of 15.0 pence per ordinary share 2008: 19.91 pence, amounting to 415 million 2008: 527 million in total.
Subject to approval by shareholders at the AGM, the dividend will be paid on 17 May 2010 and will be accounted for as an appropriation of retained earnings in the year ending 31 December 2010.
Interest on the direct capital instrument issued in November 2004 is treated as an appropriation of retained profits and, accordingly, it is accounted for when paid.
Tax relief is obtained at a rate of 28.0% 2008: 28.5%.

The tests led to impairment of goodwill of nil in 2009 2008: 68 million.
Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives have been tested for impairment in these businesses as follows: United Kingdom i Long-term business The United Kingdom long-term business goodwill balance is split across four cash generating units, with no individual balance exceeding 22 million.
The Group acquired Hamilton Life Assurance Company Limited from HFC Bank Limited HFC in 2007, and identified 20 million of the purchase price as goodwill in respect of unrecognised deferred tax assets which could not be utilised or recognised at the time.
"The Group is now able to recognise value for these assets and further consideration of 9 million, included in the ""Movements in contingent consideration"", is payable to HFC in this respect."
As required by paragraph 65 of IFRS 3, Business Combinations, the total 29 million has been charged to expenses, together with 1 million of transaction costs representing the balance of acquired goodwill.
Deferred tax assets have increased to recognise this new asset see note 45 b iii.
ii General insurance, RAC and health The recoverable amount of the UK general insurance, RAC and health unit has been determined based on a value in use calculation.
The calculation uses cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering a three year period and a risk adjusted discount rate of 9.5%.
Cash flows beyond that three year period have been extrapolated using a steady 2.5% growth rate.
This growth rate is set with regards to past experience and historical statistics of UK premium growth published by the Association of British Insurers.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Budgeted operating profit represents the operating profit in the business plans, approved by management, and as such reflects the best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the relevant UK industry sectors Some of the assumptions that underline the budgeted operating profit include market share, customer numbers, premium rate and fee income changes, claims inflation and commission rates: and Growth rates represent the rates used to extrapolate future cash flows beyond the business plan period and have been based upon latest information available regarding future and past growth rates, including external sources of data such as ABI Annual Market Statistics.
178 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 16 Goodwill continued Europe Long-term business The recoverable amount of long-term business cash generating units in the Europe region, has been determined based on a value in use calculation.
The first step of the test was to compare the carrying value of each cash generating unit, including goodwill, to the Market Consistent Embedded Value MCEV of that cash generating unit.
If the MCEV is less than the carrying value of a cash generating unit the present value of profits from expected new business for that cash generating unit is considered.
If the value of profits from expected new business for a cash generating unit is expected to grow beyond the period of the initial plan, this growth rate is set with regard to past experience in each market and market expectations of future growth in each country.
For European long-term business cash generating units a key assumption used for the calculation was the embedded value which represents the shareholder interest in the life business and is calculated in accordance with the Market Consistent Embedded Value MCEV principles.
The embedded value is the total of the net worth and the value of the in-force life business.
General insurance, health and other The recoverable amount of general insurance, health and other non-life cash generating units in the Europe region has been determined based on a value in use calculation.
Value in use is calculated for each cash generating unit using a discounted cash flow projection based on business plans and growth assumptions approved by management for each cash generating unit and discounted at a risk discount rate appropriate for each cash generating unit.
If the cash flows are expected to grow beyond the period of the initial plan, this growth rate is set with regard to past experience in each market and market expectations of future growth in each country.
iii France long-term business The recoverable amount of the indefinite life intangible asset has been assessed as part of the recoverable amount of the French long-term business cash generating unit.
The MCEV of the French long-term business was significantly greater than its carrying value, including indefinite life intangible assets.
iv Ireland long-term business The MCEV of the Irish long-term business is greater than its carrying value so the recoverable value will be significantly in excess of its carrying value, including goodwill.
v Ireland general insurance and health The recoverable amount of the Irish general insurance and health business exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Budgeted operating profit for an initial three year period which represents the operating profit in the business plans, approved by management and reflecting the best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the Irish economy.
The assumptions that underline the budgeted operating profit include market share, premium rate changes, claims inflation and commission rates: Future cash flows are extrapolated beyond the three year business plan period assuming nil growth for general insurance business and a 7% growth rate for the health business: and A risk adjusted discount rate of 10.8%.
vi Italy long-term business This calculation is an  appraisal value and is based on the embedded value of the business together with the present value of expected profits from future new business.
Key assumptions in addition to MCEV principles used for the calculation were: New business contribution represents the present value of projected future distributable profits generated from business written in a period.
This is initially based on the most recent three year business plans approved by management: Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate new business contributions beyond the business plan period, and is based on managements estimate of future growth of 2.0%: and Risk adjusted discount rate of 10.2% represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business.
The discount rate includes a risk-free rate and a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years for new business may differ from that assumed.
vii Italy non-life The recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Budgeted operating profit for an initial three year period represents the operating profit in the most recent business plans, approved by management and as such reflects the best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the Italian economy: Growth rate of 3.0% represents the rate used to extrapolate future cash flows beyond the business plan period: and A risk adjusted discount rate of 10.2%.
Financial statements IFRS 179 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 16 Goodwill continued viii Delta Lloyd long-term, general insurance, health and fund management The recoverable amount of the Delta Lloyd life and general insurance and health cash generating units has been determined on the basis of a value in use calculation.
This calculation is an appraisal value and is based on the discounted expected future cash flows from the operations over their expected useful life.
Expected cash flows for future periods have been obtained from the plan figures for a three to five year period, depending on the management plan period of the unit.
Expected cash flows for later periods have been extrapolated, taking into account the growth rate.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Expected cash flows for future periods have been obtained from the plan figures for a three to five year period: For the year following the end of the management plan period cash flows are extrapolated at a growth rate of nil to 2.6% depending on the particular circumstances of each unit: and Risk-adjusted discount rate of 10.1% to 10.6% depending on managements assessment of the specific risks of each unit, represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business.
ix Spain long-term business This calculation is based on the embedded value of the business together with the present value of expected profits from future new business.
The recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill.
This is initially based on the most recent three year business plans approved by management: Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate new business contributions beyond the business plan period, and is based on managements conservative estimate of future growth of 3.0%.
This growth rate is in line with industry expectations: and Risk adjusted discount rate of 6.5% represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business.
The discount rate is a combination of a risk-free rate and a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years for new business may differ from that assumed.
The test performed in the current year estimates the value of future new business on an MCEV basis.
This methodology incorporates more of the risk of future new business into the underlying cash flows, and so consequently a lower risk discount rate is applied relative to the prior period.
x United States long-term business The recoverable amount of the United States long-term cash generating unit has been determined based on a value in use calculation.
This calculation is an  appraisal value and is based on an embedded value of the business the total of the net worth of the life business and the value of the in-force business together with the present value of expected profits from future new business.
The value in use exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Embedded value represents the shareholder interest in the life business and is based on projected cash flows of the business including expected investment returns.
Risk adjusted discount rate of 8.0% is used to calculate the embedded value: New business contribution represents the present value of projected future distributable profits generated from business written in a period.
This is initially based on the most recent three year business plans approved by management: Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate new business contributions beyond the business plan period, and is based on managements estimate of future growth of 5.0% for life and annuity business, which is set with regard to past experience in these markets: and Risk adjusted discount rate of 10.0% represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business.
The discount rate includes an additional margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years for new business may differ from that assumed.
The recoverable amount for the cash generating unit exceeds its carrying value by 332 million.
An increase in the risk adjusted discount rates applied to calculate the embedded value and the present value of future profits from future new business of 60 basis points would result in the recoverable amount being equal to the carrying value.
Cash flow projections To comply with paragraph 33 c of IAS 36, cash flow projections for the period beyond the three year plan period are extrapolated from the position in the final year of the three year plan period.
In all cases we have assumed a steady growth rate for subsequent years, not an increasing growth rate.
The steady growth rate in each case is a positive or nil growth rate.
The steady growth rate selected for each cash generating unit reflects long-term expectations for the markets in which each cash generating unit participates.

a Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives comprise the RAC brand, and the value of the Union Financire fide France Banque distribution channel, where the existing lives of the assets and their competitive position in, and the stability of, their respective markets support this classification.
Impairment testing of these intangibles is covered in note 16 b. b The negative figure of 20 million for AVIF on insurance contracts arises from the updating of fair values for Swiss Life Belgium, described in note 3 a ii.
c During the year, the Group reviewed the terms of its bancassurance agreement with Banco Popolare, signed in December 2008, which was initially for 10 years with five-year automatic renewal periods.
This agreement is expected to be renewed indefinitely.
Although this agreement had originally been classified as an intangible asset with indefinite useful life, it is now considered more appropriate to reclassify it as having a finite useful life where the residual value is high, as a consequence of the terms of the put option, and amortisation immaterial and this is consistent with other similar contracts.
This has resulted in a reallocation in the year of 431 million from intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to those with finite useful lives.
d Other intangible assets with finite useful lives consist primarily of the value of bancassurance and other distribution agreements.

d Impairment testing CIMB Aviva Assurance Berhad and CIMB Aviva Takaful Berhad The Groups investments in CIMB Aviva Assurance Berhad and CIMB Aviva Takaful Berhad have been tested for impairment by comparing their carrying values which include goodwill which arose on their acquisition with their recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amounts for both the investments have been determined based on value in use calculations.
This calculation is an  appraisal value and is based on the embedded value of the business together with the present value of expected profits from future new business.
The recoverable amounts exceed the carrying values of both the investments.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Cash flow projections based on i the policy portfolio existing at the valuation date, and ii the future sales based on plans approved by management covering the subsequent three year period.
The cash flows from existing policy portfolio is calculated using best estimate assumptions, which have been supported by experience investigation where available and prudent estimates typical for the market where experience investigations are not available: The calculations use a risk adjusted discount rate of 13.2%: and New sales beyond the three year period have been extrapolated using a growth rate of 11.0%.

S. The Groups investment in AvivaSA Emeklilik five Hayat A. S. has been tested for impairment by comparing its carrying value which includes goodwill which arose on its acquisition with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Embedded value represents the shareholder interest in the life business and is calculated in accordance with the Market Consistent Embedded Value MCEV principles.
The embedded value is the total of the net worth of the life business and the value of the in-force business.
The underlying methodology and assumptions have been reviewed by a firm of actuarial consultants.
New business contribution represents the present value of projected future distributable profits generated from business written in a period.
This is initially based on the most recent three year business plans approved by management.
Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate new business contributions beyond the business plan period, and is based on managements estimate of future growth of 5.0%.
Risk adjusted discount rate of 15.0% represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business.
The discount rate reflects a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years for new business may differ from that assumed.

The Groups Dutch subsidiary owns 30.8% of the shares, and depositary receipts for shares, in Van Lanschot NV, a financial services company in the Netherlands.
The Group is not able to appoint management representation on the board of this company and is therefore unable to exert significant influence over its affairs.
Accordingly, this investment is treated as a financial investment rather than as an associate.

d Impairment testing RBS Life Investments Limited and RBSG Collective Investments Limited The Groups investments in RBS Life Investments Limited and RBSG Collective Investments Limited have been tested for impairment by comparing their carrying values which include goodwill which arose on their acquisition with their recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amounts for both investments have been determined based on value in use calculations, using an appraisal value methodology.
The appraisal value comprises MCEV and a value of future new business.
Future new business is valued using a similar approach as used for the in-force business.
The value of 2010 planned new business is based on planned volumes, planned margins for manufactured business and current margins for collectives and adopted business all approved by management.
This value is then multiplied by an annuity factor to give the value of 25 years of future new business and then discounted back to the valuation date.
The annuity factor for Life business allows for new business growth of 2.8% in 2011 and 5.4% thereafter and a pattern of market-consistent time dependent risk discount rates equivalent to a single risk discount rate of 4.4%.
For Collective Investments the new business growth assumptions are 7.7% in 2011 and 6.1% thereafter.
This value is adjusted to allow for future expense over-runs and under-runs, based on the projected expenses and sales volumes.
This methodology incorporates more of the risk of future new business into the underlying cash flows and so consequently a lower risk discount rate is applied relative to the prior period.
Banca Network Investimenti SpA The Groups investment in Banca Network Investimenti SpA has been tested for impairment by comparing its carrying value which includes goodwill which arose on its acquisition with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation prepared by an external valuation expert.
Value in use was calculated using a discounted cash flow projection based on business plans and growth assumptions approved by management and discounted at an appropriate risk discount rate.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: A cash flow project based on a five year plan period: and Risk adjusted discount rate of 10.3% based on the weighted average cost of capital of similar Italian listed companies.
As a result of the testing, an impairment of 26 million has been recognised.
This reflects adverse developments in the business environment in which this associate operates.
e Non-adjusting subsequent event On 17 February 2010, the Group sold its 35% holding in Sogessur SA to that companys main shareholder, Socit Gnrale, for a consideration of 35 million, realising a profit on disposal of 24 million.

Owner-occupied properties are stated at their revalued amounts, as assessed by qualified external valuers or by local qualified staff of the Group in overseas operations, all with recent relevant experience.
These values are assessed in accordance with the relevant parts of the current RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards in the UK, and with current local valuation practices in other countries.
This assessment, on the basis of Existing Use Value and in accordance with UK Practice Statement 1.3, is the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms length transaction, after proper marketing wherein the parties had acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion, assuming that the buyer is granted vacant possession of all parts of the property required by the business and disregarding potential alternative uses.
The valuation assessment adopts market-based evidence and is in line with guidance from the International Valuation Standards Committee and the requirements of IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment.
If owner-occupied properties were stated on a historical cost basis, the carrying amount would be 328 million 2008: 414 million.
The Group has no material finance leases for property and equipment.

190 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 23 Securitised m ortgages and related assets The Group has loans receivable, secured by mortgages, which have then been securitised through non-recourse borrowings, in our UK Life and Dutch businesses.
This note gives details of the relevant transactions.
a Description of arrangements i United Kingdom In a long-term business subsidiary Aviva Equity Release UK Limited AER, the beneficial interest in certain portfolios of lifetime mortgages has been transferred to five special purpose securitisation companies the ERF companies, in return for initial consideration and, at later dates, deferred consideration.
The deferred consideration represents receipts accrued within the ERF companies after meeting all their obligations to the note holders, loan providers and other third parties in the priority of payments.
The purchases of the mortgages were funded by the issue of fixed and floating rate notes by the ERF companies.
All the shares in the ERF companies are held by independent companies, whose shares are held on trust.
Although AER does not own, directly or indirectly, any of the share capital of the ERF companies or their parent companies, it retains control of the majority of the residual or ownership risks and rewards related to the assets of the securitisation companies, and they have therefore been treated as subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements.
AER has no right to repurchase the benefit of any of the securitised mortgage loans, other than in certain circumstances where AER is in breach of warranty or loans are substituted in order to effect a further advance.
AER has purchased subordinated notes and granted subordinated loans to some of the ERF companies.
These have been eliminated on consolidation through offset against the borrowings of the ERF companies in the consolidated statement of financial position.
ii Delta Lloyd In three subsidiaries, Delta Lloyd Levensverzekering NV DLL, Amstelhuys NV AMS, and Delta Lloyd Bank Belgium NV SA DLB, the principal benefits of certain portfolios of mortgage loans have been transferred to a number of special purpose securitisation companies, which were funded primarily through the issue of fixed and floating rate notes.
All the shares in the securitisation companies are held by independent trustee companies.
Although DLL, AMS and DLB do not own, directly or indirectly, any of the share capital of the securitisation companies or their parent companies, they retain control of the majority of the residual or ownership risks and rewards related to the assets of the securitisation companies, and these companies have therefore been treated as subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements.
DLL, AMS and DLB have no right, nor any obligation, to repurchase the benefit of any of the securitised mortgage loans before the optional call date, other than in certain circumstances where they are in breach of warranty.
Delta Lloyd companies have purchased notes in the securitisation companies, which have been eliminated on consolidation through offset against the borrowings of the securitisation companies in the consolidated statement of financial position.
iii General In all of the above transactions, the Company and its subsidiaries are not obliged to support any losses that may be suffered by the note holders and do not intend to provide such support.
Additionally, the notes were issued on the basis that note holders are only entitled to obtain payment, of both principle and interest, to the extent that the available resources of the respective special purpose securitisation companies, including funds due from customers in respect of the securitised loans, are sufficient and that note holders have no recourse whatsoever to other companies in the Aviva Group.

192 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 24 Financial investments continued b Fair value methodology i For financial assets carried at fair value, we have categorised the measurement basis into a fair value hierarchy as follows: Quoted market prices in active markets Level 1 Inputs to Level 1 fair values are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets.
An active market is one in which transactions for the asset occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Examples are listed equities in active markets, listed debt securities in active markets and quoted unit trusts in active markets.
Modelled with significant observable market inputs Level 2 Inputs to Level 2 fair values are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either directly or indirectly.
If the asset has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset.
Level 2 inputs include the following: Quoted prices for similar ie not identical assets in active markets.
Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly.
Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset for example, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities, prepayment spreads, loss severities, credit risks, and default rates.
Inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means market corroborated inputs.
Examples of these are securities measured using discounted cash flow models based on market observable swap yields, and listed debt or equity securities in a market that is inactive.
Valuations, whether sourced from internal models or third parties incorporate credit risk by adjusting the spread above the yield curve for government treasury securities for the appropriate amount of credit risk for each issuer, based on observed market transactions.
To the extent observed market spreads are either not used in valuing a security, or do not fully reflect liquidity risk, our valuation methodology, whether sourced from internal models or third parties, reflects a liquidity premium.
Where we use broker quotes and no information as to the observability of inputs is provided by the broker, we generally validate the price quoted by the broker by using internal models with observable inputs.
When the price obtained from the broker and internal model are similar, we look to the inputs used in our internal model to understand the observability of the inputs used by the broker.
In circumstances where internal models are not used to validate broker prices, and the observability of inputs used by brokers is unavailable, the investment is classified as Level 3.
Broker quotes are usually non-binding.
Modelled with significant unobservable market inputs Level 3 Inputs to Level 3 fair values are unobservable inputs for the asset.
Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset at the measurement date or market information for the inputs to any valuation models.
As such, unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions the business unit considers that market participants would use in pricing the asset.
Examples are certain private equity investments and private placements.
The majority of the Groups financial assets are valued based on quoted market information or observable market data.
A small percentage 4% of total financial assets recorded at fair value, are based on estimates and recorded as Level 3 investments.
Where estimates are used, these are based on a combination of independent third-party evidence and internally developed models, calibrated to market observable data where possible.
Whilst such valuations are sensitive to estimates, it is believed that changing one or more of the assumptions to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not change the fair value significantly.
The principal investments classified as Level 3 are: Structured bond type products held by our businesses in France and Italy amounting to 7.0 billion, for which there is no active market.
These bonds are valued either using third party counterparty or broker quotes.
These bonds are validated against internal or third party models.
Most of these bonds have been classified as Level 3 because either, i the third party models included a significant unobservable liquidity adjustment or ii differences between the valuation provided by the counterparty and broker quotes and the validation model were sufficiently significant to result in a Level 3 classification.
At 31 December 2009, the counterparty and broker quotes used to value these products were less than the modelled valuations.
Notes issued by loan partnerships held by our UK Life business amounting to 1.0 billion, for which there is no active market.
These are valued using counterparty quotes, corroborated against the prices of selected similar securities.
In 2009 there was insufficient market observable transactions in the selected securities to provide a reliable proxy price to corroborate the counterparty price.
Private equity investment funds held by our UK Life business amounting to 0.8 billion.
In valuing our interest in these funds, we rely on investment valuation reports received from the fund manager, making adjustments for items such as subsequent draw downs and distributions between the date of the report and valuation date and the fund managers carried interest.
Certain direct private equity investments and private placements held by our business in the Netherlands and strategic interests in banking partners held by our Italian business amounting to 0.8 billion.
Valuations are based on third-party independent appraisals, or where internally modelled, transactions in similar entities, discounted cash flow techniques and valuation multiples, using public and internal management information.
Other Level 3 investments amount to 1.6 billion and relate to a diverse range of different types of securities held by a number of businesses throughout the Group.

Transfers between fair value hierarchy levels are deemed to have occurred at the assessment date.
Transfers into and out of Level 3 arose for the following reasons: Changes in the market observability of valuation inputs.
Changes in the market observability of inputs used to validate valuations.
Significant differences between third party prices used for valuations and validation prices either sourced from third parties or internal models.
The transfers into Level 3 principally relate to certain debt securities held by our businesses in the UK, Italy and France and private equity investment funds in the UK.
These investments were previously classified as Level 2.
The single largest transfer was of 6.8 billion structured bond type products, whose valuation methodology is described earlier in this section.
Of the 52 million net losses recognised in the income statement during the year, 2 million gain relates to net investment income and 54 million loss relating to impairments is included in other expenses.

Unrealised gains and losses on financial investments classified as at fair value through profit or loss recognised in the income statement in the year were a net loss of 18,919 million 2008: 25,105 million net loss.
Of this, 1,877 million net loss 2008: 108 million net gain related to financial investments designated as trading and 17,042 million net loss 2008: 25,213 million net loss related to investments designated as other than trading.
The movement in the unrealised gain loss position reported in the statement of financial position during the year, shown in the table above, includes foreign exchange movements on the translation of unrealised gains and losses on financial investments held by foreign subsidiaries, which are recognised in other comprehensive income, as well as transfers due to the realisation of gains and losses on disposal and the recognition of impairment losses.
Total impairments of financial investments recognised in the income statement in the year, disclosed in note 6, were 538 million 2008: 973 million.
This comprised impairments of financial investments classified as available-for-sale of 482 million 2008: 830 million disclosed in the table below, and impairments of financial investments classified as fair value through profit or loss of 56 million 2008: 143 million.

The majority of the Groups stock lending transactions occurs in the UK, where investments are lent to EEAregulated, locally-domiciled counterparties and governed by agreements written under English law.
The Group receives collateral in order to reduce the credit risk of these arrangements.
Collateral must be in a readily realisable form, such as listed securities, and is held in segregated accounts.
Transfer of title always occurs for collateral received, although no market risk or economic benefit is taken.
The level of collateral held is monitored regularly, with further collateral obtained where this is considered necessary to manage the Groups risk exposure.
In certain markets, the Group or the Groups appointed stock lending managers obtain legal ownership of the collateral received and can re-pledge it as collateral elsewhere or sell outright in the absence of default.
The carrying amounts of financial assets received and pledged in this manner at 31 December 2009 were 16,909 million and 703 million respectively 2008: 18,486 million and 322 million respectively, 2007: 23,779 million and 4 million respectively.
The value of collateral that was actually sold or re-pledged in the absence of default was nil 2008: nil.
In addition to the above, the Group has received and pledged cash collateral under stock lending arrangement that has been recognised in the statement of financial position with a corresponding obligation or receivable for its return.
These latter balances are shown separately in notes 49 and 25 respectively.
ii Stock repurchase arrangements Included within financial investments are 664 million 2008: 383 million, 2007: 358 million of debt securities and other fixed income securities which have been sold under stock repurchase arrangements.
The obligations arising under these arrangements are shown in note 49. iii Other arrangements In carrying on its bulk purchase annuity business, the Groups UK Life operation is required to place certain investments in trust on behalf of the policyholders.
Amounts become payable from the trust funds to the trustees if the Group were to be in breach of its payment obligations in respect of policyholder benefits.
At 31 December 2009, 703 million 2008: 474 million, 2007: nil of financial investments were restricted in this way.
Certain financial investments are also required to be deposited under local laws in various overseas countries as security for the holders of policies issued in those countries.
Other investments are pledged as security collateral for bank letters of credit.

The amortisation reduced by 214 million in 2009, mainly in the UK where improved asset values impacted on projected profits, particularly management charges on unit-linked funds, leading to lower amortisation.
Where amortisation of the DAC balance depends on projected profits, changes to economic conditions may lead to a movement in the DAC balance and a corresponding impact on profit.
It is estimated that the movement in DAC balance would reduce profit by 5 million if market yields on fixed income investments were to reduce by 1% and reduce profit by 20 million if equity and property market values were to fall by 10% from year end 2009 levels.
The shadow adjustments relate to deferred acquisition costs on business in the United States backed by investments classified as available for sale.
As explained in accounting policy K, unrealised gains and losses on the AFS investments and the shadow adjustments above are both recognised directly in other comprehensive income.

200 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 29 Equity compensation plans This note describes the various equity compensation plans we use, and shows how we value the options and awards of shares in the Company.
a Description of the plans The Group maintains a number of active stock option and award schemes.
These are as follows: i Savings-related options These are options granted under the Inland Revenue-approved Save As You Earn SAYE share option schemes in the UK and in Ireland.
Options are normally exercisable during the six month period following either the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the start of the relevant savings contract.
ii Executive share options These are options granted on various dates from 1999 to 2004, under the Aviva Executive Share Option Scheme or predecessor schemes.
Options granted between 1999 and 2000 were subject to the satisfaction of conditions relating to either the Companys return on equity shareholders funds ROE or its relative total shareholder return TSR against a chosen comparator group.
In respect of options granted from 2000 the performance condition has been a mixture of both ROE and TSR measures.
In all cases, performance is measured over a three-year performance period and the options are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of their grant.
iii Deferred bonus plan options These are options granted in 2000 under the CGU Deferred Bonus Plan.
Participants who deferred their annual cash bonus in exchange for an award of shares of equal value also received a matching award over an equal number of share options.
The exercise of these options is not subject to the attainment of performance conditions.
These options are exercisable up to the tenth anniversary of their grant.
iv Long-term incentive plan awards These awards have been made under the Aviva Long Term Incentive Plan 2005 and are described in Section b below and in the Directors remuneration report.
v Annual bonus plan awards These awards have been made under the Aviva Annual Bonus Plan 2005, and are described in Section b below and in the Directors remuneration report.
vi One Aviva, twice the value bonus plan awards These are conditional awards first granted under the Aviva Annual Bonus Plan 2005 in 2008, and are described in section b below and in the Directors remuneration report.

Shares which do not vest, lapse.
iii Shares to satisfy awards and options Prior to March 2003, it was the practice to satisfy awards and options granted under the executive incentive plans through shares purchased in the market and held by employee share trusts which were established for the purpose of satisfying awards under the various executive incentive plans and funded by the Company.
From March 2003 to July 2008, it was generally the Companys practice to satisfy the awards granted after March 2003 by the issue of new shares at the time of vesting.
However, since July 2008, it has been the Company s practice to satisfy all awards and options using shares purchased in the market and held by employee trusts except where local regulations make it necessary to issue new shares.
Further details are given in note 30.

i Share options The fair value of the options was estimated on the date of grant, based on the following weighted average assumptions: Weighted average assumption 2009 2008 Share price 480p 518p Exercise price 316p 410p Expected volatility 55% 32.6% Expected life 5.00 years 5.00 years Expected dividend yield 5.06% 5.5% Risk-free interest rate 2.47% 4.4% The expected volatility used was based on the historical volatility of the share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the options prior to its date of grant.
The risk-free interest rate was based on the yields available on UK government bonds as at the date of grant.
The bonds chosen were those with a similar remaining term to the expected life of the options.
12,559 options granted after 7 November 2002 were exercised during the year 2008: 1,112,282. ii Share awards The fair value of the awards was estimated on the date of grant, based on the following weighted average assumptions: Weighted average assumption 2009 2008 Share price 216.25p 608p Expected volatility 60% 25% Expected volatility of comparator companies share price 61% 26% Correlation between Aviva and competitors share price 55% 65% Expected life 2.75 years 2.78 years Expected dividend yield 8.23% 4.5% Risk-free interest rate 1.76% 3.9% For awards with market-based performance conditions.
The expected volatility used was based on the historical volatility of the share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the options prior to its date of grant.

These shares were purchased in the market and are carried at cost less amounts charged to the income statement in prior years.
The trustees have waived their rights to dividends on the shares held in the trusts.
31 Preference share capital This note gives details of Aviva plcs preference share capital.
The preference share capital of the Company at 31 December 2009 was: 2009 2008 m m Authorised 200,000,000 cumulative irredeemable preference shares of 1 each 200 200 1,000,000,000 Sterling preference shares of 1 each 1,000 1,000 1,200 1,200 2009 2008 m m 700,000,000 Euro preference shares of 1 each 700 700 2009 2008 m m Issued and paid up 3 100,000,000 8 8% cumulative irredeemable preference shares of 1 each 100 100 3 100,000,000 8 4% cumulative irredeemable preference shares of 1 each 100 100 200 200 The Sterling preference shares, if issued and allotted, would rank, as to payment of a dividend and capital, ahead of the Companys ordinary share capital but behind the cumulative irredeemable preference shares currently in issue.
The issued preference shares are non-voting except where their dividends are in arrears, on a winding up or where their rights are altered.
On a winding up, they carry a preferential right of return of capital ahead of the ordinary shares.
The Company does not have a contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets to the preference shareholders and therefore the directors may make dividend payments at their discretion.

They have no fixed redemption date but the Company may, at its sole option, redeem all but not part of the euro and sterling DCIs at their principal amounts on 28 November 2014 and 27 July 2020 respectively, at which dates the interest rates change to variable rates, or on any respective coupon payment date thereafter.
In addition, under certain circumstances defined in the terms and conditions of the issue, the Company may at its sole option: substitute at any time not less than all of the DCIs for, or vary the terms of the DCIs so that they become, Qualifying Tier 1 Securities or Qualifying Upper Tier 2 Securities: substitute not less than all of the DCIs for fully paid non-cumulative preference shares in the Company.
These preference shares could only be redeemed on 28 November 2014 in the case of the euro DCIs and on 27 July 2020 in the case of the sterling DCIs, or in each case on any dividend payment date thereafter.
The Company has the right to choose whether or not to pay any dividend on the new shares, and any such dividend payment will be non-cumulative.
The Company has the option to defer coupon payments on the DCIs on any relevant payment date.
Deferred coupons shall be satisfied only in the following circumstances, all of which occur at the sole option of the Company: Redemption: or Substitution by, or variation so they become, alternative Qualifying Tier 1 Securities or Qualifying Upper Tier 2 Securities: or Substitution by preference shares.
No interest will accrue on any deferred coupon.
Deferred coupons will be satisfied by the issue and sale of ordinary shares in the Company at their prevailing market value, to a sum as near as practicable to and at least equal to the relevant deferred coupons.
In the event of any coupon deferral, the Company will not declare or pay any dividend on its ordinary or preference share capital.
33 Merger reserve This note analyses the movements in the merger reserve during the year.
Movements in the year comprised: 2009 2008 m m Balance at 1 January 3,271 3,271 Movement in the year Balance at 31 December 3,271 3,271 Prior to 1 January 2004, certain significant business combinations were accounted for using the pooling of interests method or merger accounting, which treats the merged groups as if they had been combined throughout the current and comparative accounting periods.
Merger accounting principles for these combinations gave rise to a merger reserve in the consolidated statement of financial position, being the difference between the nominal value of new shares issued by the Parent Company for the acquisition of the shares of the subsidiary and the subsidiarys own share capital and share premium account.
The merger reserve is also used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under the Companies Act 1985 and, from 1 October 2009, the Companies Act 2006.
The balance on the reserve has arisen through the mergers of Commercial Union, General Accident and Norwich Union companies, forming Aviva plc in 2000, together with the acquisition of RAC plc in 2005.

The Groups regulated subsidiaries are required to hold sufficient capital to meet acceptable solvency levels based on applicable local regulations.
Their ability to transfer retained earnings to the UK parent companies is therefore restricted to the extent these earnings form part of local regulatory capital.

Any surplus or deficit emerging in NWPSF that is not distributed as bonus will be transferred from this sub-fund to the Reattributed Inherited Estate External Support Account RIEESA see below.
Old With-Profits sub-fund OWPSF, With-Profits sub-fund WPSF and Provident Mutual sub-fund PMSF of UKLAP, where the with-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits, the shareholders receiving the balance.
Non-profit funds of Aviva Annuity UK and UKLAP, where shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits.
Shareholder profits on unitised with-profit business written by WPSF and on stakeholder unitised with-profit business are derived from management fees and policy charges, and emerge in the non-profit funds.
The RIEESA of UKLAP, which is a non-profit fund where shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits, but these cannot be distributed until the lock-in criteria set by the Reattribution Scheme have been met.
RIEESA will be used to write non-profit business and also to provide capital support to NWPSF.
In France, where the majority of policyholders benefits are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
In addition, a substantial number of policies participate in investment returns, with the balance being attributable to shareholders.
In the Netherlands, the balance of profits, after providing appropriate returns for policyholders and after tax, accrues for the benefit of the shareholders.
The bases for determining returns for policyholders are complex, but are consistent with methods and criteria followed generally in the Netherlands.
In addition, a substantial number of policies provide benefits that are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
In the United States, there are two main types of business protection products and accumulation products.
Protection products include interest-sensitive whole life, term life, universal life and indexed life insurance policies.
The accumulation product segment includes traditional fixed and indexed deferred annuities for individuals and funding agreements for business customers.
In addition, there are two closed blocks of participating contracts arising from demutualisations of subsidiary companies.
All products are classified as insurance contracts except for the funding agreements and term certain immediate annuities, which are classified as non-participating investment contracts.

The provisions for overseas subsidiaries have generally been included on the basis of local regulatory requirements, mainly using the net premium method, modified where necessary to reflect the requirements of the Companies Act.
Material judgement is required in calculating the provisions and is exercised particularly through the choice of assumptions where discretion is permitted.
In turn, the assumptions used depend on the circumstances prevailing in each of the life operations.
Provisions are most sensitive to assumptions regarding discount rates and mortality morbidity rates.
Bonuses paid during the year are reflected in claims paid, whereas those allocated as part of the bonus declaration are included in the movements in the long-term business provision.
iii Methodology and assumptions There are two main methods of actuarial valuation of liabilities arising under long-term insurance contracts the net premium method and the gross premium method both of which involve the discounting of projected premiums and claims.
Under the net premium method, the premium taken into account in calculating the provision is determined actuarially, based on the valuation assumptions regarding discount rates, mortality and disability.
The difference between this premium and the actual premium payable provides a margin for expenses.
This method does not allow for voluntary early termination of the contract by the policyholder, and so no assumption is required for persistency.
Explicit provision is made for vested bonuses including those vesting following the most recent fund valuation, but no such provision is made for future regular or terminal bonuses.
However, this method makes implicit allowance for future regular or terminal bonuses already earned, by margins in the valuation discount rate used.
The gross premium method uses the amount of contractual premiums payable and includes explicit assumptions for interest and discount rates, mortality and morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions can vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience.
Explicit provision is made for vested bonuses and explicit allowance is also made for future regular bonuses, but not terminal bonuses.
a UK With-profit business The valuation of with-profit business uses the methodology developed for the Realistic Balance Sheet, adjusted to remove the shareholders share of future bonuses.
The key elements of the Realistic Balance Sheet methodology are the with-profit benefit reserve WPBR and the present value of the expected cost of any payments in excess of the WPBR referred to as the cost of future policy-related liabilities.
The realistic liability for any contract is equal to the sum of the WPBR and the cost of future policy-related liabilities.
The WPBR for an individual contract is generally calculated on a retrospective basis, and represents the accumulation of the premiums paid on the contract, allowing for investment return, taxation, expenses and any other charges levied on the contract.
For a small proportion of business, a prospective valuation approach is used, including allowance for anticipated future regular and final bonuses.
The items included in the cost of future policy-related liabilities include: Maturity Guarantees Guaranteed Annuity Options GMP underpin on Section 32 transfers Expected payments under Mortgage Endowment Promise In the Provident Mutual and With-Profits sub-funds in UKLAP, this is offset by the expected cost of charges to WPBR to be made in respect of guarantees.
The cost of future policy-related liabilities is determined using a market-consistent approach and, in the main, this is based on a stochastic model calibrated to market conditions at the end of the reporting period.
Non-market-related assumptions for example, persistency, mortality and expenses are based on experience, adjusted to take into account future trends.
The principal assumptions underlying the cost of future policy related liabilities are as follows: Future investment return A risk-free rate equal to the spot yield on UK Government securities, plus a margin of 0.1% is used.
The rates vary, according to the outstanding term of the policy, with a typical rate as at 31 December 2009 being 4.35% 2008: 3.58% for a policy with 10 years outstanding.
Volatility of investment return Volatility assumptions are set with reference to implied volatility data on traded market instruments, where available or on a best estimate basis where not.
These are term-dependent, with specimen values for 10 year terms as follows: Volatility 2009 2008 Equity returns 26.6% 34.6% Property returns 15.0% 15.0% Fixed interest yields 14.4% 15.9% The table above shows the volatility of fixed interest yields, set with reference to 20 year at-the-money swaption volatilities.
210 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 38 Insurance liabilities continued Future regular bonuses Annual bonus assumptions for 2010 have been set consistently with the year end 2009 declaration.
Future annual bonus rates reflect the principles and practices of the fund.
In particular, the level is set with regard to the projected margin for final bonus and the change from one year to the next is limited to a level consistent with past practice.
Mortality Mortality assumptions are set with regard to recent company experience and general industry trends.
The mortality tables used in the valuation are summarised below: Mortality table used 2008 and 2009 2007 Assurances, pure endowments and deferred annuities before vesting Nil or Axx00 adjusted Nil or AM92 AF92 Pensions business after vesting and pensions annuities in payment PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus allowance for future mortality allowance for future mortality improvement improvement Non-profit business Conventional non-profit contracts, including those written in the with-profit funds, are valued using gross premium methods which discount projected future cash flows.
The cash flows are calculated using the amount of contractual premiums payable, together with explicit assumptions for investment returns, inflation, discount rates, mortality, morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience.
For unit-linked and some unitised with-profit business, the provisions are valued by adding a prospective non-unit reserve to the bid value of units.
The prospective non-unit reserve is calculated by projecting the future non-unit cash flows on the assumption that future premiums cease, unless it is more onerous to assume that they continue.
Where appropriate, allowance for persistency is based on actual experience.
Valuation discount rate assumptions are set with regard to yields on the supporting assets and the general level of long-term interest rates as measured by gilt yields.
An explicit allowance for risk is included by restricting the yields for equities and properties with reference to a margin over long-term interest rates or by making an explicit deduction from the yields on corporate bonds, mortgages and deposits, based on historical default experience of each asset class.
A further margin for risk is then deducted for all asset classes.
The provisions held in respect of guaranteed annuity options are a prudent assessment of the additional liability incurred under the option on a basis and method consistent with that used to value basic policy liabilities, and includes a prudent assessment of the proportion of policyholders who will choose to exercise the option.
Valuation discount rates for business in the non-profit funds are as follows: Valuation discount rates 2009 2008 2007 Assurances Life conventional non-profit 3.0% to 3.8% 2.7% to 3.4% 3.1% to 3.9% Pensions conventional non-profit 3.8% to 4.0% 3.4% to 3.6% 3.9% to 4.1% Deferred annuities Non-profit in deferment 4.2% 3.8% 4.3% Non-profit in payment 3.8% to 4.0% 3.4% to 3.6% 3.9% to 4.1% Annuities in payment Conventional annuity 4.2% to 5.7% 3.8% to 5.4% 4.3% to 5.2% Non-unit reserves Life 3.3% 3.0% 3.4% Pensions 4.1% 3.7% 4.2% Financial statements IFRS 211 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 38 Insurance liabilities continued Mortality assumptions are set with regard to recent company experience and general industry trends.

The net premium method is used for prospective valuations, in accordance with local regulation, where the valuation assumptions depend on the date of issue of the contract.
The valuation discount rate also depends on the original duration of the contract and mortality rates are based on industry tables.

A liability adequacy test is performed in line with IFRS requirements.
Where liabilities are based on current market interest rates and assets are valued at market value, the margin in the liability adequacy test is determined by comparison of the liabilities with the present value of best estimate cash flows.
The yield curve is constructed from yields on collateralised AAA bonds.

The liability for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance is computed using the net level method, based on guaranteed interest and mortality rates as used in calculating cash surrender values.
The weighted average interest rate for all traditional life policy reserves in 2009 was 4.47% 2008: 4.47%.
212 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 38 Insurance liabilities continued Future policy benefit reserves for universal life insurance, deferred annuity products and funding agreements are computed under a retrospective deposit method and represent policy account balances before applicable surrender charges.
For the indexed products, the liability held is calculated based on the option budget method and is equal to the host contract and the calculated value of the derivative.
The value of the derivative is based on the present value of the difference between the projected fund value and the underlying fund guarantee.
The weighted average interest crediting rates for universal life products were 4.27% in 2009 2008: 4.77%.
The range of interest crediting rates for deferred annuity products, excluding sales inducement payouts, was 2.00% to 6.00% in 2009 2008: 2.50% to 6.00%.
An additional liability is established for universal life contracts with death or other insurance benefit features, which is determined using an equally-weighted range of scenarios with respect to investment returns, policyholder lapses, benefit election rates, premium payout patterns and mortality.
The additional liability represents the present value of future expected benefits based on current product assumptions.
The indexed life and annuity products guarantee the return of principal to the customer, and credit interest based on certain indices.
A portion of the premium from each customer is invested in fixed income securities and is intended to cover the minimum guaranteed value.
A further portion of the premium is used to purchase derivatives to hedge the growth in interest credited to the customer as a direct result of increases in the related indices.
Both the derivatives and the options embedded in the policy are valued at their fair value.
Deferred income reserves are established for fees charged for insurance benefit features which are assessed in a manner that is expected to result in higher profits in earlier years, followed by lower profits or losses in subsequent years.
The excess charges are deferred and amortised using the same assumptions and factors used to amortise deferred acquisition costs.
Shadow adjustments may be made to deferred acquisition costs, acquired value of in-force business, deferred income reserves and contract liabilities.
The shadow adjustments are recognised directly in other comprehensive income so that unrealised gains or losses on investments that are recognised directly in other comprehensive income affect the measurement of the liability, or related assets, in the same way as realised gains or losses.
e Other countries In all other countries, local generally-accepted interest rates and published standard mortality tables are used for different categories of business as appropriate.
The tables are based on relevant experience and show mortality rates, by age, for specific groupings of people.
iv Movements The following movements have occurred in the long-term business provisions during the year: 2009 2008 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 156,188 135,312 Provisions in respect of new business 11,105 13,414 Expected change in existing business provisions 7,625 6,423 Variance between actual and expected experience 2,154 9,401 Effect of adjusting to PS06 14 realistic basis 40 Impact of other operating assumption changes 121 812 Impact of economic assumption changes 404 604 Other movements 1,112 527 Change in liability recognised as an expense 6,221 4,393 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 67 1,872 Foreign exchange rate movements 8,284 23,397 Carrying amount at 31 December 154,058 156,188 The variance between actual and expected experience of 2.2 billion was primarily driven by favourable movements in investment markets in 2009, which had a direct or indirect im pact on liability values.
Equity markets recovered and the values of corporate bonds and commercial mortgages were increased by the narrowing of credit spreads.
For many types of long-term business, including unit-linked and participating funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
Minor variances arise from differences between actual and expected experience for persistency, mortality and other demographic factors.
The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of insurance liabilities.
The 2.2 billion variance between actual and expected experience is not a change in assumptions.
For participating business, a movement in liabilities is generally offset by a corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus and does not impact on profit.
Where assumption changes do impact on profit, these are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 42, together with the impact of movements in related non-financial assets.
c General insurance and health liabilities i Provisions for outstanding claims Delays occur in the notification and settlement of claims and a substantial measure of experience and judgement is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost of which cannot be known with certainty at the statement of financial position date.
The reserves for general insurance and health business are based on information currently available.
However, it is inherent in the nature of the business written that the ultimate liabilities may vary as a result of subsequent developments.
Financial statements IFRS 213 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 38 Insurance liabilities continued Provisions for outstanding claims are established to cover the outstanding expected ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses LAE in respect of all claims that have already occurred.
The provisions established cover reported claims and associated LAE, as well as claims incurred but not yet reported and associated LAE.
We only establish loss reserves for losses that have already occu rred.
We therefore do not establish catastrophe equalisation reserves that defer a share of income in respect of certain lines of business from years in which a catastrophe does not occur to future periods in which catastrophes may occur.
When calculating reserves, we take into account estimated future recoveries from salvage and subrogation, and a separate asset is recorded for expected future recoveries from reinsurers after considering their collectability.
The table below shows the split of total general insurance and health outstanding claim provisions and IBNR provisions, gross of reinsurance, by major line of business.

The period of time which will elapse before the liabilities are settled has been estimated by modelling the settlement patterns of the underlying claims.
The discount rate that has been applied to latent claims reserves is based on the relevant swap curve in the relevant currency having regard to the expected settlement dates of the claims.
The range of discount rates used depends on the duration of the claims and is given in the table above.
The duration of the claims span over 35 years, with the average duration being between 8 and 15 years depending on the geographical region.
Any change in discount rates between the start and the end of the accounting period is reflected below operating profit as an economic assumption change.
During 2009, we have experienced an increase in the number of bodily injury claims settled by periodic payment orders PPOs or structured settlements, especially in the UK, which are reserved for on a discounted basis.
iii Assumptions Outstanding claims provisions are estimated based on known facts at the date of estimation.
Case estimates are generally set by skilled claims technicians, applying their experience and knowledge to the circumstances of individual claims.
Taking into account all available information and correspondence regarding the circumstances of the claim, such as medical reports, investigations and inspections.
Claims technicians set case estimates according to documented claims department policies and specialise in setting estimates for certain lines of business or types of claim.
Claims above certain limits are referred to senior claims handlers for authorisation.
214 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 38 Insurance liabilities continued No adjustments are made to the claims technicians case estimates included in booked claim provisions, except for rare occasions when the estimated ultimate cost of a large or unusual claim may be adjusted, subject to internal reserve committee approval, to allow for uncertainty regarding, for example, the outcome of a court case.
The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is then estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques, such as the Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods.
The main assumption underlying these techniques is that a companys past claims development experience can be used to project future claims development and hence ultimate claims costs.
As such, these methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers based on the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios.
Historical claims development is mainly analysed by accident period, although underwriting or notification period is also used where this is considered appropriate.
Claim development is separately analysed for each geographic area, as well as by each line of business.
Certain lines of business are also further analysed by claim type or type of coverage.
In addition, large claims are usually separately addressed, either by being reserved at the face value of loss adjuster estimates or separately projected in order to reflect their future development.
The assumptions used in most non-life actuarial projection techniques, including future rates of claims inflation or loss ratio assumptions, are implicit in the historical claims development data on which the projections are based.
Additional qualitative judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in the future, for example, to reflect one-off occurrences, changes in external or market factors such as public attitudes to claiming, economic conditions, levels of claims inflation, judicial decisions and legislation, as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy conditions and claims handling procedures in order to arrive at a point estimate for the ultimate cost of claims that represents the likely outcome, from a range of possible outcomes, taking account of all the uncertainties involved.
The range of possible outcomes does not, however, result in the quantification of a reserve range.
However, the following explicit assumptions are made which could materially impact the level of booked net reserves: UK mesothelioma claims The level of uncertainty associated with latent claims is considerable due to the relatively small number of claims and the long-tail nature of the liabilities.
UK mesothelioma claims account for a large proportion of the Groups latent claims.
The key assumptions underlying the estimation of these claims include claim numbers, the base average cost per claim, future inflation in the average cost of claims, legal fees and the life expectancy of potential sufferers.
The best estimate of the liabilities reflects the latest available market information and studies.
Many different scenarios can be derived by flexing these key assumptions and applying different combinations of the different assumptions.
An upper and lower scenario can be derived by making reasonably likely changes to these assumptions, resulting in an estimate 195 million greater than the best estimate, or 155 million lower than the best estimate.
These scenarios do not, however, constitute an upper or lower bound on these liabilities.
Interest rates used to discount latent claim liabilities The discount rates used in determining our latent claim liabilities are based on the relevant swap curve in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement of latent claims.
The range of discount rates used is shown in section ii above and depends on the duration of the claim and the reporting date.
At 31 December 2009, it is estimated that a 1% fall in the discount rates used would increase net claim reserves by approximately 60 million, excluding the offsetting effect on asset values as assets are not hypothecated across classes of business.
The impact of a 1% fall in interest rates across all assets and liabilities of our general insurance and health businesses is shown in note 56 i. Allowance for risk and uncertainty The uncertainties involved in estimating loss reserves are allowed for in the reserving process and by the estimation of explicit reserve uncertainty distributions.
The reserve estimation basis for non-life claims adopted by the Group at 31 December 2009 requires all non-life businesses to calculate booked claim provisions as the best estimate of the cost of future claim payments, plus an explicit allowance for risk and uncertainty.
The allowance for risk and uncertainty is calculated by each business unit in accordance with the requirements of the Group non-life reserving policy, taking into account the risks and uncertainties specific to each line of business and type of claim in that territory.
The requirements of the Group non-life reserving policy also seek to ensure that the allowance for risk and uncertainty is set consistently across both business units and reporting periods.
Changes to claims development patterns can materially impact the results of actuarial projection techniques.
However, allowance for the inherent uncertainty in the assumptions underlying reserving projections is automatically allowed for in the explicit allowance for risk and uncertainty included when setting booked reserves.

Exceptional strengthening of claim provisions In 2009 an exceptional charge of 60 million was incurred for the strengthening of reserves in respect of several specific discontinued commercial liability risks written in Canada a significant number of years ago, which is included in change in insurance liabilities.
In 2008 the Institute of Actuaries Asbestos Working Party report contributed to our view that experience variances, which we had previously perceived as normal short-term volatility, reflected a real worsening of expected ultimate claims experience.
The market trend in mesothelioma claims was fully reflected as a significant one-off strengthening of gross latent claims reserves in 2008 of 356 million, with a corresponding increase of 52 million in reinsurance recoverable.
The net increase of 304 million comprised 668 million on an undiscounted basis and discounting of 364 million.
d Loss development tables i Description of tables The tables that follow present the development of claim payments and the estimated ultimate cost of claims for the accident years 2001 to 2009.
The upper half of the tables shows the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to each accident year.
For example, with respect to the accident year 2002, by the end of 2009 5,767 million had actually been paid in settlement of claims.
In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the original estimated ultimate cost of claims of 6,250 million was re-estimated to be 6,044 million at 31 December 2009.
The original estimates will be increased or decreased, as more information becomes known about the individual claims and overall claim frequency and severity.
In 2005, the year of adoption of IFRS, only five years were required to be disclosed.
This is being increased in each succeeding additional year, until 10 years of information is included.
The Group aims to maintain strong reserves in respect of its general insurance and health business in order to protect against adverse future claims experience and development.
As claims develop and the ultimate cost of claims become more certain, the absence of adverse claims experience will result in a release of reserves from earlier accident years, as shown in the loss development tables and movements table c iv above.
However, in order to maintain overall reserve adequacy, the Group establishes strong reserves in respect of the current accident year 2009 where the development of claims is less mature and there is much greater uncertainty attaching to the ultimate cost of claims.
Releases from prior accident year reserves are also due to an improvement in the estimated cost of claims.
Key elements of the release from prior accident year general insurance and health net provisions during 2008 were: 285 million from the UK, mainly due to an improved trend in bodily injury experience on both personal and commercial motor, favourable experience on commercial liability and a reduction in public liability average claim costs.
312 million from Europe, mainly due to lower than expected IBNR and costs of settling motor and commercial liability claims.
111 million from Canada, mainly due to favourable motor bodily injury experience.
89 million from prior year health insurance provisions.
Key elements of the release from prior accident year general insurance and health net provisions during 2009 were: 230 million from the UK, including group reinsurance business, mainly due to an improved view of group reinsurance liabilities, and favourable development on personal and commercial motor claims, and commercial property and commercial liability large claims.
237 million from Europe mainly due to favourable development of personal motor and commercial property, especially in respect of large claims.
79 million from Canada mainly due to favourable experience on motor and personal property.
The impact of using varying exchange rates is shown at the bottom of each table.
Disposals are dealt with by treating all outstanding and IBNR claims of the disposed entity as paid at the date of disposal.
The loss development tables above include information on asbestos and environmental pollution claims provisions from business written before 2001.
The undiscounted claim provisions, net of reinsurance, in respect of this business at 31 December 2009 were 968 million 2008: 1,019 million, 2007 323 million.
The movement in the year reflects exceptional strengthening of provisions by 60 million in respect of several specific discontinued commercial liability risks written in Canada a significant number of years ago 2008: 668 million due to the increased market trend in mesothelioma claim notifications, other releases of 62 million 2008: 16 million strengthening, foreign exchange rate movements and timing differences between claim payments and reinsurance recoveries.

a Carrying amount The liability for investment contracts at 31 December comprised: 2009 2008 2007 m m m Long-term business Participating contracts 66,559 65,278 53,609 41,289 39,509 43,608 Non-participating contracts at fair value 2,167 2,772 1,027 Non-participating contracts at amortised cost 43,456 42,281 44,635 Total 110,015 107,559 98,244 b Long-term business investment liabilities Investment contracts are those that do not transfer significant insurance risk from the contract holder to the issuer, and are therefore treated as financial instruments under IFRS.
Many investment contracts contain a discretionary participation feature in which the contract holder has a contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits.
These are referred to as participating contracts and are measured according to the methodology and Group practice for long-term business liabilities as described in note 38.
They are not measured at fair value as there is currently no agreed definition of fair valuation for discretionary participation features under IFRS.
In the absence of such a definition, it is not possible to provide a range of estimates within which a fair value is likely to fall.
The IASB has deferred consideration of participating contracts to Phase II of its insurance contracts project.
For participating business, the discretionary participation feature is recognised separately from the guaranteed element and is classified as a liability, referred to as unallocated distributable surplus.
Guarantees on long-term investment products are discussed in note 40.
Investment contracts that do not contain a discretionary participation feature are referred to as non-participating contracts and the liability is measured at either fair value or amortised cost.
Of the non-participating investment contracts measured at fair value, 39,686 million are unit-linked in structure and the fair value liability is equal to the unit reserve plus additional non-unit reserves if required on a fair value basis.
These contracts are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, as the unit reserve is calculated as the publicly quoted unit price multiplied by the number units in issue, and any non-unit reserve is insignificant.
Of the remaining non-participating contracts measured at fair value at 31 December 2009, 238 million are classified as Level 1, 1,203 million are classified as Level 2 and 162 million are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
Level 3 investment contracts had a fair value of 178 million at 31 December 2008, with the movement in the year represented by foreign exchange movements of 19 million offset by new policy issuances of 3 million.
We believe that changing one or more of the assumptions that support the Level 3 valuation to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not change the fair value significantly.
In respect of investment contracts carried at fair value there were no transfers between different levels of the fair value hierarchy during 2009.
For unit-linked business, a deferred acquisition cost asset and deferred income reserve liability are recognised in respect of transaction costs and front-end fees respectively, that relate to the provision of investment management services, and which are amortised on a systematic basis over the contract term.
The amount of the related deferred acquisition cost asset is shown in note 26 and the deferred income liability is shown in note 50.
In the United States, funding agreements consist of one to ten year fixed rate contracts.
These contracts may not be cancelled by the holders unless there is a default under the agreement, but may, subject to a call premium, be terminated by Aviva at any time.
Aviva issued no new funding agreements in 2009.
The weighted average interest rates for fixed-rate and floating-rate funding agreements as at 31 December 2009 were 4.79% and 0.37% respectively.
Funding agreements issued before 2008 are measured at fair value equal to the present value of contractual cash flows, and for business issued since 2008 are measured at amortised cost.
Most funding agreements are fully collateralised and therefore their fair values are not adjusted for own credit risk.
Funding agreements carried at fair value total 1,093 million and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
There is a small volume of annuity certain business for which the liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The fair value of contract liabilities measured at amortised cost is not materially different from the amortised cost liability.

The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of participating investment contract liabilities.
The 2.5 billion variance between actual and expected experience is not a change in assumptions.

Equity markets recovered and the value of corporate bonds and commercial mortgages were increased by the narrowing of credit spreads.
For unit-linked investment contracts, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of non participating investment contract liabilities.
The impact of assumption changes on profit are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 42, which combines participating and non-participating investment contracts together with the impact of movements in related non-financial assets.
220 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 40 Financial guarantees and options This note details the financial guarantees and options we have given for some of our insurance and investment products.
As a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees and options, including investment return guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and fund management products.
Further information on assumptions is given in notes 38 and 39. a UK Life with-profit business In the UK, life insurers are required to comply with the FSAs realistic reporting regime for their with-profit funds for the calculation of FSA liabilities.
Under the FSAs rules, provision for guarantees and options within realistic liabilities must be measured at fair value, using market-consistent stochastic models.
A stochastic approach includes measuring the time value of guarantees and options, which represents the additional cost arising from uncertainty surrounding future economic conditions.
The material guarantees and options to which this provision relates are: i Maturity value guarantees Substantially all of the conventional with-profit business and a significant proportion of unitised with-profit business have minimum maturity values reflecting the sums assured plus declared annual bonus.
In addition, the guarantee fund has offered maturity value guarantees on certain unit-linked products.
For some unitised with-profit life contracts the amount paid after the fifth policy anniversary is guaranteed to be at least as high as the premium paid increased in line with the rise in RPI CPI.
ii No market valuation reduction MVR guarantees For unitised business, there are a number of circumstances where a no MVR guarantee is applied, for example on certain policy anniversaries, guaranteeing that no market value reduction will be applied to reflect the difference between the accumulated value of units and the market value of the underlying assets.
iii Guaranteed annuity options The Groups UK with-profit funds have written individual and group pension contracts which contain guaranteed annuity rate options GAOs, where the policyholder has the option to take the benefits from a policy in the form of an annuity based on guaranteed conversion rates.
The Group also has exposure to GAOs and similar options on deferred annuities.
Realistic liabilities for GAOs in the UK with-profit funds were 760 million at 31 December 2009 2008: 1,093 million, 2007: 1,161 million.
With the exception of the New With-Profits Sub Fund NWPSF, movements in the realistic liabilities in the with-profit funds are offset by a corresponding movement in the unallocated divisible surplus, with no net impact on IFRS profit.
Realistic liabilities for GAOs in the NWPSF were 109 million at 31 December 2009 2008 and 2007: not applicable.
iv Guaranteed minimum pension The Groups UK with-profit funds also have certain policies that contain a guaranteed minimum level of pensions as part of the condition of the original transfer from state benefits to the policy.
In addition, the with-profit fund companies have made promises to certain policyholders in relation to their with-profit mortgage endowments.
Top-up payments will be made on these policies at maturity to meet the mortgage value up to a maximum of the 31 December 1999 illustrated shortfall.
For UKLAP WP policyholders, these payments are subject to certain conditions.
b UK Life non-profit business The Groups UK non-profit funds are evaluated by reference to statutory reserving rules, including changes introduced in 2006 under FSA Policy Statement 06 14 Prudential Changes for Insurers.
i Guaranteed annuity options Similar options to those written in the with-profit fund have been written in relation to non-profit products.
Provision for these guarantees does not materially differ from a provision based on a market-consistent stochastic model, and amounts to 28 million at 31 December 2009 2008: 27 million, 2007: 36 million.
ii Guaranteed unit price on certain products Certain unit-linked pension products linked to long-term life insurance funds provide policyholders with guaranteed benefits at retirement or death.
No additional provision is made for this guarantee as the investment management strategy for these funds is designed to ensure that the guarantee can be met from the fund, mitigating the impact of large falls in investment values and interest rates.
c Overseas life businesses In addition to guarantees written in the Groups UK life businesses, our overseas businesses have also written contracts containing guarantees and options.
Details of the significant guarantees and options provided by overseas life businesses are set out below.
i France Guaranteed surrender value and guaranteed minimum bonuses Aviva France has written a number of contracts with such guarantees.
The guaranteed surrender value is the accumulated value of the contract including accrued bonuses.
Bonuses are based on accounting income from amortised bond portfolios, where the duration of bond portfolios is set in relation to the expected duration of the policies, plus income and releases from realised gains on equity-type investments.
Policy reserves are equal to guaranteed surrender values.
Local statutory accounting envisages the establishment of a reserve, Provision pour Alas Financiers PAF, when accounting income is less than 125% of guaranteed minimum credited returns.
No PAF was established at the end of 2008.
Financial statements IFRS 221 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 40 Financial guarantees and options continued The most significant of these contracts is the AFER Eurofund which has total liabilities of 33 billion at 31 December 2009 2008: 33 billion, 2007: 24 billion.
The guaranteed bonus on this contract equals 75% of the average of the last two years declared bonus rates and was 3.67% for 2009 2008: 3.66%, 2007: 3.64% compared with an accounting income from the fund of 4.62% 2008: 4.85%, 2007: 4.92%.
Non-AFER contracts with guaranteed surrender values had liabilities of 12 billion at 31 December 2009 2008: 12 billion, 2007: 8 billion and all guaranteed annual bonus rates are between nil and 4.5%.
Guaranteed death and maturity benefits In France, the Group has also sold unit-linked policies where the death and or maturity benefit is guaranteed to be at least equal to the premiums paid.
The reserve held in the Groups consolidated statement of financial position at the end of 2009 for this guarantee is 97 million 2008: 113 million, 2007: 30 million.
The reserve is calculated on a prudent basis and is in excess of the economic liability.
At the end of 2009, total sums at risk for these contracts were 372 million 2008: 1,279 million, 2007: 63 million out of total unit-linked funds of 14 billion 2008: 14 billion, 2007: 15 billion.
The average age of policyholders was approxim ately 54.
It is estimated that this liability would increase by 71 million 2008: 59 million, 2007: 17 million if yields were to decrease by 1% per annum and by 25 million 2008: 22 million, 2007: 7 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2009 levels.
These figures do not reflect our ability to review the tariff for this option.
ii Delta Lloyd Guaranteed minimum return at maturity In the Netherlands, it is market practice to guarantee a minimum return at maturity on traditional savings and pension contracts.
Guarantees on older lines of business are 4% per annum while, for business written since 1 September 1999, the guarantee is 3% per annum.
On Group pensions business, it is often possible to recapture guarantee costs through adjustments to surrender values or to premium rates.
On transition to IFRS, Delta Lloyd changed the reserving basis for most traditional contracts to reflect current market interest rates, for consistency with the reporting of assets at market value.
The cost of meeting interest rate guarantees is allowed for directly in the liabilities.
Although most traditional contracts are valued at market interest rate, the split by level of guarantee shown below is according to the original underlying guarantee.
The total liabilities for traditional business at 31 December 2009 are 13 billion 2008: 14 billion, 2007: 10 billion analysed as follows: Liabilities 3% guarantee 2009 2008 2007 m m m Individual 2,206 2,214 1,387 Group pensions 780 689 485 Total 2,986 2,903 1,872 Liabilities 4% guarantee 2009 2008 2007 m m m Individual 3,690 4,684 3,671 Group pensions 6,329 6,804 3,993 Total 10,019 11,488 7,664 Delta Lloyd has certain unit-linked contracts which provide a guaranteed minimum return at maturity from 4% pa to 2% pa.
Provisions consist of unit values plus an additional reserve for the guarantee.
The additional provision for the guarantee was 246 million 2008: 226 million, 2007: 70 million.
An additional provision of 33 million 2008: 121 million, 2007: 19 million in respect of investment return guarantees on group segregated fund business is held.
It is estimated that the provision would increase by 180 million 2008: 255 million, 2007: 211 million if yields were to reduce by 1% pa and by 42 million 2008: 56 million, 2007: 21 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2009 levels.
iii Ireland Guaranteed annuity options Products with similar GAOs to those offered in the UK have been issued in Ireland.
The current net of reinsurance provision for such options is 214 million 2008: 180 million, 2007: 160 million.
This has been calculated on a deterministic basis, making conservative assumptions for the factors which influence the cost of the guarantee, principally annuitant mortality option take-up and long-term interest rates.
These GAOs are in the money at current interest rates but the exposure to interest rates under these contracts has been hedged through the use of reinsurance, using derivatives swaptions.
The swaptions effectively guarantee that an interest rate of 5% will be available at the vesting date of these benefits so there is reduced exposure to a further decrease in interest rates.
222 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 40 Financial guarantees and options continued No MVR guarantees Certain unitised with-profit policies containing no MVR guarantees, similar to those in the UK, have been sold in Ireland.
These guarantees are currently in-the-money by 10 million 2008: in-the-money by 16 million, 2007: out-of-the-money by 53 million.
This has been calculated on a deterministic basis as the excess of the current policy surrender value over the discounted value excluding terminal bonus of the guarantees.
The value of these guarantees is usually sensitive to the performance of investments held in the with-profit fund.
Amounts payable under these guarantees are determined by the bonuses declared on these policies.
It is estimated that the guarantees would be in-the-money by 10 million 2008: in-the-money by 16 million, 2007: out-of-the-money by 46 million if yields were to increase by 1% per annum and by 10 million 2008: in-the-money by 16 million, 2007: out-of-the-money by 29 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2009 levels.
There is no sensitivity to either interest rates or equity markets since there is no longer any exposure to equity in these funds and a matching strategy has been implemented for bonds.
Return of premium guarantee Until 2005, Hibernian Life wrote two tranches of linked bonds with a return of premium guarantee, or a price floor guarantee, after five or six years.
The provision for these over and above unit and sterling reserves, at the end of 2009 is 11 million 2008: 18 million, 2007: 0.1 million.
It is estimated that the provision would increase by 4 million 2008: 4 million, 2007: 1 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from the year end 2009 levels.
However, the provision increase would be broadly off-set by an increase in the value of the hedging assets that were set up on sale of these policies.
We would not expect any significant impact on this provision as a result of interest rate movements.
It is estimated that the provision would increase by 2 million if property values were to decline by 10% from year end 2009 levels.
This would be offset by an increase in the value of the hedging assets by 0.4 million, the difference reflecting the fact that only the second tranche was hedged for property exposure.
iv Spain and Italy Guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values The Group has also written contracts containing guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values in both Spain and Italy.
Traditional profit-sharing products receive an appropriate share of the investment return, assessed on a book value basis, subject to a guaranteed minimum annual return of up to 6% in Spain and 4% in Italy on existing business, while on new business the maximum guaranteed rate is lower.
Liabilities are generally taken as the face value of the contract plus, if required, an explicit provision for guarantees calculated in accordance with local regulations.
At 31 December 2009, total liabilities for the Spanish business were 3 billion 2008: 5 billion, 2007: 4 billion with a further reserve of 11 million 2008: 19 million, 2007: 16 million for guarantees.
Total liabilities for the Italian business were 6 billion 2008: 5 billion, 2007: 4 billion, with a further provision of 52 million 2008: 55 million, 2007: 48 million for guarantees.
Liabilities are most sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates.
It is estimated that provisions for guarantees would need to increase by 46 million 2008: 59 million, 2007: 66 million in Spain and 16 million 2008: 5 million, 2007: 14 million in Italy if interest rates fell by 1% from end 2009 values.
Under this sensitivity test, the guarantee provision in Spain is calculated conservatively, assuming a long-term market interest rate of 1.6% and no lapses or premium discontinuances.
v United States Indexed and total return strategy products In the United States, the Group writes indexed life and deferred annuity products.
These products guarantee the return of principal to the policyholder and credit interest based on certain indices, primarily the Standard & Poors 500 Composite Stock Price Index.
A portion of each premium is used to purchase derivatives to hedge the growth in interest credited to the policyholder.
The derivatives held by the Group and the options embedded in the policy are both carried at fair value.
The US Treasury swap curve plus a risk adjustment of 1.87% 2008: 5.30%, 2007: 1.05% for indexed life and 1.65% 2008: 5.30%, 2007: 1.05% for indexed deferred annuities is used as the discount rate to calculate the fair value of the embedded options.
The risk adjustment calculation is based on market spreads on senior long-term unsecured Aviva plc debt with a reduction to reflect policyholder priority over other creditors in case of default.
The amount of change in the fair value of these embedded options resulting from the risk adjustment in 2009 is an increase of 313 million 2008: 514 million decrease, and is principally attributable to market factors rather than instrument specific credit risk.
There were no significant gains or losses attributable to the risk adjustment or instrument specific credit risk.
At 31 December 2009, the total liabilities for indexed products were 17 billion 2008: 15 billion, 2007: 8 billion, including liabilities for the embedded option of 1.7 billion 2008: 1.9 billion, 2007: 1.2 billion.
If interest rates were to increase by 1%, the provision for embedded options would decrease by 59 million 2008: 138 million, 2007: 89 million and, if interest rates were to decrease by 1%, the provision would increase by 86 million 2008: 155 million, 2007: 86 million.
The Group has certain products that credit interest based on a total return strategy, whereby policyholders are allowed to allocate their premium payments to different asset classes within the general account.
The Group guarantees a minimum return of premium plus approximately 3% interest over the term of the contracts.
The linked general account assets are fixed maturity securities, and both the securities and the contract liabilities are carried at fair value.
At 31 December 2009, the liabilities for total return strategy products were 1.2 billion 2008: 1.5 billion, 2007: 1.2 billion.
The Group offers an optional lifetime guaranteed income benefit focused on the retirement income segment of the deferred annuity marketplace to help customers manage income during both the accumulation stage and the distribution stage of their financial life.
At 31 December 2009, a total of 4.9 billion 2008: 3.2 billion, 2007: 0.7 billion in indexed deferred annuities have elected this benefit taking steps to guarantee retirement income.
Financial statements IFRS 223 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 40 Financial guarantees and options continued d Sensitivity In providing these guarantees and options, the Groups capital position is sensitive to fluctuations in financial variables including foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, real estate prices and equity prices.
Interest rate guaranteed returns, such as those available on guaranteed annuity options GAOs, are sensitive to interest rates falling below the guaranteed level.
Other guarantees, such as maturity value guarantees and guarantees in relation to minimum rates of return, are sensitive to fluctuations in the investment return below the level assumed when the guarantee was made.
41 Reinsurance assets This note details the reinsurance recoverables on our insurance and investment contract liabilities.
a Carrying amounts The reinsurance assets at 31 December comprised: 2009 2008 2007 m m m Long-term business Insurance contracts 4,299 4,466 4,298 Participating investment contracts 52 22 Non-participating investment contracts 1,258 1,047 1,461 Outstanding claims provisions 40 145 94 5,597 5,710 5,875 General insurance and health Outstanding claims provisions 1,194 1,737 1,634 Provisions for claims incurred but not reported 449 29 29 1,643 1,766 1,663 Provision for unearned premiums 332 418 511 Other technical provisions 5 1,975 2,184 2,179 Total 7,572 7,894 8,054 Of the above total, 4,493 million 2008: 6,097 million, 2007: 4,796 million is expected to be recovered more than one year after the statement of financial position date.
The increase in the reinsurers' share of provisions for claims incurred but not reported during 2009 is due to a revised allocation between outstanding claims and IBNR of reinsurance assets in respect of certain discontinued run-off business.
b Assumptions The assumptions, including discount rates, used for reinsurance contracts follow those used for insurance contracts.
Reinsurance assets are valued net of an allowance for their recoverability.
c Movements The following movements have occurred in the reinsurance asset during the year: i In respect of long-term business provisions 2009 2008 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 5,565 5,781 Asset in respect of new business 412 235 Expected change in existing business asset 57 243 Variance between actual and expected experience 35 1,141 Impact of other operating assumption changes 189 761 Impact of economic assumption changes 250 306 Other movements 486 231 Change in asset 367 1,349 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 41 140 Foreign exchange rate movements 334 993 Carrying amount at 31 December 5,557 5,565 The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of reinsurance assets.
The reduction in the reinsurance asset from assumption changes mainly relates to Ireland, with a corresponding reduction made to gross insurance contract liabilities.
For participating businesses, a movement in reinsurance assets is generally offset by a corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus and does not impact on profit.
Where assumption changes do impact profit, these are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 42, together with the impact of movements in related liabilities and other non-financial assets.

This note analyses the effect of the changes.
This disclosure only allows for the impact on liabilities and related assets, such as reinsurance, deferred acquisition costs and AVIF, and does not allow for offsetting movements in the value of backing financial assets.
Effect on Effect on profit profit 2009 2008 m m Assumptions Long-term insurance business Interest rates 363 521 Expenses 69 24 Persistency rates 2 Mortality for assurance contracts 11 44 Mortality for annuity contracts 6 26 Tax and other assumptions 49 93 Investment contracts Interest rates 20 75 Expenses 40 27 Persistency rates 2 Tax and other assumptions 89 36 General insurance and health business Change in loss ratio assumptions 2 1 Change in discount rate assumptions 57 94 Change in expense ratio and other assumptions 21 Total 321 491 The impact of interest rates for long-term business relates primarily to the US, driven by the reduction in credit spreads on corporate bonds: this had the effect of increasing liabilities for indexed business and hence a negative impact on profit.
The overall impact on profit also depends on movements in the value of assets backing the liabilities, which is not included in this disclosure.
Other assumption changes include the effect of business migration and expense inflation adjustments in the UK, and reserve releases in Asia.
Financial statements IFRS 225 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 43 Unallocated divisible surplus An unallocated divisible surplus UDS is established where the nature of policy benefits is such that the division between shareholder reserves and policyholder liabilities is uncertain.
This note shows the movements in this surplus during the year.
The following movements have occurred in the year: 2009 2008 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 2,325 6,785 Change in participating contract assets 1,314 12,022 Change in participating contract liabilities 3,836 7,699 Effect of special bonus to with-profit policyholders see note 44a 69 89 Effect of reattribution of inherited estate see note 44b 881 Other movements 25 70 Change in liability recognised as an expense 1,547 4,482 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 4 Movement in respect of change in pension scheme deficit note 47c i 24 78 Foreign exchange rate movements 43 88 Other movements 21 12 Carrying amount at 31 December 3,866 2,325 In Italy, the UDS balances were 92 million negative in total at 31 December 2009 2008: France, Italy and Spain 924 million negative, 2007: Italy 116 million negative because of an accounting mismatch between participating assets carried at market value and participating liabilities measured using local practice.
In each case, the negative balance is considered to be recoverable from margins in the existing participating business liabilities.
44 Special bonus and reattribution of the inherited estate This note describes the special distribution and reattribution of the inherited estate in our UK Life business.
a Special bonus declared by UK Life business On 5 February 2008, the Groups UK long-term business operation, Norwich Union Life, announced a one-off, special bonus worth an estimated 2.3 billion, benefiting around 1.1 million with-profit policyholders in its CGNU Life and CULAC with-profit funds.
The bonus is being used to enhance policy values by around 10% in total, in three instalments, with the qualifying dates being 1 January 2008, 1 January 2009 and 1 January 2010.
In accordance with the way the funds are managed, the bonus distribution is being split on a 90 10 basis between policyholders and shareholders.
2,127 million was set aside for policyholders on 1 January 2008, and subject to market movements from that date, will be allocated over three years.
Similarly, shareholders will receive 236 million, subject to market movements, over the three year period.
As explained in accounting policies F and K, the Groups insurance and participating investment contract liabilities are measured in accordance with IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts, and FRS 27, Life Assurance.
The latter requires liabilities for with-profit funds falling within the scope of the UKs Financial Services Authoritys capital regime to be determined in accordance with this regime, adjusted to remove the shareholders share of future bonuses.
This required us to recognise planned discretionary bonuses within policyholder liabilities at 31 December 2007, even if there was no constructive obligation at the time.
As a result of the announcement made above, a transfer of 2,127 million was made in 2007 from the UDS in order to increase insurance liabilities by 1,728 million and participating investment contract liabilities by 399 million.
Of the original 236 million due to shareholders, 69 million has been transferred from the UDS in 2009 2008: 89 million.
b Impact of the reattribution of the inherited estate On 1 October 2009 a reorganisation of the with-profit funds of CGNU Life Assurance Limited CGNU and Commercial Union Life Assurance Company Limited CULAC was approved by the Board and became effective.
The reorganisation is achieved through a reattribution to shareholders of the inherited estates of these funds.
As part of the reorganisation the two funds were merged and transferred to Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited UKLAP.
Within UKLAP, two new with-profit sub-funds have been created.
Policies of non-electing policyholders have been transferred to the Old With-Profit Sub-Fund OWPSF.
The inherited estate has not been reattributed and remains in the OWPSF.
Where policyholders elected to accept the reattribution their policies have been transferred to the New With-Profit Sub-Fund NWPSF.
The inherited estate, totalling 1,105 million at 1 October 2009, has been reattributed to a separate long-term fund called the Non-Profit Sub-Fund 1 NPSF1, in which 100% of the surplus is attributable to shareholders.
On the effective date of 1 October 2009, the unallocated divisible surplus of NWPSF was released as it has been allocated to shareholders.
The release of this liability is included in the impact below.
The reorganisation scheme has imposed certain restrictions around release of the assets allocated to shareholders as a result of this transaction, to ensure that sufficient protection for with-profit policyholder benefits is maintained.
226 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 44 Special bonus and reattribution of the inherited estate continued Initial impact The initial impact of the reorganisation on the IFRS income statement and balance sheet at 1 October 2009 was: Impact Note m Change in unallocated divisible surplus Release of unallocated divisible surplus a 881 Other expenses Policyholder incentive payments b 471 Project costs c 208 Tax d 207 Loss after tax 5 Impact Note m Cash and cash equivalents b 450 Prepayments c 208 Total assets 658 Equity 5 Gross insurance liabilities b 21 Unallocated divisible surplus a 881 Tax liabilities d 207 Total equity and liabilities 658 Notes: a The unallocated divisible surplus transferred to the NWPSF, in proportion to the electing policies, has been allocated to shareholders and released.
The remaining UDS, transferred to the OWPSF in proportion to the non-electing policies, has not been released and remains unallocated.
b Policyholder incentive payments total 471 million.
Payments totalling 450 million were paid in cash and the remaining payments of 21 million were added to the value of certain policies in the form of additional benefits.
c During the development stage of the scheme eligible costs were capitalised as a prepayment.
As the benefit of the scheme has now been realised, these costs have been charged to the Income Statement.
d A deferred tax liability has been recognised in accordance with IAS 12 on the temporary difference between the carrying value of the reattributed estate for tax and IFRS purposes.
The initial impact of the reorganisation on profit before tax was 202 million, of which a loss of 5 million is recognised in operating profit, reflecting the value derived from the reorganisation.
The remaining 207 million is recognised outside operating profit, off-setting the shareholder tax attributable to the transaction.
Ongoing impact The reattribution has an ongoing impact arising from profits generated in the NWPSF that are attributable to shareholders.
Included within profit before tax for the year of 2,022 million is 51 million that has been recognised as profit as a result of the reattribution of the inherited estate which comprises 56 million relating to the ongoing impact offset by a 5 million charge from the initial impact of the reattribution.
Previously this profit would have been transferred to the unallocated distributable surplus.

a Current tax Current tax assets recoverable and liabilities payable in more than one year are 254 million and 49 million 2008: 230 million and 362 million.
The taxation of foreign profits and worldwide debt cap rules were enacted in the Finance Act 2009.
Under the foreign profits rules, a dividend exemption was introduced which largely exempts dividends received on or after 1 July 2009 from UK corporation tax.
The Group has applied this legislation in arriving at its UK tax results for 2009.
The worldwide debt cap rules apply from 1 January 2010 and are not expected to apply to the Group due to an exemption for qualifying financial services groups.

As a result of Aviva's US sub-group filing a single consolidated tax return for the first time in 2009, deferred tax assets and liabilities in this jurisdiction are presented net for the year ended 31 December 2009.
This has reduced both assets and liabilities by 1 billion compared with the previous year end.

In countries where there is a history of tax losses, deferred tax assets are only recognised in excess of deferred tax liabilities if there is convincing evidence that future profits will be available.
Where this is the case the directors have relied on business plans supporting future profits.
The Group has unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences of 2,975 million 2008: 2,961 million to carry forward against future taxable income of the necessary category in the companies concerned.
Of these, trading losses of 127 million will expire within the next 15 years.
The remaining losses have no expiry date.
In addition, the Group has unrecognised capital losses of 462 million 2008: 556 million.
Of these, 345 million will expire within the next 15 years.
The remaining capital losses have no expiry date.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been established for temporary differences in respect of unremitted overseas retained earnings of 144 million 2008: 6,121 million associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures and associates because the Group can control the timing of the reversal of these differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences at 31 December 2009 are significantly reduced from those at 31 December 2008 following the UK tax law change which largely exempts dividends received on or after 1 July 2009 from UK tax.
The temporary differences at 31 December 2009 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries in respect of which a tax liability may still arise on remittance of those earnings to the UK, principally as a result of overseas withholding taxes on dividends.

Financial statements IFRS 229 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 47 Pension obligations This note describes the Groups pension arrangements for its employees and explains how our obligations to these schemes are calculated.
a Introduction The Group operates a large number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes around the world.
The only material defined benefit schemes are in the UK, the Netherlands, Canada and Ireland and, of these, the main UK scheme is by far the largest.
The assets of the main UK, Irish and Canadian schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
In the Netherlands, the main scheme is held in a separate foundation which invests in the life funds of the Group.
In all schemes, the appointment of trustees of the funds is determined by their trust documentation, and they are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
The long-term investment objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs of these schemes.
A full actuarial valuation of each of the defined benefit schemes is carried out at least every three years for the benefit of scheme trustees and members.
Actuarial reports have been submitted for each scheme within this period, using appropriate methods for the respective countries on local funding bases.
New entrants join the defined contribution section of the ASPS, as the defined benefit section is closed to new employees.
This scheme is operated by a trustee company, with 11 trustee directors, comprising representatives of the employers, staff, pensioners and an independent trustee referred to below as the trustees.
i Defined benefit section of the ASPS The Company works closely with the trustees who are required to consult it on the funding of the scheme and its investment strategy.
Following each actuarial valuation, the Company and the trustees agree the level of contributions needed and funding levels are then monitored on an annual basis.
At 31 March 2009, the date of the last actuarial valuation, this section of the scheme had an excess of obligations over available assets, on a funding basis, which uses more prudent assumptions than are required for reporting under IAS 19, of 3.0 billion.
At 31 December 2009, this figure is estimated to have fallen to 2.7 billion.
The Company and the trustees are in advanced stages of finalising a long-term funding plan over which it will aim to eliminate the funding deficit.
Under the current proposals, deficit funding payments in 2010 are expected to be 365 million.
The employing companies contributions to the defined benefit section of the ASPS throughout 2009 were 41% of employees pensionable salaries, together with the cost of redundancies during the year, and additional deficit funding payments totalling 52 million.
As this section of the scheme is closed to new entrants and the contribution rate is determined using the projected unit credit method, it is expected that the percentage cost of providing future service benefits will continue to increase as the membership ages, leading to higher pension costs, and the number of members falls, leading to a higher charge per member.
Pending finalisation of the funding plan above, the employers contribution rate for 2010 has been increased to 43% of pensionable salaries, with expected service funding contributions under the current proposals increasing to 130 million.
Active members of this section of the ASPS contributed between 5% and 7.5% of their pensionable salaries, increasing to between 6% and 10% from 1 April 2010.
230 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 47 Pension obligations continued In 2006, the Groups UK life business carried out an investigation into the allocation of costs in respect of funding the ASPS, to identify the deficit that arose in respect of accruals prior to the introduction of the current management services agreements MSAs and to propose a split between individual product companies based on an allocation of the deficit into preand post-MSA amounts.
The results of this review were agreed by the relevant company boards and accepted by the UK regulator.
Consequently, with effect from 1 January 2006, the Companys UK with-profit product companies are liable for a share, currently 12%, of the additional payments for deficit funding referred to above up to a total of 130 million.
This has resulted in movements between the unallocated divisible surplus UDS and retained earnings via the statement of comprehensive income of 24 million in 2009 2008: 78 million to reflect actuarial movements in the deficit during the year and therefore a change in the amount recoverable from the with-profit product companies.
ii Defined contribution money purchase section of the ASPS The trustees have responsibility for selecting a range of suitable funds in which the members can choose to invest and for monitoring the performance of the available investment funds.
Members are responsible for reviewing the level of contributions they pay and the choice of investment fund to ensure these are appropriate to their attitude to risk and their retirement plans.
The employers contribution rates for members of the defined contribution section up to 30 June 2009 were 8% of pensionable salaries, together with further contributions up to 4% where members contributed, and the cost of the death-in-service benefits.
With effect from 1 July 2009, members of this section have contributed at least 1% of their pensionable salaries and, depending on the percentage chosen, the Companys contribution has increased up to a maximum 14%.
These contribution rates are unchanged for 2010. d Charges to the income statement The total pension costs of the Groups defined benefit and defined contribution schemes were: 2009 2008 m m UK defined benefit schemes 84 115 Overseas defined benefit schemes 103 60 Total defined benefit schemes note 10b 187 175 UK defined contribution schemes 53 46 Overseas defined contribution schemes 20 19 Total defined contribution schemes note 10b 73 65 260 240 There were no significant contributions outstanding or prepaid as at either 31 December 2007, 2008 or 2009. e IAS 19 disclosures Disclosures under IAS 19 for the material defined benefit schemes in the UK, the Netherlands, Canada and Ireland are given below.
Where schemes provide both defined benefit and defined contribution pensions, the assets and liabilities shown exclude those relating to defined contribution pensions.
Total employer contributions for these schemes in 2010, including the ASPS deficit funding, are expected to be 565 million.
i Assumptions on scheme liabilities The projected unit credit method The inherent uncertainties affecting the measurement of scheme liabilities require these to be measured on an actuarial basis.
This involves discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit credit method.
This is an accrued benefits valuation method which calculates the past service liability to members and makes allowance for their projected future earnings.
It is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, which vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which the relevant businesses are situated, and changes in these assumptions can materially affect the measurement of the pension obligations.
Alternative measurement methods There are alternative methods of measuring liabilities, for example by calculating an accumulated benefit obligation the present value of benefits for service already rendered but with no allowance for future salary increases or on a solvency basis, using the cost of securing the benefits at a particular date with an insurance company or one of the growing market of alternative buy-out providers.
This could take the form of a buy-out, in which the entire liability will be settled in one payment with all obligations transferred to an insurance company or buy-out provider, or a buy-in, in which annuities or other insurance products are purchased to cover a part or all of the liability.
A valuation of the liabilities in either of these cases will almost always result in a higher estimate of the pension deficit than under an ongoing approach, as they assume that the sponsor immediately transfers the majority, if not all, of the risk to another provider who would be seeking to make a profit on the transaction.
However, there are only a limited number of organisations that would be able to offer these options for schemes of the size of those in our Group.
The full buy-out cost would only be known if quotes were obtained from such organisations but, to illustrate the cost of a buy-out valuation, an estimate for the main UK scheme is that the year end liabilities of 8.4 billion could be valued some 3.6 billion higher, at 12.0 billion.
Financial statements IFRS 231 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 47 Pension obligations continued There is a small buy-out market in Ireland, largely restricted to pensions currently in payment and it is not clear whether current capacity would enable an immediate buy-out of our Irish pension liabilities at present.
The Canadian defined benefit plans liabilities represent the likely limit on what the Canadian group annuity market could absorb at normal competitive group annuity prices if the entire plan were subject to a buy-out valuation.
There is in fact a reasonably high chance that only a portion of the plans liabilities could be absorbed in one tranche.
IAS 19 requires us to use the projected unit credit method to measure our pension scheme liabilities.
Neither of the alternative methods is considered appropriate in presenting fairly the Groups obligations to the members of its pension schemes on an ongoing basis, so they are not considered further.
Valuations and assumptions The valuations used for accounting under IAS 19 have been based on the most recent full actuarial valuations, updated to take account of that standards requirements in order to assess the liabilities of the material schemes at 31 December 2009.
Scheme assets are stated at their fair values at 31 December 2009.
Canada Ireland 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Inflation rate 2.5% 2.5% 2.5% 2.0% 2.0% 2.5% General salary increases 3.75% 3.75% 3.75% 3.5% 3.75% 4.25% Pension increases 1.25% 1.25% 1.25% 2.0% 2.0% 2.4% Deferred pension increases 2.0% 2.0% 2.4% Discount rate 5.5% 6.75% 5.25% 5.5% 5.9% 5.6% Basis of discount rate AA-rated corporate bonds AA-rated corporate bonds The discount rate and pension increase rate are the two assumptions that have the largest impact on the value of the liabilities, with the difference between them being known as the net discount rate.
For each country, the discount rate is based on current average yields of high quality debt instruments taking account of the maturities of the defined benefit obligations.
A 1% increase in this rate and therefore the net discount rate would reduce the liabilities by 1.8 billion and the service cost for the year by 31 million.
Mortality assumptions Mortality assumptions are significant in measuring the Groups obligations under its defined benefit schemes, particularly given the maturity of these obligations in the material schemes.
The assumptions used are summarised in the table below and have been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of these schemes.
232 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 47 Pension obligations continued The mortality tables, average life expectancy and pension duration used at 31 December 2009 for scheme members are as follows: Life expectancy pension Life expectancy pension duration at NRA of a male duration at NRA of a female Normal 20 years 20 years retirement Currently younger Currently younger Mortality table age NRA aged NRA than NRA aged NRA than NRA PA92U2010MC with a one year age rating deduction and 89.4 92.5 91.8 93.9 UK including an allowance for future improvements 60 29.4 32.5 31.8 33.9 82.5 84.0 86.1 86.8 Netherlands CRC8b, which includes allowance for future improvements up to 2050 65 17.5 19.0 21.1 21.8 84.4 84.4 86.8 86.8 Canada UP1994 projected to 2015, using Scale AA 65 19.4 19.4 21.8 21.8 86.5 89.5 89.3 92.3 Ireland 94% PNA00 with allowance for future improvements 61 25.5 28.5 28.3 31.3 The assumptions above are based on commonly-used mortality tables.
In the UK, the standard mortality tables have been adjusted to reflect recent research into mortality experience.
However, the extent of future improvements in longevity is subject to considerable uncertainty and judgement is required in setting this assumption.
In the UK schemes, which are by far the most material to the Group, the assumptions include an allowance for future mortality improvement, based on the actuarial professions medium cohort projection table and incorporating underpins to the rate of future improvement equal to 1.5% p. a. for males and 1.0% p. a. for females.
The effect of assuming all members were one year younger would increase the above schemes liabilities by 248 million and the service cost for the year by 5 million.
The discounted scheme liabilities have an average duration of 22 years in the UK schemes and between 12 and 18 years in the overseas schemes.
The undiscounted benefits payable from the main UK defined benefit scheme are expected to be as shown in the chart below: Undiscounted benefit payments m 1,200 1,000 800 600 400 200 0 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 2060 2070 2080 2090 2100 ii Assumptions on scheme assets The expected rates of return on the schemes assets are: UK Netherlands Canada Ireland 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 Equities 7.8% 6.3% 6.8% 6.0% 7.6% 4.5% 7.2% 6.0% Bonds 4.8% 5.2% 4.3% 3.8% 3.5% 4.3% 4.5% 4.1% Property 6.3% 4.8% 5.2% 5.7% n a n a 5.7% 4.5% Cash 0.9% 3.2% n a 3.8% n a n a 2.9% 3.0% The overall rates of return are based on the expected returns within each asset category and on current asset allocations.
The expected returns for equities and properties have been aligned with the rates used for the longer-term investment return assumptions, other than in the Netherlands, where they have been developed in conjunction with external advisers due to the characteristics of the scheme.
The figures for the total expected return on scheme assets in the following section are stated after deducting investment expenses.

The Dutch insurance policies are considered non-transferable under the terms of IAS 19 and so have been treated as other obligations to staff pension schemes within provisions see note 46.
The treatment of the relevant parts of the financial statements is as follows: Plan assets The treatment of these funds and policies in the consolidated statement of financial position is described above.
Expected rates of return Where the relevant insurance policies are in segregated funds with specific asset allocations, their expected rates of return are included in the appropriate line in the table in section ii above.
Pension expense To avoid double-counting of investment income on scheme assets and the assets backing the underlying policies, adjustments have been made to the former in the tables in section iv below.
iv Pension expense As noted above, plan assets in the UK and Dutch schemes include insurance policies with other Group companies.
To avoid double-counting of investment income on scheme assets and the assets backing the underlying policies, adjustments have been made to the former as shown in the tables below.
The total pension expense for these schemes comprises: Recognised in the income statement 2009 2008 m m Current service cost 131 162 Past service cost 25 1 Gains on curtailments 38 3 Gains on settlements 11 Total pension cost charged to net operating expenses 107 166 Expected return on scheme assets 466 706 Less: Income on insurance policy assets accounted for elsewhere see iii above 58 64 408 642 Interest charge on scheme liabilities 591 585 Charge credit to investment income 183 57 Total charge to income 290 109 Recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 2009 2008 m m Expected return on scheme assets 466 706 Actual positive negative return on these assets 1,009 1,245 Actuarial gains losses on scheme assets 543 1,951 Less: losses on insurance policy assets accounted for elsewhere see iii above 18 58 Actuarial gains losses on admissible assets 561 1,893 Experience gains arising on scheme liabilities 77 105 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the scheme liabilities 1,778 859 Actuarial losses recognised in other comprehensive income 1,140 929 The loss arising from changes in assumptions in 2009 reflects the impact of lower discount rates for liabilities across all schemes and higher pension and salary increase assumptions in the UK and Netherlands, together with the strengthening of mortality assumptions in Ireland.
The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses on the pension schemes recognised in other comprehensive income since 1 January 2004 the date of transition to IFRS is a loss of 2,230 million at 31 December 2009 2008: loss of 1,090 million.

To meet these objectives, each schemes assets are invested in a diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of equity and debt securities.
These reflect the current long-term asset allocation ranges chosen, having regard to the structure of liabilities within the schemes.
Main UK scheme Both the Group and the trustees regularly review the asset liability management of the main UK scheme.
It is fully understood that, whilst the current asset mix is designed to produce appropriate long-term returns, this introduces a material risk of volatility in the schemes surplus or deficit of assets compared with its liabilities.
The principal asset risks to which the scheme is exposed are: Equity market risk the effect of equity market falls on the value of plan assets.
Inflation risk the effect of inflation rising faster than expected on the value of the plan liabilities.
Interest rate risk falling interest rates leading to an increase in liabilities significantly exceeding the increase in the value of assets.
There is also an exposure to currency risk where assets are not denominated in the same currency as the liabilities.
The majority of this exposure has been removed by the use of hedging instruments.
In addition, the trustees have taken measures to partially mitigate inflation and interest rate risks, including entering into inflation and interest rate swaps to hedge approximately one third of the schemes exposure to these risks.
Other schemes The other schemes are considerably less material but their risks are managed in a similar way to those in the main UK scheme.

The reduction in future contractual undiscounted interest payments mainly reflects lower average interest payable at 31 December 2009 on floating rate securitised loan notes issued by our Dutch business, compared to 31 December 2008.
The securitised mortgage loan notes are at various fixed, floating and index-linked rates.
Further details about these notes are given in note 23.
All the above borrowings are stated at amortised cost, except for the loan notes issued in connection with the UK lifetime mortgage business 1,444 million 2008: 1,590 million, 2007: 1,674 million and 3,664 million 2008: 3,842 million, 2007: 3,337 million of the loan notes issued in connection with the Dutch domestic mortgage business, which are carried at fair value.
Fair values are modelled on risk-adjusted cash flows for defaults discounted at a risk-free rate plus a market-determined liquidity premium, and are therefore classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
These have been designated at fair value through profit and loss in order to present the relevant mortgages, borrowings and derivative financial instruments at fair value, since they are managed as a portfolio on a fair value basis.
This presentation provides more relevant information and eliminates any accounting mismatch.
d Description and features i Subordinated debt A description of each of the subordinated notes is set out in the table below: Callable at par at option In the event the Company does not call the notes, Notional amount Issue date Redemption date of the Company from the coupon will reset at each applicable reset date to 700 million 14 Nov 2001 14 Nov 2036 16 Nov 2026 5 year Benchmark Gilt 2.85% 800 million 14 Nov 2001 14 Nov 2021 14 Nov 2011 3 month Euribor 2.12% 650 million 29 Sep 2003 02 Oct 2023 02 Oct 2013 3 month Euribor 2.08% 500 million 29 Sep 2003 Undated 29 Sep 2015 3 month Euribor 2.35% 800 million 29 Sep 2003 Undated 29 Sep 2022 5 year Benchmark Gilt 2.40% US$300 million 19 Dec 2007 19 Jun 2017 19 Jun 2012 3 month US LIBOR 0.84% 400 million 20 May 2008 20 May 2058 20 May 2038 3 month LIBOR 3.26% 200 million 8 Aug 2008 20 May 2058 20 May 2038 3 month LIBOR 3.26% 500 million 22 May 2008 22 May 2038 22 May 2018 3 month Euribor 3.35% 200 million 31 Mar 2009 31 Mar 2019 31 Mar 2014 3 month LIBOR 8.10% 50 million 30 Apr 2009 30 Apr 2019 30 Apr 2014 3 month Euribor 8.25% The subordinated notes were issued by the Company.
They rank below its senior obligations and ahead of its preference shares and ordinary share capital.
The dated subordinated notes rank ahead of the undated subordinated notes.
The fair value of these notes at 31 December 2009 was 4,372 million 2008: 2,979 million, 2007: 3,006 million, calculated with reference to quoted prices.
242 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 48 Borrowings continued ii Debenture loans The 9.5% guaranteed bonds were issued by the Company at a discount of 1.1 million.
This discount and the issue expenses are being amortised over the full term of the bonds.
Although these bonds were issued in sterling, the loans have effectively been converted into euro liabilities through the use of financial instruments in a subsidiary.
The 2.5% perpetual subordinated loan notes were issued by Delta Lloyd to finance the acquisition of NUTS OHRA Beheer BV in 1999.
As part of the public offering of Delta Lloyd, their nominal value was increased to 497 million 2008: 490 million.
However, because they are considered to be perpetual, their carrying value is lower at 177 million 2008: 172 million, calculated in 1999 and based on the future cash flows in perpetuity discounted back at a market rate of interest.
The rate of interest paid on the notes has been gradually increased to a maximum of 2.76% in 2009.
Other loans totalling 13 million 2008: 14 million comprise borrowings in the United States.
All these borrowings are at fixed rates and their fair value at 31 December 2009 was 552 million 2008: 663 million, calculated with reference to quoted prices or discounted future cash flows as appropriate.
iii Commercial paper The commercial paper consists of 483 million in the Company 2008: 535 million, 2007: 918 million and nil in France 2008: 5 million, 2007: 4 million.
All of this is considered core structural funding.
All commercial paper is repayable within one year and is issued in a number of different currencies, primarily sterling, euros and US dollars.
Its fair value is considered to be the same as its carrying value.

The PLPs have raised external debt, secured on their respective property portfolios, and the lenders are only entitled to obtain payment of both interest and principal to the extent there are sufficient resources in the respective PLPs.
The lenders have no recourse whatsoever to the policyholder or shareholders funds of any companies in the Aviva Group.
Loans of 790 million 2008: 978 million, 2007: 485 million included in the table relate to those PLPs which have been consolidated as subsidiaries.
b Certain Irish policyholder investment funds and unit trusts, which have been fully consolidated in accordance with accounting policy D, have raised borrowings with external credit institutions.
The borrowings are secured on the funds, with the only recourse on default being the underlying investments in these funds and unit trusts.
The lenders have no recourse whatsoever to the shareholders funds of any companies in the Aviva Group.
These loans run for a period of five years, with interest rates fixed monthly and based on a fixed margin above the euro inter-bank rate.
The amount of these loans can be varied without any penalty being charged, subject to a maximum of 50% Loan to Value and a maximum facility of 40 million.
c The UK long-term business entered into a financial reassurance agreement with Swiss Re in 2008, under which up-front payments are received from Swiss Re in return for 90% of future surplus arising.
The loan will be repaid as profits emerge on the business.
d Other loans includes 500 million 10.44% subordinated notes due 2019 of which 400 million of the loan was issued by Delta Lloyd Levensverzekering and 100m by Delta Lloyd Schadeverzekering Financial statements IFRS 243 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 48 Borrowings continued v Securitised mortgage loan notes Loan notes have been issued by special purpose securitisation companies in the UK and the Netherlands.
Details of these securitisations are given in note 23.
For the Dutch securitised mortgage loan notes carried at amortised cost of 2,221 million 2008: 2,353 million, 2007: 2,283 million, their fair value is 2,170 million 2008: 2,224 million, 2007: 2,283 million, calculated based on the future cash flows discounted back at the market rate of interest.

a Uncertainty over claims provisions Note 38 gives details of the estimation techniques used by the Group to determine the general business outstanding claims provisions and of the methodology and assumptions used in determining the long-term business provisions.
These approaches are designed to allow for the appropriate cost of future policy-related liabilities, with a degree of prudence, to give a result within the normal range of outcomes.
To the extent that the ultimate cost falls outside this range, for example where experience is worse than that assumed, or future general business claims inflation differs from that expected, there is uncertainty in respect of these liabilities.
b Asbestos, pollution and social environmental hazards In the course of conducting insurance business, various companies within the Group receive general insurance liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened related litigation arising there from, including claims in respect of pollution and other environmental hazards.
Amongst these are claims in respect of asbestos production and handling in various jurisdictions, including Europe, Canada and Australia.
Given the significant delays that are experienced in the notification of these claims, the potential number of incidents which they cover and the uncertainties associated with establishing liability and the availability of reinsurance, the ultimate cost cannot be determined with certainty.
However, on the basis of current information having regard to the level of provisions made for general insurance claims, and the strengthening of latent claims that took place during 2008, the directors consider that any additional costs arising are not likely to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.
c Guarantees on long-term savings products As a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees and options, including interest rate guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and fund management products.
Note 40 gives details of these guarantees and options.
In providing these guarantees and options, the Groups capital position is sensitive to fluctuations in financial variables including foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, property values and equity prices.
The directors continue to believe that the existing provisions for such guarantees and options are sufficient.
d Pensions mis-selling The pensions review of past sales of personal pension policies which involved transfers, opt outs and non-joiners from occupational schemes, as required by the Financial Services Authority FSA, has largely been completed.
A provision of some 16 million at 31 December 2009 2008: 18 million, 2007: 23 million remains to meet the outstanding costs of the very few remaining cases, the anticipated cost of any guarantees provided, and potential levies payable to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
It continues to be the directors view that there will be no material effect either on the Groups ability to meet the expectations of policyholders or on shareholders.
e Endowment reviews In December 1999, the FSA announced the findings of its review of mortgage endowments and expressed concern as to whether, given decreases in expected future investment returns, such policies could be expected to cover full repayment of mortgages.
A key conclusion was that, on average, holders of mortgage endowments had enjoyed returns such that they had fared at least as well as they would have done without an endowment.
Nevertheless, following the FSA review, all of the Groups UK mortgage endowment policyholders received policy-specific letters advising them whether their investment was on track to cover their mortgage.
In May 2002, in accordance with FSA requirements, the Group commenced sending out the second phase of endowment policy update letters, which provide policyholders with information about the performance of their policies and advice as to whether these show a projected shortfall at maturity.
The Group will send these updates annually to all mortgage endowment holders, in accordance with FSA requirements.
The Group has made provisions totalling 25 million at 31 December 2009 2008: 38 million, 2007: 96 million to meet potential mis-selling costs and the associated expenses of investigating complaints.
It continues to be the directors view that there will be no material effect either on the Groups liability to meet the expectations of policyholders or on shareholders.
In August 2004, the Group confirmed its intention to introduce time barring on mortgage endowment complaints, under FSA rules.
The Group now includes details of its endowment policyholders time bar position within the annual re-projection mailings.
Customers will be given at least 12 months individual notice before a time bar becomes applicable double the six months notice required by the FSA.
246 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 51 Contingent liabilities and other risk factors continued f Regulatory compliance The Groups insurance and investment business is subject to local regulation in each of the countries in which it operates.
The FSA regulates the Groups UK business and in addition monitors the financial resources and organisation of the Group as a whole.
The FSA has broad powers including the authority to grant, vary the terms of, or cancel a regulated firms authorisation, to investigate marketing and sales practices and to require the maintenance of adequate financial resources.
The Groups regulators outside the UK typically have similar powers but in some cases they operate a system of prior product approval and hence place less emphasis than the FSA on regulating sales and marketing practices.
The directors believe each of the Groups regulated businesses dedicates appropriate resources to its compliance programme, endeavours to respond to regulatory enquiries in a constructive way, and takes corrective action when warranted.
However, all regulated financial services companies face the risk that their regulator could find that they have failed to comply with applicable regulations or have not undertaken corrective action as required.
The impact of any such finding whether in the UK or overseas could have a negative impact on the Groups reported results or on its relations with current and potential customers.
Regulatory action against a member of the Group could result in adverse publicity for, or negative perceptions regarding, the Group, or could have a material adverse effect on the business of the Group, its results of operations and or financial condition and divert managements attention from the day-to-day management of the business.
g Aviva USA litigation In November 2006, the Group completed the acquisition of the AmerUs Group, a US-based insurer.
In common with other companies operating in the sector, AmerUs is subject to litigation, including class-action litigation, arising out of its sale of equitybased index-linked annuity products.
The Group is aware of a multi-district class action filed against AmerUs in Pennsylvania but is not aware of any adverse development.
The directors continue to monitor the situation and consider that the litigation will not have a material effect on the Groups ability to meet shareholder expectations.
h Payment protection insurance PPI mis-selling In September 2009, the FSA launched an investigation into sales practices for payment protection insurance.
As at 3 March 2010, no ruling has been issued by the FSA and, as a result, it is not possible to determine whether, and if so to what extent, any liability exists.
The directors continue to monitor the situation.
i Structured settlements In Canada annuities have been purchased from licensed Canadian life insurers to provide for fixed and recurring payments to claimants.
As a result of these arrangements, the Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent that any of the life insurers fail to fulfil their obligations.
The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk for these arrangements is approximately 984 million as at 31 December 2009 2008: 1,029 million, 2007: 742 million based on estimated replacement cost for the underlying annuities.
The credit risk is managed by acquiring annuities from a diverse portfolio of life insurers with proven financial stability.
The risk is reduced to the extent of coverage provided by Assuris, the Canadian life insurance industry compensation plan.
As at 31 December 2009, no information has come to the Group's attention that would suggest any weakness or failure in the Canadian life insurers from which it has purchased annuities.
j Other In the course of conducting insurance and investment business, various Group companies receive liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened related litigation.
In the opinion of the directors, adequate provisions have been established for such claims and no material loss will arise in this respect.
The Company and several of its subsidiaries have guaranteed the overdrafts and borrowings of certain other Group companies.
At 31 December 2009, the total exposure of the Group and Company is nil 2008: nil, 2007: 7 million and 77 million 2008: 88 million, 2007: 113 million respectively and, in the opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise in respect of these guarantees and indemnities.
In addition, in line with standard business practice, various Group companies have been given guarantees, indemnities and warranties in connection with disposals in recent years of subsidiaries and associates to parties outside the Aviva Group.
In the opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise in respect of these guarantees, indemnities and warranties.
The Groups insurance subsidiaries pay contributions to levy schemes in several countries in which we operate.
Given the economic environment, there is a heightened risk that the levy contributions will need to be increased to protect policyholders if an insurance company falls into financial difficulties.
The directors continue to monitor the situation but are not aware of any need to increase provisions at the statement of financial position date.

54 Group capital structure Accounting basis and capital employed by segment The table below shows how our capital, on an MCEV basis, is deployed by segment and how that capital is funded.

The corporate net liabilities represent the element of the pension scheme deficit held centrally.
In addition to our external funding sources, we have certain internal borrowing arrangements in place which allow some of the assets that support technical liabilities to be invested in a pool of central assets for use across the group.
These internal debt balances allow for the capital allocated to business operations to exceed the externally sourced capital resources of the group.
Net internal debt represents the balance of the amounts due from corporate and holding entities, less the tangible net assets held by these entities.
Although intra-group in nature, they are included as part of the capital base for the purpose of capital management.
These arrangements arise in relation to the following: Certain subsidiaries, subject to continuing to satisfy stand alone capital and liquidity requirements, loan funds to corporate and holding entities.
These loans satisfy arms length criteria and all interest payments are made when due.
Aviva International Insurance AII Ltd acts as both a UK general insurer and as the primary holding company for our foreign subsidiaries.
Internal capital management mechanisms in place allocate a portion of the total capital of the company to the UK general insurance operations.
These mechanisms also allow for some of the assets backing technical liabilities to be made available for use across the group.
Balances in respect of these arrangements are also treated as internal debt for capital management purposes.
Total capital employed is financed by a combination of equity shareholders funds, preference capital, subordinated debt and borrowings including internal borrowings as described in footnote 2 above.
At 31 December 2009 we had 25.2 billion 2008: 25.1 billion of total capital employed in our trading operations, measured on an MCEV basis.
Over the period the benefit of operating profits and investment gains have been offset by foreign exchange losses and actuarial losses on staff pension schemes.
In April 2009 we issued a private placement of 245 million equivalent of Lower Tier 2 hybrid in a dual tranche transaction 200 million on 1 April 2009 and a further 50 million on 30 April 2009.
These transactions had a positive impact on group IGD solvency and economic capital measures.
Financial leverage, the ratio of external senior and subordinated debt to MCEV capital and reserves, was 31.8% 2008: 34.0%.
If centre assets were offset against this debt the financial leverage would be 19.0% 2008: 25.4%.
Fixed charge cover, which measures the extent to which external interest costs, including subordinated debt interest and preference dividends, are covered by MCEV operating profit was 8.5 times 2008: 9.2 times.

The analysis of movements in capital provides an explanation of the movement in available capital of the Group's life business for the year.
This analysis is intended to give an understanding of the underlying causes of changes in the available capital of the Group's life business, and provides a distinction between some of the key factors affecting the available capital.
As detailed in note 44 b, on 1 October 2009 the with-profit funds of CGNU Life Assurance Limited CGNU and Commercial Union Life Assurance Company Limited CULAC were reorganised.
This reorganisation was achieved through a reattribution to shareholders of the inherited estates of these funds.
Within UKLAP two new with-profit sub-funds have been created.
Policies of non-electing policyholders have been transferred to Old With-Profit Sub-Fund OWPSF.
The inherited estate has not been reattributed and remains in OWPSF.
Where policyholders elected to accept the reattribution their policies have been transferred to New With-Profit Sub-Fund NWPSF.
The negative shareholders funds balance within the UK with-profit funds arises in NWPSF as a result of regulatory valuation and admissibility differences in the reattributed estate which is valued on a realistic regulatory basis compared to the disclosure on an IFRS basis.
NWPSF is fully supported by the reattributed estate of 1,177 million, known as the Reattribution Inherited Estate External Support Accounts RIEESA, at 31 December 2009, held within NPSF1 a non-profit fund within UKLAP included within other UK life operations, in the form of a capital support arrangement.
This support arrangement will provide capital to NWPSF to ensure that the value of assets of NWPSF are at least equal to the value of liabilities calculated on a realistic regulatory basis therefore it forms part of the NWPSF available capital resources.
For UKLAP RIEESA, equity market performance has had little impact, as the funds mitigate materially all of the equity risk of the estate RIEESA through internal hedging.
Commercial property returns have been negative, and this has had adverse impact, less so in UKLAP WP as the risk had been partially hedged.
However, credit risk is largely unhedged, and the reduction in spreads on corporate bonds through 2009 contributed to increases in the estate RIEESA.
Stabilisation in financial markets saw implied volatility reduce significantly through 2009, from near 35% at start of year to 25% at year end.
This has significantly reduced the market consistent cost of guarantees and hence increased estate RIEESA.
For the Overseas life operations, the positive variance between actual and expected experience is driven mainly by market movements which has led to capital appreciation of fixed interest assets and consequential increase of the unallocated divisible surplus in France and other European businesses.
In aggregate, the Group has at its disposal total available capital of 17.1 billion 2008 restated: 13.7 billion, representing the aggregation of the solvency capital of all of our businesses.
This capital is available to meet risks and regulatory requirements set by reference to local guidance and EU directives.
After effecting the year end transfers to shareholders, the UK with-profit funds' have available capital of 2.9 billion 2008: 2.7 billion including amounts held in RIEESA.
Subject to certain conditions, the RIEESA capital can be used to write new non-profit business, but the primary purpose of this capital is to provide support for the UK with-profit business.
The capital is comfortably in excess of the required capital margin, and therefore the shareholders are not required to provide further support.
For the remaining life and general insurance operations, the total available capital amounting to 14.2 billion 2008 restated: 11.0 billion is significantly higher than the minimum requirements established by regulators and, in principle, the excess is available to shareholders.
In practice, management will hold higher levels of capital within each business operation to provide appropriate cover for risk.
252 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 55 Capital statement continued As the total available capital of 17.1 billion is arrived at on the basis of local regulatory guidance, which evaluates assets and liabilities prudently, it understates the economic capital of the business which is considerably higher.
This is a limitation of the Group Capital Statement which, to be more meaningful, needs to evaluate available capital on an economic basis and compare it with the risk capital required for each individual operation, after allowing for the considerable diversification benefits that exist in our Group.
Within the Aviva Group there exist intra-group arrangements to provide capital to particular business units.
Included in these arrangements is a subordinated loan of 200 million from Aviva Life Holdings UK Limited to the Aviva Annuity Limited to provide capital to support the writing of new business.
The available capital of the Groups with-profit funds is determined in accordance with the Realistic balance sheet regime prescribed by the FSAs regulations, under which liabilities to policyholders include both declared bonuses and the constructive obligation for future bonuses not yet declared.
The available capital resources include an estimate of the value of their respective estates, included as part of the unallocated divisible surplus.
The estate represents the surplus in the fund that is in excess of any constructive obligation to policyholders.
It represents capital resources of the individual with-profit fund to which it relates and is available to meet regulatory and other solvency requirements of the fund and, in certain circumstances, additional liabilities may arise.
The liabilities included in the balance sheet for the with-profit funds do not include the amount representing the shareholders portion of future bonuses.
However, the shareholders portion is treated as a deduction from capital that is available to meet regulatory requirements and is therefore shown as a separate adjustment in the capital statement.
In accordance with the FSAs regulatory rules under its realistic capital regime, the Group is required to hold sufficient capital in its UK life with-profit funds to meet the FSA capital requirements, based on the risk capital margin RCM.
The determination of the RCM depends on various actuarial and other assumptions about potential changes in market prices, and the actions management would take in the event of particular adverse changes in market conditions.

Estimated realistic inherited estate at 31 December 2008 was 0.7 billion, 0.7 billion and 1.2 billion for CGNU Life, CULAC and NUL&P respectively 2007: 1.4 billion, 1.2 billion, 1.9 billion respectively.
The risk capital margin RCM is 3.6 times covered by the inherited estate and capital support arrangement 2008: 1.8 times, 2007: 3.5 times.
The UKLAP fund includes the Provident Mutual PM fund, which has realistic assets and liabilities of 1.7 billion and therefore does not impact the realistic inherited estate.
This represents the reattributed estate of 1.1 billion at 31 December 2009 held within the non-profit fund with UKLAP included within other UK life operations.
Under the FSA regulatory regime, UK life with-profit business is required to hold capital equivalent to the greater of the regulatory requirement based on EU Directives regulatory peak and the FSA realistic bases realistic peak described above.
For UK non-participating business, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with FSA regulations.
The available capital reflects the excess of regulatory basis assets over liabilities before deduction of capital resources requirement.
For UK general insurance businesses, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with the FSA requirements.
For overseas businesses in the EEA, US, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore, the available capital and the minimum requirement are calculated under the locally applicable regulatory regimes.
The businesses outside these territories are subject to the FSA rules for the purposes of calculation of available capital and capital resource requirement.
For fund management and other businesses, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with the local regulators requirements for the specific class of business.
All businesses hold sufficient available capital to meet their capital resource requirement.
Financial statements IFRS 253 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 55 Capital statement continued The available capital resources in each regulated entity are generally subject to restrictions as to their availability to meet requirements that may arise elsewhere in the Group.
The principal restrictions are: i UK with-profit funds NWPSF, OWPSF and existing UKLAP WP funds any available surplus held in each fund can be used to meet the requirements of the fund itself, be distributed to policyholders and shareholders or in the case of NWPSF and OWPSF, transferred via the capital support arrangement explained above for OWPSF only to the extent support has been provided in the past.
In most cases, with-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits while the shareholders receive the balance.
The latter distribution would be subject to a tax charge, which is met by the fund.
ii UK non-participating funds any available surplus held in these is attributable to shareholders.
Capital in the non-profit funds may be made available to meet requirements elsewhere in the Group subject to meeting the regulatory requirements of the fund.
Any transfer of the surplus may give rise to a tax charge subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
iii Overseas life operations the capital requirements and corresponding regulatory capital held by overseas businesses are calculated using the locally applicable regulatory regime.
The available capital resources in all these businesses are subject to local regulatory restrictions which may constrain managements ability to utilise these in other parts of the Group.
Any transfer of available capital may give rise to a tax charge subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
iv General insurance operations the capital requirements and corresponding regulatory capital held by overseas businesses are calculated using the locally applicable regulatory regime.
Any transfer of available capital may give rise to a tax charge, subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
56 Risk management This note sets out the major risks our businesses face and describes our approach to managing these.
It also gives sensitivity analyses around the major economic and non-economic assumptions that can cause volatility in our earnings and capital requirements.
a Risk management framework Aviva has established a risk management framework to protect the Group from events that hinder the sustainable achievement of its performance objectives, including failing to exploit opportunities.
The risks faced by the Group can be categorised as follows: Financial risks cover market and credit risk, insurance risk, liquidity and capital management.
Strategic risks include issues such as customer, brand, products and markets as well as any risks to our business model arising from changes in our market and risks arising from mergers and acquisitions.
Operational risk arises from inadequate or failed internal processes, or from people and systems or from external events.
Operational risks include business protection, information technology, people, legal and regulatory compliance.
The risk management framework provides the means to identify, assess, mitigate, manage, monitor and report all of the different types of risk faced by the Group to provide a single picture of the threats and uncertainties faced and opportunities that exist.
Responsibility for risk management resides at all levels within the Group with appropriate risk related objectives embedded within performance measurement plans.
As part of our risk management framework we employ a three lines of defence model that encourages close working relationships between line management and the risk function whilst facilitating independent assurance by internal audit.
Primary responsibility for risk identification and management lies with business management the first line of defence.
Support for and challenge on the completeness and accuracy of risk assessment, risk reporting and adequacy of mitigation plans are performed by specialist risk functions the second line of defence.
Independent and objective assurance on the robustness of the risk management framework and the appropriateness and effectiveness of internal control is provided by group audit the third line of defence.
The Group sets limits to manage material risks to ensure the risks stay within risk appetite the amount of risk the Group is willing to accept.
The Group assesses the size and scale of a risk by considering how likely it is that the risk will occur and the potential impact the risk could have on our business and our stakeholders.
Where risks are outside appetite actions are agreed to mitigate the exposure.
The Groups risk management framework is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk to business objectives and mitigates the risk of material financial misstatement or loss.
New and emerging risks, or risks we currently deem as immaterial may also pose a risk to business objectives.
The Group recognises the critical importance of maintaining an efficient and effective risk management framework.
To this end, the Group has an established governance framework, which has the following key elements: Defined terms of reference for the Board, its committees, and the associated executive management committees.
A clear organisational structure with documented delegated authorities and responsibilities from the Board to Board committees, executive management committees and senior management.
A risk management function operating across Group centre, regions and business units, with clear responsibilities and objectives: A Group policy framework that defines risk appetite and sets out risk management and control standards for the Groups worldwide operations.
The policies also set out the roles and responsibilities of businesses, regions, policy owners and the risk oversight committees: and Risk oversight committees that review and monitor aggregate risk data, assess whether the risk profile is within appetite and take overall risk management decisions.
The committees monitor adherence to the risk management policies and oversee mitigating actions being taken where risks are outside of appetite.
254 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 56 Risk management continued The Group has developed economic capital models that support the measurement, comparison and monitoring of our risks.
The results of the modelling are incorporated into key decision making processes.
These models show the relative impact to economic capital from the risks we face.
In turn this supports the assessment of appropriate and effective mitigating strategies where risks are outside of appetite.
The financial impact from changes in market risk such as interest rates, equity prices and property values is examined through stress tests adopted in the Individual Capital Assessments ICA and scenario analysis which consider the impact on capital from variations in financial circumstances on either a remote scenario, or to changes from the central operating scenario.
Both assessments consider the management actions that may be taken in mitigation of the change in circumstances.
Stress and scenario testing help give an indication of the size of losses that could be experienced in extreme but plausible events and complements other risk measurement techniques.
It helps identify concentration risk across businesses and portfolios and is a useful tool for management to use in their capital planning process.
A number of stress tests and economic scenarios have been developed to capture the adverse impact on the businesses of extreme events.
The stress tests are designed to cover major asset classes and insurance risks.
The stress tests are produced at least monthly and are reviewed and discussed by senior management.
The sensitivity of Group earnings to changes in economic markets is regularly monitored through sensitivities to investment rate and investment return and asset values in IFRS and MCEV reporting.
The Financial Services Authority FSA requires Aviva to assess its economic capital requirements to ensure that it adequately reflects business and control risks.
In turn this analysis supports our strategic planning and decision-making processes.
b Market risk Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in fair values or future cash flows of financial instruments from fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, property prices, and foreign currency exchange rates.
Market risk arises in business units due to fluctuations in both the value of liabilities and the value of investments held.
At Group level, it also arises in relation to the overall portfolio of international businesses and in the value of investment assets owned directly by the shareholders.
The Group has established a policy on market risk which sets out the principles that businesses are expected to adopt in respect of management of the key market risks to which the Group is exposed.
The Group monitors adherence to this market risk policy and regularly reviews how business units are managing these risks locally, through the Group Assets Committee and ultimately the Group Asset Liability Committee.
For each of the major components of market risk, described in more detail below, the Group has put in place additional processes and procedures to set out how each risk should be managed and monitored, and the approach to setting an appropriate risk appetite.
The management of market risk is undertaken in businesses, regions and at Group level.
Businesses manage market risks locally using the Group market risk framework and within local regulatory constraints.
Businesses may also be constrained by the requirement to meet policyholders reasonable expectations and to minimise or avoid market risk in a number of areas.
The Group Assets Committee is responsible for managing market risk at Group level, and a number of investment-related risks, in particular those faced by shareholder funds throughout the Group.
The Group market risk policy sets out the minimum principles and framework for matching liabilities with appropriate assets, the approaches to be taken when liabilities cannot be matched and the monitoring processes that are required.
The Group has criteria for matching assets and liabilities for all classes of business to minimise the impact of mismatches between the value of assets and the liabilities due to market movements.
The local regulatory environment for each business will also set the conditions under which assets and liabilities are to be matched.
In addition, where the Groups long-term savings businesses have written insurance and investment products where the majority of investment risks are borne by its policyholders, these risks are managed in line with local regulations and marketing literature, in order to satisfy the policyholders risk and reward objectives.
The Group writes unit-linked business in a number of its operations.
In unit-linked business, the policyholder bears the investment risk on the assets held in the unit-linked funds, as the policy benefits are directly linked to the value of the assets in the fund.
The shareholders exposure to market risk on this business is limited to the extent that income arising from asset management charges is based on the value of assets in the fund.
Equity price risk The Group is subject to equity price risk due to daily changes in the market values of its equity securities portfolio.
The Groups shareholders are exposed to the following sources of equity risk: Direct equity shareholdings in shareholder funds and the Group defined benefit pension funds.
The indirect impact from changes in the value of equities held in policyholders funds from which management charges or a share of performance are taken: and Its interest in the free estate of long-term with profits funds.
Financial statements IFRS 255 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 56 Risk management continued At a business unit level, equity price risk is actively managed in order to mitigate anticipated unfavourable market movements where this lies outside the risk appetite of either the company in respect of shareholder assets or the fund in respect of policyholder assets concerned.
In addition local asset admissibility regulations require that business units hold diversified portfolios of assets thereby reducing exposure to individual equities.
The Group does not have material holdings of unquoted equity securities.
Equity risk is also managed using a variety of derivative instruments, including futures and options.
Businesses actively model the performance of equities through the use of stochastic models, in particular to understand the impact of equity performance on guarantees, options and bonus rates.
The Group Assets Committee actively monitors equity assets owned directly by the Group, which may include some material shareholdings in the Groups strategic business partners.
Sensitivity to changes in equity prices is given in section i below.
Property price risk The Group is subject to property price risk due to holdings of investment properties in a variety of locations worldwide.
Investment in property is managed at regional and business level, and will be subject to local regulations on asset admissibility, liquidity requirements and the expectations of policyholders as well as overall risk appetite.
The Group Assets Committee also monitors property assets owned directly by the Group.
As at 31 December 2009, no material derivative contracts had been entered into to mitigate the effects of changes in property prices.
Sensitivity to changes in property prices is given in section i below.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises primarily from the Groups investments in long-term debt and fixed income securities, which are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates.
The Group manages this risk by adopting close asset liability matching criteria, to minimise the impact of mismatches between the value of assets and liabilities from interest rate movements.
A number of policyholder participation features have an influence on the Groups interest rate risk.
The major features include guaranteed surrender values, guaranteed annuity options, and minimum surrender and maturity values.
Details of material guarantees and options are given in note 40.
In short-term business such as general insurance business, the Group requires a close matching of assets and liabilities to minimise this risk.
Interest rate risk is monitored and managed by the Group Assets Committee, and the Group Asset Liability Committee.
Exposure to interest rate risk is monitored through several measures that include Value-at-Risk analysis, position limits, scenario testing, stress testing and asset and liability matching using measures such as duration.
The impact of exposure to sustained low interest rates is regularly monitored.
Interest rate risk is also managed using a variety of derivative instruments, including futures, options, swaps, caps and floors, in order to provide a degree of hedging against unfavourable market movements in interest rates inherent in the assets backing technical liabilities.
As at 31 December 2009, the Group had entered into a number of initiatives, including interest rate swap agreements and changes in asset mix, to mitigate the effects of potential adverse interest rate movements, and to enable closer matching of assets and liabilities.
Sensitivity to changes in interest rates is given in section i below.
Further information on borrowings is included in note 48.
Currency risk The Group has minimal exposure to currency risk from financial instruments held by business units in currencies other than their functional currencies, as nearly all such holdings are backing either unit-linked or with-profit contract liabilities.
For this reason, no sensitivity analysis is given for these holdings.
The Group operates internationally and as a result is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates of various currencies.
Approximately half of the Groups premium income arises in currencies other than sterling and the Groups net assets are denominated in a variety of currencies, of which the largest are euro, sterling, and US dollars.
The Group does not hedge foreign currency revenues as these are substantially retained locally to support the growth of the Groups business and meet local regulatory and market requirements.
The Groups foreign exchange policy requires that each of our subsidiaries maintains sufficient assets in its local currency to meet local currency liabilities.
Therefore, capital held by the Groups business units should be able to support local business activities regardless of foreign currency movements.
However, such movements may impact the value of the Groups consolidated shareholders equity which is expressed in sterling.
This aspect of foreign exchange risk is monitored and managed centrally, against pre-determined limits.
The Groups foreign exchange policy is to manage these exposures by aligning the deployment of regulatory capital by currency with the Groups regulatory capital requirements by currency.
Limits are set to control the extent to which the deployment of capital is not aligned fully with the Groups regulatory capital requirement for each major currency.
Currency borrowings and derivatives are used to manage exposures within the limits that have been set.
256 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 56 Risk management continued At 31 December 2009, the Groups total equity deployment by currency was: Sterling Euro US$ Other Total m m m m m Capital 31 December 2009 1,737 8,781 2,605 1,963 15,086 Capital 31 December 2008 restated 2,041 8,108 2,130 2,294 14,573 Capital 31 December 2007 restated 3,809 8,763 1,456 1,999 16,027 A 10% change in sterling to euro US$ foreign exchange rates would have had the following impact on total equity.

These movements in exchange rates therefore have no impact on profit.
Net assets are stated after taking account of the effect of currency hedging activities.
Derivatives risk Derivatives are used by a number of the businesses, within policy guidelines agreed by the Board of Directors, as set out in the Group policy on derivatives use.
Activity is overseen by the Derivatives Approvals Committee, which monitors implementation of the policy, exposure levels and approves large or complex transactions proposed by businesses.
Derivatives are primarily used for efficient investment management, risk hedging purposes or to structure specific retail savings products.
Derivative transactions are covered by either cash or corresponding assets and liabilities.
Speculative activity is prohibited, unless prior approval has been obtained from the Derivatives Approvals Committee.
Over the counter derivative contracts are entered into only with approved counterparties and using ISDA documentation and credit support annexes or equivalent in accordance with the Group derivatives policy.
Adherence to the collateral requirements as set out in the Group derivatives and Group credit policies thereby reduces the risk of credit loss.
The Group applies strict requirements to the administration and valuation processes it uses, and has a control framework that is consistent with market and industry practice for the activity that is undertaken.
Correlation risk The Group recognises that identified lapse behaviour and potential increases in consumer expectations are sensitive to and interdependent with market movements and interest rates.
These interdependencies are taken into consideration in the ICA in the aggregation of the financial stress tests with the operational risk assessment and in scenario analysis.
c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss as a result of the default or failure of third parties to pay on their obligations to Aviva.
Our credit risks arise through exposures to debt investments, structured asset investments, derivative counterparties, mortgage lending and reinsurance placement counterparties.
We hold these investments for the benefit of both our policyholders and shareholders.
The Group manages its credit risk at business unit, regional and Group levels.
All business units and regions are required to implement local credit risk processes including limits frameworks, operate specific risk management committees, and ensure detailed reporting and monitoring of their exposures against pre-established risk criteria.
At Group level, we manage and monitor all exposures across our business units on a consolidated basis, and operate group limit frameworks that must be adhered to by all.
The Group risk management framework also includes the market related aspect of credit risk.
This is the risk of a fall in the value of fixed interest securities from changes in the perceived worthiness of the issuer and is manifested through changes in the fixed interest securities credit spreads.
Management of credit risk is effected by five core functions: The maintenance and adherence of an effective governance structure.
This includes clear guidance, scope and frameworks for all aspects of the credit risk function to ensure accountability and clarity.
This also includes delegated authority to the Group Credit Approvals Committee, a quorum of key senior risk officers, that is authorised to make key decisions within certain risk appetite levels.
The accurately and timely reporting of detailed exposure information, and their aggregation by counterparty, exposure types, sectors, geography and ratings.
The implementation of a sophisticated capital charge based credit limits framework that considers and quantifies the key specific attributes of each exposure eg seniority, maturity etc and provides a counterparty level aggregation methodology on a risk neutral basis.
This is then managed against centrally set limits.
Absolute upper bound limits are also set to ensure unexpected jump to default risks are kept within appetite.
Additional limit frameworks are applied for structured assets and reinsurance counterparty exposures.
The limits framework also considers more systemic risk factors such as sector and geographic concentrations, and these are continually assessed throughout our global portfolio to ensure optimal diversification levels are maintained and improved.
Financial statements IFRS 257 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 56 Risk management continued Additional committee and credit risk function oversight is provided on all credit risk related matters.
This includes regular consideration and review of our key counterparties, monitoring and addressing key credit themes and news that emerge in the markets.
The Group Credit Approvals Committee provides an effective forum to ensure that all key recommendations are considered, and decisions implemented throughout the Group.
The regional and Group credit divisions ensure that all qualitative aspects of risk management are considered and evaluated to provide further oversight and balance to the quantitative aspects.
The employment of risk mitigation techniques where and when deemed appropriate.
These are utilised where possible to remove residual unwanted risks, as well as bring limits within appetite, and include methods such as collateralisation, purchase of credit protection and diversification strategies.
A detailed breakdown of Avivas current credit exposure by credit quality is shown below.
Financial exposures by credit ratings Financial assets are graded according to current external credit ratings issued.
AAA is the highest possible rating.
Investment grade financial assets are classified within the range of AAA to BBB ratings.
Financial assets which fall outside this range are classified as speculative grade.
The following table provides information regarding the aggregated credit risk exposure, for financial assets with external credit ratings, of the Group.
Not rated assets capture assets not rated by external ratings agencies.
258 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 56 Risk management continued Other investments Other investments include: 29, 944 million of unit trusts and other investment vehicles.
The underlying credit ratings of these assets are not reflected in this analysis.
Derivative financial instruments of 2,078 million, representing positions to mitigate the impact of adverse market movements.
Other assets of 2,804 million, which are primarily deposits with credit institutions and investments in hedge funds.
The Group loan portfolio principally comprises: Policy loans which are generally collateralised by a lien or charge over the underlying policy: Loans and advances to banks which primarily relate to loans of cash collateral received in stock lending transactions.
These loans are fully collateralised by other securities: and Mortgage loans collateralised by property assets.
Unit trusts and other investment vehicles The credit quality of the underlying debt securities within these vehicles is managed by the safeguards built into the investment mandates for these funds.
We rely on our understanding that the trusts and their asset managers are only approved if they satisfy certain selection criteria including due diligence in the form of a questionnaire and or research by dedicated teams.
In addition, the asset managers are mandated to make investments in line with the funds risk profiles as marketed to prospective customers and policyholders.
Accordingly, as part of reviewing the asset quality of unit trusts and other investment vehicles, we monitor the assets within the funds and their performance to ensure they remain in line with the respective investment mandates for these funds.
For certain of the unit trusts in our other investments, we apply minimum requirements affecting both the underlying counterparties and the investments issued by those counterparties such as a minimum size for the counterpartys programme, a limit on the size of the overall exposure to the underlying counterparty and, where appropriate, explicit approval of the counterparty by internal credit risk management teams is required.
These criteria are indicators of the asset quality for these investments, as they represent minimum criteria for liquidity and diversification.
A proportion of the assets underlying these investments are represented by equities and so credit ratings are not generally applicable.
Equity exposures are managed against agreed benchmarks that are set with reference to overall market risk appetite.
Derivatives Derivative transactions must comply with Group guidance on the quality of counterparties used and the extent of collateralisation required.
The counterparty must have a minimum credit rating from rating agencies S&P, Moody's and Fitch and the collateral process must meet certain minimum standards as set out by Group guidelines.
The largest shareholder notional positions are exchange traded, rather than over the counter OTC, with the added protection that provides ie the credit risk is mitigated significantly through regular margining and protection offered by the exchange, and is controlled by the Groups local asset management operations.
Other assets The vast majority over 90% of the investments in deposits and credit institutions is with an individual financial services counterparty which benefits from both implicit and explicit backing of AAA rated governments as a function of its ownership structure.
Financial statements IFRS 259 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 56 Risk management continued Loans The majority of the Group loans portfolio is unrated.
However, we use the following metrics to internally monitor our exposure: Property collateralisation Interest service cost Diversity of the tenant base Lower risk nature of loans made to the UK healthcare sector: and Existence of government guarantees for some residential mortgages.
Policy loans are loans and advances made to policyholders, and are collateralised by the underlying policies.
As such, we believe such collateralisation minimises our risk.
Credit concentration risk The long-term businesses and general insurance businesses are generally not individually exposed to significant concentrations of credit risk due to the regulations, applicable in most markets, limiting investments in individual assets and asset classes supplemented by the Group credit policy and limits framework.
In cases where the business is particularly exposed to credit risk eg in respect of defaults on mortgages matching annuity liabilities this risk is translated into a more conservative discount rate used to value the liabilities, creating a greater capital requirement, and this credit risk is actively managed.
The impact of aggregation of credit risk is monitored as described above.
With the exception of Government bonds the largest aggregated counterparty exposure is approximately 0.8% of the Groups total shareholder assets.
Reinsurance credit exposures The Group is exposed to concentrations of risk with individual reinsurers, due to the nature of the reinsurance market and the restricted range of reinsurers that have acceptable credit ratings.
The Group operates a policy to manage its reinsurance counterparty exposures, by limiting the reinsurers that may be used and applying strict limits to each reinsurer.
Reinsurance exposures are aggregated with other exposures to ensure that the overall risk is within appetite.
The Credit Approvals Committee has a monitoring role over this risk.
The Groups largest reinsurance counterparty is Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd including subsidiaries.
At 31 December 2009, the reinsurance asset recoverable from Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd was 1,433 million.
This exposure is monitored on a regular basis.
In the event of a catastrophic event, the counterparty exposure to a single reinsurer is estimated not to exceed 4.6% of shareholders equity.
Securities finance The Group has significant securities financing operations within the UK.
The risks within this business are mitigated by over collateralisation which is designed to result in minimal residual risk.
The Group operates strict standards around collateral management and controls.
Derivative credit exposures The Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk through derivative trades.
This risk is mitigated through collateralising almost all trades the exception being certain FX trades where it has historically been the market norm not to collateralise.
The Group operates strict standards around collateral management and controls including the requirement that all Over the Counter derivatives are supported by credit support annexes and ISDAs.
Unit-linked business As discussed previously, in unit-linked business the policyholder bears the market risk, including credit risk, on investment assets in the unit funds, and the shareholders exposure to credit risk is limited to the extent that their income arises from asset management charges based on the value of assets in the fund.
260 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 56 Risk management continued Impairment of financial assets The following table provides information regarding the carrying value of financial assets that have been impaired and the ageing of financial assets that are past due but not impaired.

The credit quality of financial assets is managed at the local business unit level.
Where assets have been classed as past due and impaired, an analysis is made of the risk of default and a decision is made whether to seek collateral from the counterparty.
There were no material financial assets that would have been past due or impaired had the terms not been renegotiated.
Financial statements IFRS 261 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 56 Risk management continued d Liquidity risk At Group level, we maintain a prudent level of liquidity which meets the expectations of the financial services authority FSA and the wider investment community.
We maintain a buffer of liquid assets, determined by liquidity stress tests, which is designed to cover unforeseen circumstances in any of our businesses.
The Group and Company have a strong liquidity position 2.2 billion of financial assets held at Group and through the application of a Group Liquidity policy seek to maintain sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due.
In addition to this strong liquidity position, the Group and Company maintain significant committed borrowing facilities 2.1 billion from a range of highly rated banks to further mitigate this risk.
Asset liability matching Generally, our individual business units generate sufficient capital from the receipt of premiums, fees and investment income, along with planned asset sales and maturities, to pay claims and expenses.
However, there may be instances where additional cash requirements arise in excess of that available within the operating businesses.
In such instances, we have several options to fund these cash requirements including the selling of assets from the investment portfolios, using centre funds, issuing commercial paper and the committed borrowing facilities.
The Asset Liability matching ALM methodology develops optimal asset portfolio maturity structures for our businesses which seek to ensure that the cash flows are sufficient to meet the liabilities as they are expected to arise.
Where any decision to adopt a position in respect of policyholder assets and liabilities is not closely matched but is within the business units investment risk appetite, the impact is monitored through our economic capital measurement process.
The decision taken must be justified to the local management board and Group management by a full analysis of the impact of the level of mismatch on both risk and return.
ALM strategy may be determined at a sub-fund level for a block of closely related liabilities.
Alternatively, if ALM strategy is determined at a fund or company level, it will usually be appropriate for pricing, financial reporting and risk management purposes to develop a hypothecation of assets to notional sub-funds with different liability characteristics.
It is for this reason that Group Risk provides a framework of corporate objectives within which the operating businesses develop specific and appropriate ALM methodologies, to seek to ensure that our businesses have sufficient liquidity to settle claims as they are expected to arise.
ALM modelling is based on a projection of both assets and liabilities into the future.
Stochastic models are used to set ALM policy where fund particulars contain a range of outcomes.
A further tenet of our risk management strategy involves investment strategies, which also take into account the accounting, regulatory, capital and tax issues.
The ALM strategy also takes into account the reasonable expectations of policyholders, local best practice and meets relevant regulatory requirements.
Our investment strategies are designed to seek to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists in extreme business scenarios.
For example, our investment strategy must consider a scenario of high lapses accompanied by poor investment markets or a general insurance catastrophe event.
Maturity analyses The following tables show the maturities of our insurance and investment contract liabilities, and of the financial and reinsurance assets to meet them.
A maturity analysis of the contractual amounts payable for borrowings and derivatives is given in notes 48 and 57 respectively.
Contractual obligations under operating leases and capital commitments are given in note 52. i Analysis of maturity of insurance and investment contract liabilities For non-linked insurance business, the following table shows the gross liability at 31 December 2009 analysed by remaining duration.
The total liability is split by remaining duration in proportion to the cash-flows expected to arise during that period, as permitted under IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts.
Almost all investment contracts may be surrendered or transferred on demand.
For such contracts, the earliest contractual maturity date is therefore the current statement of financial position date, for a surrender amount approximately equal to the current statement of financial position liability.
We expect surrenders, transfers and maturities to occur over many years, and the tables reflect the expected cash flows for non-linked investment contracts.
However, contractually, the total liability for nonlinked investment contracts of 59,504 million 2008: 60,264 million, 2007: 45,492 million would be shown in the within 1 year column below.
Unit-linked contracts are repayable or transferable on demand and are therefore shown in the within 1 year column.

Where an instrument is transferable back to the issuer on demand, such as most unit trusts or similar types of investment vehicle, it is included in the On demand or within 1 year column.
Debt securities with no fixed contractual maturity date are generally callable at the option of the issuer at the date the coupon rate is reset under the contractual terms of the instrument.
The terms for resetting the coupon are such that we expect the securities to be redeemed at this date, as it would be uneconomic for the issuer not to do so, and for liquidity management purposes we manage these securities on this basis.
The first repricing and call date is normally 10 years or more after the date of issuance.
Most of the Groups investments in equity securities and fixed maturity securities are market traded and therefore, if required, can be liquidated for cash at short notice.
As explained in note 2 a ii, comparative information for the disclosures required by the IFRS 7 amendments is not needed in the first year of application and so no table for 2008 is presented above.
e Insurance risk i Life insurance risk Types of risk Life insurance risk in the Group arises through its exposure to mortality and morbidity insurance and exposure to worse than anticipated operating experience on factors such as persistency levels and management and administration expenses.
Risk management framework The Group has developed a life insurance risk policy and guidelines on the practical application of this policy.
Individual life insurance risks are managed at a business unit level but are also monitored at Group level.
The impact of life insurance risks is monitored by the business units as part of the control cycle of business management.
Exposure is monitored through the assessment of liabilities, the asset liability management framework, profit reporting under both IFRS and MCEV, and the ICA process.
Significant insurance risks will be reported through the Group risk management framework and overseen by the Life Insurance Committee.
At Group level the overall exposure to life insurance risk is measured through the ICA and other management reporting.
The Life Insurance Committee monitors the application of the risk policy in each business, and receives management information on life insurance risks.
The committee considers all areas of life insurance risk, but in particular has a remit to monitor mortality, longevity, morbidity, persistency, product development and pricing, unit pricing and expenses.
The committee also considers the reinsurance coverage across the life businesses.
It confirms that guidance and procedures are in place for each of the major components of life insurance risk, and that the businesses mitigate against any life insurance risk outside local appetite, within the parameters for the overall Group risk appetite.
The committee has also developed guidance for business units on management of a number of areas of life insurance risk to ensure best practice is shared throughout the Group and common standards are adopted.
264 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 56 Risk management continued Management of life insurance risks The individual life insurance risks are managed as follows: Mortality and morbidity risks are mitigated by use of reinsurance.
The Group a llows business units to select reinsurers, from those approved by the Group, based on local factors, but assesses the overall programme to manage group-wide risk exposures and monitor the aggregation of risk ceded to individual reinsurers is within appetite for credit risk.
Longevity risk is carefully monitored against the latest external industry data and emerging trends.
Whilst individual businesses are responsible for reserving and pricing for annuity business, the Group monitors the exposure to this risk and the capital implications to manage the impact on the group-wide exposure and the capital funding that businesses may require as a consequence.
The Group has used reinsurance solutions to reduce the risks from longevity where possible and desirable and continually monitors and evaluates emerging market solutions to mitigate this risk further.
Persistency risk is managed at a business unit level through frequent monitoring of company experience, benchmarked against local market information.
Generally, persistency risk arises from customers lapsing their policies earlier than has been assumed.
Where possible the financial impact of lapses is reduced through appropriate product design.
Businesses also implement specific initiatives to improve retention of policies which may otherwise lapse.
The Group Life Insurance Committee has developed guidelines on persistency management.
Product Design and Pricing risk arises from poorly designed or inadequately priced products and can lead to both financial loss and reputation damage from the Group.
Guidelines have been developed to support the businesses through the complete cycle of the product development process, financial analysis and pricing.
Expense risk is primarily managed by the business units through the assessment of business unit profitability and frequent monitoring of expense levels.
Apart from the ICA, sensitivity testing is widely used to measure the capital required and volatility in earnings due to exposure to life insurance risks, typically through MCEV reporting examples of which are contained elsewhere in this report.
This assessment is taken at both business unit level and at Group level where the impact of aggregation of similar risks can be measured.
This enables the Group to determine whether action is required to reduce risk, or whether that risk is within the overall risk appetite.
Concentration risk The Group writes a diverse mix of business in worldwide markets that are all subject to similar risks mortality, persistency etc.
The Group assesses the relative costs and concentrations of each type of risk through the ICA capital requirements and material issues are escalated to and addressed at the Life Insurance Committee.
This analysis enables the Group to assess whether accumulations of risk exceeds risk appetite.
One key concentration of life insurance risk for the Group is improving longevity risk from pensions in payment and deferred annuities in the UK and the Netherlands where the Group has material portfolios.
The Group continually monitors this risk and the opportunities for mitigating actions through reinsurance, improved asset liability matching, or innovative solutions that emerge in the market.
When looking at concentrations of risk, for example market risk, the risk within Aviva staff pension schemes is also considered.
ICA analysis and MCEV sensitivity testing help identify both concentrations of risk types and the benefits of diversification of risk.
Embedded derivatives The Group has exposure to a variety of embedded derivatives in its long-term savings business due to product features offering varying degrees of guaranteed benefits at maturity or on early surrender, along with options to convert their benefits into different products on pre-agreed terms.
The extent of the impact of these embedded derivatives differs considerably between business units.
Examples of each type of embedded derivative affecting the Group are: Options: call, put, surrender and maturity options, guaranteed annuity options, options to cease premium payment, options for withdrawals free of market value adjustment, annuity options, and guaranteed insurability options.
Guarantees: embedded floor guaranteed return, maturity guarantee, guaranteed death benefit, and guaranteed minimum rate of annuity payment.
Other: indexed interest or principal payments, maturity value, loyalty bonus.
The impact of these is reflected in ICA and MCEV reporting and managed as part of the asset liability framework.
Financial statements IFRS 265 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 56 Risk management continued ii General insurance risk Types of risk General insurance risk in the Group arises from: Fluctuations in the timing, frequency and severity of claims and claim settlements relative to expectations Unexpected claims arising from a single source Inaccurate pricing of risks or inappropriate underwriting of risks when underwritten Inadequate reinsurance protection or other risk transfer techniques Inadequate reserves The majority of the general insurance business underwritten by the Group is of a short tail nature such as motor, household and commercial property insurances.
The Groups underwriting strategy and appetite is agreed by the Executive Committee and communicated via specific policy statements and guidelines.
Like life insurance risk, general insurance risk is managed primarily at business unit level with oversight at a Group level, through the General Insurance Committee.
The vast majority of the Groups general insurance business is managed and priced in the same country as the domicile of the customer.
Management of general insurance risks Significant insurance risks will be reported through the Group risk management framework.
Additionally, the ICA is used to assess the risks that each general insurance business unit, and the Group as a whole, is exposed to, quantifying their impact and calculating appropriate capital requirements.
Increasingly risk-based capital models are being used to support the quantification of risk under the ICA framework.
All general insurance business units undertake a quarterly review of their insurance risks, the output from which is a key input into the ICA and risk-based capital assessments.
The General Insurance Committee monitors and develops the management of insurance risk in the general insurance business units, and assesses the aggregate risk exposure.
It is responsible for the development, implementation, and review of the Group policies for underwriting, claims, reinsurance and reserving that operate within the Group risk management framework.
Business units have developed mechanisms that identify, quantify and manage accumulated exposures to contain them within the limits of the appetite of the Group.
The Group has pioneered various developments, such as the Aviva UK Digital Flood Map to effectively manage exposures arising from specific perils.
Where appropriate such projects are employed throughout the business units to promote the adoption of best practice as standard.
General insurance claims reserving Actuarial claims reserving is conducted by local actuaries in the various general insurance business units according to the General Insurance Reserving policy.
The General Insurance Committee monitors and maintains the General Insurance Reserving policy, and conducts quarterly reviews of the Groups general insurance claims provisions, and their adequacy.
The reviews include peer reviews of the business units own conclusions as well as independent analysis to confirm the reasonableness of the local reviews.
The adequacy of the Groups general insurance claims provisions is ultimately overseen by the General Insurance Committee.
A number of business units also have periodic external reviews by local consultant actuaries often as part of the local regulatory requirement.
Reinsurance strategy Significant reinsurance purchases are reviewed annually at both business unit and Group level, to verify that the levels of protection being bought reflect any developments in exposure and the risk appetite of the Group.
Reinsurance purchases must be in line with the strategy set out in our Group General Insurance Reinsurance policy.
The basis of these purchases is underpinned by extensive financial and capital modelling and actuarial analysis to optimise the cost and capital efficiency benefits from our reinsurance program.
For the larger business units, this involves utilising externally sourced probabilistic models to verify the accumulations and loss probabilities based on the Groups specific portfolios of business.
Where external models are not available, scenarios are developed and tested using the Groups data to determine potential losses and appropriate levels of reinsurance protection.
The reinsurance is placed with providers who meet the Groups counterparty security requirements, and large reinsurance placements may also require approval from the Group Asset Liability Committee.
Concentration risk Processes are in place to manage catastrophe risk in individual business units and at a Group level.
The Group cedes much of its worldwide catastrophe risk to third party reinsurers but retains a pooled element for its own account gaining diversification benefit.
The total Group potential loss from its most concentrated catastrophe exposure Northern European windstorm is approximately 335 million, for a one in ten year annual loss scenario, compared to approximately 620 million when measured on a one in a hundred year annual loss scenario.
For the 2010 underwriting year the Group will participate in a share of a reinsurers US property catastrophe reinsurance portfolio.
This exposure is not correlated with the Groups other General Insurance exposure and therefore provides diversification benefit.
The total expected loss from a one in ten year annual loss scenario is approximately 50 million compared to approximately 145 million when measured on a one in a hundred year annual loss scenario.
266 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 56 Risk management continued f Operational risk Types of operational risk Operational risk is the risk of loss, arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, or from people and systems, or from external events.
Operational risks include business protection, information technology, people, legal and regulatory compliance risks.
Operational risk management We process a large number of complex transactions across numerous and diverse products, and are highly dependent on the proper functioning of information technology and communications systems.
We are partially reliant on the operational processing performance of our outsourced partners including certain servicing and IT functions.
The long-term nature of our business means that accurate records have to be maintained for significant periods.
Significant resources are devoted to maintaining efficient and effective operations within our framework of corporate responsibility, policies and business ethics code.
Our businesses are primarily responsible for identifying and managing operational risks in line with minimum standards of control set out in our policies.
Each operational risk is assessed by considering the potential impact and the probability of the event occurring.
Impact assessments are considered against financial, operational and reputation criteria.
Business management teams must be satisfied that all material risks falling outside our risk appetite are being mitigated, monitored and reported to an appropriate level.
Any risks with a high potential impact level are monitored centrally on a regular basis.
Businesses use key indicator data to help monitor the status of the risk and control environment.
They also identify and capture loss events: taking appropriate action to address actual control breakdowns and promote internal learning from these occurrences.
The Group Operational Risk Committee ORC oversees the Groups aggregate operational risk exposure on behalf of the Group Executive Committee and reports to the Board Risk & Regulatory Committee.
It makes recommendations on the risk appetite that the Group can work within for operational risk, assesses and monitors overall operational risk exposures, identifying any concentrations of operational risk across the Group, and in particular verifies that mitigating action plans are implemented.
The ORC operates a number of sub-committees which focus on specific areas of strategic and operational risk including customer, brand, business protection, IT, people, legal and regulatory compliance.
g Strategic risk We are exposed to a number of strategic risks.
Our strategy needs to support our vision, purpose and objectives and be responsive to both the external and internal environment, for example changes in the competitive landscape, customer behaviour, regulatory changes, merger and acquisition opportunities and emerging trends such as climate change, pandemic and improving longevity.
Strategic risk is explicitly considered throughout our strategic review and planning process.
Developments are assessed during our quarterly performance management process where all aspects of our risk profile are considered.
We closely monitor regulatory, legal and fiscal developments as well as actively engaging with external bodies to share the benefit of our expertise in supporting responses to emerging risks to challenge developments that could be damaging to our business and the industry as a whole.
h Brand and reputation risk We are dependent on the strength of our brands, the brands of our partners and our reputation with customers and agents in the sale of our products and services.
Our success and results are, to a certain extent, dependent on the strength of our brands and reputation.
As part of our ongoing One Aviva, Twice the Value strategy, we have been working to create a global Aviva brand, as well as rebrand businesses in the UK under the Aviva name.
While we as a group are well recognised, we are vulnerable to adverse market and customer perception.
We operate in an industry where integrity, customer trust and confidence are paramount.
We are exposed to the risk that litigation, employee misconduct, operational failures, the outcome of regulatory investigations, press speculation and negative publicity, disclosure of confidential client information, inadequate services, amongst others, whether or not founded, could impact our brands or reputation.
Any of our brands or our reputation could also be affected if products or services recommended by us or any of our intermediaries do not perform as expected whether or not the expectations are founded or the customers expectations for the product change.
One of the FSAs strategic objectives is to help customers get a fair deal through its treating customers fairly principle.
Examples of treating customers fairly include: products and services targeted to meet customers needs and which perform in line with what customers have been led to expect: clear information and advice where relevant : good service: and making sure there are no unfair barriers that prevent customers from getting access to their money, changing products or making a successful insurance claim.
The FSA regularly checks that we are meeting the requirement to treat our customers fairly and we make use of various metrics to assess our own performance, including customer advocacy, retention and complaints.
Failure to meet these requirements could also impact our brands or reputation.
If we do not manage successfully the perception of our brands and reputation, it could cause existing customers or agents to withdraw from our business and potential customers or agents to be reluctant or elect not to do business with us.
This would adversely impact our business and results of operations.
Financial statements IFRS 267 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 56 Risk management continued i Risk and capital management Sensitivity test analysis The Group uses a number of sensitivity test-based risk management tools to understand the volatility of earnings, the volatility of its capital requirements, and to manage its capital more efficiently.
Primarily, MCEV, ICA, and scenario analysis are used.
Sensitivities to economic and operating experience are regularly produced on all of the Groups financial performance measurements to inform the Groups decision making and planning processes, and as part of the framework for identifying and quantifying the risks that each of its business units, and the Group as a whole are exposed to.
For long-term business in particular, sensitivities of MCEV performance indicators to changes in both economic and non economic experience are continually used to manage the business and to inform the decision making process.
More information on MCEV sensitivities can be found in the presentation of results on an MCEV basis in the supplementary section of this report.
Life insurance and investment contracts The nature of long-term business is such that a number of assumptions are made in compiling these financial statements.
Assumptions are made about investment returns, expenses, mortality rates, and persistency in connection with the in-force policies for each business unit.
Assumptions are best estimates based on historic and expected experience of the business.
A number of the key assumptions for the Groups central scenario are disclosed elsewhere in these statements for both IFRS reporting and reporting under MCEV methodology.
General insurance and health business General insurance and health claim liabilities are estimated by using standard actuarial claims projection techniques.
These methods extrapolate the claims development for each accident year based on the observed development of earlier years.
In most cases, no explicit assumptions are made as projections are based on assumptions implicit in the historic claims.
Sensitivity test results Illustrative results of sensitivity testing for long-term business, general insurance and health business and the fund management and non-insurance business are set out below.
For each sensitivity test the impact of a reasonably possible change in a single factor is shown, with other assumptions left unchanged.
Sensitivity factor Description of sensitivity factor applied Interest rate and investment return The impact of a change in market interest rates by a 1% increase or decrease.
The test allows consistently for similar changes to investment returns and movements in the market value of backing fixed interest securities.
Equity property market values The impact of a change in equity property market values by 10%.
Expenses The impact of an increase in maintenance expenses by 10%.
Assurance mortality morbidity life insurance only The impact of an increase in mortality morbidity rates for assurance contracts by 5%.
Annuitant mortality life insurance only The impact of a reduction in mortality rates for annuity contracts by 5%.
Gross loss ratios non-life insurance only The impact of an increase in gross loss ratios for general insurance and health business by 5%.

The different impacts of the economic sensitivities on profit and shareholders' equity arise from classification of certain assets as available for sale in some business units, for which movements in unrealised gains or losses would be taken directly to shareholders equity.
The sensitivities to economic movements relate mainly to business in the UK, US and the Netherlands.
In general a fall in market interest rates has a beneficial impact on non-participating business and shareholders funds, due to the increase in market value of fixed interest securities and the relative durations of assets and liabilities: similarly a rise in interest rates has a negative impact.
In the US most debt securities are classified as available-for-sale, which limits the overall sensitivity of IFRS profit to interest rate movements.
The sensitivity to movements in equity and property market values relates mainly to holdings in the Netherlands, although the impact on IFRS profit is moderated by the classification of equities as available for sale.
Changes in sensitivities between 2008 and 2009 reflect movements in market interest rates, portfolio growth, changes to asset mix and the relative durations of assets and liabilities, asset liability management actions, and reattribution of inherited estate in the UK.
The mortality sensitivities relate primarily to the UK.
Financial statements IFRS 269 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 56 Risk management continued Impact of the reattribution of the inherited estate on IFRS long-term business sensitivities Prior to the reattribution of the inherited estates of CGNU Life Assurance Limited CGNU and Commercial Union Life Assurance Company Limited CULAC as detailed in note 44 b, movements in the value of assets and liabilities in the with-profit funds of CGNU and CULAC would result in corresponding movements in the value of the unallocated divisible surplus.
IFRS profit in these funds would only arise on the shareholders share of bonuses paid on claims during the year or added to policies at the end of the year.
As a result of the reattribution, movements in the value of assets and liabilities in the New With-Profit Shareholders Funds NWPSF and in the reattributed assets will lead to increased volatility of IFRS profit as the result will be borne by shareholders.
The main drivers of this increased volatility will be investment returns, the effect of writing new with-profit business in the fund, changes in the cost of guarantees and changes in assumptions.
This increase in potential volatility is the primary driver of the change in IFRS long-term business sensitivities between 2008 and 2009.
The impact on the Groups results from sensitivity to these assumptions can also be found in the MCEV sensitivities included in the alternative method of reporting long-term business profits section.

Limitations of sensitivity analysis The above tables demonstrate the effect of a change in a key assumption while other assumptions remain unchanged.
In reality, there is a correlation between the assumptions and other factors.
It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.
The sensitivity analyses do not take into consideration that the Groups assets and liabilities are actively managed.
Additionally, the financial position of the Group may vary at the time that any actual market movement occurs.
For example, the Groups financial risk management strategy aims to manage the exposure to market fluctuations.
As investment markets move past various trigger levels, management actions could include selling investments, changing investment portfolio allocation, adjusting bonuses credited to policyholders, and taking other protective action.
A number of the business units use passive assumptions to calculate their long-term business liabilities.
Consequently, a change in the underlying assumptions may not have any impact on the liabilities, whereas assets held at market value in the statement of financial position will be affected.
In these circumstances, the different measurement bases for liabilities and assets may lead to volatility in shareholder equity.
Similarly, for general insurance liabilities, the interest rate sensitivities only affect profit and equity where explicit assumptions are made regarding interest discount rates or future inflation.
Other limitations in the above sensitivity analyses include the use of hypothetical market movements to demonstrate potential risk that only represent the Groups view of possible near-term market changes that cannot be predicted with any certainty: and the assumption that all interest rates move in an identical fashion.
57 Derivative financial instruments This note gives details of the various derivative instruments we use to mitigate risk.
The Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments, including both exchange traded and over-the-counter instruments, in line with our overall risk management strategy.
The objectives include managing exposure to price, foreign currency and or interest rate risk on existing assets or liabilities, as well as planned or anticipated investment purchases.
In the narrative and tables below, figures are given for both the notional amounts and fair values of these instruments.
The notional amounts reflect the aggregate of individual derivative positions on a gross basis and so give an indication of the overall scale of the derivative transaction.
They do not reflect current market values of the open positions.
The fair values represent the gross carrying values at the year end for each class of derivative contract held or issued by the Group.
The fair values do not provide an indication of credit risk, as many over-the-counter transactions are contracted and documented under ISDA International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc master agreements or their equivalent.
Such agreements are designed to provide a legally enforceable set-off in the event of default, which reduces credit exposure.
In addition, the Group has collateral agreements in place between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties.
a Hedged derivatives The Group has formally assessed and documented the effectiveness of its hedged derivatives in accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
To aid discussion and analysis, these derivatives are analysed into cash flow, fair value and net investment hedges, as detailed below.
i Cash flow hedges The Group uses forward starting interest rate swap agreements in the United States to hedge the variability in future cash flows associated with the forecasted purchase of fixed-income assets.
These agreements reduce the impact of future interest rate changes on the forecasted transaction.
Fair value adjustments for these interest rate swaps are deferred and recorded in equity until the occurrence of the forecasted transaction, at which time the interest rate swaps will be terminated.
The accumulated gain or loss in equity will be amortised into investment income as the acquired asset affects income.
The Group is hedging its exposure to the variability of future cash flows from interest rate movements for terms up to 10 years, therefore the cash flows from these hedging instruments are expected to affect profit and loss for approximately the next 10 years.
For the year ended 31 December 2009, none of the Groups cash flow hedges was ineffective or discontinued.
The notional value of these interest rate swaps was 3 million at 31 December 2009 and their fair value was 0.1 million liability.
The Group had no cash flow hedge activity at 31 December 2008.

The notional value of these interest rate swaps was 3,060 million at 31 December 2009 2008: 1,088 million, 2007: nil and their fair value was 184 million liability 2008: 86 million liability, 2007: nil.
These hedges were fully effective during the year.
iii Net investment hedges To reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk, the Group has entered into the following net investment hedges: The Group has designated a portion of its Euro and US dollar denominated debt as a hedge of the net investment in its European and American subsidiaries.
The carrying value of the debt at 31 December 2009 was 2,806 million 2008: 2,914 million, 2007: 1,988 million and its fair value at that date was 2,709 million 2008: 1,962 million, 2007: 1,972 million.
The foreign exchange gain of 255 million 2008: loss of 716 million on translation of the debt to sterling at the statement of financial position date has been recognised in the hedging instruments reserve in shareholders equity.
This hedge was fully effective throughout the current and prior years.
The Group holds a Sterling Euro cross currency swap derivative, which has been designated as a hedge of the net investment in its European subsidiaries.
The notional value of the derivative at 31 December 2009 was 500 million 2008: 500 million, 2007: 1,000 million and its fair value at that date was 120 million liability 2008: 185 million liability, 2007: 27 million liability.
During 2008, the Group reduced the size of the notional amount from 1 billion to 500 million, realising a loss of 164 million in closing out this part of the hedge.
The fair value gain during 2009 was 65 million 2008: 158 million loss: 2007: 27 million loss on revaluation of the derivative which was recognised in other comprehensive income and the hedging instrument reserve in shareholders equity.
This hedge was fully effective throughout the year.
The losses on the Groups net investment hedges during the year were more than offset by gains on the relevant subsidiaries which are recognised in the currency translation reserve see note 34. b Non-hedge derivatives Non-hedge derivatives either do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 or the option to hedge account has not been taken.
