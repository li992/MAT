Financial Shareholder statements information Notes to the 2009 financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies Corporate information The financial statements of the Group were authorised for issue in accordance with a directors resolution on 5 March 2010.
Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited are listed and incorporated respectively on Stock Exchanges in the United Kingdom and Australia.
Rio Tinto plcs registered office is at 2 Eastbourne Terrace, London W2 6LG, United Kingdom.
Rio Tinto Limiteds registered office is at 120 Collins Street, Melbourne, Australia, 3000.
Rio Tintos business is finding, mining and processing mineral resources.
Major products are aluminium, copper, diamonds, coal, uranium, gold, industrial minerals borax, titanium dioxide, salt, talc, and iron ore. Activities span the world but are strongly represented in Australia and North America with significant businesses in South America, Asia, Europe and Africa.
Basis of preparation The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 are set out below.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards both as adopted by the EU EU IFRS and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IFRS, interpretations issued from time to time by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC adopted by the European Union that are mandatory for year ended 31 December 2009, the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law, applicable Australian law as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 27 January 2006 as amended on 22 December 2006 and Article 4 of the European Union IAS regulation.
The EU IFRS financial information has been drawn up on the basis of accounting policies consistent with those applied in the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2008, except for the following: IFRS 8 Operating segments IFRS 7 Financial instruments Disclosures amendment IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements revised IFRS 2 amendment, Share based payment Vesting conditions and cancellations Amendment to IAS 32 Financial instruments: Presentation and IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements Puttable financial instruments and obligations arising on liquidation Amendment to IAS 39 Eligible hedged items Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Reclassification of financial assets Amendment to IFRIC 9 and IAS 39 on embedded derivatives Improvements to IFRS 2008 to the extent mandatory in 2009.
This standard collates many minor changes to IFRS.
The amendments most relevant to the Group relate to the classification of derivatives which are not hedges by maturity rather than as short term and the imputation of interest on government grants.
IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes IFRIC 15 Agreements for construction of real estate IFRIC 16 Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation IFRIC 18 Transfers of assets from customers The effect of adopting the above standards and interpretations is not material to Group earnings or to shareholders funds in the current or prior year.
Therefore, prior year information has not been restated.
IFRS 7, IFRS 8 and IAS 1 revised relate to disclosure only, prior year information has been reclassified to conform with the current presentation.
The reclassifications do not affect prior year statements of financial position.
In addition, the Group has early adopted Amendment to IAS 32 Classification of rights issues.
The amendment permits rights issues to existing shareholders which allow those shareholders to receive a fixed number of shares at a fixed price in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, to be classed as equity transactions provided the offer is pro rata to all shareholders.
Prior to the amendment, such an offer was treated as giving rise to a derivative liability.
As a consequence, the US$827 million gain in the income statement which arose at the half year under the previous accounting rules has been removed with a corresponding credit to equity.
The Group has not applied the following pronouncements: those which are expected to be most relevant to the Group are IFRS 3 and IAS 27 revised.
IAS 1 amendment, Presentation of financial statements mandatory for year 2010 IAS 27 revised Consolidated and separate financial statements mandatory for year 2010.
The standard requires the effects of all increases or decreases in the ownership of subsidiaries to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control.
They will therefore no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses.
The standard also specifies the accounting when control is lost.
Any remaining interest in the company is re-measured to fair value and a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
IAS 38 amendment, Intangible Assets mandatory for year 2010 www.
com 137 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued IFRS 3 amendment Business combinations mandatory for business combinations after 1 January 2010.
Under the revised standard, all payments to purchase a business are to be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date with contingent payments classified as debt subsequently re-measured through the income statement.
All acquisition related costs should be expensed.
When a business is acquired in which the Group previously held a non-controlling stake, or the Group increases its stake in a business which it does not control, the existing stake is re-measured to fair value at the date of acquisition.
Any difference between fair value and carrying value is taken to the income statement.
IFRS 5 amendment, Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations mandatory for year 2010 Eligible Hedged Items an amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement mandatory for year 2010 IFRIC 17 Non cash distributions to owners mandatory for year 2010 Standards and interpretations not yet endorsed by the European Union IFRS 2 Share based payment Group cash settled share based payment transactions mandatory for year 2010 Improvements to IFRS 2009 mandatory for year 2010.
This standard collates further minor changes to IFRS Amendment to IFRIC 14, IAS 19 Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement mandatory for year 2011 Amendment to IAS 24 Related party disclosures mandatory for year 2011 IFRIC 19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments mandatory for year 2011 IFRS 9, Financial instruments mandatory for year 2013 The Group is evaluating the impact of the above pronouncements.
The above changes are not expected to be material to the Groups earnings or to shareholders funds.
Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty Many of the amounts included in the financial statements involve the use of judgement and or estimation.
These judgements and estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to previous experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements.
Information about such judgements and estimation is contained in the accounting policies and or the Notes to the financial statements, and the key areas are summarised below.
Areas of judgement that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are: Merger accounting for the 1995 merger of the economic interests of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited into the dual listed companies DLC structure page 136. Review of asset carrying values and impairment charges and reversals note 1 e and i, note 5 and note 11 Estimation of asset lives, note 1 e and i Determination of ore reserve estimates note 1 j Close down, restoration and clean up obligations note 1 k Deferral of stripping costs note 1 h Recognition of deferred tax on mineral rights recognised in acquisitions note 1 m Capitalisation of exploration and evaluation costs note 1 f Identification of functional currencies note 1 d The definition of Underlying earnings note 2 Acquisitions note 1 b Key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: Review of asset carrying values and impairment charges and reversals note 1 e and i, note 5 and note 11 Estimation of close down and restoration costs and the timing of expenditure note 1 k and note 27 Estimation of environmental clean up costs and the timing of expenditure note 1 k and note 27 Estimation of liabilities for post retirement costs note 50 Recoverability of potential deferred tax assets note 1 m and note 18 d Contingencies note 35 These areas of judgement and estimation are discussed further on page 149. a Accounting convention The financial information included in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009, and for the related comparative period, has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain derivative contracts, financial assets and post retirement assets and liabilities.
The Groups policy in respect of these items is set out in the notes below.
b Basis of consolidation The financial statements consist of the consolidation of the accounts of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited together the Companies and their respective subsidiaries together the Group.
All intragroup balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits or losses, including unrealised profits arising from intragroup transactions, have been eliminated on consolidation.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
138 Rio Tinto 2009 Annual report Financial Shareholder statements information Subsidiaries: Subsidiaries are entities over which the Companies have the power to govern the financial and operating policies in order to obtain benefits from their activities.
Control is presumed to exist where the Companies own more than one half of the voting rights which does not always equate to percentage ownership unless it can be demonstrated that ownership does not constitute control.
Control does not exist where other parties hold veto rights over significant operating and financial decisions.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The consolidated financial statements include all the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the Companies and their subsidiaries after eliminating intragroup transactions as noted above.
For partly owned subsidiaries, the allocation of net assets and net earnings to outside shareholders is shown in the line Amounts attributable to outside equity shareholders on the face of the Group statement of financial position and Group income statement.
Associates: An associate is an entity, that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture, over whose operating and financial policies the Group exercises significant influence.
Significant influence is presumed to exist where the Group has between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting rights, but can also arise where the Group holds less than 20 per cent if it has the power to be actively involved and influential in policy decisions affecting the entity.
The Groups share of the net assets, post tax results and reserves of associates are included in the financial statements using the equity accounting method.
This involves recording the investment initially at cost to the Group, which therefore includes any goodwill on acquisition, and then, in subsequent periods, adjusting the carrying amount of the investment to reflect the Groups share of the associates results less any impairment of goodwill and any other changes to the associates net assets such as dividends.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the associates.
Joint ventures: A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control such that significant operating and financial decisions require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
In some situations, joint control exists even though the Group has an ownership interest of more than 50 per cent because of the veto rights held by joint venture partners.
The Group has two types of joint ventures: Jointly controlled entities JCEs : A JCE is a joint venture that involves the establishment of a corporation, partnership or other entity in which each venturer has a long term interest.
JCEs are accounted for using the equity accounting method.
In addition, for both associates and jointly controlled entities, the carrying value will include any long term debt interests that in substance form part of the Groups net investment.
Jointly controlled assets JCAs : A JCA is a joint venture in which the venturers have joint control over the assets contributed to or acquired for the purposes of the joint venture.
JCAs do not involve the establishment of a corporation, partnership or other entity.
This includes situations where the participants derive benefit from the joint activity through a share of the production, rather than by receiving a share of the results of trading.
The Groups proportionate interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of JCAs are incorporated into the Groups financial statements under the appropriate headings.
The Group uses the term Equity accounted units to refer to associates and jointly controlled entities collectively.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the results of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
Acquisitions On the acquisition of a subsidiary, the purchase method of accounting is used whereby the purchase consideration is allocated to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities identifiable net assets of the subsidiary on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition.
Provisional fair values allocated at a reporting date are finalised within twelve months of the acquisition date.
When part or all of the amount of purchase consideration is contingent on future events, the cost of the acquisition initially recorded includes a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the contingent amounts expected to be payable in the future.
The cost of the acquisition is adjusted when revised estimates are made, with corresponding adjustments made to goodwill until the ultimate outcome is known.
The results of businesses acquired during the year are brought into the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control, joint control or significant influence commences and taken out of the financial statements from the date on which control, joint control or significant influence ceases.
Disposals Individual non current assets or disposal groups ie groups of assets and liabilities to be disposed of, by sale or otherwise in a single transaction, are classified as held for sale if the following criteria are met: the carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, and the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for such sales, and the sale is highly probable.
Disposal groups held for sale are carried at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and are presented separately on the face of the statement of financial position with the related assets and liabilities being presented as a single asset and a single liability respectively.
Comparative statement of financial position information is not restated.
Disposal groups acquired with a view to resale are held at fair value determined at the acquisition date and no profits or losses are recognised between acquisition date and disposal date.
com 139 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Disposals continued For a disposal group held for sale that continues to be carried at its carrying amount, the profit on disposal, calculated as net sales proceeds less the carrying amount, is recognised in the income statement in the period during which control passes to the buyer.
Where the fair value less costs to sell of a disposal group is lower than the carrying amount at the time of classification as held for sale, the resulting charge is recognised in the income statement in that period.
On classification as held for sale, the assets are no longer depreciated.
When the fair value less costs to sell of a disposal group falls below the carrying amount during the period in which it is classified as held for sale, the charge is included in the income statement at that time.
If the disposal group or groups represent a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or are part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or are subsidiaries acquired exclusively with a view to resale, they are classified as discontinued operations.
The net results attributable to such discontinued operations are shown separately and comparative figures in the income and cash flow statements are restated.
The Group accounts for transactions with outside equity shareholders using the parent company model.
Under this model, acquisitions of an outside equity shareholders interest will generally give rise to additional goodwill and a disposal will give rise to a profit or loss in the income statement.
c Sales revenue Sales revenue comprises sales to third parties at invoiced amounts, with most sales being priced ex works, free on board f. o. b. or cost, insurance and freight c. i. f..
Amounts billed to customers in respect of shipping and handling are classed as sales revenue where the Group is responsible for carriage, insurance and freight.
All shipping and handling costs incurred by the Group are recognised as operating costs.
If the Group is acting solely as an agent, amounts billed to customers are offset against the relevant costs.
Revenue from services is recognised as services are rendered and accepted by the customer.
Sales revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes.
Mining royalties are presented as an operating cost or, where they are in substance a profit based tax, within taxes.
Gross sales revenue disclosed as part of the income statement includes the Groups share of the sales revenue of equity accounted units.
To avoid duplication, this excludes sales by jointly controlled entities to third parties of products purchased from the Group and sales by jointly controlled entities of products to the Group for onward sale to third parties.
It also excludes charges by jointly controlled entities to the Group.
Co-product revenues are included in sales revenue.
A large proportion of Group production is sold under medium to long term contracts, but sales revenue is only recognised on individual sales when persuasive evidence exists that all of the following criteria are met: the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product have been transferred to the buyer: neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership, nor effective control over the goods sold, has been retained: the amount of revenue can be measured reliably: it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the sale will flow to the Group: and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the sale can be measured reliably.
These conditions are generally satisfied when title passes to the customer.
In most instances sales revenue is recognised when the product is delivered to the destination specified by the customer, which is typically the vessel on which it will be shipped, the destination port or the customers premises.
Sales revenue is commonly subject to adjustment based on an inspection of the product by the customer.
In such cases, sales revenue is initially recognised on a provisional basis using the Groups best estimate of contained metal, and adjusted subsequently.
Certain products are provisionally priced, ie the selling price is subject to final adjustment at the end of a period normally ranging, from 30 to 180 days after delivery to the customer, based on the market price at the relevant quotation point stipulated in the contract.
As is customary in the industry, revenue on provisionally priced sales is recognised based on estimates of the fair value of the consideration receivable based on forward market prices.
At each reporting date provisionally priced metal is marked to market based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the contract.
For this purpose, the selling price can be measured reliably for those products, such as copper, for which there exists an active and freely traded commodity market such as the London Metals Exchange and the value of product sold by the Group is directly linked to the form in which it is traded on that market.
The marking to market of provisionally priced sales contracts is recorded as an adjustment to sales revenue.
Information on provisionally priced sales contracts is included in note 33.
Certain other of the Groups products, such as iron ore, are sold under long term contracts at a benchmark price which is agreed annually.
Where the benchmark price has not been finally agreed at the end of an accounting period, revenue is estimated based on the best available information, having reference to the terms of the contractual agreement and, where appropriate, to sales with other customers.
140 Rio Tinto 2009 Annual report Financial Shareholder statements information d Currency translation The functional currency for each entity in the Group, and for jointly controlled entities and associates, is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
For many entities, this is the currency of the country in which they operate.
Transactions denominated in other currencies are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction unless hedge accounting applies, in which case the contract rate is used.
Generally, this applies when derivatives or embedded derivatives are designated as cashflow hedges of the Groups sales.
The Groups accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting are explained in more detail in note p iii below.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at year end exchange rates.
The US dollar is the currency in which the Groups Financial statements are presented, as it most reliably reflects the global business performance of the Group as a whole.
On consolidation, income statement items are translated from the functional currency into US dollars at average rates of exchange.
Statement of financial position items are translated into US dollars at year end exchange rates.
Exchange differences on the translation of the net assets of entities with functional currencies other than the US dollar, and any offsetting exchange differences on net debt hedging those net assets, are recognised directly in the foreign currency translation reserve via the statement of comprehensive income net of translation adjustments relating to Rio Tinto Limiteds share capital.
Exchange gains and losses which arise on balances between Group entities are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve where the intragroup balance is, in substance, part of the Groups net investment in the entity.
The balance of the foreign currency translation reserve relating to an operation that is disposed of is transferred to the income statement at the time of the disposal.
The Group finances its operations primarily in US dollars but part of the Groups US dollar debt is located in subsidiaries having functional currencies other than the US dollar.
Except as noted above, exchange gains and losses relating to such US dollar debt are charged or credited to the Groups income statement in the year in which they arise.
This means that the impact of financing in US dollars on the Groups income statement is dependent on the functional currency of the particular subsidiary where the debt is located.
Exchange differences arising on closure provisions are capitalised at operating mines.
Except as noted above, or in note p below relating to derivative contracts, all other exchange differences are charged or credited to the income statement in the year in which they arise.
e Goodwill and intangible assets excluding exploration and evaluation expenditure Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is initially determined based on provisional fair values.
Fair values are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is separately disclosed and goodwill on acquisitions of associates and JCEs is included within investments in equity accounted units.
For non wholly owned subsidiaries, interests attributable to outside equity shareholders are initially recorded based on the proportion of the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised at acquisition attributable to outside equity shareholders.
Where the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquired companys identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds costs, the values assigned are reassessed.
Any excess after that reassessment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
In 1997 and previous years, goodwill was eliminated against reserves in the year of acquisition as a matter of accounting policy, as was then permitted under UK GAAP.
Such goodwill was not reinstated under subsequent UK accounting standards or on transition to IFRS.
Goodwill is not amortised: rather it is tested annually for impairment.
Goodwill is allocated to the cash generating unit or group of cash generating units expected to benefit from the related business combination for the purposes of impairment testing which is carried out in accordance with accounting policy note 1 i.
Goodwill impairments cannot be reversed.
Investments in equity accounted units are tested for impairment as a single asset.
Goodwill included in the Groups investment in equity accounted units is not tested on an annual basis therefore but only as part of the Groups overall testing for impairment when a trigger for impairment has been identified.
Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights, and the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition.
Purchased intangible assets are initially recorded at cost and finite life intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line or units of production basis, as appropriate.
Intangible assets having indefinite lives and intangible assets that are not yet ready for use are not amortised and are reviewed annually for impairment in accordance with accounting policy note 1 i. Intangible assets are considered to have indefinite lives when, based on an analysis of all of the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate cash flows for the Group.
The factors considered in making this determination include the existence of contractual rights for unlimited terms: or evidence that renewal of the contractual rights without significant incremental cost can be expected for indefinite periods into the future in view of the Groups future investment intentions.
The life cycles of the products and processes that depend on the asset are also considered.
Where amortisation is calculated on a straight line basis, the following useful lives have been determined for classes of intangible assets: Trademark, patented and non patented technology Trademarks: 14 to 20 years Patented and non patented technology: 10 to 20 years www.
com 141 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Other intangible assets Internally generated intangible assets and computer software: 2 to 5 years Other intangible assets: 2 to 20 years Contract based intangible assets Power contracts: 2 to 39 years Other purchase and customer contracts: 5 to 15 years f Exploration and evaluation Exploration and evaluation expenditure comprises costs that are directly attributable to: researching and analysing existing exploration data: conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling: examining and testing extraction and treatment methods: and or compiling pre-feasibility and feasibility studies.
Exploration expenditure relates to the initial search for deposits with economic potential.
Evaluation expenditure arises from a detailed assessment of deposits or other projects that have been identified as having economic potential.
Expenditure on exploration activity is not capitalised.
Capitalisation of evaluation expenditure commences when there is a high degree of confidence in the projects viability and hence it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group.
The carrying values of capitalised evaluation amounts are reviewed twice per annum by management and the results of these reviews are reported to the Audit committee.
In the case of undeveloped projects, there may be only inferred resources to form a basis for the impairment review.
The review is based on a status report regarding the Groups intentions for development of the undeveloped project.
In some cases, the undeveloped projects are regarded as successors to ore bodies, smelters or refineries currently in production.
Where this is the case, it is intended that these will be developed and go into production when the current source of ore is exhausted or to replace the reduced output, which results where existing smelters and or refineries are closed.
It is often the case that technological and other improvements will allow successor smelters and or refineries to more than replace the capacity of their predecessors.
Subsequent recovery of the resulting carrying value depends on successful development or sale of the undeveloped project.
If a project does not prove viable, all irrecoverable costs associated with the project net of any related impairment provisions are written off.
g Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the estimated close down and restoration costs associated with the asset.
Once a mining project has been established as commercially viable, expenditure other than that on land, buildings, plant and equipment is capitalised under Mining properties and leases together with any amount transferred from Exploration and evaluation.
In open pit mining operations, it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste materials to access ore from which minerals can be extracted economically.
The process of mining overburden and waste materials is referred to as stripping.
During the development of a mine or pit, before production commences, stripping costs are capitalised as part of the investment in construction of the mine.
Costs associated with commissioning new assets, in the period before they are capable of operating in the manner intended by management, are capitalised.
Development costs incurred after the commencement of production are capitalised to the extent they are expected to give rise to a future economic benefit.
Interest on borrowings related to construction or development projects is capitalised until the point when substantially all the activities that are necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use are complete.
h Deferred stripping As noted above, stripping costs incurred in the development of a mine or pit before production commences are capitalised as part of the cost of constructing the mine or pit and subsequently amortised over the life of the mine or pit on a units of production basis.
Where a mine operates several open pits that are regarded as separate operations for the purpose of mine planning, stripping costs are accounted for separately by reference to the ore from each separate pit.
If, however, the pits are highly integrated for the purpose of mine planning, the second and subsequent pits are regarded as extensions of the first pit in accounting for stripping costs.
In such cases, the initial stripping ie overburden and other waste removal of the second and subsequent pits is considered to be production phase stripping relating to the combined operation.
The Groups determination of whether multiple pit mines are considered separate or integrated operations depends on each mines specific circumstances.
The following factors would point towards the stripping costs for the individual pits being accounted for separately: If mining of the second and subsequent pits is conducted consecutively with that of the first pit, rather than concurrently.
If separate investment decisions are made to develop each pit, rather than a single investment decision being made at the outset.
If the pits are operated as separate units in terms of mine planning and the sequencing of overburden and ore mining, rather than as an integrated unit.
142 Rio Tinto 2009 Annual report Financial Shareholder statements information If expenditures for additional infrastructure to support the second and subsequent pits are relatively large.
If the pits extract ore from separate and distinct ore bodies, rather than from a single ore body.
This additional factor would point to an integrated operation in accounting for stripping costs: If the designs of the second and subsequent pits are significantly influenced by opportunities to optimise output from the several pits combined, including the co-treatment or blending of the output from the pits.
The relative importance of each of the above factors is considered in each case to determine whether, on balance, the stripping costs should be attributed to the individual pit or to the combined output from the several pits.
As this analysis requires judgment another company could make the determination that a mine is separate or integrated differently than the Group, even if the fact pattern appears to be similar.
To the extent the determination is different, the resulting accounting would also be different.
The Group defers stripping costs incurred subsequently, during the production stage of its operations, for those operations where this is the most appropriate basis for matching the costs against the related economic benefits and the effect is material.
This is generally the case where there are fluctuations in stripping costs over the life of the mine or pit.
The amount of stripping costs deferred is based on the ratio Ratio obtained by dividing the tonnage of waste mined either by the quantity of ore mined or by the quantity of minerals contained in the ore.
Stripping costs incurred in the period are deferred to the extent that the current period Ratio exceeds the life of mine or pit Ratio.
Such deferred costs are then charged against reported profits to the extent that, in subsequent periods, the current period Ratio falls short of the life of mine or pit Ratio.
The life of mine or pit Ratio is based on proved and probable reserves of the mine or pit.
The life of mine or pit waste-to-ore ratio is a function of the pit design s and therefore changes to that design will generally result in changes to the Ratio.
Changes in other technical or economic parameters that impact on reserves will also have an impact on the life of mine or pit Ratio even if they do not affect the pit design s. Changes to the life of mine or pit Ratio are accounted for prospectively.
In the production stage of some mines or pits, further development of the mine or pit requires a phase of unusually high overburden removal activity that is similar in nature to pre-production mine development.
The costs of such unusually high overburden removal activity are deferred and charged against reported profits in subsequent periods on a units of production basis.
This accounting treatment is consistent with that for stripping costs incurred during the development phase of a mine or pit, before production commences.
If the Group were to expense production stage stripping costs as incurred, there would be greater volatility in the year to year results from operations and excess stripping costs would be expensed at an earlier stage of a mines operation.
Deferred stripping costs are included in Mining properties and leases within property, plant and equipment or in investments in equity accounted units, as appropriate.
These form part of the total investment in the relevant cash generating unit, which is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Amortisation of deferred stripping costs is included in net operating costs or in the Groups share of the results of its equity accounted units, as appropriate.
i Depreciation and impairment Depreciation of non current assets Property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life, or over the remaining life of the mine if shorter.
Depreciation commences when an asset is available for use.
The major categories of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a units of production and or straight-line basis as follows: Units of production basis For mining properties and leases and certain mining equipment, the economic benefits from the asset are consumed in a pattern which is linked to the production level.
Except as noted below, such assets are depreciated on a units of production basis.
Straight line basis Assets within operations for which production is not expected to fluctuate significantly from one year to another or which have a physical life shorter than the related mine are depreciated on a straight line basis as follows: Land and Buildings Land Not depreciated Buildings 5 to 50 years Plant and equipment Other plant and equipment 3 to 35 years Power assets 25 to 100 years Capital work in progress Not depreciated Residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date.
Changes to the estimated residual values or useful lives are accounted for prospectively.
In applying the units of production method, depreciation is normally calculated using the quantity of material extracted from the mine in the period as a percentage of the total quantity of material to be extracted in current and future periods based on proved and probable reserves and, for some mines, other mineral resources.
Such non reserve material may be included in depreciation calculations in limited circumstances and where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction.
Development costs that relate to a discrete section of an ore body and which only provide benefit over the life of those reserves, are depreciated over the estimated life of that discrete section.
Development costs incurred which benefit the entire ore body are depreciated over the estimated life of the ore body.
com 143 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued i Depreciation and impairment continued Impairment of non current assets Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment if there is any indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Impairment is normally assessed at the level of cash-generating units which, in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, are identified as the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows, which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets.
In addition, an impairment loss is recognised for any excess of carrying amount over the fair value less costs to sell of a non current asset or disposal group held for sale.
Goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or at any time during the year if an indicator of impairment is considered to exist.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the related business combination.
The groups of cash-generating units represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and these groups are not larger than the reporting segments determined in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating segments.
When an impairment review is undertaken, recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of value in use being the net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant cash generating unit and fair value less costs to sell fair value.
The best evidence of fair value is the value obtained from an active market or binding sale agreement.
Where neither exists, fair value is based on the best information available to reflect the amount the Group could receive for the cash generating unit in an arms length transaction.
This is often estimated using discounted cash flow techniques.
Where recoverable amount is assessed using discounted cash flow techniques, the resulting estimates are based on detailed mine and or production plans.
For value in use, recent cost levels are considered, together with expected changes in costs that are compatible with the current condition of the business and which meet the requirements of IAS 36.
The cash flow forecasts are based on best estimates of expected future revenues and costs, including the future cash costs of production, capital expenditure, close down, restoration and environmental clean up.
These may include net cash flows expected to be realised from extraction, processing and sale of mineral resources that do not currently qualify for inclusion in proved or probable ore reserves.
Such non reserve material is included where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction.
This expectation is usually based on preliminary drilling and sampling of areas of mineralisation that are contiguous with existing reserves.
Typically, the additional evaluation to achieve reserve status for such material has not yet been done because this would involve incurring costs earlier than is required for the efficient planning and operation of the mine.
Where the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is dependent on the life of its associated ore body, expected future cash flows reflect long term mine plans, which are based on detailed research, analysis and iterative modelling to optimise the level of return from investment, output and sequence of extraction.
The mine plan takes account of all relevant characteristics of the ore body, including waste to ore ratios, ore grades, haul distances, chemical and metallurgical properties of the ore impacting on process recoveries and capacities of processing equipment that can be used.
The mine plan is therefore the basis for forecasting production output in each future year and for forecasting production costs.
The Groups cash flow forecasts are based on estimates of future commodity prices, which assume market prices will revert to the Groups assessment of the long term average price, generally over a period of three to five years.
These long term commodity prices, for most commodities, are derived from an analysis of the marginal costs of the producers of these commodities.
These assessments often differ from current price levels and are updated periodically.
For the long run, the Group does not believe that forward prices quoted in the metals markets provide a good indication of future price levels since forward prices tend to be strongly influenced by spot price levels.
In some cases, prices applying to some part of the future sales volumes of a cash generating unit are predetermined by existing sales contracts.
The effects of such contracts are taken into account in forecasting future cash flows.
The discount rates applied to the future cash flow forecasts represent an estimate of the rate the market would apply having regard to the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.
The Groups weighted average cost of capital is used as a starting point for determining the discount rates, with appropriate adjustments for the risk profile of the countries in which the individual cash generating units operate.
For operations with a functional currency other than the US dollar, the impairment review is undertaken in the relevant functional currency.
The great majority of the Groups sales are based on prices denominated in US dollars.
To the extent that the currencies of countries in which the Group produces commodities strengthen against the US dollar without commodity price offset, cash flows and, therefore, net present values are reduced.
When calculating value in use, IAS 36 requires that calculations should be based on exchange rates current at the time of the assessment.
Non financial assets other than goodwill that have suffered an impairment are tested for possible reversal of the impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment may have reversed.
144 Rio Tinto 2009 Annual report Financial Shareholder statements information j Determination of ore reserve estimates The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by Competent Persons as defined in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves of December 2004 the JORC code.
Reserves, and for certain mines, other mineral resources, determined in this way are used in the calculation of depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges, the assessment of life of mine stripping ratios and for forecasting the timing of the payment of close down and restoration costs and clean up costs.
In assessing the life of a mine for accounting purposes, mineral resources are only taken into account where there is a high degree of confidence of economic extraction.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves, and assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available.
Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, production costs or recovery rates may change the economic status of reserves and may, ultimately, result in the reserves being restated.
k Provisions for close down and restoration and for environmental clean up costs Close down and restoration costs include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure and the removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas.
Estimated close down and restoration costs are provided for in the accounting period when the obligation arising from the related disturbance occurs, whether this occurs during the mine development or during the production phase, based on the net present value of estimated future costs.
Provisions for close down and restoration costs do not include any additional obligations which are expected to arise from future disturbance.
The costs are estimated on the basis of a closure plan.
The cost estimates are updated annually during the life of the operation to reflect known developments, eg revisions to cost estimates and to the estimated lives of operations, and are subject to formal review at regular intervals.
Close down and restoration costs are a normal consequence of mining, and the majority of close down and restoration expenditure is incurred at the end of the life of the mine.
Although the ultimate cost to be incurred is uncertain, the Groups businesses estimate their respective costs based on feasibility and engineering studies using current restoration standards and techniques.
The amortisation or unwinding of the discount applied in establishing the net present value of provisions is charged to the income statement in each accounting period.
The amortisation of the discount is shown as a financing cost, rather than as an operating cost.
The initial closure provision together with other movements in the provisions for close down and restoration costs, including those resulting from new disturbance, updated cost estimates, changes to the estimated lives of operations and revisions to discount rates are capitalised within property, plant and equipment.
These costs are then depreciated over the lives of the assets to which they relate.
Where rehabilitation is conducted systematically over the life of the operation, rather than at the time of closure, provision is made for the estimated outstanding continuous rehabilitation work at each statement of financial position date and the cost is charged to the income statement.
Provision is made for the estimated present value of the costs of environmental clean up obligations outstanding at the statement of financial position date.
These costs are charged to the income statement.
Movements in the environmental clean up provisions are presented as an operating cost, except for the unwind of the discount which is shown as a financing cost.
Remediation procedures may commence soon after the time the disturbance, remediation process and estimated remediation costs become known, but can continue for many years depending on the nature of the disturbance and the remediation techniques.
As noted above, the ultimate cost of environmental remediation is uncertain and cost estimates can vary in response to many factors including changes to the relevant legal requirements, the emergence of new restoration techniques or experience at other mine sites.
The expected timing of expenditure can also change, for example in response to changes in ore reserves or production rates.
As a result there could be significant adjustments to the provision for close down and restoration and environmental clean up, which would affect future financial results.
l Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, primarily on a weighted average cost basis.
Average costs are calculated by reference to the cost levels experienced in the current month together with those in opening inventory.
Cost for raw materials and stores is purchase price and for partly processed and saleable products is generally the cost of production.
For this purpose the costs of production include: labour costs, materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the extraction and processing of ore: the depreciation of mining properties and leases and of property, plant and equipment used in the extraction and processing of ore: and production overheads.
Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted and is available for further processing.
If there is significant uncertainty as to when the stockpiled ore will be processed it is expensed as incurred.
Where the future processing of this ore can be predicted with confidence, eg because it exceeds the mines cut off grade, it is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
If the ore will not be processed within the 12 months after the statement of financial position date it is included within non current assets.
Work in progress inventory includes ore stockpiles and other partly processed material.
Quantities are assessed primarily through surveys and assays.
m Taxation Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on the taxable income for the year calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
It includes adjustments for tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect of previous periods.
com 145 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Temporary differences are the difference between the carrying value of an asset or liability and its tax base.
Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all temporary differences existing at the statement of financial position date with certain limited exceptions.
The main exceptions to this principle are as follows: tax payable on the future remittance of the past earnings of subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities is provided for except where the Group is able to control the remittance of profits and it is probable that there will be no remittance in the foreseeable future: deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that does not affect accounting profit or taxable profit and is not a business combination, such as on the recognition of a provision for close down and restoration costs and the related asset or on the recognition of new finance leases.
Furthermore, with the exception of the unwind of discount, deferred tax is not recognised on subsequent changes in the carrying value of such assets and liabilities, for example where the related assets are depreciated or finance leases are repaid: and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered.
Probable is defined as more likely than not.
Recoverability is assessed having regard to the reasons why the deferred tax asset has arisen and projected future taxable profits for the relevant entity or group of entities.
Deferred tax is provided in respect of fair value adjustments on acquisitions.
These adjustments may relate to assets such as mining rights that, in general, are not eligible for income tax allowances.
In such cases, the provision for deferred tax is based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its nil income tax base.
The existence of a tax base for capital gains tax purposes is not taken into account in determining the deferred tax provision relating to such mineral rights because it is expected that the carrying amount will be recovered primarily through use and not from the disposal of mineral rights.
Also, the Group is only entitled to a deduction for capital gains tax purposes if the mineral rights are sold or formally relinquished.
Current and deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
n Post employment benefits For defined benefit post employment plans, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets if any and the present value of the plan liabilities is recognised as an asset or liability on the statement of financial position.
Any asset recognised is restricted, if appropriate, to the present value of any amounts the Group expects to recover by way of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions.
Actuarial gains and losses arising in the year are taken to the statement of comprehensive income.
For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising because of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred.
Other movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the income statement, including the current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any curtailment or settlements.
The interest cost less the expected return on assets is also charged to the income statement.
The amount charged to the income statement in respect of these plans is included within operating costs or in the Groups share of the results of equity accounted units as appropriate.
The most significant assumptions used in accounting for pension plans are the long term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and the mortality assumptions.
The long term rate of return on plan assets is used to calculate interest income on pension assets, which is credited to the Groups income statement.
The discount rate is used to determine the net present value of future liabilities.
The discount rate used is the yield on high quality corporate bonds with maturity and terms that match those of the post employment obligations as closely as possible.
Where there is no developed corporate bond market in a country, the rate on government bonds is used.
Each year, the unwinding of the discount on those liabilities is charged to the Groups income statement as the interest cost.
The mortality assumption is used to project the future stream of benefit payments, which is then discounted to arrive at a net present value of liabilities.
The values attributed to plan liabilities are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
The Groups contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate.
o Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the statement of financial position, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits held on call with banks and short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are net of bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand which are shown as current liabilities on the statement of financial position.
p Financial instruments i Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, available-for-sale and held to maturity investments.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Management determines the classification of financial assets at initial recognition.
a Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Derivatives are included in this category unless they are designated as hedges.
Assets in this category are classified based on their maturity.
Generally, the Group does not acquire financial assets for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement.
146 Rio Tinto 2009 Annual report Financial Shareholder statements information b Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are classified as current assets or non current assets based on their maturity date.
Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables, other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost less any impairment.
c Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non derivatives that are either designated as available for sale or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are included in non current assets unless the Group intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the statement of financial position date.
Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the holder other than equity investments, are analysed between translation differences and other changes in the carrying amount of the security.
The translation differences are recognised in profit or loss.
Any impairment charges are also recognised in profit or loss, while other changes in fair value are recognised in equity.
When financial assets classified as available-for-sale are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are included in the income statement within net operating costs.
Dividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are also recognised in the income statement within interest receivable and similar income when the Groups right to receive payments is established.
Financial assets not carried at fair value through profit and loss are initially recognised on the trade date at fair value plus transaction costs.
Financial assets are derecognised when the investments mature or are sold, and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
ii Financial liabilities Borrowings and other financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred and are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between the amounts originally received net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period to maturity using the effective interest method.
Borrowings and other financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the statement of financial position date.
iii Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups policy with regard to Financial risk management is set out in note 33.
When the Group enters into derivative contracts these transactions are designed to reduce exposures related to assets and liabilities, firm commitments or anticipated transactions.
Commodity based contracts that meet the definition of a derivative in IAS 39 but are entered into in accordance with the Groups expected purchase or sales requirements are recognised in earnings as described in note 1 c Sales revenue above.
All other derivatives are initially recognised at their fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured subject to IAS 39 at their fair value at each statement of financial position date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether or not the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or of firm commitments fair value hedges or hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedges.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged items fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
Hedges that are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated.
Fair value hedges: Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability or firm commitment that is attributable to the hedged risk.
Where derivatives are held with different counterparties to the underlying asset or liability or firm commitment, the fair values of the derivative assets and liabilities are shown separately in the statement of financial position as there is no legal right of offset.
The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging fixed rate borrowings is recognised in the income statement within interest payable and similar charges.
com 147 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Cash flow hedges: The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within net operating costs.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the period when the hedged item affects profit or loss, for example when the forecast sale that is being hedged takes place.
The realised gain or loss relating to the effective portion of forward foreign exchange or commodity contracts hedging sales is recognised in the income statement within sales revenue.
When the forecast transaction that is being hedged results in the recognition of a non financial asset the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and adjust the cost of the asset.
The gains and losses are recognised subsequently in the income statement within net operating costs when the non financial asset is amortised.
When a cash flow hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a cash flow hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, although the forecasted transaction is still expected to occur, any cumulative gain or loss relating to the instrument which is held in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
When a fair value interest rate hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a fair value interest rate hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value adjustments which have been made to the hedged item are amortised through the income statement over its remaining life.
iii Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting continued Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting: Any derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting, are marked to market at the statement of financial position date.
In respect of currency swaps, the gain or loss on the swap and offsetting gain or loss on the financial asset or liability against which the swap forms an economic hedge are shown in separate lines in the income statement within the lines net gains losses on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting and net exchange gains losses on external debt and intragroup balances.
In respect of other derivatives, the mark to market may give rise to charges or credits to the income statement in periods before the transaction against which the derivative is held as an economic hedge is recognised.
These charges or credits would be recognised in the line net gains losses on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting.
Embedded derivatives: Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to their host contracts.
In some cases, the embedded derivatives may be designated as hedges and will be accounted for as described above.
iv Fair value Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties.
Where relevant market prices are available, these have been used to determine fair values.
In other cases, fair values have been calculated using quotations from independent financial institutions, or by using valuation techniques consistent with general market practice applicable to the instrument.
a The fair values of cash, short term borrowings and loans to joint ventures and associates approximate to their carrying values, as a result of their short maturity or because they carry floating rates of interest.
b The fair values of medium and long term borrowings is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows using an appropriate market based yield curve.
The carrying value of the borrowings is amortised cost.
c Derivative financial assets and liabilities are carried at fair value based on published price quotations for the period for which a liquid active market exists.
Beyond this period, the Groups own assumptions are used.
The fair values of the various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 34.
Movements on the hedging reserve are disclosed within note 30. v Impairment of financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets The group assesses at each statement of financial position date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
In the case of equity securities classified as available for sale, an evaluation is made as to whether a decline in fair value is significant or prolonged based on an analysis of indicators such as significant adverse changes in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the company invested in operates.
If an available-for-sale financial asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost net of any principal payment and amortisation and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement is transferred from equity to the income statement.
Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement.
Reversals of impairment losses on debt instruments are reversed through the income statement, if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
vi fide-recognition of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets A financial asset is derecognised when its contractual rights to the cash flows that comprise the financial asset expire or substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset are transferred.
148 Rio Tinto 2009 Annual report Financial Shareholder statements information Financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expired.
Gains and losses on derecognition are recognised within finance income and finance costs respectively.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a fide-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.
vii Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost reduced by any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
Indicators of impairment would include financial difficulties of the debtor, likelihood of the debtors insolvency, default in payment or a significant deterioration in credit worthiness.
Any impairment is recognised in the income statement within net operating costs.
When a trade receivable is uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against net operating costs in the income statement.
viii Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
q Share based payments The fair value of cash settled share plans is recognised as a liability over the vesting period of the awards.
Movements in that liability between accounting dates are recognised as an expense.
The grant date fair value of the awards is determined from the market value of the shares at the date of award and adjusted for any market based vesting conditions attached to the award eg relative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance.
Fair values are subsequently re-measured at each accounting date to reflect the market value of shares at the measurement date and, where relevant, the number of awards expected to vest based on the current and anticipated TSR performance.
If any awards are ultimately settled in shares, the liability is transferred directly to equity as part of the consideration for the equity instruments issued.
The Groups equity-settled share plans are settled either by the issue of shares by the relevant parent company, by the purchase of shares on market or by the use of shares previously acquired as part of a share buyback.
The fair value of the share plans recognised as an expense over the expected vesting period with a corresponding entry to retained earnings for Rio Tinto plc plans and to other reserves for Rio Tinto Limited plans.
If the cost of shares acquired to satisfy the plans exceeds the expense charged, the excess is taken to the appropriate reserve.
The fair value of the share plans is determined at the date of grant, taking into account any market based vesting conditions attached to the award eg TSR.
The Group uses fair values provided by independent actuaries calculated using a lattice based option valuation model.
Non market based vesting conditions eg earnings per share targets are taken into account in estimating the number of awards likely to vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each statement of financial position date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued.
No adjustment is made after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
Further information about the treatment of individual share based payment plans is provided in note 49. r Contingencies Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed by way of note unless their occurrence is remote.
Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statement but they are disclosed by way of note if they are deemed probable.
s Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any group company purchases the Groups equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes is deducted from equity attributable to Rio Tintos equity shareholders.
Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to Rio Tintos equity shareholders.
Critical accounting policies and estimates i Dual listed company reporting As explained in detail in the Outline of Dual Listed Companies Structure and basis of financial statements section on page 136, the consolidated financial statements of the Rio Tinto Group deal with the results, assets and liabilities of both of the dual listed companies, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited, and their subsidiaries.
In other words, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited are viewed as a single parent company with their respective shareholders being the shareholders in that single company.
The 2009 Annual report satisfies the obligations of Rio Tinto Limited to prepare consolidated accounts under Australian company law, as amended by an order issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on 27 January 2006 as amended on 22 December 2006.
The 2009 Financial statements disclose the effect of the adjustments to consolidated EU IFRS profit, consolidated total comprehensive income and consolidated shareholders funds for the Group that would be required under the version of IFRS that is applicable in Australia Australian IFRS.
The US dollar is the presentation currency used in these financial statements, as it most reliably reflects the Groups global business performance.
com 149 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued ii Asset carrying values Events or changes in circumstances can give rise to significant impairment charges or reversals of impairment provisions in a particular year.
When such events or changes in circumstances impact on a particular asset or cash generating unit, its carrying value is assessed by reference to its recoverable amount, being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use being the net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant cash generating unit.
Where the recoverable amounts of Group cash generating units are assessed by analyses of discounted cash flows, the resulting valuations are particularly sensitive to changes in long term commodity prices: exchange rates: operating costs: and discount rates.
To the extent that the currencies of countries in which the Group produces commodities strengthen against the US dollar without commodity price offset: cash flows and, therefore, net present values are reduced.
Management considers that over the long term, there is a tendency for movements in commodity prices to compensate to some extent for movements in the value of the US dollar and vice versa.
However, such compensating changes are not synchronised and do not fully offset each other.
Reviews of carrying values relate to cash generating units which, in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, are identified as the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows, which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets.
In some cases, the business units within the product groups consist of several operations with independent cash generating streams, which therefore constitute separate cash generating units.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to groups of cash generating units that are being managed as a combined business.
These groups of cash generating units represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and these groups are not larger than the Groups reporting segments, which are its product groups.
The cash flow forecasts are based on best estimates of expected future revenues and costs.
These may include net cash flows expected to be realised from extraction, processing and sale of mineralised material that does not currently qualify for inclusion in proven or probable ore reserves.
Rio Tintos cash flow forecasts are based on assessments of expected long term commodity prices, which for most commodities are derived from an analysis of the marginal costs of the producers of the relevant commodities.
These assessments often differ from current price levels and are updated regularly.
As denoted above, cost levels incorporated in the cash flow forecasts are based on the current long term mine plan or long term production plan for the cash generating unit.
For value in use calculations used in impairment reviews, recent cost levels are considered, together with expected changes in costs that are compatible with the current condition of the business.
Because future cash flows are estimates for the asset in its current condition, value in use does not reflect future cash flows associated with improving or enhancing an assets performance.
The useful lives of the major assets of a cash generating unit are often dependent on the life of the ore body to which they relate.
Where this is the case, the lives of mining properties, and their associated refineries, concentrators and other long lived processing equipment generally relate to the expected life of the ore body.
The life of the ore body, in turn, is estimated on the basis of the long term mine plan.
Where the major assets of a cash generating unit are not dependent on the life of a related ore body, management applies judgement in estimating the remaining service potential of long lived assets.
In the case of smelters, factors affecting the remaining service potential include smelter technology and electricity contracts when the power is not sourced from the companys own electricity generating capacity.
Forecast cash flows are discounted to present values using Rio Tintos weighted average cost of capital with appropriate adjustment for the risks associated with the relevant cash flows, to the extent that such risks are not reflected in the forecast cash flows.
For final feasibility studies and ore reserve estimation, internal hurdle rates are used which are generally higher than the weighted average cost of capital.
Value in use and ore reserve estimates are based on the exchange rates current at the time of the evaluation.
In final feasibility studies and estimates of fair value, a forecast of the long term exchange rate is made having regard to spot exchange rates, historical data and external forecasts.
Forecast cash flows for ore reserve estimation for JORC purposes and for impairment testing are generally based on Rio Tintos long term price forecasts.
For Aluminium, the prices used fall within the range of analysts long term consensus forecasts current around the date of the evaluation.
150 Rio Tinto 2009 Annual report Financial Shareholder statements information All goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet ready for use or have an indefinite life are tested annually for impairment regardless of whether there has been any change in events or circumstances.
iii Asset lives Intangible assets are considered to have indefinite lives when, based on an analysis of all of the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate cash flows for the Group.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves and assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available.
Such changes in reserves could impact on depreciation and amortisation rates, asset carrying values, deferred stripping calculations and provisions for close down, restoration and environmental clean up costs.
iv Ore reserve estimates Rio Tinto estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by Competent Persons as defined in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves of December 2004 the JORC code.
The amounts presented under EU and Australian IFRS are based on the reserves, and in some cases mineral resources, determined under the JORC code.
v Close down, restoration and clean up obligations Provision is made for environmental remediation costs when the related environmental disturbance occurs, based on the net present value of estimated future costs.
The cost estimates are calculated annually during the life of the operation to reflect known developments, eg updated cost estimates and revisions to the estimated lives of operations, and are subject to formal review at regular intervals.
The initial closure provisions together with changes, other than those arising from the unwind of the discount applied in establishing the net present value of the provision, are capitalised within property, plant and equipment and depreciated over the lives of the assets to which they relate.
Clean up costs result from environmental damage that was not a necessary consequence of mining, including remediation, compensation and penalties.
Provisions are recognised at the time the damage, remediation process and estimated remediation costs become known.
Remediation procedures may commence soon after this point in time but may continue for many years depending on the nature of the disturbance and the remediation techniques.
As noted above, the ultimate cost of environmental disturbance is uncertain and cost estimates can vary in response to many factors including changes to the relevant legal requirements, the emergence of new restoration techniques or experience at other mine sites.
The expected timing of expenditure can also change, for example in response to changes in ore reserves or production rates or economic conditions.
vi Overburden removal costs In open pit mining operations, it is necessary to remove overburden and other barren waste materials to access ore from which minerals can economically be extracted.
During the development of a mine, before production commences, it is generally accepted that stripping costs are capitalised as part of the investment in construction of the mine.
In such cases, the initial stripping of the second and subsequent pits is considered to be production phase stripping relating to the combined operation.
Stripping of waste materials continues during the production stage of the mine or pit.
Some mining companies expense these production stage stripping costs as incurred, while others defer such stripping costs.
In operations that experience material fluctuations in the ratio of waste materials to ore or contained minerals on a year to year basis over the life of the mine or pit, deferral of stripping costs reduces the volatility of the cost of stripping expensed in individual reporting periods.
Those mining companies that expense stripping costs as incurred will therefore report greater volatility in the results of their operations from period to period.
com 151 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Rio Tinto defers production stage stripping costs for those operations where this is the most appropriate basis for matching costs with the related economic benefits and the effect is material.
Stripping costs incurred in the period are deferred to the extent that the current period ratio exceeds the life of mine or pit ratio.
Such deferred costs are then charged against reported profits to the extent that, in subsequent periods, the ratio falls short of the life of mine or pit ratio.
The life of mine or pit ratio is based on the proven and probable reserves of the mine or pit and is obtained by dividing the tonnage of waste mined either by the quantity of ore mined or by the quantity of minerals contained in the ore.
In some operations, the quantity of ore is a more practical basis for matching costs with the related economic benefits where there are important co-products or where the grade of the ore is relatively stable from year to year.
The life of mine or pit waste-to-ore ratio is a function of an individual mines pit design and therefore changes to that design will generally result in changes to the ratio.
Changes in other technical or economic parameters that impact on reserves will also have an impact on the life of mine or pit ratio even if they do not affect the pit design.
Changes to the life of mine or pit ratio are accounted for prospectively.
In the production stage of some operations, further development of the mine requires a phase of unusually high overburden removal activity that is similar in nature to preproduction mine development.
The costs of such unusually high overburden removal activity are deferred and charged against reported profits in subsequent periods on a units-of-production basis.
Deferred stripping costs are included in property, plant and equipment or in investment in equity accounted units, as appropriate.
Amortisation of deferred stripping costs is included in operating costs or in the Groups share of the results of its jointly controlled entities and associates as appropriate.
During 2009, production stage stripping costs incurred by subsidiaries and equity accounted operations were US$174 million higher than the amounts charged against pre tax profit 2008: production stage costs exceeded the amounts charged against pre tax profit by US$175 million.
In addition, US$59 million of deferred stripping has been written off in 2009 as part of the Diamonds businesses impairment.
The net book value carried forward in property, plant and equipment and in investments in jointly controlled entities and associates at 31 December 2009 was US$1,171 million 2008: US$1,026 million.
Information about the stripping ratios of the business units, including equity accounted units that account for the majority of the deferred stripping balance at 31 December 2009, along with the year in which deferred stripping is expected to be fully amortised, is set out in the following table: Actual stripping ratio for the year Life of mine stripping ratio 2009 2008 2009 2008 a Kennecott Utah Copper 2020 2.13 1.98 1.21 1.24 a Grasberg Joint Venture 2015 3.42 3.27 3.00 2.87 b Diavik 2012 1.17 1.23 1.02 1.20 c Escondida 2043 0.11 0.12 0.14 0.10 Notes a Stripping ratios shown are waste to ore. b Diaviks stripping ratio is disclosed as bench cubic metre per carat.
The 2009 deferred stripping ratio is based on a dual pit commercial production A154 and A418 with the A154 open pit scheduled to end commercial production in the first quarter of 2010 and the A418 open pit scheduled to end commercial production in the third quarter of 2012. c Escondidas stripping ratio is based on waste tonnes to pounds of copper mined.
Rio Tinto Borax capitalised stripping costs as part of a distinct period of new development during the production stage of the mine.
The capitalised costs will be fully amortised in 2034. vii Deferred tax on fair value adjustments On transition to EU IFRS with effect from 1 January 2004, deferred tax was provided in respect of fair value adjustments on acquisitions in previous years.
No other adjustments were made to the assets and liabilities recognised in such prior year acquisitions and, accordingly, shareholders funds were reduced by US$720 million on transition to EU IFRS primarily as a result of deferred tax on fair value adjustments to mining rights.
In general, these mining rights are not eligible for income tax allowances.
In such cases, the provision for deferred tax was based on the difference between their carrying value and their nil income tax base.
The existence of a tax base for capital gains tax purposes was not taken into account in determining the deferred tax provision relating to such mineral rights because it is expected that the carrying amount will be recovered primarily through use and not from the disposal of the mineral rights.
For acquisitions after 1 January 2004 provision for such deferred tax on acquisition results in a corresponding increase in the amounts attributed to acquired assets and or goodwill under EU IFRS.
viii Exploration Under the Groups accounting policy, exploration and evaluation expenditure is not capitalised until the point is reached at which there is a high degree of confidence in the projects viability and it is considered probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group.
152 Rio Tinto 2009 Annual report Financial Shareholder statements information The carrying values of exploration and evaluation assets are reviewed twice per annum by management and the results of these reviews are reported to the Audit committee.
In some cases, the undeveloped projects are regarded as successors to ore bodies, smelters or refineries currently in production and may therefore benefit from existing infrastructure and equipment.
ix Functional currency The determination of functional currency affects the carrying value of non current assets included in the statement of financial position and, as a consequence, the amortisation of those assets included in the income statement.
It also impacts exchange gains and losses included in the income statement.
The functional currency for each entity in the Group, and for jointly controlled entities and associates, is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
For many of Rio Tintos entities, this is the currency of the country in which each operates.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction unless hedge accounting applies.
The US dollar is the currency in which the Groups financial statements are presented, as it most reliably reflects the global business performance of the Group as a whole.
On consolidation, income statement items are translated into US dollars at average rates of exchange.
Exchange differences on the translation of the net assets of entities with functional currencies other than the US dollar, and any offsetting exchange differences on net debt hedging those net assets, are recognised directly in the foreign currency translation reserve.
With the above exceptions, and except for derivative contracts which qualify as cash flow hedges, exchange differences are charged or credited to the income statement in the year in which they arise.
x Underlying earnings The Group presents Underlying earnings as an additional measure to provide greater understanding of the underlying business performance of its operations.
The adjustments made to net earnings to arrive at Underlying earnings are explained in note 2. xi Post retirement benefits The difference between the fair value of the plan assets if any of post retirement plans and the present value of the plan obligations is recognised as an asset or liability on the statement of financial position.
The Group has adopted the option under IAS 19 to record actuarial gains and losses directly in the Groups statement of comprehensive income.
The most significant assumptions used in accounting for post retirement plans are the long term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, the expected rate of long term inflation and the mortality assumptions.
The mortality assumption is used to project the length of time for which future pension payments will be made and the inflation assumption is used in projecting future increases in those payments.
The discount rate is used to determine the net present value of those future payments and each year the unwinding of the discount on those liabilities is charged to the Groups income statement.
Valuations are carried out using the projected unit method.
The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is determined as managements best estimate of the long term return on the major asset classes, ie equity, debt, property and other, weighted by the actual allocation of assets among the categories at the measurement date.
The expected rate of return is calculated using geometric averaging.
The sources used to determine managements best estimate of long term returns are numerous and include country specific bond yields, which may be derived from the market using local bond indices or by analysis of the local bond market, and country specific inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and analysts or governments expectations as applicable.
In particular, the Group estimates long term expected returns on equity based on the economic outlook, analysts views and those of other market commentators.
This is the most subjective of the assumptions used and it is reviewed regularly to ensure that it remains consistent with best practice.
The discount rate used in determining the service cost and interest cost charged to income is the market yield at the start of the year on high quality corporate bonds.
For countries where there is no deep market in such bonds the yield on government bonds is used.
com 153 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued xi Post retirement benefits continued For determining the present value of obligations shown on the statement of financial position, market yields at the statement of financial position date are used.
Details of the key assumptions are set out in note 50. xii Deferred tax potentially recoverable on Group tax losses The Group has carried forward losses: mainly in the UK, French and Canadian tax groups: that have the potential to reduce tax charges in future years.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised on these tax losses to the extent their recovery is probable, having regard to the projected future taxable profits of the relevant tax groups.
The possible tax assets on these losses totalled US$1,882 million at 31 December 2009 2008: US$1,000 million.
Of these, US$1,286 million have been recognised as deferred tax assets 2008: US$899 million, leaving US$596 million 2008: US$101 million unrecognised, as recovery is not considered probable.
This amount excludes unrecognised capital losses which can only be recovered against future capital gains.
Within the UK tax group, US$303 million in tax losses have been recognised as deferred tax assets 2008: US$246 million, with no amounts unrecognised.
Within the French tax group, US$419 million in tax losses have been recognised as deferred tax assets 2008: US$309 million with US$503 million unrecognised.
Within the Canadian tax group, US$393 million in tax losses have been recognised as deferred tax assets 2008: US$172 million, with no amounts unrecognised.
xiii Contingencies Disclosure is made of material contingent liabilities unless the possibility of any loss arising is considered remote.
Contingencies are disclosed in note 35. xiv Acquisition accounting On the acquisition of a subsidiary, the purchase method of accounting is used whereby the purchase consideration is allocated to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities identifiable net assets on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition.

Underlying earnings and Net earnings both represent amounts attributable to Rio Tinto shareholders.
Items a to h below are excluded from Net earnings in arriving at Underlying earnings.
a Profits arising on the disposal of interests in businesses in 2009 relate principally to sales of the Corumba iron ore mine in Brazil, the Jacobs Ranch coal mine, the sale of 52 per cent of Rio Tintos interest in Cloud Peak Energy Resources LLC CPER and are partially offset by a loss from the sale of Alcan Composites.
Profits arising on the disposal of interests in businesses in 2008 relate principally to the sales of the Cortez gold mine and the Greens Creek mine.
Profits arising on the disposal of interests in undeveloped projects which in 2009 includes gains on disposal of undeveloped potash assets in Argentina and Canada amounting to US$797 million, net of tax, are not excluded from Underlying earnings.
The 2008 profits relate principally to the disposal of the undeveloped Kintyre uranium project in Western Australia.
b Charges relating to impairment of goodwill and other non-current assets other than undeveloped projects but including discontinued operations.
The impairment charges of US$1,103 million for the year ended 31 December 2009 related mainly to Alcan Engineered Products: US$500 million, the Groups aluminium businesses: US$212 million, the Groups diamond businesses: US$348 million, and US$43 million in other impairments.
All impairments have been measured based upon an assessment of fair value.
An impairment of US$318 million 31 December 2008: US$960 million relating to the Alcan Packaging business has been recognised during the year ended 31 December 2009, and is included in Loss after tax from discontinued operations.
This impairment is based on an estimate of fair value less costs to sell, which is based on the Groups best estimate of expected proceeds to be realised on sale of Alcan Packaging, less an estimate of remaining costs to sell.
Loss after tax from discontinued operations of US$449 million 31 December 2008: US$827 million also includes a US$131 million tax charge 31 December 2008: US$133 million tax benefit relating to an increase in the Groups estimate of the tax to be paid on sale of the Alcan Packaging business.
The weak economic environment continued to put downward pressure on the sales prices for these divestment businesses and resulted in the impairment of the Alcan Packaging businesses and Alcan Engineered Products businesses.
The impairment charge related to the Groups aluminium businesses related mainly to the planned closure of certain smelters and was caused by a decrease in short term price assumptions at the date of the impairment review.
The impairment to the Groups diamond business was caused by weak demand for luxury items and increased input costs.
The impairment charge of US$7,579 million for the year ended 31 December 2008 related mainly to the Groups aluminium businesses: US$6,127 million, and Alcan Engineered Products: US$980 million.
This includes amounts relating to equity accounted units of US$15 million.
c Exchange gains and losses on US dollar debt and intragroup balances.
The 2009 tax on exchange gains and losses on external debt and intragroup balances includes tax charges on gains on US dollar denominated debt.
However, a significant proportion of the pre-tax losses on intragroup balances are not subject to tax.
The 2008 tax on exchange gains and losses on external debt and intragroup balances included a benefit of US$254 million through recovery of tax relating to prior years.
It also included a tax relief for losses on US dollar denominated debt.
The gains on intragroup balances were largely not subject to tax.
d Valuation changes on currency and interest rate derivatives which are ineligible for hedge accounting, other than those embedded in commercial contracts.
e The currency revaluation of embedded US dollar derivatives contained in contracts held by entities whose functional currency is not the US dollar.
f Valuation changes on commodity derivatives, including those embedded in commercial contracts, that are ineligible for hedge accounting, but for which there will be an offsetting change in future Group earnings.
g During 2009, the Group incurred further restructuring costs relating to the cost savings measures announced in December 2008. h Other credits and charges that, individually, or in aggregate if of a similar type, are of a nature or size to require exclusion in order to provide additional insight into underlying business performance.
During 2008, the Group incurred advisory and other costs related to the rejection by the Board of the pre-conditional takeover proposal from BHP Billiton, which was withdrawn in November 2008.
These costs totalled US$270 million net of tax in 2008 and have been excluded from Underlying earnings.
Other charges excluded from Underlying earnings in 2008 and 2009 comprise of costs relating to acquisitions, disposals and similar corporate projects.
i Exclusions from Underlying earnings relating to equity accounted units and discontinued operations are stated after tax.

The majority of the 2008 impairment charge related to goodwill US$6,621 million, property, plant and equipment US$1,222 million and intangible assets US$129 million, with the remainder relating to investments in equity accounted units.
b The 2009 impairment charge related mainly to the planned closure of certain smelters, and was caused by a decrease in short term price assumptions at the date of the impairment review.
The recoverable amount was based on fair value less costs to sell, and was assessed in line with the policy in note 1 i.
The 2008 impairment charge related mainly to the writedown of goodwill resulting from the annual impairment review, due to the deferral of growth projects following significant weakening in economic and market circumstances, and increases in input costs.
c Alcan Engineered Products is part of the Alcan group that was acquired in October 2007, and forms part of Other Operations.
It manufactures engineered or fabricated aluminium products.
On 1 December 2009, Rio Tinto announced that it had completed the sale of Alcan Composites for US$349 million.
The Groups intention is to sell the remaining businesses relating to Alcan Engineered Products.
As such, the recoverable amount has been based on fair value less costs to sell, which represents the Groups best estimate of the expected proceeds to be realised from the sale of the remaining Alcan Engineered Products businesses, less an estimate of remaining costs to sell.
The estimated proceeds are assessed in line with the policy in note 1 i.
The weak economic environment continued to put downward pressure on the sales prices for these divestment businesses and resulted in the impairment of the property, plant and equipment relating to the Alcan Engineered Products businesses.
d The specific details of the impairment review relating to Alcan Packaging are set out in note 19. e The impairment to the Groups Diamonds business during 2009 was caused by weak demand for luxury items and higher input costs.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment was assessed by reference to the fair value less costs to sell of the cash generating units CGUs.
The determination of fair value less costs to sell was based on the policy in note 1 i.
This estimate was derived from discounting projections of cash flows, using valuation assumptions that a buyer might be expected to apply.
f In 2008, full provision was made against the carrying value of the HIsmelt operation, which is within the Iron ore product group.
Operations at the Kwinana plant have been suspended and the Groups future role in developing this technology is under review, leading to doubt about the recoverability of the amount invested.

In addition, the directors of Rio Tinto announced a final dividend of 45.0 cents per share on 11 February 2010.
This is expected to result in payments of US$882 million Rio Tinto plc: US$686 million, Rio Tinto Limited US$196 million.
The dividends will be paid on 1 April 2010 to Rio Tinto plc shareholders on the register at the close of business on 26 February 2010 and to Rio Tinto Limited shareholders on the register at the close of business on 2 March 2010.
The proposed Rio Tinto Limited dividends will be franked out of existing franking credits or out of franking credits arising from the payment of income tax during 2010.
The approximate amount of the Rio Tinto Limited consolidated tax groups retained profits and reserves that could be distributed as dividends and franked out of credits, that arose from net payments of income tax in respect of periods up to 31 December 2009 after deducting franking credits expected to be utilised on the 2009 final dividend declared, is US$13,035 million.

A large component of Aluminiums carrying value relates to the former Alcan businesses purchased in 2007.
Aluminiums annual impairment review resulted in no impairment charge for 2009 2008: US$6,127 million after taxation.
The recoverable amount has been assessed by reference to fair value less costs to sell, using discounted cash flows, in line with the policy in note 1 i.
In arriving at fair value less costs to sell, a post-tax discount rate of 6.8 per cent has been applied to the post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms.
Fair value less costs to sell was determined by estimating cash flows for a period of 12 years.
The cash flow projections are based on long term production plans.
These cash flows are then aggregated with a terminal value.
The terminal value represents the value of cash flows beyond the twelfth year, incorporating an annual real term growth rate of one and a half percent, with a corresponding increase in capital expenditure to support the real term growth rate.
Aluminium benefits from a global marketplace with substantial barriers to entry and there are a limited number of competitors who are able to access effectively the key resources necessary to make aluminium.
In addition, continued global industrialisation is expected to support demand for aluminium.
The operating cost levels included in the fair value assessment are calculated based on Aluminiums long term production plans.
Price assumptions for inputs into the aluminium smelting process are based on analysis of market fundamentals and are made consistent with related output price assumptions.
Approximately, 80 per cent of Aluminiums production is located in the first half of the industry cost curve.
Aluminiums intention is to maintain and, where possible, improve its relative position on the industry cash cost curve.
The key assumptions to which the calculation of fair value less costs to sell for Aluminium is most sensitive are the long term aluminium price: the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar exchange rates against the US dollar: operating costs: and discount rates.
Cash flows for the periods included in the projections were translated into the functional currency using the Groups estimate of future exchange rates.
Future selling prices and operating costs have been estimated in line with the policy in note 1 i.
Management believes that, currently, there are no reasonably possible changes in any of the key assumptions, that would lead to the recoverable amount being below the carrying amount, except for the long term aluminium price.
The long term aluminium price used in the terminal year of the fair value calculations include a component to reflect the impact of carbon pricing.
The Groups price without this carbon element is within the range of market consensus of US$2,014 to US$2,578 per tonne, with an average of US$2,347 per tonne, in real terms.
The carbon element within the long term price used in the fair value calculations is based on a price per tonne of carbon dioxide CO emissions.
This price is also comparable to the range published by market commentators, of between 2 US$10 and US$35 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions in real terms.
The relationship between the price per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions and the price per tonne of aluminium is dependent on how many tonnes of carbon dioxide are used per tonne of aluminium produced by marginal cost smelters.
Industry data show that emissions for all producers range from about two tonnes to in excess of 15 tonnes of CO per 2 tonne of aluminium produced, depending on the primary energy source used to generate the consumed electric power.
The weighted industry average for all producers is approximately 8-10 tonnes of CO per tonne of aluminium.
The assumptions used in the Groups long term 2 aluminium price used in the terminal year imply a carbon emission intensity for the marginal producers above the weighted industry average but below the top end of the industry range.
Based on the assessment of fair value less costs to sell, the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value by approximately 21 per cent.
The calculation is highly sensitive to changes in the long term aluminium price, and an eight per cent decrease in the long term aluminium price, in isolation, would lead to the fair value less costs to sell of Aluminium being equal to its carrying amount.
However, management believe that a decrease in the long term aluminium price would have an associated beneficial impact on input costs which would, to a certain extent, offset the impact of the change in the long term aluminium price.
In addition, the assumed relationship between the long term aluminium price and the Australian and Canadian currencies provides further natural protection in the long term see also note 33 Financial risk management.
Australian Iron Ore The recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Australian Iron Ore has been assessed by reference to fair value less costs to sell.
Valuations are based on cash flow projections that incorporate best estimates of selling prices, ore grades, production rates, future sustaining capital expenditure and production costs over the life of each mine.
In line with normal practice in the mining industry, the cash flow projections are based on long term mine plans covering the expected life of each operation.
Therefore, the projections generally cover periods well in excess of five years.
Assumptions about selling prices, operating costs, exchange rates, and discount rates are particularly important in these valuations.
com 161 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 11 Goodwill continued Future selling prices and operating costs have been estimated in line with the policy in note 1 i.
Long term average selling prices are forecast taking account of estimates of the costs of producers of each commodity.
Forecasts of operating costs are based on detailed mine plans which take account of all relevant characteristics of the ore body.
Goodwill relating to Australian Iron Ore has been reviewed applying a discount rate of 6.8 per cent to the post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms.
If assessed based on pre-tax cash flows expressed in real terms, the equivalent pre-tax discount rate would be around 9.5 per cent.
There are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions, which would cause the goodwill allocated to Australian Iron Ore to be impaired.
Other The recoverability of the remaining goodwill, which is included within Other in the table above, has been assessed by reference to fair value, using assumptions consistent with those described above.
The recoverable amounts were determined to be in excess of carrying value, and there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions that would cause the remaining goodwill to be impaired by a significant amount.

b The Group benefits from certain intangible assets acquired with Alcan including power supply contracts, customer contracts and water rights.
The water rights are expected to contribute to the efficiency and cost effectiveness of operations for the foreseeable future: accordingly, these rights are considered to have indefinite lives and are not subject to amortisation.
These water rights constitute the majority of the amounts in the column of the above table entitled Contract based intangible assets.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives were provisionally valued at acquisition based on the advice of expert valuation consultants and, subsequently this valuation was finalised in 2008.
The carrying values are reviewed for impairment annually or at any time an indicator of impairment is considered to exist.
They are reviewed for impairment as part of the cash generating units to which they relate.
The water rights have been allocated to cash generating units within Aluminium.
In 2009, the recoverable amount of these cash generating units was determined based on fair value less costs to sell, using a methodology and assumptions consistent with those described in note 1 i and note 11.
No impairment of these indefinite-lived intangible assets was recognised during 2009, as the fair value less costs to sell of the related cash generating units was in excess of their carrying amounts.
In 2008, the recoverable amount of these cash generating units was determined based on value in use, using a methodology and assumptions consistent with those described in note 1 i.
No impairment of these indefinite-lived intangible assets was recognised during 2008, as the value in use of the related cash generating units was in excess of their carrying amounts.
c There are no intangible assets either pledged as security or held under restriction of title.

Packagings fair value less costs to sell represents the Groups best estimate of the expected proceeds to be realised from the sale of Packaging, less an estimate of remaining costs to sell.
This estimate is based on proceeds from the sale of the global pharmaceuticals, global tobacco, food Europe and food Asia divisions to Amcor, which was completed on 1 February 2010: proceeds from the sale of the Food Americas division to Bemis, which was announced on 6 July 2009: and an estimate of fair value less costs to sell for Packagings remaining businesses, assessed in line with the policy in note 1 i. Packagings impairment reduced the Assets held for sale line of the Groups statement of financial position.

The Syndicated bank loans were divided into four facilities, as follows: Facility A Facility B Facility C Facility D Facility amount US$ billions 15 10 5 10 Type Term Loan Revolving Revolving Term Loan Due October 2009 October 2010 October 2012 December 2012 Repayment Bullet Bullet Bullet Bullet Outstanding balance US$ billions Total At 31 December 2009 8.5 8.5 At 31 December 2008 28.0 8.9 9.1 10.0 Undrawn facilities US$ billions At 31 December 2009 2.1 5.0 At 31 December 2008 0.9 5.0 The amounts outstanding under these facilities are shown net of the unamortised costs of obtaining the facilities.
In addition to the syndicated bank loan facilities shown above, there are US$2.3 billion of unused committed bilateral banking facilities of which US$1.0 billion matures December 2011 and US$1.3 billion matures December 2012.
Facilities A and B were subject to mandatory prepayment and cancellation to the extent of the net proceeds from disposals of assets and from the raising of funds through equity or capital markets, subject to specific thresholds and conditions.
All of Facilities A and B have been repaid from the proceeds of the rights issues and disposal proceeds in 2009.
The mandatory prepayments also reduced the available limit on Facility B to US$2.1 billion at 31 December 2009.
Refer to note 48 for partial repayment of Facility D and cancellation of Facility B subsequent to year end.
The main financial covenant to which the Group is subject is the covenant contained in the Alcan facilities which requires it to maintain a ratio of net borrowings to EBITDA of no greater than 4.5 times.
A compliance certificate must be produced for this ratio on a semi annual basis.
In addition, the Facility Agreement contains restrictions on the Group, including that it be required to observe certain customary covenants including but not limited to i maintenance of authorisations: ii compliance with laws: iii change of business: iv negative pledge subject to certain carve outs : v environmental laws and licences: and vi subsidiaries incurring financial indebtedness.
At 31 December 2009, the Group is in compliance with the covenants contained in the Alcan facilities.
b Rio Tinto has a US$10 billion 2008: US$10 billion European Medium Term Note EMTN programme for the issuance of debt, of which approximately US$0.3 billion was outstanding at 31 December 2009 2008: US$0.3 billion.
The Groups EMTNs are swapped to US dollars.
The fair value of currency swap liabilities at 31 December 2009 was US$68 million 2008: US$99 million.
These are included in other financial liabilities in the statement of financial position.
Details of the major currency swaps are shown in note 34-B d. c As at 31 December 2009, US$5 billion of the fixed rate borrowings shown were swapped to floating rates 2008: none.
The fair value of interest rate swap liabilities at 31 December 2009 was US$97 million 2008: nil.
Details of the major interest rate swaps are shown in note 34-B d. In December 2008, the Group unwound interest rate swaps with a principal of US$5.9 billion to take advantage of market conditions.
US$5.0 billion of this amount was designated as a fair value hedge.
As a consequence, the fair value adjustments which had been made to the hedged debt are being amortised to the income statement over the remaining life of the debt.
At 31 December 2009, the carrying value of the debt was US$506 million 2008: US$565 million higher than the principal as a result of the unamortised fair value adjustment.
d The Groups borrowings of US$22.9 billion 2008: US$39.6 billion include some US$4.6 billion 2008: US$4.6 billion which relates to borrowings of subsidiaries that are without recourse to the Group, some of which are subject to various financial and general covenants with which the respective borrowers were in compliance as at 31 December 2009. www.

It also includes the provisions relating to the Groups cash-settled share based payment plans of US$111 million 2008: US$43 million, which are described in note 49.
Furthermore, this includes US$229 million 2008: US$118 million of provision for redundancy and severance payments.
c The Groups policy on close down and restoration costs is described in note 1 k. Close down and restoration costs are a normal consequence of mining, and the majority of close down and restoration expenditure is incurred at the end of the relevant operation.
Remaining lives of mines and infrastructure range from one to over 50 years with an average, weighted by closure provision, of around 23 years 2008: 18 years.
Provisions of US$6,916 million 2008: US$6,011 million for close down and restoration costs and environmental clean up obligations, include estimates of the effect of future inflation and have been adjusted to reflect risk.
These estimates have been discounted to their present value at an average rate of approximately four per cent per annum, being an estimate of the long term, risk free, pre-tax cost of borrowing.
Excluding the effects of future inflation, and before discounting, this provision is equivalent to some US$10.1 billion 2008: US$8.2 billion.
d Some US$505 million 2008: US$495 million of environmental clean up expenditure is expected to take place within the next five years.
The remainder includes amounts for the operation and maintenance of remediation facilities in later years.
The provision for environmental clean up expenditure includes the issue described in e below.
e In 1995, Kennecott Utah Copper KUC agreed with the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA and the State of Utah to complete certain source control projects and perform specific environmental studies regarding contamination of ground water in the vicinity of the Bingham Canyon mine.
A remedial investigation and feasibility study on the South Zone ground water contamination, completed in March 1998, identified a range of alternative measures to address this issue.
Additional studies were conducted to refine the workable alternatives.
A remedial design document was completed in 2002.
A joint proposal and related agreements with the State of Utah Natural Resource Damage Trustee, the State of Utah and the Jordan Valley Water Conservancy District were approved in 2004.
KUC entered into a formal agreement with the EPA in 2007 on the remedial action.
In September 2008, the EPA withdrew its proposal to list the Kennecott South Zone Site on the Superfund National Priorities List.
This action recognises that soil clean up work is complete and that groundwater cleanup is adequately initiated and financial assurance is in place to assure completion of the work.
f Other provisions deal with a variety of issues and include US$101 million 2008: US$103 million relating to the Rio Tinto Alcan Foundation commitment in Canada made at the time of the Alcan acquisition.
This involves payments of C$200 million over a five year period.

Rio Tintos management structure is based on the principal product groups shown above together with the global functions that support the business.
The chief executive of each product group reports to the Chief executive of Rio Tinto.
The Chief executive of Rio Tinto monitors the performance of each product group based on a number of measures including capital expenditure and operating cash flows, with Underlying earnings being the key financial performance indicator.
Interest costs and net debt are managed on a group basis.
Generally, business units are allocated to product groups based on their primary product.
The Energy product group includes both coal and uranium businesses.
The Diamonds & Minerals product group includes businesses with products such as borates, talc and titanium dioxide feedstock together with diamonds operations.
The Copper group includes certain gold operations in addition to copper.
The Aluminium group excludes Alcan Engineered Products which is included in Other Operations and Alcan Packaging which is included in Assets held for sale.
The segments differ from those reported under IAS 14 in 2008 because of changes in the Groups organisational structure.
The Diamonds & Minerals product group has been reinstated alongside the Iron Ore, Copper, Aluminium and Energy product groups.
Alcan Engineered Products was reclassified from Aluminium to Other Operations during the year.
Information for 2008 has been reclassified accordingly.
com 177 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 31 Operating segments continued The Financial information by business unit provided on page 219 of these financial statements provide additional voluntary disclosure which the Group considers is useful to the users of the financial statements.
a Gross sales revenue Product group gross sales revenue includes 100 per cent of subsidiaries sales revenue and the Groups share of the sales revenue of equity accounted units.
The Rio Tintos share of the sales revenue of equity accounted units are deducted and intra-subsidiary equity accounted unit sales are adjusted in arriving at consolidated sales revenue as shown on the income statement.
Inter-segment transactions relate to sales between Aluminium and Alcan Engineered Products which is included in Other Operations.
b Underlying earnings As discussed in note 2, Underlying earnings is an alternative measure of earnings which provides a greater understanding of the underlying business performance of the Groups operations.
The measure of Underlying earnings is used by the Chief executive of Rio Tinto to assess the performance of the product groups.
Product group earnings include earnings of subsidiaries stated before finance items but after the amortisation of discount.
Earnings attributable to equity accounted units include interest charges and amortisation of discount except that, from 2009 onwards, RBM earnings are before charging interest on third party debt.
Rio Tintos share of the Underlying earnings of equity accounted units amounts to US$864 million in 2009 2008: US$1,047 million.
This amount is attributable as follows: US$750 million profit to the Copper group and US$114 million profit to other product groups, 2008: US$852 million profit is attributable to the Copper product group and US$195 million profit to other product groups.
These amounts are included in Underlying earnings of the relevant product groups.
These amounts include the Underlying earnings of the Groups tolling entities which process bauxite and alumina.
These entities recharge the majority of their costs and would generally have minimal earnings.
The Diamonds & Minerals Underlying earnings in 2009 includes a US$797 million profit after tax in relation to the divestment of undeveloped potash assets in Argentina and Canada.
In 2008, the Energy group Underlying earnings includes a US$483 million profit after tax in relation to the divestment of the undeveloped Kintyre uranium project in Western Australia.
c Depreciation and amortisation Product group totals of depreciation include 100 per cent of subsidiaries depreciation and amortisation and include Rio Tintos share of the depreciation and amortisation of equity accounted units.
The Rio Tintos share of the depreciation and amortisation charge of equity accounted units is deducted to arrive at depreciation and amortisation excluding equity accounted units as shown in note 3.
These figures exclude impairment charges, which are excluded from Underlying earnings.
d Tax charge This relates to the tax charges on the product groups Underlying earnings.
The reconciling item is the tax on amounts that are excluded in arriving at Underlying earnings.
Within product groups, tax of subsidiaries is stated before tax on finance items but after tax on the amortisation of the discount related to provisions.
The tax charge excludes tax on the earnings of equity accounted units of US$491 million 2008: US$596 million of which US$498 million 2008: US$515 million related to the Copper product group.
e Additions to non current assets other than financial instruments and deferred tax assets This represents the total cost incurred during the year to acquire non current assets other than financial instruments and deferred tax assets, measured on an accruals basis in accordance with IFRS 8.
The reconciling items to arrive at capital expenditure shown in the Financial information by business unit are shown below: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2009 2008 US$m US$m Capitalised interest costs 198 203 Capitalised closure costs and other provisions 268 393 Movement in payables for capital expenditure 595 503 Goodwill cash additions 8 Additions to investments in equity accounted units 412 29 Increase in non current inventories 109 10 Increase in non current prepayments 50 Finance leases taken out 73 Proceeds of disposal of property, plant and equity and intangible assets 32 90 Funding of equity accounted units for major capital expenditure 4 Total 497 1,282 178 Rio Tinto 2009 Annual report Financial Shareholder statements information f Operating assets Product group totals of operating assets comprise net assets excluding post retirement assets and liabilities, net of tax, and are before deducting net debt.
Operating assets are less outside shareholders interests, which are calculated by reference to the net assets of the relevant companies i. e. net of such companies debt.
For equity accounted units, Rio Tintos net investment excluding post retirement assets and liabilities net of tax, is shown.
Other items relate to assets held by entities not considered as reportable segments.
In 2009, Rio Tintos investment in equity accounted units of US$6,735 million is attributable as follows: US$3,489 million to the Aluminium product group, US$2,777 million to the Copper product group and US$469 million to other product groups 31 December 2008: US$5,053 million of which US$3,294 million is attributable to the Aluminium product group, US$1,597 million is attributable to the Copper product group, and US$162 million to other product groups.

33 Financial risk management The Groups policies with regard to financial risk management are clearly defined and consistently applied.
They are a fundamental part of the Groups long term strategy covering areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and capital management.
Generally, the Group only sells commodities it has produced but also enters into third party direct transactions and physical swaps on Alumina to balance the regional positions and to balance the loading on production facilities.
In the long term, natural hedges operate in a number of ways to help protect and stabilise earnings and cash flow.
The Group has a diverse portfolio of commodities and markets, which have varying responses to the economic cycle.
The relationship between commodity prices and the currencies of most of the countries in which the Group operates provides further natural protection in the long term.
Production of minerals is an important contributor to the Gross Domestic Products of Australia and Canada, countries in which the Group has a large presence.
As a consequence, the Australian and Canadian currencies have historically tended to strengthen when commodity prices are high.
In addition, the Groups policy of borrowing primarily at floating US dollar interest rates helps to counteract the effect of economic and commodity price cycles.
These natural hedges significantly reduce the necessity for using derivatives or other forms of synthetic hedging.
Such hedging is therefore undertaken to a strictly limited degree, as described below.
Treasury operates as a service to the business of the Rio Tinto Group and not as a profit centre.
Strict limits on the size and type of transaction permitted are laid down by the Rio Tinto board and are subject to rigorous internal controls.
Senior management is advised of corporate debt and currency, commodity and interest rate derivatives through a monthly reporting framework.
Rio Tinto does not acquire or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes: nor does it believe that it has material exposure to such trading or speculative holdings through its investments in joint ventures and associates.
Derivatives are used to separate funding and cash management decisions from currency exposure and interest rate management.
The Group uses interest rate and cross currency interest rate swaps in conjunction with longer term funds raised in the capital markets to achieve a predominantly floating rate obligation which is consistent with the Groups interest and exchange rate policies, ie.
However, the group reserves the right to realise swap positions to take advantage of favourable market conditions and to manage counterparty credit risk.
No material exposure is considered to exist by virtue of the possible non performance of the counterparties to financial instruments held by the Group.
Derivative contracts are carried at fair value based on published quotations for the period for which a liquid active market exists.
Beyond this period, Rio Tintos own assumptions are used.
180 Rio Tinto 2009 Annual report Financial Shareholder statements information i Foreign exchange risk Rio Tintos shareholders equity, earnings and cash flows are influenced by a wide variety of currencies due to the geographic diversity of the Groups sales and the countries in which it operates.
The US dollar, however, is the currency in which the great majority of the Groups sales are denominated.
Operating costs are influenced by the currencies of those countries where the Groups mines and processing plants are located and also by those currencies in which the costs of imported equipment and services are determined.
The Australian and Canadian dollars and the Euro are the most important currencies apart from the US dollar influencing costs.
In any particular year, currency fluctuations may have a significant impact on Rio Tintos financial results.
A strengthening of the US dollar against the currencies in which the Groups costs are partly determined has a positive effect on Rio Tintos Underlying earnings.
Given the dominant role of the US currency in the Groups affairs, the US dollar is the currency in which financial results are presented both internally and externally.
It is also the most appropriate currency for borrowing and holding surplus cash, although a portion of surplus cash may also be held in other currencies, most notably Australian dollars, Canadian dollars and the Euro.
This cash is held in order to meet short term operational and capital commitments and, for the Australian dollar, dividend payments.
The Group finances its operations primarily in US dollars, either directly or using cross currency interest rate swaps.
A substantial part of the Groups US dollar debt is located in subsidiaries having a US dollar functional currency.
However, certain US dollar debt and other financial assets and liabilities including intragroup balances are not held in the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary.
This results in an accounting exposure to exchange gains and losses as the financial assets and liabilities are translated into the functional currency of the subsidiary that accounts for those assets and liabilities.
These exchange gains and losses are recorded in the Groups income statement except to the extent that they can be taken to equity under the Groups accounting policy which is explained in note 1 d. Gains and losses on US dollar net debt and on intragroup balances are excluded from Underlying earnings.
Other exchange gains and losses are included in Underlying earnings.
As noted above, Rio Tinto hedges interest rate and currency risk on most of its foreign currency borrowings by entering into cross currency interest rate swaps, and or interest rate swaps when required.
These have the economic effect of converting fixed rate foreign currency borrowings to floating rate US dollar borrowings.
See section B d of note 34 Financial instruments for the details of currency and interest rate contracts relating to borrowings.
After taking into account relevant swap instruments, almost all of the Groups net debt is either denominated in US dollars or in the functional currency of the entity holding the debt.
The table below summarises the net debt by currency.
2009 2008 Net debt funds by currency US$m US$m United States dollar 18,466 38,111 Australian dollar 232 351 South African rand 60 52 UK sterling 35 34 Euro 140 77 Canadian dollar 137 122 Other 89 29 Total 18,861 38,672 Currency hedging Under normal market conditions, the Group does not generally believe that active currency hedging of transactions would provide long term benefits to shareholders.
The Group reviews on a regular basis its exposure and reserves the right to enter into hedges to maintain financial stability.
Currency protection measures may be deemed appropriate in specific commercial circumstances and are subject to strict limits laid down by the Rio Tinto board, typically hedging of capital expenditures and other significant financial items such as tax and dividends.
There is a legacy of currency forward contracts used to hedge operating cash flow exposures which was acquired with the North companies.
Refer to section B a to d of note 34 - Financial instruments for the currency forward and option contracts used to manage the currency risk exposures of the Group at 31 December 2009.
Foreign exchange sensitivity: Risks associated with exposure to financial instruments The sensitivities below give the estimated effect of a ten per cent strengthening in the full year closing US dollar exchange rate on the value of financial instruments.
The impact is expressed in terms of the effect on net earnings, Underlying earnings and equity, assuming that each exchange rate moves in isolation.
The sensitivities are based on financial assets and liabilities held at 31 December 2009, where balances are not denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary and exclude financial assets and liabilities held by equity accounted units see note b below.
They also exclude exchange movements on local currency deferred tax balances and provisions.
These balances will not remain constant throughout 2010, and therefore these numbers should be used with care.

b The sensitivities presented are on financial assets and liabilities of subsidiaries and proportionally consolidated entities, and do not include non-financial instruments such as provisions or post retirement benefits, or sensitivities arising from financial assets and liabilities within equity accounted units.
The impact of reflecting these items primarily impacts the Canadian dollar sensitivity, with a US$69 million reduction in net earnings 2008: US$9 million reduction, a US$67 million reduction in Underlying earnings 2008: US$21 million reduction, and a US$114 million increase recorded directly in equity 2008: US$56 million increase.
c Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. which has a US functional currency for accounting purposes, has a significant amount of US dollar denominated external and intragroup debt held in Canada and is taxed on a Canadian currency basis.
The above sensitivities as at 31 December 2009 for a 10 per cent strengthening of the US dollar do not include any tax benefit related to this debt because the capital losses generated would not be recognised.
If the US dollar weakened below 97 Canadian cents then tax charges would begin to be recognised at 15 per cent.
Similarly at 31 December 2008, the above sensitivities for a 10 per cent strengthening of the US dollar did not include any tax benefit related to this debt because the capital losses generated would not have been recognised.
If the US dollar had weakened below 97 Canadian cents then tax charges would have begun to be recognised at 15 per cent.
ii Interest rate risk Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
Rio Tintos interest rate management policy is generally to borrow and invest at floating interest rates.
This approach is based on historical correlation between interest rates and commodity prices.
In some circumstances, an element of fixed rate funding may be considered appropriate.
As noted above, Rio Tinto hedges interest rate and currency risk on most of its foreign currency borrowings by entering into cross currency interest rate swaps in order to convert fixed rate foreign currency borrowings to floating rate US dollar borrowings.
The market value of these interest rate and cross currency interest rate swaps moves in alignment with the market and at times can act as alternative sources of funding.
The Group reviews the positions on a regular basis and may act to either monetise in-the-money value or achieve lower costs of funding.
At the end of 2009, US$8.3 billion 2008: US$10.6 billion of the Groups debt was at fixed rates after taking into account interest rate swaps and finance leases, making the fixed to floating debt ratio 36 per cent fixed to 64 per cent floating.
A monthly Treasury report is provided to senior management which summarises corporate debt exposed to currency risks and, where applicable, the offsetting derivatives.
See note 22 Borrowings for the details of debt outstanding at 31 December 2009.
Based on the Groups net debt and other floating rate financial instruments outstanding as at 31 December 2009, the effect on net earnings of a half percentage point increase in US dollar LIBOR interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would be a reduction of US$37 million 2008: US$100 million.
These balances will not remain constant throughout 2010, however, and therefore these numbers should be used with care.
182 Rio Tinto 2009 Annual report Financial Shareholder statements information iii Commodity price risk The Groups normal policy is to sell its products at prevailing market prices.
Exceptions to this rule are subject to strict limits laid down by the Rio Tinto board and to rigid internal controls.
Rio Tintos exposure to commodity prices is diversified by virtue of its broad commodity base and the Group does not generally believe commodity price hedging would provide long term benefit to shareholders.
The Group may hedge certain commitments with some of its customers or suppliers.
Details of commodity derivatives held at 31 December 2009 are set out in note 34 B a to c Financial instruments.
Metals such as copper and aluminium are generally sold under contract, often long term, at prices determined by reference to prevailing market prices on terminal markets, such as the London Metal Exchange LME and COMEX in New York, usually at the time of delivery.
Prices fluctuate widely in response to changing levels of supply and demand but, in the long run, prices are related to the marginal cost of supply.
Gold is also priced in an active market in which prices respond to daily changes in quantities offered and sought.
Newly mined gold is only one source of supply: investment and disinvestment can be important elements of supply and demand.
Contract prices for many other natural resource products including iron ore and coal are generally agreed annually or for longer periods with customers, although volume commitments vary by product.
Certain products, predominantly copper concentrate, are provisionally priced, ie the selling price is subject to final adjustment at the end of a period normally ranging from 30 to 180 days after delivery to the customer, based on the market price at the relevant quotation point stipulated in the contract.
Revenue on provisionally priced sales is recognised based on estimates of fair value of the consideration receivable based on forward market prices.
At each reporting date, provisionally priced metal is marked to market based on the forward selling price for the period stipulated in the contract.
For this purpose, the selling price can be measured reliably for those products, such as copper for which there exists an active and freely traded commodity market such as the London Metal Exchange and the value of product sold by the Group is directly linked to the form in which it is traded on that market.
At the end of 2009, the Group had 267 million pounds of copper sales 2008: 183 million pounds that were provisionally priced at US 335 cents per pound 2008: US 133 cents per pound.
The final price of these sales will be determined during the first half of 2010.
A ten per cent change in the price of copper realised on the provisionally priced sales would increase or reduce net earnings by US$55 million 2008: $15 million.
Approximately 27 per cent of Rio Tintos 2009 Underlying earnings from operating businesses came from products whose prices were terminal market related and the remainder came from products priced by direct negotiation.
Commodity price sensitivity: Risks associated with derivatives The table below summarises the impact of changes in the market price on the following commodity derivatives including those aluminium forward and option contracts embedded in electricity purchase contracts outstanding at 31 December 2009, but excluding the impact of commodity and embedded derivatives held by equity accounted units see note a.
The impact is expressed in terms of the resulting change in the Groups net earnings for the year or, where applicable, the change in equity.
The sensitivities are based on the assumption that the market price increases by ten per cent with all other variables held constant.
The Groups own use contracts are excluded from the sensitivity analysis below as they are outside the scope of IAS 39.
Such contracts to buy or sell non financial items can be net settled but were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of the non financial item in accordance with the business units expected purchase, sale or usage requirements.
These sensitivities should be used with care.
The relationship between currencies and commodity prices is a complex one: changes in exchange rates can influence commodity prices and vice versa.

com 183 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 33 Financial risk management continued iv Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.
The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities primarily from customer receivables and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.
Credit risks related to receivables Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to Rio Tintos established policy, procedures and controls relating to customer credit risk management.
Credit limits are established for all customers based on internal or external rating criteria.
Where customers are rated by an independent credit rating agency, these ratings are used to set credit limits.
In circumstances where no independent credit rating exists, the credit quality of the customer is assessed based on an extensive credit rating scorecard.
Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored and any credit concerns highlighted to senior management.
High risk shipments to major customers are generally covered by letters of credit or other forms of credit insurance.
At 31 December 2009, the Group had approximately 70 customers 2008: 86 customers that owed the Group more than US$5 million each and these balances accounted for approximately 52 per cent 2008: 75 per cent of all receivables owing.
There were 17 customers 2008: 21 customers with balances greater than US$20 million accounting for just over 30 per cent 2008: 49 per cent of total amounts receivable.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets mentioned on page 191.
The Group does not hold collateral as security for any trade receivables.
Credit risk related to financial instruments and cash deposits Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by Group Treasury in accordance with a board approved policy.
Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty.
Counterparty credit limits are reviewed by the Rio Tinto board on an annual basis, and may be updated throughout the year subject to approval of the Rio Tinto Finance committee.
The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate the potential for financial loss through counterparty failure.
No material exposure is considered to exist by virtue of the possible non performance of the counterparties to financial instruments.
v Liquidity and Capital risk management The Groups total capital is defined as Rio Tintos shareholders funds plus funds attributable to outside equity shareholders plus net debt, and amounted to US$65 billion at 31 December 2009 2008: US$61 billion.
The Groups over-riding objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the business as a going concern: to maximise returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure in order to provide a high degree of financial flexibility at the lowest cost of capital.
The unified credit status of the Group is maintained through cross guarantees whereby contractual obligations of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited are automatically guaranteed by the other.
Following the successful US$15.2 billion rights issues in July 2009, Moodys and Standard & Poors S&P improved the Groups credit rating.
S&P upgraded the long term rating to BBB from BBB and its short term credit ratings to A-2 from A-3, the outlook improved from negative to stable.
Moodys affirmed the long term rating of Baa1 and short term corporate credit rating of P-2 also with a stable outlook.
In 2007, Rio Tinto acquired Alcan which was financed using a US$40 billion syndicated bank facility.
As at 31 December 2009, there was US$8.5 billion drawn on this facility compared to US$28 billion at 31 December 2008.
The facility had two term facilities Facilities A and D of which Facility A was fully repaid in 2009 and US$8.5 billion remained on Facility D at 31 December 2009.
Revolving Facility B had an initial capacity of US$10 billion.
As at 31 December 2009, only US$ 2.1 billion of the facility remained available to draw upon.
The maturity date for Facility B is October 2010.
Revolving Facility C is for an amount of up to US$5 billion, all of which is undrawn.
The maturity date for Facility C is October 2012.
The maturity date for Facility D is December 2012.
Advances under each Facility generally bear interest at rates per annum equal to the margin for that Facility plus LIBOR and any mandatory costs.
Refer to note 48 Events after the statement of financial position date for the partial repayment of Facility D and cancellation of Facility B post year end.
The Groups back-up facilities consist of revolving tranches of the syndicated bank facility and a series of standby bi-lateral bank facilities.
These standby bi-lateral bank facilities contain no financial covenants and are not affected to any material extent by a change in the Groups credit rating.
The syndicated bank facility contains a financial covenant requiring the maintenance of a ratio of no greater than 4.5 times of net borrowings to EBITDA.
At 31 December 2009, the Group has available committed financing of US$5.0 billion under Alcan Facility C, US$2.1 billion under Facility B and US$2.3 billion unused committed bilateral banking facilities.
Refer to note 22 Borrowings for further details.
The Groups net debt as a percentage of total capital was 29 per cent at 31 December 2009 2008: 63 per cent.

The list therefore only includes those jointly controlled entities that have a more significant impact on the profit or operating assets of the Group.
The Groups principal jointly controlled entities are held by intermediate holding companies and not directly by Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited.
With the exception of e and f above, all jointly controlled entities operate mainly in the countries in which they are incorporated.
a While the Group holds more than a 50 per cent interest in these entities, other participants have veto rights over operating, financing and strategic decision making.
Accordingly, the Group does not have the ability to unilaterally control, and therefore does not consolidate these entities.
b Leichhardt has a 31.4 per cent interest in the Blair Athol joint venture.
As a result, the Group has a further beneficial interest of 14 per cent in addition to its direct interest of 57.2 per cent, which is owned via a subsidiary of Rio Tinto Limited.
The Blair Athol joint venture is disclosed as a jointly controlled asset in note 40. c The year end of Minera Escondida Limitada is 30 June.
However, the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements of Rio Tinto are based on accounts of Minera Escondida Limitada that are coterminous with those of the Group.
At the same time an agreement was signed with the joint venture partner BHP Billiton, to restructure the joint venture while maintaining the Groups remaining interest in RBM.
This transaction has reduced the Groups interest from 50 per cent to 37 per cent allocated between two entities.

45 Exchange rates in US$ The principal exchange rates used in the preparation of the 2009 financial statements are: Annual average Year end 2009 2008 2009 2008 Sterling 1.57 1.86 1.61 1.44 Australian dollar 0.79 0.86 0.89 0.69 Canadian dollar 0.88 0.94 0.95 0.82 South African rand 0.12 0.12 0.14 0.11 Euro 1.39 1.47 1.44 1.41 200 Rio Tinto 2009 Annual report Financial Shareholder statements information 46 Rights issues The terms of the rights issues were 21 New Rio Tinto plc Shares offered for every 40 existing shares at 1,400 pence per share and 21 New Rio Tinto Limited Shares offered for every 40 existing shares at A$28.29 per share.
The rights issues were fully underwritten and were completed on 2 July 2009 and 3 July 2009 respectively.
The net proceeds from the rights issues of US$14.8 billion were used to pay down Group borrowings.
Although Rio Tinto plcs functional currency is the US dollar, the UK element of the rights issue was denominated in Sterling.
At the time the Group announced its half year results, the offer of rights was treated as a derivative financial liability under IFRS prevailing at that time because the company was not issuing a fixed number of shares for a fixed amount of US dollars Rio Tinto Limiteds functional currency is the Australian dollar and the Australian element of the rights issue was denominated in Australian dollars so there was no equivalent issue for Rio Tinto Limited.
This gave rise to a gain of US$827 million in the Groups half year income statement.
In October 2009, the IASB approved an amendment to IAS 32 which allows the offer of rights to be treated as an equity instrument, provided they are offered pro rata to all shareholders.
The EU endorsed this amendment in January 2010 and the gain of US$827 million was therefore reversed in the second half of 2009.
Both Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited entered into a series of forward US dollar derivative exchange contracts to minimise exposure to foreign exchange rates and to provide confidence in the absolute dollar proceeds from the rights issues.
Proceeds from the rights issues were used for a partial prepayment of the US dollar denominated Alcan acquisition facility.
The forward contracts taken out by both companies are accounted for as derivatives.
The contracts entered into by Rio Tinto plc to fix the Sterling proceeds in US dollars, which is the companys functional currency, are considered to be, in substance, share issue costs and accordingly, the losses on these contracts from inception to receipt of proceeds have been recognised in equity, within share premium.
Rio Tinto Limiteds functional currency is the Australian dollar and, therefore, the losses on the contracts entered into by Rio Tinto Limited have been recognised in the income statement and excluded from Underlying earnings.
The losses on Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited contracts are included within Other investing cash flows in the statement of cash flow.
The rights issues were at a discount to the then market price.
Accordingly, earnings per share for all periods up to the date on which the shares were issued have been adjusted for the bonus element of the rights issues.
2008 comparatives for both earnings per share and ordinary dividends per share have been restated accordingly.
47 Bougainville Copper Limited BCL Mining has been suspended at the Panguna mine since 1989.
Safe mine access by company employees has not been possible since that time and an accurate assessment of the condition of the assets cannot therefore be made.
Considerable funding would be required to recommence operations to the level which applied at the time of the mines closure in 1989.
An Order of Magnitude study undertaken in 2008 indicates that costs in a range of US$2 billion to US$4 billion would be required to reopen the mine assuming all site infrastructure is replaced.
The directors consider that the Group does not currently realise a benefit from its interest in BCL and therefore BCL information continues to be excluded from the financial statements.
BCL reported a net profit of US$3 million for the financial year 2008: net loss of US$2 million.
This is based upon actual transactions for the financial year.
The aggregate amount of capital and reserves reported by BCL as at 31 December 2009 was US$138 million 2008: US$113 million.
The Group owns 214,887,966 shares in BCL, representing 53.6 per cent of the issued share capital.
The investment of US$195 million was fully provided against in 1991.
At 31 December 2009, the number of shares in BCL held by the Group, multiplied by the share price, resulted in an amount of US$114 million 2008: US$101 million.
48 Events after the statement of financial position date On 29 January 2010, US$2.0 billion of Facility D of the Alcan facility was paid.
An additional US$2.0 billion was paid on 26 February 2010, leaving US$4.5 billion outstanding on the facility.
All of Tranches A and B of the Alcan facility have now been repaid.
Facility B of the acquisition facility is a revolving facility of which US$2.1 billion was undrawn at 31 December 2009.
On 5 February 2010, in accordance with the acquisition facility agreement, proceeds from the sale of the majority of Alcan Packaging to Amcor were used to cancel US$2.0 billion of the outstanding capacity.
At the same time, the Group voluntarily surrendered the remaining US$0.1 billion of the facility.
Rio Tinto completed the sale of Alcan Packaging global pharmaceuticals, global tobacco, food Europe and food Asia divisions to Amcor for a total consideration of US$1,948 million on 1 February 2010.
The consideration has been adjusted to exclude the Medical Flexibles operations and to reflect the actual business performance over the past six months.
The final consideration remains subject to certain customary post-close adjustments.
The sale of Maules Creek to Aston Resources was completed on 18 February 2010.
The sale of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas division to Bemis Company Inc. for a total all-cash consideration of US$1.2 billion was completed on 1 March 2010.
These divestments have not been reflected in the 2009 results, and will be reflected in the period in which the sales are completed.
On 1 March 2010, Rio Tinto announced that it has agreed to acquire 15 million shares in Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. at a subscription price of C$16.31 per share, increasing its ownership in Ivanhoe Mines by 2.7 per cent to 22.4 per cent.
The total consideration for this acquisition is C$244.7 million.
The shares are being issued to Rio Tinto in satisfaction of an agreement with Ivanhoe Mines in 2008 to finance equipment for the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold complex in Mongolias South Gobi region.
After the completion of the acquisition, Rio Tinto will own 98.6 million shares of Ivanhoe Mines.
If Rio Tinto were to execute all of its shares purchase warrants and convert its US$350 million loan into shares it would own approximately 267.6 million shares of Ivanhoe Mines representing 44.0 per cent of Ivanhoe Mines.
com 201 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 49 Share based payments Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited the Companies have a number of share based payment plans, which are described in detail in the Remuneration report.
These plans have been accounted for in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, which means that IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of employee share based payments that had not vested as at 1 January 2004.
The charge credit that has been recognised in the income statement for Rio Tintos share based compensation plans, and the related liability for cash-settled plans, is set out in the table below.
Charge credit recognised Liability at the end for the year of the year 2009 2008 2009 2008 US$m US$m US$m US$m Equity-settled plans 76 61 Cash-settled plans 101 83 111 43 Total 177 22 111 43 Effect of the rights issues All options and awards outstanding when the rights issues took place have been adjusted to nullify any impact on the economic position of the participant at exercise.
For Rio Tinto plc options the fair values and exercise prices have been reduced by the bonus element and the number of options and awards has been increased by the same proportion.
For Rio Tinto Limited awards, top-up awards have been granted to increase the number held with a corresponding decrease in the associated fair value.
For Rio Tinto Limited options the exercise price has been reduced so that their intrinsic value measured at June 2009 remains unchanged as a result of the rights issue.
The 2008 comparatives have been restated as if the rights issues had taken place prior to the 1st January 2008.
This is to ensure the figures are comparable with the 2009 results which include the impact of the rights issues.
Lattice-based option valuation model The fair value of share options is estimated as at the date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation model.
The significant assumptions used in the valuation model are disclosed below.
Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of Rio Tintos share returns under the UK and Australian listings.
Historical data was used to estimate employee forfeiture and cancellation rates within the valuation model.
Under the Share Option Plans, it is assumed that after options have vested 20 per cent per annum of participants will exercise their options when the market price is at least 20 per cent above the exercise price of the option.
Participants in the Share Savings Plans are assumed to exercise their options immediately after vesting.
The implied lifetime of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
The risk-free rate used in the valuation model is equal to the yield available on UK and Australian zero-coupon government bonds for plc and Limited options respectively at the date of grant with a term equal to the expected term of the options.
Summary of options outstanding A summary of the status of the Companies equity-settled share option plans at 31 December 2009, and changes during the year ended 31 December 2009, is presented below.

202 Rio Tinto 2009 Annual report Financial Shareholder statements information Share Savings Plans Awards under these plans are settled in equity and accounted for accordingly.
The fair value of each award on the day of grant was estimated using a lattice-based option valuation model, including allowance for the exercise price being at a discount to market price.
The key assumptions used in the valuation are noted in the following table.

com 203 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 49 Share based payments continued Share Option Plans The Group has a policy of settling these awards in equity, although the directors at their discretion can offer a cash alternative.
The awards are accounted for in accordance with the requirements applying to equity-settled, share based payment transactions.
The performance conditions in relation to Total Shareholder Return TSR have been incorporated in the measurement of fair value for these awards by modelling the correlation between Rio Tintos TSR and that of the index.
The relationship between Rio Tintos TSR and the index was simulated many thousands of times to derive a distribution which, in conjunction with the lattice-based option valuation model, was used to determine the fair value of the options.
The key assumptions are noted in the following table.

204 Rio Tinto 2009 Annual report Financial Shareholder statements information Share Ownership Plan The fair values of awards of Matching and Free Shares made by Rio Tinto are taken to be the market value of the shares on the date of purchase.
These awards are settled in equity.
The total fair value of shares awarded during the year was US$1 million 2008: US$2 million.
Mining Companies Comparative Plan Awards under this plan are accounted for in accordance with the requirements applying to cash-settled, share based payment transactions.
If any awards are ultimately settled in shares, the liability is transferred direct to equity as the consideration for the equity instruments issued.
The grant date fair values of the awards made prior to 2008 are taken to be the market value of the shares at the date of award reduced by 50 per cent for anticipated relative TSR performance.
The grant date fair value of the awards made in 2008 and 2009 were calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
In addition, for the valuations after 2005, the market value is reduced for non receipt of dividends between measurement date and date of vesting excluding awards for executive directors and product group chief executive officers.
Forfeitures are assumed prior to vesting at three per cent per annum of outstanding awards, except for the 2009 awards where no allowance has been made for forfeitures.
In accordance with the method of accounting for cash-settled awards, fair values are subsequently re-measured each year to reflect the market price of shares at the measurement date and the number of awards expected to vest based on the current and anticipated TSR performance.
This re-measurement at 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2009 was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.

com 207 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 50 Post retirement benefits Description of plans The Group operates a number of pension and post retirement healthcare plans around the world.
Some of these plans are defined contribution and some are defined benefit, with assets held in separate trusts, foundations and similar entities.
Valuations of these plans are produced and updated annually to 31 December by qualified actuaries.
Plans that were previously sponsored by the Alcan Packaging business were previously excluded from this note and reflected in the value of the assets held for sale.
Any plans that are not now expected to be sold with these businesses are now reflected in this note rather than within Assets held for sale.
Rio Tinto has a number of retirement plans which, within the same legal arrangement, have sections providing benefits on a defined benefit basis and sections providing benefits on a defined contribution basis.
In prior years these arrangements were presented as a defined benefit plan only, although they had characteristics of both types of plan.
Those sections providing benefits on a defined contribution basis are now presented as defined contribution plans.
The comparative information in all of the tables in this note has been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation.
The comparative statements of financial position, income statements and statements of comprehensive income were not affected by this change.
Pension plans The majority of the Groups pension obligations are in Canada, the UK, the US, Switzerland and the Eurozone.
There are some defined benefit obligations in Australia but the retirement arrangements there are predominantly defined contribution.
In general the Group has a policy of moving towards defined contribution provision.
There are a number of pension arrangements in the UK.
The defined benefit sections of these arrangements are linked to final pay and are closed to new members, with new employees being admitted to defined contribution sections.
In Australia, the main arrangements are principally defined contribution in nature but there are sections providing defined benefits linked to final pay, typically paid in lump sum form.
A number of defined benefit pension plans are sponsored by the US and Canadian entities.
The main plans are two Canadian plans for salaried and bargaining employees.
Benefits for salaried staff are generally linked to final average pay, while benefits for bargaining employees are reviewed in negotiation with unions.
In Europe, there are defined benefit plans in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany and France.
The largest single plan is in Switzerland and provides benefits linked to final average pay.
The Group also operates a number of unfunded defined benefit plans, which are included in the figures below.
Post retirement healthcare plans Certain subsidiaries of the Group, mainly in the US and Canada, provide health and life insurance benefits to retired employees and in some cases to their beneficiaries and covered dependants.
Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain age and service criteria.
These arrangements are unfunded, and are included in the figures below.
Plan assets The proportions of the total fair value of assets in the pension plans for each asset class at the balance sheet date were: a 2009 2008 Equities 54.9% 51.3% Bonds 33.6% 36.6% Property 5.5% 7.1% Other 6.0% 5.0% 100.0% 100.0% a Prior year comparatives have been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation.
The sections providing benefits on a defined contribution basis are now presented as defined contribution plans.
Further details are provided above.
The assets of the plans are generally managed on a day-to-day basis by external specialist fund managers.
These managers may invest in the Groups securities subject to limits imposed by the relevant fiduciary committees and local legislation.
The approximate total holding of Group securities within the plans is US$19 million 2008: $6 million.
208 Rio Tinto 2009 Annual report Financial Shareholder statements information Main assumptions rates per annum The main assumptions for the valuations of the plans under IAS 19 are set out below.
Information on the sensitivity of the results to the main assumptions is set out in the sensitivity section on page 212.
b The assumptions vary by location for the Other plans.
Assumptions shown are for Southern Africa.
The main financial assumptions used for the healthcare plans, which are predominantly in the US and Canada, were: discount rate: 6.0 per cent 2008: 6.5 per cent, medical trend rate: 7.5 per cent reducing to 5.1 per cent by the year 2015 broadly on a straight line basis 2008: 7.0 per cent, reducing to 5.0 per cent by the year 2015, claims costs based on individual company experience.
For both the pension and healthcare arrangements the post retirement mortality assumptions allow for future improvements in longevity.
The mortality tables used imply that a man aged 60 at the balance sheet date has a weighted average expected future lifetime of 24 years 2008: 24 years and that a man aged 60 in 2029 would have a weighted average expected future lifetime of 26 years 2008: 26 years.
The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is determined as managements best estimate of the long term returns of the major asset classes equities, bonds, property and other weighted by the allocation of assets among the categories at the measurement date.
The expected rates of return shown have been reduced to allow for plan expenses including, where appropriate, taxes incurred within pension plans on investment returns.
Based on the assumptions made and the distribution of assets the weighted average expected return on assets as at 1 January 2009 was 5.9 per cent 2008: 6.4 per cent and is expected to be 6.4 per cent as at 1 January 2010.
The sources used to determine managements best estimate of long term returns are numerous and include country-specific bond yields, which may be derived from the market using local bond indices or by analysis of the local bond market, and country-specific inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and analysts or governments expectations as applicable.

210 Rio Tinto 2009 Annual report Financial Shareholder statements information Contributions to plans Contributions to defined benefit pension plans during 2009 totalled US$560 million 2008: US$421 million.
Contributions of US$190 million 2008: US$184 million were made to defined contribution arrangements and US$9 million 2008: US$10 million to industry-wide plans: these are charged against profits and are included in the figures for defined contribution current employer service costs shown above.
Contributions for other benefits totalled US$46 million 2008: US$53 million.
Contributions to defined benefit pension plans for 2010 are estimated to be around US$200 million higher than for 2009.
The increase relates to UK, Canada and the US where the impact of the global financial crisis is now included in the funding valuations.
Furthermore, the inclusion of plans which were previously classified within Assets held for sale contributed to the increase.
Healthcare plans are generally unfunded and contributions for future years will be equal to benefit payments and therefore cannot be predetermined.
Movements in the present value of the defined benefit obligation and in the fair value of assets The amounts shown below include, where appropriate, 100 per cent of the costs, contributions, gains and losses in respect of employees who participate in the plans and who are employed in operations that are proportionally consolidated or equity accounted.
Consequently, the costs, contributions, gains and losses do not correspond directly to the amounts disclosed above in respect of the Group.
