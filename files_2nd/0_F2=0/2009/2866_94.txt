Pension contributions are determined based on the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
The Group made a special additional cash contribution to the Capita scheme of 40m in January 2009 as a result of the outcome of the full formal valuation.
This was in addition to a special additional cash contribution of 10m made in December 2008.
Formal valuations of the Capita scheme and the FPS scheme were carried out as at 6 April 2008 and 31 March 2008 respectively.
For the other schemes, the latest formal valuations were carried out as at either 1 April 2004, 31 December 2006 or 31 March 2007.
These valuations are updated by independent qualified actuaries at each balance sheet date.
Scheme assets are stated at their market valuations at each respective balance sheet date.
The assumption for the expected long term rate of return on assets has been derived by considering the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the assumption for the expected long term rate of return on assets for the portfolio.
