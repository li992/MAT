Financial instruments Refinancing On 7 April 2009 the Group successfully reached agreement with its banks and private placement holders regarding a revised covenant and financing package the Override Agreement.
The Group also reached similar agreement with the holders of its two public Eurobond issues on 30 April 2009.
The principal terms of the refinancing consisted of an alignment of all debt maturity dates to 3 July 2012, an increase in margin or coupon, an additional interest charge in the form of payment in kind PIK and warrants giving all lenders at the time the right to subscribe in cash for a combined total of approximately 5% of the Companys ordinary share capital at a fixed price and a revised operating and financial covenant package.
Following the equity raise in June 2009 the Group was able to reduce its borrowings to below a level such that PIK stopped accruing, the additional interest reduced and restrictive operating covenants relaxed.
Capital management The Groups objective is to obtain a strong credit rating for the business and to have an appropriate funding structure based on a minimum interest cover and maximum gearing.
In the current circumstances maintaining interest cover is not applicable as cash generation has been the Groups primary focus, however complying with policy remains an objective of the Group when market conditions allow.
Shareholders equity and long term debt are used to finance fixed assets and medium to long term land bank.
Revolving credit facilities are used to fund net current assets including work in progress and short term land.
