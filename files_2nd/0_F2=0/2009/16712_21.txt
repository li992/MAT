Significant accounting policies General information Victrex plc the Company is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of its Registered Office is Victrex Technology Centre, Hillhouse International, Thornton Cleveleys, Lancashire, FY5 4QD, United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 30 September 2009 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
These consolidated financial statements have been approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 7 December 2009.
Basis of preparation Both the consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU endorsed IFRS and on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments are measured at their fair value.
The Groups business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Annual Business Review on pages 3 to 15.
In addition, note 15 on financial risk management details its exposure to a variety of financial risks, including currency and credit risk.
The Group has significant positive cash balances and has a committed bank facility of 40m which expires in 2012.
This facility was undrawn at 30 September 2009 and remained undrawn at 7 December 2009 when these consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors.
Based on the above and a review of the Groups budgets and forecasts, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and hence have continued to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Annual Report & Accounts.
On publishing the Company financial statements here together with the consolidated financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of section 408 Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form part of the approved financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with endorsed IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Details of significant estimates and assumptions are set out in note 24.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied by Group entities.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction was adopted during the year.
There has been no impact upon the income statement or balance sheet from this adoption.
A number of standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued during the period and endorsed by the EU, but which are not yet effective and accordingly the Group has not yet adopted.
The cumulative impact of the adoption of these standards is not expected to be significant.

Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered in assessing control.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Segment reporting A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
A business segment is defined as a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
During the year the Groups business was strategically reorganised into two divisions: Invibio and Victrex Polymer Solutions.
Consequently, in compliance with IAS 14 Segment Reporting, the business now reports divisional information as the primary analysis and geographical information as the secondary analysis.
As required by the standard, the comparative figures have been restated and there has been no financial effect of the change on the Group.
Foreign currency translation Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operated the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the retranslation to balance sheet date exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Group companies The results and financial position of all the Group entities none of which have the currency of a hyperinflationary economy that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: a Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: b Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at weighted average exchange rates and, c All resulting exchange differences, from 1 October 2004, are recognised as a separate component of equity.
Victrex Stats 09:Victrex 10 12 09 09:06 Page 23 Victrex plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 39 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risks.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivatives are recognised at fair value.
The method of recognising any gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
For derivatives not used in hedging transactions, the gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective portion of changes in fair value is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time is recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Fair value estimation The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
Property, plant and equipment Owned assets All owned items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment.
The cost of self constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Leased assets Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives as follows: Buildings 30 years Plant and machinery 10-30 years Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 5 years Computers and motor vehicles 3-5 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed annually for continued appropriateness and indications of impairment, and adjusted if appropriate.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount.
These are included in the income statement.
Victrex Stats 09:Victrex 10 12 09 09:06 Page 24 40 Victrex plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Any impairment provisions that arose during impairment testing would not be reversed.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 October 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded previously under UK GAAP.
In respect of acquisitions that have occurred since 1 October 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred unless it meets all the criteria to be capitalised under IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Should any impairment provisions arise during annual impairment testing, these would also be deducted from the carrying value of other intangible assets.
Other intangible assets are tested annually for impairment, to the extent that they are considered to have an indefinite useful economic life.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis in order to allocate the cost over the estimated useful economic lives as follows: Knowhow 10 years The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed annually for continued appropriateness and impairment, and adjusted if appropriate.
Impairment The carrying amount of the Groups non-financial assets, other than inventories and current and deferred tax, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the recoverable amounts of the relevant assets are determined.
Goodwill Goodwill is tested annually for impairment by reference to the estimated future cash flows of the relevant cash generating unit CGU, discounted to their present value using risk adjusted discount factors to give its value in use.
A CGU is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash flows that are largely independent from other assets and groups.
Impairment losses are recognised if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its value in use and are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the unit or group of units on a pro rata basis.
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
Other assets For other assets subject to impairment reviews, an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised in previous periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Victrex Stats 09:Victrex 10 12 09 09:06 Page 25 Victrex plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 41 Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in, first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads allocated based on normal operating capacity.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances, call deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.
Income tax Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries except to the extent that they will probably reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved.
Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the amounts receivable for the sale of goods and services, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
Revenue from contractual payments is recognised by reference to completion of a specific milestone in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreements.
Royalty income is recognised when the amount payable is known.
No revenue is recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due, associated costs or the possible return of goods.
Rebates are accounted for as sales are made throughout the period.
Volume rebates are accrued based on the maximum amount due to customers based on annualised sales, unless it is clear that rebate conditions will not be met in a particular period.
Victrex Stats 09:Victrex 10 12 09 09:06 Page 26 42 Victrex plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Employee benefits Defined contribution pension plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit pension plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for past service costs.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any minimum funding requirements that apply.
An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised in the profit or loss on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised in profit or loss.
Victrex has decided to take advantage of the option under IAS 19 Employee Benefits to recognise actuarial gains and losses through the statement of recognised income and expense as opposed to the income statement.
Ongoing actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognised in full through the statement of recognised income and expense.
Share-based payment transactions The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
Share-based payment transactions are recharged from the Company to those subsidiaries benefitting from the service of the employees to whom options are granted.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest and include employee service periods and performance targets which are not related to the parents share price, such as earnings per share growth.
The fair value of the options is measured by the Stochastic model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
At each balance sheet date the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
Any failure to meet market conditions, which includes performance targets such as share price or Total Shareholder Return, would not result in a reversal of original estimates in the income statement.
The proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and it has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows.
Net financing income and expense Net financing income and expense comprises interest payable on borrowings, interest received on funds invested and charges on bank loans and overdrafts.

The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined using value in use calculations which use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management.
For the periods beyond the budget, cash flows are extrapolated using long-term growth rates.
Foreign exchange rates are based on actual rates at the time of the budget and are held constant.
Other assumptions such as market share and changes to selling prices are based on past experience and management's expectations of future changes in the market.
BDF is a key raw material for the vast majority of our products and associated downstream activities.
The carrying value of goodwill arising on the associated acquisitions is measured against the discounted future cash flow projections of the Victrex business as a whole.
The goodwill associated with the acquisition in March 2007 of the remaining 49% share in Victrex-MC, Inc is measured against the discounted future cash flow projections of our Japanese operations.
For Victrex the long-term average growth rate used was 2.5% 2008: 2.5% and the risk adjusted pre-tax discount rate was 8% 2008: 8%.
The impairment test results in more than 100% headroom and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
For our Japanese operations the long-term average growth rate used was 2.5% 2008: 2.5% and the risk adjusted pre-tax discount rate was 8% 2008: 8%.
Knowhow The knowhow arose on the acquisition in December 1999 associated with the supply of our key raw material BDF.
It is being amortised over its estimated useful economic life and has less than one year remaining to be charged.
The charge is recognised within cost of sales in the income statement.

Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including the following: Currency risk Company Victrex plc is an investment holding company and is not exposed to currency risk.
The Company has no forward exchange contracts.
Group The Group currently exports 96% of sales from the UK, and also makes raw material purchases overseas.
In addition, the Group includes a number of foreign subsidiaries.
As a result of these factors, the Groups financial statements are exposed to currency fluctuations.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollar, Euro and Yen.
The impact of a 5% movement in the average sterling US Dollar, sterling Euro and sterling Yen rates on profit before tax for 2009 is 1.9m, 1.4m and 0.3m 2008: 2.3m, 2.4m and 0.7m respectively.
Forward exchange contracts are used to manage this exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The Group hedges a proportion of sales, and occasionally purchases, denominated in a foreign currency.
The Board is responsible for setting the hedging policy which is detailed on page 22.
Most of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
The Group buys or sells foreign currency at spot where necessary to address any short-term imbalances.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecast transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair value of the Groups forward exchange contracts and swaps designated as cash flow hedges are as follows: Notional Carrying Notional Carrying contract amount and contract amount and amount fair value amount fair value 2009 2009 2008 2008 000 000 000 000 Current assets 9,010 1,702 22,594 855 Current liabilities 76,389 6,303 111,966 10,455 85,399 4,601 134,560 9,600 The fair values have been calculated by applying where relevant, for equivalent maturity profiles, the rate at which forward currency contracts with the same principal amounts could be acquired at the balance sheet date.
The following tables indicate the periods in which cash flows associated with the maturity date of the forward foreign exchange contracts for which hedge accounting applies are expected to occur: Expected 6 months 6 to 12 12 to 18 Expected 6 months 6 to 12 12 to 18 cash flows or less months months cash flows or less months months 2009 2009 2009 2009 2008 2008 2008 2008 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Forward exchange contracts Assets 10,762 2,923 7,839 22,594 13,724 19,646 16,672 Liabilities 73,412 36,477 32,392 4,543 111,966 62,796 39,448 9,722 84,174 39,400 40,231 4,543 134,560 49,072 59,094 26,394 The following tables indicate the periods in which cash flows associated with the maturity date of the forward foreign exchange contracts for which no hedge accounting is applied are expected to occur: Expected 6 months 6 to 12 12 to 18 cash flows or less months months 2009 2009 2009 2009 000 000 000 000 Forward exchange contracts Assets 1,752 2,261 509 Liabilities 2,977 2,977 1,225 716 509 Any change in the fair value of these items is recognised in the income statement.

Victrex Stats 09:Victrex 10 12 09 09:06 Page 35 Victrex plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 51 Credit risk Company The only trade receivables of the Company are amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings.
Group The Group manages exposure to credit risk at many levels ranging from Board approval being required for the credit limits of larger customers, to the use of letters of credit and cash in advance where appropriate.
Internal procedures require regular due consideration of credit ratings, payment history, aged items and proactive debt collection.
The Board receives a detailed breakdown every month of all significant credit limits, amounts due and amounts overdue across the Group and, in the case of the latter, the relevant action being taken.
Trade receivables can be analysed as follows: Group Group 2009 2008 000 000 Amounts neither past due nor impaired 12,301 14,202 Amounts past due but not impaired Less than 30 days 1,715 1,616 30 60 days 132 617 More than 60 days 150 578 Total past due but not impaired 1,997 2,811 Amounts impaired 385 663 Impairment allowances 385 663 Carrying amount of impaired receivables Trade receivables net of allowances 14,298 17,013 Trade receivables are considered to be impaired when the amount is in dispute, customers are believed to be in financial difficulty or if any other reason exists which implies that there is a doubt over the recoverability of the debt.
No provision has been made in respect of the amounts shown as past due but not impaired as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable in full.
Movements in the allowance for impairments were: 2009 2008 000 000 At beginning of year 663 426 Release charge in the year 287 192 Exchange adjustments 9 45 At end of year 385 663 The credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties with significant balances are established, international banks.
As at 30 September 2009, the maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits was 6.7m 2008: 9.4m for the Group.
The mark to market exposure on forward foreign exchange contracts is a net liability position with each single bank, both at the current and prior financial year end, due to the weakening of sterling against our major trading currencies.
The amounts on deposit at the year end represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk on cash and deposits.
Victrex Stats 09:Victrex 10 12 09 09:06 Page 36 52 Victrex plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Liquidity risk The Groups objective in terms of funding capacity is to ensure that it always has sufficient short-term and long-term funding available, either in the form of the Groups cash resources or committed bank facilities.
The Group has sufficient funds available in order to meet its current funding requirements for both revenue and capital expenditure.
In order to further manage liquidity risk to an acceptable level, the Group has a committed bank facility of 40m, all of which was undrawn at the year end.
This facility was renewed in 2007 and expires in September 2012.
As at 30 September 2009 the Group had a cash and cash equivalents balance of 18,563,000.
Interest rate risk The Group had no short-term borrowings at the balance sheet date.
Although the Group does hold substantial cash balances its exposure to interest rate risk is not considered to be significant.
Price risk The Groups products contain a number of key raw materials and its operations require energy, notably electricity and natural gas.
Any increase or volatility in prices and any significant decrease in the availability of raw materials or energy could affect the Groups results.
Victrex strives to obtain the best prices and uses contractual means to benefit where appropriate and possible.
The Group has a significant degree of control over its supply chain which enables it to effectively manage the risk in this area.
Capital management The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Groups total equity.
Its policy for managing this capital is to maintain a strong balance sheet to ensure that the Group always has sufficient resources to be able to invest in future growth.
The Groups capital and equity ratio is as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 Total equity 168,227 166,794 Total assets 220,954 223,361 Equity ratio 76% 75% Summary of categories of financial assets and liabilities Carrying Carrying amount and amount and fair value fair value Group Group 2009 2008 Financial assets 000 000 Derivative instruments designated as fair value through profit and loss FVTPL 130 Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 1,572 855 Loans and receivables 15,663 18,195 Cash and cash equivalents 18,563 23,532 Financial liabilities Derivative instruments designated as FVTPL 1,565 Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 4,738 10,455 Trade and other payables 14,582 19,820 The maturity profile and basis of the fair value calculation of the derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships and trade receivables is given on pages 50 and 51 respectively.
For trade and other payables there are no amounts due after one year, the majority falling due in 30 days or less.

Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of pension schemes for its employees throughout the world.
The majority of schemes outside the UK are defined contribution.
The principal scheme operated by the Group is a funded UK pension scheme in which certain employees of subsidiary undertakings participate.
The scheme has two sections.
One section provides benefits on a defined benefit basis with benefits related to final pensionable pay.
The defined benefit section was closed to new members from 31 December 2001.
From this date new employees have been invited to join the second section that provides benefits on a defined contribution basis.

All options are settled by the physical delivery of shares.
The terms and conditions of all the grants are as follows: Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The Victrex 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme came to the end of its 10 year life in 2005.
The exercise price of the granted options is equal to the market price of the shares on the date of grant.
ESOS options are conditional on the employee completing three years service the vesting period.
These options are exercisable starting three years from date of grant only if the Group achieves EPS growth exceeding inflation by an average of at least 3% per annum over the three year vesting period.
These options have a maximum term of ten years.
All employees are eligible to participate in the Executive Plan.
The Remuneration Committee currently excludes executive Directors from participating in this plan.
Option awards are based on a percentage of basic salary, not exceeding 100% of salary.
The exercise price of the options is equal to the market price of the shares on the date of grant.
ESOP options are conditional on the employee completing three years service the vesting period.
These options are exercisable starting three years from date of grant.
The level of awards vesting will vary depending on EPS growth.
In order for awards to vest the Group must achieve EPS growth exceeding the Retail Prices Index by an average of at least 2%, 3% and 4% per annum, over the three year vesting period, for awards up to 33%, from 33% to 66% and from 66% to 100% of salary respectively.
Straight line vesting will occur to the extent that EPS growth falls between these average annual EPS growth targets.

The price payable for each share shall be a price determined by the Board, provided that it shall not be less than 85% of the lower of the market value of a share on the date of grant or the date of purchase.
Awards may be granted over a number of shares determined by the amount employees have saved by the end of a one year savings period.
There are no outstanding options as at balance sheet date 2008: nil.
Victrex 1999 Long Term Incentive Plan 1999 LTIP The 1999 LTIP came to the end of its 10 year life in 2009.
Each year executive Directors were eligible to be awarded options to acquire, at no cost, market purchased shares in the Company up to a maximum equivalent of 100% of basic salary.
The awards have normally become exercisable between the fifth and tenth anniversaries of the grant date, subject to continued employment and the Groups performance over the three year period commencing at the start of the financial year in which the grant is made.
The extent to which an award has been exercisable is dependent on two independent performance conditions with 50% determined by reference to the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR and 50% determined by reference to the Groups earnings per share EPS : The TSR element of an award will vest in full if the TSR ranks in the upper quartile, as measured over the three year period, relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts at the beginning of that period.
This element of the award is reduced to 12.5% on a pro-rata basis for median performance and is reduced to nil for below median performance.
Notwithstanding these provisions, no shares will vest under this performance condition unless, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group over the relevant performance period and, The EPS element of an award will vest in full if EPS growth exceeds inflation, as measured by the Retail Prices Index, by an average of 12% per annum or more over the three year period.
This element of the award is reduced to 10% on a pro-rata basis if EPS growth exceeds inflation by an average of 5% per annum over the period and is reduced to nil if EPS growth fails to exceed inflation by 5% per annum.

Each year executive Directors are eligible to be awarded options to acquire, at no cost, market purchased shares in the Company up to a maximum equivalent of 150% of basic salary.
In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or retention, this limit is increased to 200% of an employees annual base salary.
Awards normally vest in three equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant to the extent that the applicable performance conditions see below have been satisfied and provided the participant is still employed in the Companys Group.
Participants will have a five year period from the date each tranche vests in which to exercise awards structured as nil or nominal cost options.
Participants will receive a payment in cash and or shares on or shortly following the vesting of their awards, of an amount equal to the dividends that would have been paid on those shares between the time when the awards were granted and the time when they vest.
Alternatively, participants may have their awards increased as if dividends were paid on the shares subject to their award and then reinvested in further shares.
The extent to which an award will be exercisable is dependent on two independent performance conditions with 50% determined by reference to the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR and 50% determined by reference to the Groups earnings per share EPS : The TSR element of an award will vest in full if the TSR ranks in the upper quartile, as measured over the three year period, relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts at the beginning of that period.

Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Group hedging policy is to defer the impact on profits of currency movements by hedging a proportion of projected transaction exposures.
Forward exchange contracts are used to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
These forward contracts are entered into on the basis of forecasts of future trading and the valuation of these contracts is calculated using forward exchange market rates.
The valuation of pension scheme liabilities is calculated in accordance with Group policy.
The valuation is prepared by independent qualified actuaries but significant judgements are required in relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension increases, inflation, the discount rate applied, investment returns and member longevity which underpin the valuations.
Note 16 contains information about the assumptions relating to retirement benefit obligations.
The charge for share-based payment transactions is calculated in accordance with Group policy.
The option valuation models used require subjective assumptions to be made including the future volatility of the Groups share price, expected dividend yields, risk free interest rates and expected staff turnover.
The Directors draw upon a variety of external sources to aid the determination of the appropriate data to use in such calculations.
Note 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to share-based payment transactions.
In relation to the Companys property, plant and equipment, useful economic lives and residual values of assets have been established using historical experience and an assessment of the nature of the assets involved.
Assets are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine whether circumstances exist that could lead to a potential impairment of the carrying value of such assets.
No circumstances have been identified to suggest that this is the case.
Goodwill is reviewed annually to assess the requirement for impairment.
Other intangible assets are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine whether circumstances exist that could lead to the conclusion that the carrying value of such assets is not supportable.
Impairment testing on goodwill is carried out as described in note 10.
Such calculations require judgement relating to the appropriate discount factors and long-term growth prevalent in particular markets as well as short-term business performance.
The Directors also draw upon experience in making these judgements.
Note 10 contains information about the assumptions relating to impairment testing.
