Explanatory notes on the impact of the transition to IFRS a Foreign currency translation In applying IAS 21, the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates the Company is required to translate all outstanding foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities on the Balance Sheet at the closing rate.
Under UK GAAP, all hedged assets and liabilities were recorded at the 2009 hedged rate as at 31 December 2008.
Accordingly the Group grossed up all hedged foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities outstanding as at 31 December 2008 from their 2009 hedged rate to the closing year-end exchange rate.
The corresponding hedged assets and liability has been recognised on the Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2008, resulting in no impact on the Income Statement.
b Deferred tax Under UK GAAP deferred tax was recognised in respect of all timing differences, with a few exceptions that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences arise when the pro t or loss is recognised in a different period in the tax computation from that in the financial statements.
Under IFRS the Company is required to adopt a balance sheet approach under which temporary differences are identi ed for each asset and liability rather than accounting for the effects of timing and permanent differences between taxable and accounting pro t. There are presentational changes under IFRS which include classifying deferred tax liabilities and assets as non-current and reporting them separately on the face of the balance sheet.
Accordingly under IFRS deferred tax is recognised on the estimated future tax deduction arising in relation to the exercise of UK employee share options, resulting in an increase in deferred tax assets of US$0.1m and a corresponding increase in retained earnings.
