Unexpected fluctuations in interest rates could cause the corresponding prices of long positions and short positions adopted to move in directions which were not originally anticipated.
In addition, interest rate increases generally increase the interest or carrying costs of investments.
However, the Companys investments designated as at fair value through profit or loss are non interest bearing, and therefore is not exposed to interest rate risk.
The Companys own cash balances are not materially exposed to interest rate risk as cash and cash equivalents are held on floating interest rate deposits with banks and the Company does not rely on income from bank interest to meet day to day expenses.
