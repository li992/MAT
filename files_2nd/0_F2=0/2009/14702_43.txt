On 25 October 2007, six members of the Group, Sports Direct International plc, SportsDirect.
com Retail Limited, Lillywhites Limited, Brands Holdings Limited, Dunlop Slazenger Group Limited and Smith and Brooks Holdings Limited the Borrowers entered into a committed working capital facility agreement with The Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland the Working Capital Facility.
The Working Capital Facility is available to any of the Borrowers and may be drawn to an aggregate limit of 500 million.
It is capable of being utilised by way of cash advances, letters of credit, guarantees, bonds and or currency borrowings.
The Working Capital Facility is available until 30 April 2011.
Each Borrower is required to observe certain covenants, including undertakings relating to delivery of financial statements, and certain negative covenants, including in relation to creation of security and disposal of assets.
The Working Capital Facility is secured by a debenture from each of the Borrowers and a composite guarantee from each of the non-dormant subsidiaries of SportsDirect.
We have previously reported that our strategic stake were held by Kaupthing Singer & Freidlander KSF and partly financed by them.
On 8 October 2008, KSF went into administration and we are in dispute with the administrators concerning the ownership of the shares they hold.
We now have concluded that, while we continue to maintain that the shares are ours and should be delivered to us, we may not control the shares for accounting purposes.
We have therefore treated them in the accounts as having been derecognised.
Doing so has no impact on net assets as the value of the shares 26,219,000 has been replaced by a reduction in creditors 20,298,000 owed to KSF and the recognition of a 5,921,000 receivable.
This derecognition has resulted in the transfer of historic losses, previously recognised in reserves of 53,156,000 into the income statement.
The Group has a 50m working capital facility with Mike Ashley which can be drawn down on request.
The carrying amounts and fair value of the borrowings are not materially different.
