Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued As a result of the Bow Valley acquisition see note 28, the Group acquired an investment in third Investments continued party non-bank sponsored asset backed papers ABCP with a face value of C$40,340,000.
13 These notes should have been repaid prior to the Groups acquisition of Bow Valley, however, they were not repaid due to liquidity issues experienced in the Canadian ABCP market.
As a consequence, these notes were restructured and were replaced with new longer term floating rate notes.
Under the restructuring the Group now owns Class A, Class B and Class C notes.
On acquisition, no reliable quoted market values for ABCP investments were available due to the current market disruption and as a result, the Group determined the fair value of its ABCP investment on acquisition to be 9,448,000 using available information regarding the proposed ABCP restructuring, market conditions and other factors.
These values represented an indicative value of the underlying assets in a liquidation scenario at that date.
During the last few months of the year the liquidity in the market for the notes has greatly increased and the Group has received indicative trading valuations and has increased the fair value of the notes as a result to C$19,535,000, which is a discount of 52% of the face value of the notes.
During the previous year, the Group increased its share in its available-for-sale asset, Faroes through a series of market purchases to 27.53% and as a result the asset was reclassified as an investment in associate.
