22 Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill and intangible assets includes goodwill arising on business combinations, the present value of in-force long-term insurance business, and other intangible assets.
Previously, it formed part of Rest of Asia-Pacific.
Comparative data have been restated accordingly.
During 2009, there was no impairment of goodwill 2008: US$10.6 billion: 2007: nil.
Impairment testing Timing of impairment testing HSBCs impairment test in respect of goodwill allocated to each cash-generating unit CGU is performed as at 1 July each year.
In line with the accounting policy set out in Note 2, goodwill is also retested for impairment whenever there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired.
There was no indication of impairment in the period to 31 December 2009 and therefore goodwill has not been retested since 1 July 2009.
In 2008, an additional impairment test was performed on all CGUs within the Group as at 31 December due to the extraordinary market events experienced globally during the year.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the Groups CGUs are based on customer groups and global business separated by geographical region.
The CGUs represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Basis of the recoverable amount value in use or fair value less costs to sell The recoverable amount of all CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated was equal to its value in use VIU at each respective testing date for 2008 and 2009.
For each significant CGU, the VIU is calculated by discounting managements two year cash flow projections for each CGU.
The discount rate used is based on the cost of capital HSBC allocates to investments in the countries within which the CGU operates.
The long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows in perpetuity because of the long-term perspective within the Group of the business units making up the CGUs.
However, due to the current economic conditions in Personal Financial Services Latin America, a 10 year cash flow projection was used.

These CGUs do not carry on their balance sheets any significant intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, other than goodwill.
Nominal long-term growth rate: external data that reflects the markets assessment of GDP and inflation for the countries within which the CGU operates.
The rates used for 2008 and 2009 are taken as an average of the last 10 years.
Discount rate: the discount rate used to discount the cash flows is based on the cost of capital assigned to each CGU, which is derived using a Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM.
The CAPM depends on inputs reflecting a number of financial and economic variables including the risk-free rate in the country concerned and a premium to reflect the inherent risk of the business being evaluated.
These variables are based on the markets assessment of the economic variables and managements judgement.
In addition, for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, management supplements this process by comparing the discount rates derived using the internally generated CAPM with cost of capital rates produced by external sources.
HSBC uses externally-sourced cost of capital rates where, in managements judgement, those rates reflect more accurately the current market and economic conditions.
In 2008, the rates used in the impairment test for Personal Financial Services Latin America were based on externally sourced rates.
Managements judgement in estimating the cash flows of a CGU: the cash flow projections for each CGU are based on plans approved by the Group Management Board.
The key assumptions in addition to the discount rate and nominal long-term growth rate for each significant CGU are discussed below.
Personal Financial Services Europe and Commercial Banking Europe: the assumptions included in the cash flow projections for Personal Financial Services Europe and Commercial Banking Europe reflect the economic environment and financial outlook of the European countries within these two segments.
Key assumptions include the level of interest rates and the level and change in unemployment rates, particularly in the UK.
While current economic conditions in Europe continue to be challenging, managements cash flow projections are based primarily on these prevailing conditions.
Although the prospects for near term economic growth are uncertain, management does not expect these conditions to continue over the longer term.
The downside risks to this assessment include the risk of a prolonged economic downturn and the continuation of base rates at their current record low levels.
Based on the conditions at the balance sheet date, management determined that a reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions described above would not cause an impairment to be recognised in respect of Personal Financial Services Europe or Commercial Banking Europe.
Private Banking Europe: the revenues in Private Banking Europe are predominately generated through HSBCs client relationships.
For 2010, a modest recovery in client risk appetite is expected, reducing the pressure on brokerage and portfolio management fees.
Thereafter, the nominal long-term growth rates described in the table above have been used.
Based on the conditions at the balance sheet date, management determined that a reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions described above would not cause an impairment to be recognised in respect of Private Banking Europe.
436 Global Banking and Markets Europe: the cash flows generated by Global Banking and Markets Europe are diversified and there is no one key assumption that drives the cash flow projection of this CGU.
The forecast cash flows in the 2010 plan reflect the effect of current flatter yield curves, more stable risk positions and lower volumes offset by increased transaction and management revenue as client risk appetite recovers.
One of the key factors which may impact the carrying value of this CGU is the level of impairment charges which may emerge in the future, particularly in respect of holdings of available-for-sale sub-prime and Alt-A Residential MBSs.
Based on managements current assessment of the credit quality of these securities, which includes stressed scenarios for collateral defaults and house prices, and the level of credit support available, management determined that a reasonably possible change in key assumptions would not cause an impairment to be recognised in respect of Global Banking and Markets Europe.
Personal Financial Services Latin America: the assumptions included in the cash flow projections for Personal Financial Services Latin America reflect the economic environment and financial outlook of the countries within this segment, with Brazil and Mexico being two of the largest countries included within this segment.
Key assumptions include the growth in lending and deposit volumes, the credit quality of the loan portfolios and operational efficiency improvements.
Based on the conditions at the balance sheet date, management determined that a reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions described above would not cause an impairment to be recognised in respect of Personal Financial Services Latin America.
The calculation of the PVIF is based upon assumptions that take into account risk and uncertainty.
To project these cash flows, a variety of assumptions regarding future experience is made by each insurance operation which reflects local market conditions and managements judgement of local future trends.
Some of the Groups insurance operations incorporate risk margins separately in the projection assumptions for each product, while others incorporate risk margins into the overall discount rate.
Both factors are reflected in the wide range of risk discount rates applied.
2 The amortisation charge for the year is recognised within the income statement under Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, with the exception of the amortisation of mortgage servicing rights that is charged to net fee income.
