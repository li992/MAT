Commercial reserves estimates note 10 : Proven and probable reserves are estimated using standard recognised evaluation techniques.
The estimate is reviewed at least twice annually and is regularly reviewed by independent consultants.

Taxation on profit on ordinary activities continued b Factors affecting tax charge for period The tax rates applied to profit on ordinary activities in preparing the reconciliation below is the upstream UK corporation tax applicable to the Groups oil and gas activities plus the rate of Supplementary corporation tax SCT.
The difference between the total current tax charge shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax applicable to UK profits derived from upstream activities 30% plus the rate of SCT in respect of UK upstream profits 20% to the profit before tax is as follows: 2009 2008 m m Group profit on ordinary activities before tax 20.3 299.3 Tax on group profit on ordinary activities at a combined standard UK corporation tax and SCT rate of 50% 2008: 50% 10.1 149.6 Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 7.6 0.9 Utilisation of tax losses not previously recognised 10.7 1.8 Net losses not recognised 38.4 118.4 Petroleum revenue tax PRT 2.7 5.2 UK corporation tax deductions for current PRT 1.3 2.6 Adjustments relating to prior years 4.4 0.4 Income taxed at a different rate 3.5 29.8 Income not subject to corporation tax 41.3 170.0 Group total tax expense for the year 1.8 73.1 The Groups profit before taxation will continue to be subject to jurisdictions where the effective rate of taxation differs from that in the UK.
Furthermore, unsuccessful exploration expenditure is often incurred in jurisdictions where the Group has no taxable profits, such that no related tax benefit arises.
Accordingly, the Groups tax charge will continue to depend on the jurisdictions in which pre-tax profits and exploration costs written off arise.
The Group has tax losses of 363.3 million 2008: 155.0 million that are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits in the companies in which the losses arose.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group.
The Group has recognised 24.4 million in deferred tax assets in relation to taxable losses 2008: nil.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of 277.0 million 2008: 270.0 million relating to unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

These amounts will be written off to the Income Statement as exploration costs unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment.
The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore whether the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.
Additions include capitalised interest of 11.0 million 2008: nil.
The Group only capitalises interest in respect of intangible exploration and evaluation assets where it is considered that development is inevitable and advanced appraisal and development is ongoing.
In 2008 amounts written off included an impairment charge calculated in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets of 60.1 million determined by estimating its value in use.
The impairment resulted from lower reserves estimates following a change in the most likely development plans and lower assumed oil prices following the fall in oil prices in the second half of 2008.
In calculating this impairment, management used a range of assumptions, including a long-term oil price of $80 per barrel and a 15% pre-tax discount rate.

Other fixed assets include leasehold improvements, motor vehicles and office equipment.
The 2009 impairment loss relates to the Chinguetti field in Mauritania 2008: Chinguetti field in Mauritania.
The recoverable amount was determined by estimating its value in use.
In calculating this impairment, management used a production profile based on proven and probable reserves estimates and a range of assumptions, including an oil price assumption equal to the forward curve in 2010 and 2011 and $80 per barrel thereafter and a pre-tax discount rate assumption of 15%.
Depletion and amortisation for oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the end of the period plus production in the period, generally on a field-by-field basis.
Commercial reserves estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Commercial reserves estimates are based on a Group reserves report produced by an independent engineer.
However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the fields life.

Capital management The Group defines capital as the total equity of the Group.
Capital is managed in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits to stakeholders and to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Tullow is not subject to any externallyimposed capital requirements.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may put in place new debt facilities, issue new shares for cash, repay debt, engage in active portfolio management, adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, or other such restructuring activities as appropriate.
No significant changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2009.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt ratio, that is, the ratio of net debt to net debt plus equity.
Net debt is calculated as gross debt, as shown in the balance sheet, less cash and cash equivalents.
2009 2008 m m External borrowings 876.6 711.3 Less cash and cash equivalents 158.3 311.0 Net debt 718.3 400.3 Equity 1,525.9 1,309.2 Net debt ratio 47% 31% The movement from 2008 is attributable to higher external borrowings during 2009, principally as a result of the Groups 757.4 million investment in development, appraisal and exploration activities in conjunction with holding less cash as at 31 December 2009 which is offset by an increase in equity attributable to the equity raise in January 2009.
Interest rate risk The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, excluding trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, at 31 December 2009 was as follows: Stg Euro US$ Other Total m m m m m Cash at bank at floating interest rate 21.6 0.7 122.4 6.0 150.7 Cash at bank on which no interest is received 7.1 0.5 7.6 Fixed rate debt 342.1 342.1 Floating rate debt 37.0 446.3 483.3 Net debt cash 15.4 0.7 658.9 6.5 667.1 128 Tullow Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Accounts The profile at 31 December 2008 for comparison purposes was as follows: Stg Euro US$ Other Total m m m m m Cash at bank at floating interest rate 55.7 1.3 240.2 9.4 306.6 Cash at bank on which no interest is received 4.0 0.5 4.5 Fixed rate debt 34.5 34.5 Floating rate debt 676.9 676.9 Net cash debt 55.7 1.3 467.2 9.9 400.3 Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance from overnight to three months at rates determined by US Dollar LIBOR and Sterling LIBOR.
Fixed rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance for periods greater than three months or bank borrowings where the interest rate has been fixed through interest rate hedging.
The US$2 billion Reserves Based Lending Facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at Sterling or US Dollar LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 350 basis points to 375 basis points.
The outstanding debt is repayable in variable amounts determined semi-annually over the period to 31 December 2015, or such time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier.
There is no requirement under the Reserves Based Lending Facility to hedge interest rate exposure to Sterling LIBOR and US Dollar LIBOR.
The Reserves Based Lending Facility states that consideration should be given to hedging at least 30% of the interest rate exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR for Sterling and US Dollars in respect of loans under the facility, net of relevant cash balances.
The US$250m Revolving Credit Facility is repayable in full on 31 December 2011.
The facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at US Dollar LIBOR plus a margin of 500 basis points.
The Revolving Credit Facility states that the terms of the Reserves Based Lending Facility Hedging Policy above shall apply to the Revolving Credit Facility.
At the end of December 2009, the headroom under the two facilities amounted to US$620 million 389.3 million : US$370 million 232.3 million under the US$2 billion Reserves Based Lending and US$250 million 157.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.
At the end of December 2008, the headroom under the two facilities was US$335 million 231.4 million : US$235 million 162.3 million under the US$1,350 million Reserves Based Lending Facility and US$100 million 69.1 million under the Hardman Bridge Facility.
The Group is exposed to floating rate interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates.
The Group hedges its floating rate interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis through the use of interest rate derivatives, namely interest rate swaps, interest rate collars and interest rate caps.
The Group put in place a material interest rate hedging programme in mid 2009.
The two year interest rate swaps currently in place have an average swap rate of 2.61% for a current notional principal of US$100 million 62.8 million.
The three year interest rate swaps currently in place have an average swap rate of 2.19% for a current notional principal of US$250 million 156.7 million.
The five year interest rate swaps currently in place have an average swap rate of 3.14% for a notional principal of US$50 million 31.4 million.
The effect of the interest rate collar currently in place limits the exposure to US Dollar LIBOR at varying rates maximum of 4.3% over the remaining life of the derivative May 2011 for a current notional principal of US$50 million 31.4 million.
The combined mark-to-market position as at 31 December 2009 was 5.6 million out of the money 2008: 2.1 million out of the money.
The interest rate hedges excluding the collar are included in the fixed rate debt in 2009, in the above table, and were also included in the fixed rate debt in 2008.
Foreign currency risk Wherever possible, the Group conducts and manages its business in Sterling UK and US Dollars all other countries, the operating currencies of the industry in the areas in which it operates.
The Groups borrowing facilities are also denominated in Sterling and US Dollars, which further assists in foreign currency risk management.
From time to time the Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
These exposures are managed by executing foreign currency financial derivatives, typically to manage exposures arising on corporate transactions such as acquisitions and disposals.
There were no foreign currency financial derivatives in place at the 2009 year end.
Cash balances are held in other currencies to meet immediate operating and administrative expenses or to comply with local currency regulations.
As at 31 December 2009, the only material monetary assets or liabilities of the Group that were not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were US$1,337 million 839.4 million cash drawings under the US$2 billion Reserved Based Lending Facility.
As at 31 December 2008, the only material monetary assets or liabilities of the Group that were not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were US$930 million 642.3 million cash drawings under the US$1,350 million Borrowing Base Facility and US$100 million 69.1 million cash drawings under the US$200 million Hardman Bridge Facility.
These US Dollar cash drawings at 31 December 2009 continue to be held as a hedge against US Dollar denominated net assets in subsidiaries.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are net liabilities of 739.9 million 2008: net liabilities of 444.5 million.
com 129 Financial statements Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 17.
Financial liabilities continued Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to fluctuations in the US Dollar.
The Group measures its market risk exposure by running various sensitivity analyses including 20% favourable and adverse changes in the key variables.
The sensitivity analyses include only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 20% change in foreign currency rates.
As at 31 December 2009, a 20% increase in Sterling against the US Dollar would have resulted in a decrease in foreign currency denominated liabilities and equity of 142.3 million 2008: 133.1 million and a 20% decrease in Sterling against US Dollar would have resulted in an increase in foreign currency denominated liabilities and equity of 213.4 million 2008: 199.7 million.
Liquidity risk The Group manages the liquidity requirements by the use of both shortand long-term cash flow projections, supplemented by maintaining debt financing plans and active portfolio management.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short-, mediumand long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk.
Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities run for different scenarios including, but not limited to, changes in commodity prices, different production rates from the Groups portfolio of producing fields and delays in development projects.
The Group normally seeks to ensure that it has a minimum ongoing capacity of $500 million 320 million for a period of at least 12 months to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Following the equity placing announced in January 2010, the planned portfolio activity and the US$2 billion financing already secured in March 2009, the Groups forecasts and projections show that there is significant capacity and financial flexibility for the 12 months from the date of this Annual Report and Accounts.
After taking account of the above, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
The following table details the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.

Financial instruments Financial risk management objectives The Group holds a portfolio of commodity derivative contracts, with various counterparties, covering both its underlying oil and gas businesses.
In addition, the Group holds a small portfolio of interest rate derivatives.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the internal auditors on a regular basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The Group considers the carrying value of all the financial assets and liabilities to be materially the same as the fair value.
The Group has no material financial assets that are past due.
The Group predominately sells to large oil and gas multinationals and no financial assets are impaired at the balance sheet date and all are considered to be fully recoverable.
Fair values of derivative instruments Under IAS 39 all derivatives must be recognised at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in such fair value between accounting periods being recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives have been designated as cash flow or fair value hedges.
The fair value is the amount for which the asset or liability could be exchanged in an arms length transaction at the relevant date.
Fair values are determined using quoted market prices marked-to-market values where available.
To the extent that market prices are not available, fair values are estimated by reference to market-based transactions, or using standard valuation techniques for the applicable instruments and commodities involved.
The Groups derivative instrument book and fair values were as follows: Less than One to Total Less than One to Total one year three years 2009 one year three years 2008 Assets liabilities : m m m m m m Cash flow hedges Gas derivatives 8.4 8.4 5.6 5.2 10.8 Oil derivatives 3.2 10.7 13.9 26.5 35.7 62.2 Interest rate derivatives 3.8 1.8 5.6 0.9 1.2 2.1 1.4 12.5 11.1 20.0 29.3 49.3 The derivatives maturity and the timing of the recycling into profit or loss coincide.
The following provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Level 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: All derivative financial instruments of the Group are level 2 2008: level 2.
Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 during the year.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
com 131 Financial statements Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 18.
Financial instruments continued Oil and gas prices The Group uses a number of derivative instruments to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with its underlying oil and gas revenues.
Such commodity derivatives will tend to be priced using pricing benchmarks, such as Brent Dated, D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren, which correlate as far as possible to the underlying oil and gas revenues respectively.
The Group hedges its estimated oil and gas revenues on a portfolio basis, aggregating its oil revenues from substantially all of its African oil interests and its gas revenues from substantially all of its UK gas interests.
At 31 December 2009, the Groups oil hedge position was summarised as follows: Oil hedges H1 2010 H2 2010 2011 2012 Volume bopd 14,500 14,500 10,500 6,500 Average Price $ bbl 81.39 83.83 85.77 88.02 Average hedge prices are based on market prices as at 31 December 2009 and represent the current value of hedged volumes at that date.
At 31 December 2009, the Groups gas hedge position was summarised as follows: Gas hedges H1 2010 H2 2010 2011 2012 Volume mmscfd 32.73 19.71 10.43 4.31 Average Price p therm 42.56 45.22 49.11 50.50 Average hedge prices are based on market prices as at 31 December 2009 and represent the current value of hedged volumes at that date.
As at 31 December 2009, all of the Groups oil and gas derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges.
The Groups oil and gas hedges have been assessed to be highly effective within the range prescribed under IAS 39 using regression analysis on oil and ratio analysis on gas.
There is, however, a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups oil hedges arising from, among other factors, the discount on the Groups underlying African crude relative to Brent and the timing of oil liftings relative to the hedges.
There is also a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups gas hedges which arise from, among other factors, field production performance on any day.
Income statement hedge summary The changes in the fair value of hedges which are required to be recognised immediately in the income statement for the year were as follows: 2009 2008 Loss gain on hedging instruments: m m Cash flow hedges Gas derivatives Ineffectiveness 0.1 Time value 4.1 4.3 4.1 4.4 Oil derivatives Ineffectiveness 4.3 8.2 Time value 37.0 30.3 41.3 38.5 Total net loss gain for the year in the income statement 37.2 42.9 The following table summarises the deferred losses gains on derivative instruments, net of tax effects, recorded in the hedge reserve note 23 for the year: 2009 2008 Deferred amounts in the hedge reserve m m At 1 January 29.0 132.0 Amounts recognised in profit for the year 37.2 42.9 Deferred losses gains before tax arising during the year 61.8 206.2 Deferred tax movement taken directly to equity 8.2 2.3 32.8 161.0 At 31 December 3.8 29.0 132 Tullow Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 2008 Deferred amounts in the hedge reserve net of tax effects m m Cash flow hedges Gas derivatives 5.5 3.6 Oil derivatives 3.7 34.1 Interest rate derivatives 5.6 1.5 3.8 29.0 The hedge reserve represents the cumulative portion of gains and losses on hedging instruments deemed effective in cash flow hedges.
The movement for the period in the hedge reserve is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Gains from settlements during the period amounted to 15.3 million, while revaluation losses during the period amounted to 25.6 million.
The resulting total reclassification from equity to profit or loss during the period was 40.9 million.
Gains transferred from equity into profit and loss during the period of 15.3 million are included in the revenue line.
Financial derivatives The Group internally measures its market risk exposure by running various sensitivity analyses, including utilising 10% favourable and adverse changes in the key variables.
Oil and gas sensitivity analysis The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being Dated Brent oil prices and UK D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren natural gas prices.
The sensitivity analysis, which is used internally by management to monitor financial derivatives, has been prepared using the following assumptions: The pricing adjustments relate only to the point forward mark-to-market MTM evaluations: The price sensitivities assume there is no ineffectiveness related to the oil and gas hedges: and The sensitivities have been run only on the intrinsic element of the hedge as management consider this to be the material component of the MTM oil and gas hedges.
As at 31 December 2009, a 10% increase in the dated Brent oil price curve would have decreased equity by approximately 10.3 million 2008: 22.0 million, a 10% decrease would have increased equity by approximately 6.6 million 2008: 27.0 million.
As at 31 December 2009, a 10% increase in the UK D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren natural gas price curves would have decreased equity by approximately 2.9 million 2008: 10.5 million, a 10% decrease would have increased equity by approximately 3.2 million 2008: 10.3 million.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis As at 31 December 2009, the interest rate derivative position was out-of-the-money to an amount of 5.6 million 2008: 2.1 million : a 25bps increase in the underlying interest rate would increase equity by approximately 1.5 million 2008: 0.5 million.
Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due, resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The primary activities of the Group are oil and gas exploration and production.
The Group has a credit policy that governs the management of credit risk, including the establishment of counterparty credit limits and specific transaction approvals.
The Group limits credit risk by assessing creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their credit worthiness after transactions have been initiated.
The Group attempts to mitigate credit risk by entering into contracts that permit netting and allow for termination of the contract upon the occurrence of certain events of default.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics.
The maximum financial exposure due to credit risk on the Groups financial assets, representing the sum of cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivative assets, trade receivables and other current assets, as at 31 December was 404.2 million 2008: 490.2 million.

These provisions have been created based on Tullows internal estimates and, where available and appropriate, operators estimates.
Assumptions, based on the current economic environment, have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable.
This involves an assessment of when those deferred tax assets are likely to reverse, and a judgement as to whether or not there will be sufficient taxable profits available to offset the tax assets when they do reverse.
This requires assumptions regarding future profitability and is therefore inherently uncertain.
To the extent assumptions regarding future profitability change, there can be an increase or decrease in the level of deferred tax assets recognised which can result in a charge or credit in the period in which the change occurs.

Share-based payments 2005 Performance Share Plan PSP Under the PSP, senior executives can receive conditional awards of rights over whole shares worth up to 200% of salary p. a.
Awards granted in 2009 vest subject to a Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition.
Half of an award is tested against constituents of the FTSE 100 index excluding investment trusts and the other half against a comparator group of oil and gas companies.
Performance is measured over a fixed three year period starting on 1 January prior to grant, and an individual must normally remain in employment for three-years from grant for the shares to vest.
No dividends are paid over the vesting period.
There are further details of PSP award measurement in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 94.

Share-based payments continued 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The only share option scheme operated by the Company during the year was the 2000 ESOS.
Options normally only become exercisable from the third anniversary of the date of the grant and if the performance condition has been met.
The awards are tested against constituents of an index and 100% of awards will vest if the Companys TSR is above the median of the index over three years following grant.
For awards from March 2008 the Index is the FTSE 100 index excluding investment trusts : for awards before March 2008, the Index is the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts.
Options granted under the previous 1998 ESOS had all been exercised at 31 December 2009.
All awards under the 1998 ESOS were made prior to 7 November 2002 and therefore, under the IFRS transitional provisions, they have not been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based payments.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices WAEP of, and movements in, share options under the 1998 ESOS and the 2000 ESOS during the year.
Options outstanding at 31 December 2009 had exercise prices of 63.0p to 1,179.0p and remaining contractual lives of 1 to 10 years.
The fair values were calculated using a proprietary binomial valuation model.
The principal inputs to the options valuation model were: Risk free interest rate 1.9-2.5% pa Expected volatility 49% Dividend yield 0.5-0.8% pa Employee turnover 5% pa Early exercise At rates dependent upon potential gain from exercise Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over a period commensurate with the expected lifetime of the awards.

These are all employee plans, which have been set up in the UK and Ireland, enable employees to save out of salary up to prescribed monthly limits.
Contributions are used by the Plan trustees to acquire Tullow shares Partnership Shares.
The Company makes a matching contribution to acquire a matching number of Tullow shares Matching Shares on a one-for-one basis at the end of each three month accumulation period.
Matching shares are subject to time based forfeiture over three years on leaving employment in certain circumstances or if the related Partnership shares are sold.
The fair value of a Matching Share is its market value at the start of the accumulation period.
For the UK plan, Partnership Shares are purchased at the lower of the market values at the start of the Accumulation Period and the purchase date which is treated as a three month share option for IFRS 2 purposes.
For the Irish plan, shares are bought at the market price at the purchase date which does not result in any IFRS 2 accounting charge.
