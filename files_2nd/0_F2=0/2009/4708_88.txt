Intangible assets continued a Brands are stated at fair value on acquisition.
At 30 June 2009, the principal acquired brands, all of which are regarded as having indefi nite useful economic lives, were as follows: 2009 2008 Financial statements Principal market Product million million 97 Independent auditors Carrying amount of acquired brands report to the members Smirnoff Global Vodka 499 414 of Diageo plc in respect of the consolidated Johnnie Walker Global Whisky 625 625 fi financial statements Captain Morgan Global Rum 728 604 98 Consolidated Crown Royal United States Whisky 888 736 income statement 99 Consolidated Windsor Premier Korea Whisky 414 416 statement of Cacique Spain Rum 181 168 recognised income Bells Great Britain Whisky 179 179 and expense Bushmills United States Whiskey 144 144 100 Consolidated balance sheet Seagrams 7 Crown United States Whiskey 135 113 101 Consolidated cash Gordons Great Britain Gin 119 119 fl ow statement Seagrams VO United States Whisky 115 96 102 Accounting policies of the group Old Parr Venezuela Whisky 95 78 106 N otes to the Ursus Southern Europe Vodka 72 67 consolidated Tanqueray United States Gin 72 60 fi financial statements 149 Independent auditors Bundaberg Australia Rum 66 65 report to the members Chalone Vineyard United States Wine 64 52 of Diageo plc in respect White Horse Russia and Eastern Europe Whisky 53 53 of the parent company Romana Sambuca United States Liqueur 52 43 fi financial statements 150 Company Other brands 120 107 balance sheet 4,621 4,139 151 Accounting policies of the company 152 Notes to the company Capitalised brands are regarded as having indefi nite useful economic lives and have therefore not been amortised.
These brands are protected fi financial statements by trademarks, which are renewable indefi nitely, in all of the major markets where they are sold.
There are not believed to be any legal, 155 Principal group regulatory or contractual provisions that limit the useful lives of these brands.
The nature of the premium drinks industry is that obsolescence is not companies a common issue, with indefi nite brand lives being commonplace, and Diageo has a number of brands that were originally created more than 100 years ago.
Accordingly the directors believe that it is appropriate that the brands are treated as having indefi nite lives for accounting purposes.
b For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill has been attributed to cash-generating units as follows: 2009 2008 million million North America United States 192 195 Europe Ireland 43 43 Southern Europe 69 65 Russia and Eastern Europe 42 28 Other cash-generating units 17 19 363 350 Goodwill has arisen on acquisitions of businesses and distribution rights and includes synergies arising from cost savings and the opportunity to utilise the groups distribution network to leverage marketing of the acquired products.
In the year ended 30 June 2008, the minority interest recognised on the acquisition of the distribution rights for Ketel One vodka products excluded the minoritys share of the deferred tax liability relating to the intangible asset that represents the distribution rights.
This omission has been corrected in the current year, and the eff ect of the adjustment is to reduce goodwill attributed to the United States by 58 million and reduce minority interests by the same amount.
c Other intangibles principally comprise distribution rights.
In the year ended 30 June 2008, Diageo acquired the global distribution rights for Ketel One vodka products in perpetuity, and the directors believe that it is appropriate to treat these rights as having an indefi nite life for accounting purposes.
The carrying value at 30 June 2009 was 1,091 million 2008 905 million.
All other distribution rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over the length of the distribution arrangements, generally between 10 and 20 years, unless there is an indication that the asset may be impaired, in which case, if necessary, the asset is written down or the amortisation period is reassessed and changed.
Amortisation of other intangible assets is recognised in other operating expenses in the income statement.
d Computer software includes 25 million 2008 35 million in respect of projects in the course of development.
Amortisation of computer software is recognised in other operating expenses in the income statement.
Performance summary Business description Business review Governance Financial statements Additional information Notes to the consolidated 125 fi financial statements Impairment testing To ensure that brands, goodwill and other intangibles with indefi nite useful lives are not carried at above their recoverable amount, impairment reviews are performed comparing the net carrying value with the recoverable amount using value in use calculations.
For goodwill the recoverable amount is calculated in respect of the cash-generating unit including the attributed goodwill.
These calculations are performed annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The value in use calculations are based on discounted forecast cash fl ows and terminal values calculated on the assumption that cash fl ows continue in perpetuity at the long term growth rate of each country or region.
Cash fl ows are forecast for each brand, other intangible and cash-generating unit for the next fi financial year in the groups annual fi financial plan, which is approved by the board and refl ects managements expectations of sales growth, operating costs and margin, based on past experience and external sources of information.
For global brands, the discount rate used for the value in use calculations is the groups weighted average cost of capital with appropriate adjustments where necessary to refl ect a market participants assessment.
For other brands and other intangibles, the rate used is the groups weighted average cost of capital for global brands, adjusted for appropriate risks in the relevant country or region where the cash fl ows are generated.
The long term growth rates applied at the end of the forecast period are taken as the real gross domestic product GDP growth rate of the country or region plus its infl ation rate, based on a three-year average.
For brands and other intangibles, the rates used are based on the country or countries where the cash fl ows are generated.
For goodwill this is based on the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill is attributed.
For the Ketel One vodka distribution rights, the principal market is the United States.
For some recently acquired intangible assets, management expects to achieve growth, driven by Diageos sales, marketing and distribution expertise, which is in excess of the long term growth rates for the applicable countries or regions.
In these circumstances, the cash fl ow forecast is extended beyond the next fi financial year by up to fi five years using a detailed plan.
For the Ketel One vodka distribution rights, a seven-year plan has been used, as an eight-year plan was agreed with the Nolet Group on the date of the acquisition 9 June 2008, and principally refl ects the benefi ts forecast to arise when Ketel One vodka is launched in a number of countries throughout the world during that longer period.
The pre-tax discount rates and long term growth rates used for impairment testing are as follows: 2009 2008 Pre-tax Long term Pre-tax Long term discount growth discount growth rate rate rate rate % % % % Global brands 12 4.9 12 5.4 North America United States 12 3.4 13 4.2 Europe Great Britain 12 4.9 12 4.0 Ireland 10 2.9 12 3.3 Spain 11 3.7 12 3.3 Southern Europe 11 2.9 12 3.3 Russia and Eastern Europe 28 12.1 24 17.4 International Venezuela 54 31.3 43 27.5 Asia Pacifi c Australia 14 4.5 13 6.3 Korea 16 7.1 14 6.9 The impairment testing for Ketel One vodka distribution rights uses both the pre-tax discount rate and the long term growth rate for the United States for the period after the seven-year plan.
Any impairment writedowns identifi ed are charged to other operating expenses in the income statement.
In the year ended 30 June 2009, there are no impairment writedowns 2008 and 2007 nil.
Sensitivity to change in key assumptions Impairment testing is dependent on managements estimates and judgements, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash fl ows, the discount rates applied to those cash fl ows and the expected long term growth rates.
The impairment reviews of the Ursus brand and Ketel One vodka distribution rights show limited headroom.
This is because they were recently acquired and have been aff ected in the short term by the slowdown in the worldwide economy experienced during the year.
The recoverable amount of the Ursus brand is equal to the book value.
For the Ketel One vodka distribution rights, the recoverable amount exceeds the book value by 10 million.
Management will closely monitor the value in use of these intangibles.
For all intangibles with an indefi nite life, other than Ursus and Ketel One vodka, management has concluded that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which it has determined the recoverable amounts would cause their carrying values to exceed their recoverable amounts.
The table below shows the impairment charge that would be required if the assumptions in the calculation of their value in use were changed: 5% 1% 1% decrease increase in decrease in in forecast discount long term annual rate growth rate cash fl ows million million million Brands Ursus 9 8 3 Other brands Goodwill Other intangibles Ketel One vodka 105 65 44 It remains possible that changes in assumptions could arise in excess of those indicated in the table above.
