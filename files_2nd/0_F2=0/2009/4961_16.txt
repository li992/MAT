The placing raised 105.5 million and was undertaken to help maintain the Groups investment grade debt rating, with the proceeds used to pay down debt on 31 July 2009.
The placing shares have been credited as fully paid and rank equally in all respects with the existing ordinary shares of 16 11 pence each in the capital of the Company, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, 29 made or paid in respect of such shares after the date of issue of the placing shares.
The share placing was achieved through a cash box placing arrangement.
The benefit of a cash box placing arrangement is that it is legally structured to enable the merger relief criteria within the Companies Act 1985 to apply.
Accordingly the funds raised in excess of the nominal value of the shares issued have been treated as distributable within retained reserves rather than credited to the share premium account.
As a consequence, of the 105.5 million funds raised, share capital increased by 2.9 million, and the balance of 102.6 million increased the Companys profit and loss account reserve in the year ended 31 December 2009.
Issued under employee share schemes 16 During 2008, a total of 1,968 ordinary shares of 11 29 pence each were issued in satisfaction of share options which were exercised in accordance with the rules of the SAYE Plan.
There were no such issues in 2009.
The Company has only one class of ordinary shares, which carry no right to fixed income.
No shareholders have waived their rights to dividends.
