Assuming that movie subscriber numbers remain unchanged from current levels, an additional 551 million US$879 million of commitments 2008: 296 million, US$590 million would also be payable in US dollars, relating to price escalator clauses.
The pound sterling television programme rights commitments include similar price escalation clauses that would result in additional commitments of 1 million 2008: 3 million if subscriber numbers were to remain at current levels.
ii The third party payment commitments are in respect of distribution agreements for the television channels owned and broadcast by third parties, retailed by the Group to retail and commercial subscribers Sky Distributed Channels and are for periods of up to five years 2008: six years.
The extent of the commitment is largely dependent upon the number of retail subscribers to the relevant Sky Distributed Channels, and in certain cases, upon inationary increases.
If both the retail subscriber levels to these channels and the rate payable for each Sky Distributed Channel were to remain at current levels subject to inationary increases, the additional commitment would be 533 million 2008: 636 million.
iii Transponder capacity commitments are in respect of the Astra and Eurobird satellites that the Group uses for digital transmissions to both retail subscribers and cable operators.
The commitments are for periods of up to eleven years 2008: twelve years.
No additional agreements were entered into in the year ended 30 June 2009. iv On 21 December 2007, the Group entered into a property development agreement to construct a new production and broadcast centre.
v In December 2008, the Group entered into a new contractual agreement with NDS, a related party, for the provision of smartcards.
b Contingent assets The Group has served a claim for a material amount against EDS an information and technology solutions provider which provided services to the Group as part of the Groups investment in customer management systems software and infrastructure.
The amount which may be recovered by the Group will not be nally determined until resolution of the claim.
c Contingent liabilities and guarantees On 7 May 2008 the Nomenclature Committee of the European Commission issued an Explanatory Note EN 0590 2007 to the Combined Nomenclature setting out their view that set-top boxes with a hard drive should be classied under Customs Tariff heading 8521 90 00 and so subject to a 13.9% ad valorem duty on importation to the EU.
As a consequence the Group is exposed to potential retrospective Customs Duty liability in respect of such set-top boxes imported by Amstrad acquired in September 2007 and for the reimbursement of certain suppliers in line with the terms of contractual supply agreements.
Managements opinion is that the retrospective application of the Explanatory Note would be wrong as a matter of law.
In addition management considers that the adoption of the EN puts the EU in breach of the Information Technology Agreement of 1996, a view which is shared by the US, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan who have instigated WTO proceedings against the EU on this matter.
The Group therefore is, in common with other affected importers, defending its position on this matter and consequently has lodged an appeal to the VAT & Duties Tribunal regarding classication of these products.
This matter has been referred by the Tribunal to the European Court of Justice.
The Group has also lodged an appeal with HMRC against the assessment for retrospective duty.
As a result of the potential remedies available under the Community Customs Code, the Group considers that in the event that an assessment is made for import duty relating to imports prior to 7 May 2008, it is probable that no outow of economic benefit would be required to discharge this obligation, and that as such at 30 June 2009 any liability should be considered contingent.
Certain subsidiaries of the Company have agreed to provide additional funding to several of their investments in limited and unlimited companies and partnerships, in accordance with funding agreements.
Payment of this additional funding would be required if requested by the investees in accordance with the funding agreements.
The maximum potential amount of future payments which may be required to be made by the subsidiaries of the Company to their investments, in both limited and unlimited companies and partnerships under the undertakings and additional funding agreements, is 6 million 2008: 11 million.
The Group has guarantees in place relating to the Groups borrowings, see note 22 Borrowings and non-current other payables.
