As the direct method of presentation has been adopted for these activities, no further disclosure is required.

278 Aviva plc Notes to the Companys Annual Report and Accounts 2009 financial statements A Restatement of prior year figures The Company runs sterling and currency intercompany accounts with subsidiaries.
During the year, it was discovered that incorrect foreign exchange rates had been applied to one of these accounts, with the result that the Company incorrectly recorded a foreign exchange loss of 87 million in 2008.
The correcting entry has resulted in a reduction in expenses in 2008 of 87 million, an increase to the 2008 tax charge of 25 million, a reduction in the 2008 current tax asset of 25 million, an increase in other amounts owed by subsidiaries of 87 million and an increase in retained earnings of 62 million as at 31 December 2008.
B Investments in subsidiaries i Movements in the Companys investments in its subsidiaries are as follows: 2009 2008 2007 m m m Fair value as at 1 January 16,353 24,466 27,886 Movement in fair value 883 8,113 3,420 At 31 December 17,236 16,353 24,466 Fair values are estimated using applicable valuation models underpinned by the Companys market capitalisation, and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described in note 24 b to the Group consolidated financial statements.
ii At 31 December 2009, the Company has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, both incorporated in Great Britain.
These are General Accident plc and Aviva Group Holdings Limited.
Aviva Group Holdings Limited is an intermediate holding company, whilst General Accident plc no longer carries out this function.
The principal subsidiaries of the Aviva Group at 31 December 2008 are listed on pages 33 and 34.
C Operating expenses i Operating expenses Operating expenses comprise: Restated 2009 2008 m m Staff costs and other employee related expenditure see below 130 86 Other operating costs 20 109 Net foreign exchange losses gains 44 170 Total 194 25 ii Staff costs Total staff costs were: 2009 2008 m m Wages and salaries 85 49 Social security costs 9 7 Post-retirement obligations Defined benefit schemes see iii below 6 6 Defined contribution schemes 6 3 Profit sharing and incentive plans 9 3 Equity compensation plans see iv below 12 11 Termination benefits 3 7 Total 130 86 iii Pension costs The Company is one of a number of UK companies being charged for its employees participating in the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme, and its contributions are affected by the financial position of the scheme.
There is no contractual agreement or policy for charging the net defined benefit cost for this scheme across the participating Group entities but, instead, this cost is recognised in the financial statements of the main UK employing company.
The Company therefore recognises a pension expense equal to its contributions payable in the year for its staff, together with the service cost of any unfunded benefits, within staff costs above.
Full disclosure on the Groups pension schemes is given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 47.
Financial statements IFRS 279 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the Companys financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information iv Equity compensation plans All transactions in the Groups equity compensation plans involve options and awards for ordinary shares of the Company.
Full disclosure of these plans is given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 29.
The cost of such options and awards is borne by all participating businesses and, where relevant, the Company bears an appropriate charge.
As the majority of the charge to the Company relates to directors options and awards, for which full disclosure is made in the Directors remuneration report, no further disclosure is given here on the grounds of immateriality.

The taxation of foreign profits and worldwide debt cap rules were enacted in the Finance Act 2009.
Under the foreign profits rules, a dividend exemption was introduced which largely exempts dividends received on or after 1 July 2009 from UK corporation tax.
The Company has applied this legislation in arriving at its tax results for 2009.
The worldwide debt cap rules apply from 1 January 2010 and are not expected to apply to the Company due to an exemption for qualifying financial services groups.

Annual interest payments for these borrowings are 74 million 2008: 77 million.
The fair value of the subordinated debt at 31 December 2009 was 4,372 million 2008: 2,979 million.
The fair value of the 9.5% guaranteed bonds 2016 at 31 December 2009 was 238 million 2008: 224 million.
The fair value of the commercial paper is considered to be the same as its carrying value.
Further details of these borrowings and undrawn committed facilities can be found in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 48.
G Contingent liabilities Details of the Companys contingent liabilities are given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 51 j.
Financial statements IFRS 281 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the Companys financial statements continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information H Risk management Risk management in the context of the Group is considered in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 56.
The business of the Company is managing its investments in subsidiary and joint venture operations.
Its risks are considered to be the same as those in the operations themselves and full details of the risk management policies are given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 56.
Such investments are held by the Company at fair value in accordance with accounting policy D. The fair values of the subsidiaries and joint venture are estimated using applicable valuation models, underpinned by the Companys market capitalisation.
This uses a three month rolling average of the Companys share price.
Given that the key input into the valuation model is based on an observable current share price, and therefore sensitive to movements in that price, the valuation process is not sensitive to non-observable market assumptions.
Management believes the resulting estimated fair values recorded in the balance sheet and any changes in fair values recorded in the income statement are reasonable, and are the most appropriate values at the balance sheet date.
Financial assets, other than investments in subsidiaries and the joint venture, largely consist of amounts due from subsidiaries.
As at the balance sheet date, these receivable amounts were neither past due nor impaired.
Financial liabilities owed by the Company as at the balance sheet date are largely in respect of borrowings details of which are provided in note F and the Group consolidated financial statements, note 48 and loans owed to subsidiaries.
Loans owed to subsidiaries were within agreed credit terms as at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate risk Loans to and from subsidiaries are at either fixed or floating rates of interest, with the latter being exposed to fluctuations in these rates.
The choice of rates is designed to match the characteristics of financial investments which are also exposed to interest rate fluctuations held in both the Company and the relevant subsidiary, to mitigate as far as possible each companys net exposure.
The majority of the Companys external borrowings are at fixed rates of interest and are therefore not exposed to changes in these rates.
However, for those borrowings that are at floating rates, the Company is affected by changes in these rates.
Further details of the Company's borrowings are provided in note F and the Group consolidated financial statements, note 48.
Currency risk The Companys direct subsidiaries are all incorporated and operating in the UK, and therefore are not exposed to currency risk.
However, these subsidiaries are themselves exposed to foreign currency risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates during the course of providing insurance and asset management services around the world.
The exposure of the subsidiaries to currency risk is considered from a Group perspective in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 56.
The Company faces exposure to foreign currency risk through some of its borrowings which are denominated in euros and US dollars.
However, most of these borrowings have been on-lent to a subsidiary which holds financial investments in these currencies, generating the net investment hedge described in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 57 a iii.
