During the prior year, the Group amended the terms of its dened benefit pension scheme.
This amendment restricts the annual increase in pensionable pay qualifying earnings to the lower of ination or 5%.
The effect of this change was a curtailment benefit that was recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as an exceptional credit of 22.0 million.
Also during the prior year, the Group initiated a Group-wide project to transform its IT infrastructure, software and business operations.
This led the directors to conclude that the carrying value of certain intangible and tangible assets that were previously used in its operations were impaired and they were written down by 6.7 million.
The exceptional credit generated a tax charge of 4.3 million.
There was no cash impact from the exceptional items arising in the prior year.

Goodwill arising on business combinations is reviewed and tested on an annual basis or more frequently if there is indication that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit CGU, including goodwill, with the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding operating profit, discount rates and growth rates.
The operating profit is based on the latest forecasts for the CGUs approved by management and management estimates discount rates using post-tax rates that reect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the CGUs.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management and extrapolates cash ows for the following years based on the long-term growth rates.
The long-term growth rates are based on management forecasts of an average estimated growth rate of 3.0% 2008 3.0%, reecting long-term wage ination fee growth.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash ows is 9.0% post tax 2008 9.5%.
The reduction on the prior year discount rate is driven by a fall in risk-free return.
Impairment reviews were performed at the year end by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
Management determined that there has been no impairment.
Given the current economic climate, a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill.
This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be possible by management.
This included an increase in the discount factor of up to 0.5% and a decrease in the long-term growth rate of up to 1%.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would arise under each scenario other than in the case of a part of Asia Pacic.
This has no headroom based on current assumptions, where a reduction in the discount factor and long-term growth rate would result in an impairment of up to 1.5 million.
Management will continue to monitor this acquisition but do not consider impairment appropriate.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows: In s million 2009 2008 United Kingdom & Ireland 92.4 92.4 Continental Europe & Rest of World 62.6 58.2 Asia Pacific 19.9 18.3 174.9 168.9 14 Other intangible assets In s million 2009 2008 Cost At 1 July 14.1 6.9 Exchange adjustments 0.3 0.5 Additions 34.6 6.7 Disposals 0.3 At 30 June 48.7 14.1 Amortisation At 1 July 8.7 2.6 Exchange adjustments 0.2 0.4 Charge for year 1.2 1.7 Impairment charge note 5 4.0 At 30 June 10.1 8.7 Net book value At 30 June 38.6 5.4 80 Hays plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 14 Other intangible assets continued Other intangible asset additions in the current year include 4.9 million in relation to internally generated intangible assets 2008 0.7 million.

The majority of overseas arrangements are either dened contribution or government-sponsored schemes and these arrangements are not material in the context of the Group results.
UK Dened Contribution Scheme The Hays Stakeholder Pension Plan was established on 1 July 2001.
Money purchase benets are funded by contributions from employees and, for eligible employees, from the employer.
Employer contributions are in the range of 2% to 18% of pensionable salary depending on the length of pensionable service and seniority.
The total cost charged to the Consolidated Income Statement of 1.4 million 2008 1.1 million represents employers contributions payable to the Stakeholder Pension Plan.
Contributions of 0.1 million 2008 nil were outstanding at the end of the year.
The assets of the Stakeholder Pension Plan are held separately from those of the Group.
UK Dened benefit Schemes i The Hays Pension Scheme, is a dened benefit scheme where the benets are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
It is a funded approved dened benefit scheme and closed to new members on 1 July 2001.
It is funded through a legally separate trustee administered fund.
ii The Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme is a supplementary unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme for employees who were subject to HMRCs earnings cap on pensionable salary.
The last formal actuarial valuations were performed at 30 June 2006.
A roll forward of the actuarial valuations of the Hays Pension Scheme and the Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme to 30 June 2009 has been performed by the Scheme actuary, an employee of Mercer Human Resource Consulting.
The key assumptions used at 30 June 2009 are listed on the following page.
IAS 19 accounting valuation Hays plc has applied the accounting requirements of IAS 19 as follows: scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date: scheme liabilities are measured using a projected-unit credit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liability: and actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the Consolidated Income Statement, in retained earnings and presented in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.

The long-term expected rate of return on scheme assets does not affect the level of the obligation but does affect the expected return on pension scheme assets within the net finance charge income.
The mortality rates have been calculated using the PA92 generational mortality tables with a medium cohort projection.
This assumes that a 65-year old, male, current pensioner has a life expectancy of 21.9 years.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption for the portfolio.

No material deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of such losses 2008 nil.
These are unrecognised tax losses of which 0.1 million is due to expire in 2012 and 36.0 million is unlikely to expire in the short term.
The Group has unused tax credits of 3.1 million 2008 3.1 million available for off set against future profits.
These credits are unlikely to expire in the short term.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these credits 2008 nil.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries on which deferred tax liabilities have not been provided is 92.6 million.
The reason for not providing for these liabilities, is because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences.
Additionally it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future and the level of underlying tax credit on remitted earnings is likely to cover any UK corporation tax.

90 Hays plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 28 Share-based payments continued Long Term Co-Incentive Plan LTCIP In previous years, employees were invited to commit a number of shares to the LTCIP.
The LTCIP was based upon the Total Shareholder Return TSR of the Company over a three-year period, compared to a peer group of 15 companies including Hays plc.
Dependent upon the performance ranking, the Company was to match up to five times the number of shares committed by the employee.
If the ranking of Hays plc was ninth or less then there was to be no matching of shares by the Company.
The 2005 LTCIP award vested on 14 December 2008 and participants became entitled to 33% of the matching shares based on the Companys TSR performance over the three-year period to 14 December 2008, where Hays was ranked in 8th position out of the peer group of 15 companies.
A total of 0.4 million shares were matched for this award.
All awards under this scheme have now vested and there is currently no intention of making further awards.
Performance Share Plan PSP and Deferred Annual Bonus DAB These are the incentive arrangements that replaced the LTCIP in 2007.
Only members of the Management Board participate in the DAB and circa 330 managers participate in the PSP.
The PSP and DAB are equity settled share-based payment awards with non-market performance conditions over a three-year period.
For existing DAB awards, up to a maximum of 100% of the annual bonus is deferred into Hays shares and is matched with free conditional shares at a maximum one for one basis, subject to the performance conditions over a three-year period.
Under the PSP, generally the awards are a maximum of 30% to 150% of a participants base salary and will not exceed two times a participants base salary in any financial year.
The first PSP award, PSP 1, made in April 2007 and the first DAB award, DAB 1, made in May 2007 have a performance period of three years from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2009.
The second awards, PSP 2 and DAB 2, were made in September 2007 for a three-year performance period from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2010.
The third awards, PSP 3 and DAB 3, were made in October 2008 for a three-year performance period from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2011.
The performance criteria for the DAB awards are combinations of cumulative EPS, cumulative International Net Fees and cumulative Cash Conversion set each year.
The performance criteria for the PSP awards are combinations of Group EPS, Economic profit, Regional Operating profit, Divisional Operating profit and Country or Sub-Regional profit, depending on the recipients role.
The PSP awards are either on a one or three-year performance period, with no re-testing of performance conditions.
For one-year performance period awards there is a two-year holding period before vesting.
