Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 29.
Financial Instruments continued The company does not invest funds in deposits with maturities exceeding one month and thus there is no significant price risk on cash or cash equivalents.
o Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
p Liquidity and interest risk tables The following tables detail the groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the group can be required to pay.

Financial assets in this category include the quoted shares held in blinkx Plc.
The fair value of unquoted shares is determined by management by considering the underlying profitability and net assets of those investments.
The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements approximate their fair values.

Post-Balance Sheet Events During the first quarter of 2010 the company announced the strategic acquisition of MicroLink, LLC, a leading Autonomy reseller targeting U. S. state and federal government accounts.
The acquisition was for a purchase price of $55 million in cash, after disposal of a portion of the MicroLink business prior to the transaction, and is based on a zero net working capital position.
The transaction is intended to accelerate the adoption of Autonomy technology in this important and growing area of US government expenditure, allowing Autonomy to take a larger part in these contracts.
The purchase price allocation, and the additional disclosures required by IFRS 3, are expected to become available in the first half of 2010.
On 10 February 2009 the company announced the launch and pricing of an offering of approximately 500 million principal amount of convertible bonds due 2015.
The bonds will be convertible into ordinary shares of the company and will carry a semi-annual coupon of 3.25% per annum and an initial conversion price of 20.6334.
The bonds will be issued at 100% of their principal amount and, unless previously redeemed, converted or cancelled, will mature on the fifth anniversary of the issue of the bonds in 2015.
The company will have the option to call the bonds after approximately the first three years should the price of the companys ordinary shares exceed 130% of the then prevailing conversion price over a specified period.
Settlement and delivery of the bonds is expected to take place on or about 4 March 2010.
