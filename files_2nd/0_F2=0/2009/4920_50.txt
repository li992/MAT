Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups financial risk management objectives consist of identifying and monitoring those risks, which have an adverse impact on the value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities or on reported pro tability and on the cash ows of the Group.
The Groups principal financial liabilities comprise bank loans, bank revolving facilities, other loans and finance leases.
The Group has various financial assets such as trade receivables and cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group has not entered into any derivative transactions such as interest rate swaps or financial foreign currency contracts.
It is, and has been throughout 2009 and 2008, the Groups policy that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken.
The Groups main treasury risks relate to the availability of funds to meet its future requirements and uctuations in interest rates.
The treasury policy of the Group is determined and monitored by the Board.
The Group monitors its cash resources through short, medium and long-term cash forecasting, against available facilities.
Surplus cash is pooled into an interest bearing account with the Groups bankers.
The Group monitors its overall level of financial gearing monthly, with short and medium-term forecasts showing levels of gearing within targets.
It is the Groups policy not to exceed a ratio of 1:1 of adjusted net debt to EBITDA.
The Group includes within adjusted net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings, bank revolving facilities, less cash and cash equivalents and excludes, for this calculation, the Dominos Leasing Limited non-recourse loans and the share buyback obligation.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are foreign currency risk, credit risk, price risk, liquidity risk and cash ow interest rate risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
Foreign currency risk The Group has invested in operations in the Republic of Ireland and also buys and sells goods and services in currencies other than sterling.
As a result the value of the Groups non-sterling revenues, purchases, financial assets and liabilities and cash ows can be affected by movements in exchange rates, the euro in particular.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of its currency exposures by agreeing xed euro rates with franchisees and suppliers wherever possible.
The Board does not consider there to be any signi cant unmitigated risk in relation to the Groups pro t before tax.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change in the sterling against euro exchange rates with all other variables held constant, of the Groups equity due to changes in the carrying value of euro denominated assets in subsidiaries with a sterling functional currency and sterling denominated assets in subsidiaries with a euro functional currency : Increase decrease in Effect on sterling versus pro t before euro rate tax % 000 2009 25 346 25 577 2008 10 23 10 53 Credit risk Customers who trade on credit terms and obtain finance leasing from the Group are predominantly franchisees and it is considered that the franchisee selection process is suf ciently robust to ensure an appropriate credit veri cation procedure.
There are no signi cant concentrations of credit risks within the Group.
Non-recourse loans are only repayable provided the related lease receivables are settled in full.
This limits the Groups exposure to the non-repayment of other lease receivables.
In addition, trade debtor balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not signi cant.
Since the Group trades only with franchisees that have been subject to the franchisee selection process and provide guarantees as required under the franchisee agreements, there is no requirement for collateral.
It is Group policy that cash deposits are only made with banks that have been approved by the Board and have a high credit rating.
Price risk The Board considers that the Groups exposure to changing market prices on the values of financial instruments does not have a signi cant impact on the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities.
As such no speci c policies are applied currently, although the Board will continue to monitor the level of price risk and its exposure should the need occur.
Liquidity risk The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by managing cash generation by its operations with cash collection targets set throughout the Group.
All major investment decisions are considered by the Board as part of the project appraisal and approval process.
In this way the Group aims to maintain a good credit rating to facilitate fund raising.

Whilst xed rate interest bearing debt is not exposed to cash ow interest rate risk, there is no opportunity for the Group to bene t from a reduction in borrowing costs when market rates are declining.
Conversely, whilst oating rate borrowings are not exposed to changes in fair value, the Group is exposed to cash ow interest rate risk as costs are impacted by changes in market rates.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups pro t before tax through the impact on the period end oating rate cash balances and borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity.
