FINANCIAL STATEMENTS notes to the parent company financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified for measurement of derivative financial instruments at fair value and in accordance with applicable UK law and UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP.
As the Company is included in the consolidated financial statements, made up to 31 December each year, it is not required to present a separate profit and loss account as provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
New Accounting Standards The Company has adopted the amendments to FRS 2, FRS 6 and FRS 28 Amendments for Companies Act Changes, the Amendment to FRS 20 Vesting Conditions and Cancellations and the Amendments to UITF 42 and FRS 26 Embedded Derivatives and Reclassification.
The adoption of these amendments had no impact on the net results or net assets of the Company.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Purchased goodwill, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of assets acquired, is written off on a straight line basis from the date of acquisition over 20 years, being its anticipated useful life.
Tangible assets Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of all other assets, less residual value, on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location.
Usual asset lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years Fixtures, fittings and equipment Building installations 20 years or lease period if less Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Business systems software 4 years The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment in periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Investments Fixed asset investments, including investment in subsidiaries, are stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Leases Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease on a straight line basis.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs in bringing each product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in-first-out basis, including all attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity.
Net realisable value represents the selling price less further costs to be incurred to completion and on sale.
Trade and other debtors Trade debtors, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Spirent Communications plc 85 Annual Report 2009 notes to the parent company financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions are recorded when the Company has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event for which it is probable that it will be required to settle by an outflow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company, the revenue can be reliably measured and when the Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership.
In addition, revenue is only recognised when collectability is probable.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
All exchange profits and losses are taken to the profit and loss account.
Product development Expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Companys balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Equity instruments Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies relating to firm commitments or highly probable forecast transactions.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into, and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reported balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The Company has designated its forward foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges.
Changes in the fair value of contracts which are designated as effective are recognised directly in equity and the gain or loss on the ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the profit and loss account.
For effective hedges that are in relation to a financial asset or liability, amounts originally deferred are recognised in the profit and loss account in the same period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss, for example when a highly probable sale occurs.
For non-financial assets or liabilities, the gains or losses that have been included in equity are included in the initial measurement of the non-financial asset or liability at the time the asset or liability is recognised on the balance sheet.
The Company discontinues hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Company revokes designation.
Gains or losses arising on hedging instruments, which are cancelled due to termination of the underlying exposure, are taken to the profit and loss account immediately.
86 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts.
Pensions The Company operates two defined benefit pension plans.
All other plans are defined contribution in nature where the amount charged to the profit and loss account is the contributions paid or payable during the year.
For defined benefit pension plans full actuarial valuations are carried out every three years using the projected unit credit method, and updates are performed at each balance sheet date.
The cost of providing benefits under these plans is determined separately for each plan, and attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost, and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of defined benefit obligations.
Past services are recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight line basis or immediately if the benefits have vested.
When a settlement eliminating all obligations for benefits already accrued, or a curtailment reducing future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the plan membership or a reduction in future entitlement occurs, the obligation and related plan assets are remeasured using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss recognised in the profit and loss account during the period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
The interest element of the defined benefit pension plan cost represents the change in present value of plan obligations resulting from the passage of time and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into account material changes in the obligation during the year.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long term market returns on plan assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received, and benefits paid during the year.
The difference between the expected return on plan assets and the interest cost is recognised in the profit and loss account as finance costs or finance income.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets, experience adjustments on liabilities and changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The defined benefit pension plan asset or liability in the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the defined benefit obligation using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds denominated in the same currency and whose term is consistent with the estimated term of the obligation.
Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price.
The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the sum of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount the Company expects to recover, by way of reductions in the future contributions or refunds from the plan that have been agreed by the trustees.
Treasury shares Spirent Communications plc Ordinary Shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost and shown as a deduction from retained earnings.
Consideration received for the sale of such Ordinary Shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings.
Employee benefits When an employee has rendered service to the Company during an accounting period, short term benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service are recognised in the same accounting period.
Dividends paid The interim dividend is included in the financial statements in the period it is approved by the directors, and the final dividend in the period it is approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
Spirent Communications plc 87 Annual Report 2009 notes to the parent company financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Share-based payment The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined using a binomial model.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised as a cost to the Company or as an addition to the cost of investment in the subsidiary in which the relevant employees work, over the vesting period of the equity-settled transactions with a corresponding adjustment to reserves.
Any payments received from the Companys subsidiaries in respect of these share-based payments result in a reduction in the cost of investment.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other vesting conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The Company has an employee share trust for the granting of certain share incentives to employees.
Shares are held by the employee share trust, treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
Tax The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable represents the amount expected to be paid or recovered in respect of taxable profit for the year and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided on an undiscounted basis on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date except as referred to below.
Amounts provided are calculated with reference to tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not provided on gains on the disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, unless there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
Provision will not be made where it is considered more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only when the replacement assets are sold.
Employees Please refer to the Report on directors remuneration on pages 33 to 40 for disclosures relating to the emoluments, share incentives and long term incentive interests and pensions of the directors.
Pensions Defined benefit plans The defined benefit pension plans are in the United Kingdom and comprise the Spirent Communications plc Staff Pension & Life Assurance Plan Staff Plan and the Spirent Communications plc Retirement Cash & Life Assurance Plan Cash Plan.
The Staff Plan is the Companys most significant plan.
There is in addition an unfunded plan.
88 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3.
Pensions continued The most recent actuarial valuations, at 1 April 2009, of the plans assets and the present value of the defined benefit plans obligations, using the projected unit credit method, have been used and updated by our independent actuaries.
i The key financial assumptions The assumptions used for both plans were as follows: 2009 2008 % % Inflation 3.4 3.0 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.9 3.5 Rate of increase for pensions in payment pre 2001 service 3.7 3.6 Rate of increase for pensions in payment post 2001 pre April 2005 service 3.2 2.9 Rate of increase for pensions post April 2005 service 2.2 2.1 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.4 3.0 Rate used to discount plan liabilities 5.7 6.0 Expected rate of return on plan assets weighted for both plans 5.6 5.2 Spirent Communications plc employs a building block approach in determining the long term rate of return on the plans assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long term rate of return on each class of asset is set out within this note.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return of each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the plans.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are such that a member currently aged 68 2008 aged 65 will live on average for a further 19.1 years 2008 21.7 years if they are male and for a further 20.9 years 2008 24.0 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2019 2008 in 2028 at age 64 2008 aged 65 the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 23.6 years 2008 22.9 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 25.5 years 2008 25.0 years after retirement if they are female.
The approximate impact to the past service liabilities of changing these main assumptions is as follows: Reducing the discount rate by 0.1 per cent per annum.
This would increase past service liabilities by 2.0 million.
Increasing the life expectancy of a member by one year by modifying the standard mortality tables using an appropriate scaling factor.
This would increase past service liabilities by 4.3 million.
There will also be an impact on the future service cost but given the small active population in these plans this is likely to be insignificant.

As a result only 1.6 million of the 2.3 million surplus has been recognised on the balance sheet at 31 December 2008.
The recognition of the surplus in the Cash Plan is restricted in 2009 to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the Plan or reductions in future contributions to the Plan.
As a result only 0.3 million of the 0.8 million surplus has been recognised on the balance sheet at 31 December 2009.
The plans are prohibited from investing in Spirents own financial instruments.
For the purposes of the following disclosures the two plans have been combined as the Cash Plan is immaterial to these financial statements.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension plan deficit recognised on 1 January 2003 and taken directly to equity of 41.9 million in the Company is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension plans.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Companys statement of recognised gains and losses before 1 January 2003. v Movements in the present value of funded defined benefit obligations 2009 2008 million million At 1 January 126.5 135.1 Current service cost 0.1 0.2 Interest cost 7.5 7.5 Employee contributions 0.1 0.1 Benefit payments 5.7 6.1 Actuarial loss gain 8.9 10.3 Present value of funded defined benefit pension plans obligations 137.4 126.5 Spirent Communications plc 91 Annual Report 2009 notes to the parent company financial statements continued 3.

The above plans are funded and have full UK HM Revenue & Customs HMRC tax-exempt approval.
Certain members, whose salaries were in excess of the HMRC statutory earnings cap, had their benefits increased through unapproved unfunded arrangements, to the level that would otherwise have applied in respect of basic salary only.
The Company has contractually agreed to pay the additional retirement benefits itself and a provision is made in respect of this obligation in the balance sheet at 31 December 2009 of 0.4 million 2008 0.6 million.
This represents the actuarial value, as confirmed by the Companys pension advisers, of the unapproved benefit entitlements accrued at that date.
The value is assessed and reviewed on a market value basis in line with the main plan valuation.
There are no experience gains or losses on the unfunded plan in the period from 2005 to 2009.

Description of employee share plans 2005 Employee Incentive Plan EIP The EIP, which was introduced in 2005 and replaced the now closed ESOS see below, is currently available for selected employees, including executive directors, on a discretionary basis.
Under the EIP, the Company is able to grant share options, including HMRC approved options, share-settled stock appreciation rights SARs and Performance shares.
No price is payable on the grant of an award.
In normal circumstances, EIP awards vest three years following the date of grant provided the relevant performance conditions have been met.
For share options and SARs, the performance conditions relate to the Companys earnings per share EPS and for Performance shares, relate to total shareholder return TSR.
Further information on the performance conditions for EIP share incentives is set out in the Report on directors remuneration on pages 34 and 35.
Options and SARs granted under the EIP expire on the tenth anniversary of their grant unless they have previously lapsed or been exercised.
Spirent Stock Incentive Plan SSIP The SSIP was introduced in 2000.
This discretionary plan is primarily targeted at US employees with grants normally determined by reference to the seniority and contribution of the individual, together with the performance of the relevant business and prevailing local market practice.
Grants are also permitted to selected newly hired and promoted employees on a monthly basis.
Under the SSIP, the Company is able to grant share options and share-settled SARs.

Capital and reserves continued At the Annual General Meeting held in May 2009, shareholders approved the extension of the SSIP until the Companys 2010 Annual General Meeting after which the plan will expire.
The current shareholder approved mandate regarding the annual dilution rate is 0.5 per cent of the issued Ordinary Share capital for both the SSIP and EIP in aggregate.
Most awards made pursuant to the SSIP vest over four years, provided that the participant remains in employment.
Vesting is not normally subject to a performance condition and awards become 25 per cent exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant and thereafter in equal tranches on a monthly basis over a further 36 months.
Any award not exercised by the seventh anniversary of the date of grant will lapse.
The vesting of the SSIP awards made to Bill Burns, prior to his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, and to certain other key senior managers within the Communications group, are subject to the Company meeting EPS growth targets over the vesting periods.
Further details of these performance conditions are set out in the Report on directors remuneration on page 35.
SARs granted under the EIP and SSIP will deliver the appreciation value ie the increase in market value of an Ordinary Share over the base price of the SAR in the form of Ordinary Shares.
This SARs approach helps the Company manage its dilution headroom more efficiently as only the SAR gain needs to be funded.
Using a SARs approach, it is not possible to determine the precise level of dilution until the SARs are exercised.
1995 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The ESOS is now closed for new grants and has been replaced by the EIP referred to above.
Under the ESOS awards of share options, including HMRC approved options, were on a discretionary basis.
No price was payable on the grant of an option and no options were granted at a discount to the market price.
The normal exercise period for options granted under the ESOS is between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Options awarded under the ESOS were subject to the achievement of an EPS performance condition before they could be exercised.
All outstanding options have now passed their EPS performance conditions and remain exercisable until they expire on the tenth anniversary of their respective grant dates.
UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme SRSOS and the 2005 Sharesave Scheme The SRSOS closed in 2005 and was replaced by the 2005 Sharesave Scheme.
SRSOS options which remain outstanding may still be exercised prior to expiry, however no further grants can be made.
Both schemes operate as HMRC approved Save-As-You-Earn schemes and are open to all UK employees, subject to a qualifying service period.
Any future sharesave invitations will be made under the 2005 Sharesave Scheme, which is broadly similar to the SRSOS.
No price is payable on the grant of an option.
The option exercise price is calculated by reference to the middle market closing price of an Ordinary Share on the business day prior to the beginning of the invitation period, discounted by up to 20 per cent at the Boards discretion.
Options are normally exercisable within six months of the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the contract commencement date as elected by the option holder at the start of the contract.
The Company operates the SST to honour the commitment to deliver Ordinary Shares against the exercise of outstanding options under the SRSOS.
Spirent Sharesave Trust Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spirent Communications plc, acts as sole trustee of the SST.
During the year, 0.3 million Ordinary Shares were transferred to participants 2008 0.3 million Ordinary Shares.
No invitations have been made under either of these schemes since 2003.
UK Employee Share Purchase Plan UK ESPP The UK ESPP, which is based on an HMRC approved share incentive plan, was approved by shareholders in 2005 and is available to all UK employees, subject to a qualifying service period.
The UK ESPP offers three ways to provide Ordinary Shares to employees: free shares, partnership shares and matching shares.
The UK ESPP will operate in conjunction with a trust, which will hold the shares on behalf of participants.
To date, no awards have been made under this plan.

Share-based payment The total charge for the year relating to employee share-based payment plans is as follows: 2009 2008 million million 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme 0.1 2005 Employee Incentive Plan 0.1 0.2 All employee share plans 0.1 0.1 0.4 All schemes are equity-settled.
The fair value of share incentives is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial model.
The following table gives the assumptions made in arriving at the share-based payment charge and the fair value: 2009 2008 Weighted average share price pence 97.8 50.5 Weighted average exercise price pence 25.3 Weighted average fair value pence 29.3 16.7 Expected volatility % 53.0 45.0 Expected life years 4.5 4.5 Risk free rate % 2.4 3.7 Dividend yield % 2.0 2.0 The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous two years which management considers to be the period which is likely to be most representative of future volatility.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
For Performance shares granted under the 2005 Employee Incentive Plan, which have a market based performance condition, it has been assumed that there will be 30 per cent vesting for valuation purposes.
