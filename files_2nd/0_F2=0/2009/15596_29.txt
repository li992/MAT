loss arising on property-related items, impact on leases of annual uplifts The Group believes these arrangements remain effective and in rent and rent-free periods, amortisation charge from intangible assets economically and commercially viable hedges despite the inability arising on acquisition and replaces the IAS 19 pension charge with the to apply hedge accounting.
normal cash contributions for pensions.
Where hedge accounting is not applied to certain hedging arrangements, the reported results reflect the movement in fair value of related derivatives due to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
In addition, at each period end, any gain or loss accruing on open contracts is recognised in the Group Income Statement for the period, regardless of the expected outcome of the hedging contract on termination.
This may mean that the Group Income Statement charge is highly volatile, whilst the resulting cash flows may not be as volatile.
The underlying profit measure removes this volatility to help better identify underlying business performance.
During 2008 9, 10m 2007 8 nil of the IAS 32 39 charge arose in the share of post-tax profit of joint ventures and associates, with the remainder in finance income costs.
IAS 19 Income Statement charge for pensions Under IAS 19 Employee Benefits, the cost of providing pension benefits in the future is discounted to a present value at the corporate bond yield rates applicable on the last day of the previous financial year.
Corporate bond yield rates vary over time which in turn creates volatility in the Group Income Statement and Group Balance Sheet.
IAS 19 also increases the charge for young pension schemes, such as Tescos, by requiring the use of rates which do not take into account the future expected returns on the assets held in the pension scheme which will fund pension liabilities as they fall due.
The sum of these two effects makes the IAS 19 charge disproportionately higher and more volatile than the cash contributions the Group is required to make in order to fund all future liabilities.
Therefore, within underlying profit we have included the normal cash contributions for pensions but excluded the volatile element of IAS 19 to represent what the Group believes to be a fairer measure of the cost of providing post-employment benefits.
IAS 17 Leases impact of annual uplifts in rent and rent-free periods The amount charged to the Group Income Statement in respect of operating lease costs and incentives is expected to increase significantly as the Group expands its International business.
The leases have been structured in a way to increase annual lease costs as the businesses expand.
IAS 17 Leases requires the total cost of a lease to be recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, irrespective of the actual timing of the cost.
The impact of this treatment in 2008 9 was an adverse charge of 27m 2007 8 18m to the Group Income Statement after deducting the impact of the straight-line treatment recognised as rental income within share of post-tax profits of joint ventures and associates.

com annualreport09 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 88 Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 10 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Impairment of goodwill Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cash-generating units according to the level at which management monitor that goodwill.
Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
In 2008 9, recoverable amounts are based on value in use.
Value in use is calculated from cash flow projections for five years using data from the Groups latest internal forecasts, the results of which are reviewed by the Board.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in margins.
Management estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating units.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
Given the current economic climate, a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing the recoverable amounts of goodwill.
In the case of Japan, it is reasonably possible that a change in key assumptions would cause the goodwill to exceed its value in use.
At 28 February 2009, there was headroom of 8m, incorporating a long-term growth rate of 1.5% and a pre-tax discount rate of 7.3% as key assumptions.
A 0.2% reduction in the long-term growth rate or a 0.2% increase in the discount rate would cause goodwill to exceed its value in use.
EBITDA margin is also assumed to increase in 2009 10 from 2008 9, where a 2.9% decrease in the forecast margin for 2009 10 would also cause goodwill to exceed its value in use.
For Poland, with headroom of 84m and assuming an 11.3% pre-tax discount rate, a 0.4% increase in the discount rate would cause goodwill to exceed its value in use.
The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long-term average growth rates of generally 2%-10% 2008: 3%-4%.
The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use range from 7%-24% 2008: 8%-24%.
On a post-tax basis, the discount rates ranged from 5%-19% 2008: 5%-20%.
These discount rates are derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital as adjusted for the specific risks relating to each geographical region.
In February 2009 and 2008 impairment reviews were performed by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
Management determined that there has been no impairment.

Cash-generating units are tested for impairment if there are indications of impairment at the Balance Sheet date.
Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based on value in use, which is calculated from cash flow projections for five years using data from the Groups latest internal forecasts, the results of which are reviewed by the Board.
The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long-term growth rates of generally 2%-10% 2008: 3%-4%.
The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use range from 7%-24% 2008: 8%-24% depending on the specific conditions in which each store operates.
These discount rates are derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital.

In all cases, impairment losses arose due to stores performing below forecasted trading levels.
The reversal of previous impairment losses arose principally due to improvements in stores performances over the last year which increased the net present value of future cash flows.

Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 99 Note 22 Financial instruments Derivatives are used for hedging in the management of exposure to market risks.
This enables the optimisation of the overall cost of accessing debt capital markets, and mitigates the market risk which would otherwise arise from the maturity and other profiles of assets and liabilities.
Hedging policies using derivative financial instruments are further explained below.
Derivatives that are held as hedging instruments are formally designated as hedges as defined in IAS 39.
Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes as described below.
Fair value hedges The Group maintains interest rate and cross-currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and currency risk on fixed rate debt issued by the Group.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Group Income Statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The gain or loss on the hedging instrument and hedged item is recognised in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item is amortised to the Group Income Statement under the effective interest rate method.
A gain of 1,197m on hedging instruments was recognised during the year, offset by a loss of 1,227m on hedged items in 2008, a gain of 261m on hedging instruments was offset by a loss of 261m on hedged items.
Cash flow hedges The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the purchasing company.
Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting, mark-to-market gains and losses are deferred in equity.
The hedging instruments are primarily used to hedge purchases in Euros and US Dollars.
The cash flows hedged will occur and will affect the Group Income Statement within one year of the Balance Sheet date.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is recognised in the Group Income Statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the Group Income Statement.
Net investment hedges The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts, currency denominated borrowings and currency options to hedge the exposure of a proportion of its non-Sterling denominated assets against changes in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Group has a South Korean Won denominated liability relating to the future purchase of the minority shareholding of its subsidiary, Samsung Tesco Co. Limited.
This liability has been designated as a net investment hedge of a proportion of the assets of Samsung Tesco Co. Limited.
The Group has a Chinese Yuan denominated liability relating to the future purchase of the minority shareholding of its subsidiary, Hymall.
This liability has been designated as a net investment hedge of a proportion of the assets of Hymall.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the Group Income Statement on disposal of the overseas operation.
Financial instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting The Groups policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes: however, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is appropriate.
These instruments include caps, collars, interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs.
The Group has a liability relating to the future purchase of the minority shareholding of its subsidiary, dunnhumby Limited.

com annualreport09 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 102 Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 23 Financial risk factors The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates, the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions, and the availability of funds to meet business needs.
These risks are managed as described below.
The Group Balance Sheet position at 28 February 2009 is representative of the position throughout the year, including the impact of acquisitions during the year.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The Board provides written principles for risk management, as described in the Business Review on pages 38 to 40.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Debt issued at variable rates exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Debt issued at fixed rates exposes the Group to fair value risk.
Our interest rate management policy is explained on page 40.
The Group has RPI debt where the principal is indexed to increases in the RPI index.
RPI debt is treated as floating rate debt.
The Group also has LPI debt, where the principal is indexed to RPI, with an annual maximum increase of 5% and a minimum of 0%.
LPI debt is treated as fixed rate debt.
For interest rate risk relating to Tesco Personal Finance Group Limited TPF please refer to the separate section on TPF financial risk factors.
During 2009 and 2008, net debt including TPF was managed using derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk as follows: 2009 2008 Fixed Floating Total Fixed Floating Total m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 3,509 3,509 1,788 1,788 Loans and advances to customers TPF 3,388 3,388 Loans and advances to banks and other financial assets TPF 2,129 2,129 Short-term investments 1,233 1,233 360 360 Other investments TPF 259 259 Joint venture loan receivables 262 262 173 173 Finance leases 84 159 243 73 188 261 Bank and other borrowings 11,540 4,667 16,207 5,745 2,045 7,790 Customer deposits TPF 4,538 4,538 Deposits by banks TPF 24 24 Future purchases of minority interests 200 200 232 232 Derivative effect: Interest rate swaps 415 415 752 752 Cross currency swaps 4,524 4,524 2,778 2,778 Caps and collars 774 774 876 876 Total 3,294 7,138 10,432 3,396 2,566 5,962 Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, customer deposits, financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
The Group policy on credit risk is described on page 40.
The counterparty exposure under derivative contracts is 1,860m 2008 313m.
The Group policy is to transact derivatives only with counterparties rated at least A1 by Moodys.
For credit risk relating to TPF please refer to the separate section on TPF financial risk factors.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed by short-term and long-term cash flow forecasts.
In addition, the Group has committed facility agreements for 2.7bn 2008 1.6bn, which mature between 2010 and 2014.
The Group has a European Medium Term Note programme of 15bn, of which 11bn was in issue at 28 February 2009 2008 4.9bn, plus a Euro Commercial Paper programme of 2bn, of which 1.6bn was in issue at 28 February 2009 2008 0.6bn, and a US Commercial Paper programme of $4bn, none of which was in issue at 28 February 2009 2008 nil.
For liquidity risk relating to TPF please refer to the separate section on TPF financial risk factors.
The following is an analysis of the undiscounted contractual cash flows payable under financial liabilities and derivatives.
The undiscounted cash flows will differ from both the carrying values and fair value.
Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing rate at the Balance Sheet date.
Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at the Balance Sheet date.
For index linked liabilities, inflation is estimated at 3% for the life of the liability.

The following analysis, required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK interest rates, and foreign exchange risk.
com annualreport09 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 104 Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 23 Financial risk factors continued Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk principally via: a Transactional exposure, from the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the purchasing company.
Transactional exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are hedged.
These exposures are hedged via forward foreign currency contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges.
The notional and fair value of these contracts is shown in note 22. b Net investment exposure, from the value of net investments outside the UK.
We hedge the majority of our investments in our international subsidiaries via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies, which are formally designated as net investment hedges.
These are hedged via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies, which are not formally designated as hedges, as gains and losses on hedges and hedged loans will naturally offset.
The impact on Group financial instruments from foreign currency volatility is shown in the sensitivity analysis below.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-employment obligations and on the retranslation of overseas net assets as required by IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
However it does include the foreign exchange sensitivity resulting from all local entity non-functional currency financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 28 February 2009.
It should be noted that the sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on income and equity due to all financial instruments held at the Balance Sheet date.
It does not reflect any change in sales or costs that may result from changing interest or exchange rates.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the sensitivity of interest payable to movements in interest rates is calculated on the post hedge floating rate net debt exposure with no sensitivity assumed for LPI-linked debt: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates or foreign exchange rates have an immaterial effect on the Group Income Statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges from movements in foreign exchange rates are recorded directly in equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments only affect the Group Income Statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments are fully effective with no impact on the Group Income Statement: debt with a maturity below one year is floating rate for the interest payable part of the calculation: and the floating leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in interest rates affects a full 12-month period for the interest payable portion of the sensitivity calculations.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Group Income Statement and equity that would result from changes in UK interest rates, and in exchange rates: 2009 2008 Income Equity Income Equity gain loss gain loss gain loss gain loss m m m m Assets 1% increase in GBP interest rates 59 42 25% appreciation of the Euro 2008 5% 22 22 5 32 20% appreciation of the South Korean Won 2008 5% 1 222 25% appreciation of the US Dollar 2008 5% 11 218 2 43 25% appreciation of the Thai Baht 2008 5% 1 1 25% appreciation of the Czech Koruna 2008 10% 204 27 15% appreciation of the Polish Zloty 2008 15% 14 1 102 20% appreciation of the Slovak Koruna 2008 20% 2 87 The impact on equity from changing exchange rates results principally from foreign currency deals used as net investment hedges.
The impact on equity will largely be offset by the revaluation in equity of the hedged assets.
For changes in the USD GBP exchange rate, the impact on equity results principally from forward purchases of USD as cash flow hedges.
Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 105 Note 23 Financial risk factors continued Capital risk The Groups objectives when managing capital defined as net debt plus equity are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while maintaining a strong credit rating and headroom whilst optimising return to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes to economic conditions and the strategic objectives of the Company.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, buy back shares and cancel them or issue new shares.
In April 2006, we outlined our plan to release cash from our property assets, via a sequence of property joint ventures and other transactions, and return significant value to shareholders, either through enhanced dividends or share buy-backs.
The target for the value of share buy-backs was increased from 1.5bn to 3.0bn over a five-year period from April 2007.
Whilst we continued with the policy at the beginning of 2008 9, we have subsequently used the proceeds from property divestment to pay down debt, following the two major acquisitions in the second half Homever and Tesco Personal Finance Group Limited.
Early in 2008 9 we purchased and cancelled 100m ordinary shares.
In the financial year 2009 10 we expect to continue to use the proceeds from the sale of property to pay down debt.
The policy for debt is to ensure a smooth debt maturity profile with the objective of ensuring continuity of funding.
This policy continued during the current year with bonds redeemed of 524m and new bonds issued totalling 4,901m.
The Group borrows centrally and locally, using a variety of capital market issues and borrowing facilities to meet the requirements of each local business.
Tesco Personal Finance Group Limited TPF Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises where assets and liabilities in TPFs banking activities have different repricing dates.
TPF policy seeks to minimise the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates.
Potential exposures to interest rate movements in the medium to long term are measured and controlled through position and sensitivity limits.
Short-term exposures are measured and controlled in terms of net interest income sensitivity over 12 months to a 1.5% parallel movement in interest rates.
Risk is managed through arms length cash transactions.
Credit risk Credit risk is the probability of customers and counterparties failing to meet their obligations to TPF and arises principally from TPFs lending activities but also from other transactions involving on and off-balance sheet instruments.
Limits have been established for all counterparties based on their respective credit ratings.
The limits and proposed counterparties are reviewed and approved by the Risk Management Committee RMC and Board of TPF.
Internal reporting and oversight of risk assets is principally differentiated by credit ratings.
Internal ratings are used to assess the credit quality of borrowers.
Customers are assigned credit ratings, based on various credit grading models that reflect the probability of default.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed on a consolidated basis within TPFs banking activities and adheres to the liquidity requirements set by the Financial Services Authority FSA from time to time.
In the UK, the FSA requires TPF to be able to meet its sterling obligations without recourse to the wholesale markets for a period of at least five business days.
To meet regulatory requirements a diversified portfolio of high quality liquid and marketable assets is maintained.
Cash flow commitments and marketable asset holdings are measured and managed on a daily basis.
TPF has credit facilities sufficient to meet all foreseeable outflow requirements as they fall due and its liquidity risk is further mitigated by its well diversified retail deposit base.
Expressed as an annual probability of default, the upper and lower boundaries and the midpoint for each of the asset quality grades are as follows: Annual probability of default Minimum Midpoint Maximum S&P Asset quality grade % % % equivalent AQ1 0.00 0.10 0.20 AAA to BBBAQ2 0.21 0.40 0.60 BB to BB AQ3 0.61 1.05 1.50 BBto B AQ4 1.51 3.25 5.00 B to B AQ5 5.01 52.50 100.00 B and below Accruing NonImpairment AQ1 AQ2 AQ3 AQ4 AQ5 past due accrual provision Total At 28 February 2009 m m m m m m m m m Assets: Other investments 259 259 Loans and advances to customers 352 652 828 870 563 82 291 250 3,388 Loans and advances to banks and other financial assets 2,129 2,129 2,740 652 828 870 563 82 291 250 5,776 Commitment 3,103 1,451 744 305 129 5,732 Total off balance sheet 3,103 1,451 744 305 129 5,732 To find out more go to www.
com annualreport09 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 106 Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 23 Financial risk factors continued Insurance risk TPF is exposed to insurance risk indirectly through its profit sharing commission arrangement with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC.
Insurance risk is the risk of fluctuations in the timing, frequency or severity of insured events, relative to the expectations at the time of underwriting.
The frequency and severity of claims and the sources of uncertainty for the key classes that TPF is exposed to are as follows: Motor insurance Claims experience is quite variable, due to a wide range of factors, but the principal ones are age, sex and driving experience, type and nature of vehicle, use of vehicle and area.
There are many sources of uncertainty that will affect TPFs experience under motor insurance including operational risk, reserving risk, premium rates not matching claims inflation rates, the weather, the social, economic and legislative environment and reinsurance failure risk.
Property insurance The major causes of claims for property insurance are theft, flood, escape of water, fire, storm, subsidence and various types of accidental damage.
The major source of uncertainty is the volatility of weather.

The total Group Income Statement charge for the year recognised in respect of share-based payments is 242m 2008 228m, which is made up of share option schemes and share bonus payments.
Of this amount 204m 2008 199m will be equity-settled and 38m 2008 29m cash-settled.
a Share option schemes The Company had nine share option schemes in operation during the year, all of which are equity-settled schemes: i The Savings-related Share Option Scheme 1981 permits the grant to employees of options in respect of ordinary shares linked to a building society bank save-as-you-earn contract for a term of three or five years with contributions from employees of an amount between 5 and 250 per four-weekly period.

ii The Irish Savings-related Share Option Scheme 2000 permits the grant to Irish employees of options in respect of ordinary shares linked to a building society bank save-as-you-earn contract for a term of three or five years with contributions from employees of an amount between 12 and 320 per four-weekly period.
iii The Approved Executive Share Option Scheme 1994 was adopted on 17 October 1994.
The exercise of options granted under this scheme will normally be conditional upon the achievement of a specified performance target related to the growth in earnings per share over a three-year period.
No further options will be granted under this scheme and it has been replaced by the Discretionary Share Option Plan 2004.
There were no discounted options granted under this scheme.
iv The Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme 1996 was adopted on 7 June 1996.
v The International Executive Share Option Scheme 1994 was adopted on 20 May 1994.
This scheme permits the grant to selected non-UK executives of options to acquire ordinary shares on substantially the same basis as their UK counterparts.
The exercise of options granted under this scheme will normally be conditional on the achievement of a specified performance target related to the growth in earnings per share over a three-year period.
vi The Executive Incentive Plan 2004 was adopted on 5 July 2004.
This scheme permits the grant of options in respect of ordinary shares to selected executives.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant for nil consideration.
vii The Performance Share Plan 2004 was adopted on 5 July 2004 and amended on 29 June 2007.
Options granted before 29 June 2007 are normally exercisable between four and ten years from the date of grant for nil consideration.
Options granted after 29 June 2007 are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant for nil consideration.
The exercise of options will normally be conditional on the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on capital employed over a three-year period.
viii The Discretionary Share Option Plan 2004 was adopted on 5 July 2004.
This scheme permits the grant of approved, unapproved and international options in respect of ordinary shares to selected executives.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant at a price not less than the middle-market quotation or average middle-market quotations of an ordinary share for the dealing day or three dealing days preceding the date of grant.
The exercise of options will normally be conditional on the achievement of a specified performance target related to the annual percentage growth in earnings per share over a three-year period.
There will be no discounted options granted under this scheme.
ix The Group New Business Incentive Plan 2007 was adopted on 29 June 2007.
Options will normally vest in four tranches: four, five, six and seven years after the date of grant and will be exercisable for up to two years from the vesting dates for nil consideration.
The exercise of options will normally be conditional on the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on capital employed over the seven-year plan.
The average share price during the year to 28 February 2009 was 372.06p 2008 443.59p.
The fair value of share options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The following table gives the assumptions applied to the options granted in the respective periods shown.
No assumption has been made to incorporate the effects of expected early exercise.

The measure of volatility used in Tesco PLC option pricing models is the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a period of time.
In estimating the future volatility of the Companys share price, the Board consider the historical volatility of the share price over the most recent period that is generally commensurate with the expected term of the option, taking into account the remaining contractual life of the option.
b Share bonus schemes Eligible UK employees are able to participate in Shares in Success, an all-employee profit-sharing scheme.
Each year, shares are awarded as a percentage of earnings up to a statutory maximum of 3,000.

The most significant of these are the funded defined benefit pension schemes for the Groups employees in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
Defined contribution plans The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of 11m 2008 8m have been fully expensed against profits in the current year.
Defined benefit plans United Kingdom The principal plan within the Group is the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme, which is a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the assets of which are held as a segregated fund and administered by trustees.
Watson Wyatt Limited, an independent actuary, carried out the latest triennial actuarial assessment of the scheme as at 31 March 2008, using the projected unit method.
At the date of the last actuarial valuation the actuarial deficit was 275m.
The market value of the schemes assets was 3,987m and these assets represented 94% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in earnings and pensions in payment.
The One Stop Senior Executives Pension Scheme is a funded defined benefit scheme open to senior executives and certain other employees at the invitation of the Company.
An independent actuary, using the projected unit method, carried out the latest actuarial assessment of the scheme as at 5 April 2004.
Overseas The most significant overseas scheme is the funded defined benefit pension scheme which operates in the Republic of Ireland.
An independent actuary, using the projected unit method, carried out the latest actuarial assessment of the scheme as at 1 April 2007.
The valuations used for IAS 19 have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations and updated by Watson Wyatt Limited to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 28 February 2009.
The schemes assets are stated at their market values as at 28 February 2009.
Watson Wyatt Limited have updated the most recent Republic of Ireland valuation.
The liabilities relating to retirement healthcare benefits have also been determined in accordance with IAS 19, and are incorporated in the following tables.
Principal assumptions The valuations used have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations and updated by Watson Wyatt Limited to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 28 February 2009.
The major assumptions, on a weighted average basis, used by the actuaries were as follows: 2009 2008 2007 % % % Rate of increase in salaries 3.7 5.0 4.5 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.1 3.5 3.0 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.2 3.5 3.0 Rate of increase in career average benefits 3.2 3.5 3.0 Discount rate 6.5 6.4 5.2 Price inflation 3.2 3.5 3.0 In excess of any Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP element.
The main financial assumption is the real discount rate i. e. the excess of the discount rate over the rate of price inflation.
If this assumption increased decreased by 0.1%, the UK defined benefit obligation would decrease increase by approximately 110m and the annual UK current service cost would decrease increase by approximately 11m.
UK mortality assumptions The Company conducts analysis of mortality trends under the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme in the UK as part of the triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme.
At the latest triennial actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2008, the following assumptions were adopted for funding purposes: Base tables: PMA92C00 for male members with cohort improvements to 2000 and members taken to be one year younger than actual age.
PFA92C00 for female members with cohort improvements to 2000 and members taken to be half a year older than actual age.
This assumption was used for the calculation of the pension liability as at 28 February 2009 for the main UK scheme.
As at 28 February 2009, the mortality assumptions have been strengthened.
The base tables have been updated in line with medium cohort projections with a minimum improvement of 1% per annum from 31 March 2008 to 28 February 2009.
In addition, the allowance for future mortality improvements has been changed to incorporate medium cohort projections with a minimum improvement of 1% per annum.
Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 111 Note 28 Post-employment benefits continued The mortality assumptions used for the calculation of the pension liabilities as at 24 February 2007 and 23 February 2008 were based on the previous triennial actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2005, which included the following assumptions for funding purposes: Base tables: PMA92C00 for male members with cohort improvements to 2000 and members taken to be two years older than actual age.
Additionally, at the 31 March 2005 valuation an allowance was built in for future mortality improvements via a 0.2% reduction to the discount rate.
The following table illustrates the expectation of life of an average member retiring at age 65 at the Balance Sheet date and a member reaching age 65 at the same date 25 years: 2009 2008 2007 in years in years in years Retiring at Reporting date at age 65: Male 21.5 19.0 17.5 Female 23.3 23.3 21.9 Retiring at Reporting date 25 years at age 65: Male 23.9 20.6 18.4 Female 25.8 24.7 23.0 Rates of return on scheme assets The assets in the defined benefit pension schemes and the expected nominal rates of return were: 2009 2008 2007 Long-term Market Long-term Market Long-term Market rate of return value rate of return value rate of return value % m % m % m Equities 8.9 1,482 8.9 2,205 8.1 2,420 Bonds 5.5 1,080 5.7 901 5.2 812 Property 7.3 342 7.3 351 6.7 343 Other alternative assets 8.9 383 8.9 512 8.1 384 Cash 3.7 133 4.5 120 4.0 48 Total market value of assets 3,420 4,089 4,007 The expected rate of return on assets is a weighted average based on the actual plan assets held and the respective returns expected on the separate asset classes.
The expected rate of return on equities and cash have both been set having regard to expected returns over the medium term, as calculated by the Companys independent actuary.
The expected rate of return on bonds was measured directly from actual yields for gilts and corporate bond stocks.
The above rate takes into account the actual mix of UK gilts, UK corporate bonds and overseas bonds held at the Balance Sheet date.

Accordingly, the assumptions made in calculating the Groups defined benefit pension liability have been revised, resulting in a gain of 250m being recognised in Group operating profit in 2006 7.
Revisions to this assumption will be reflected in the Group Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Changes to scheme rules in the Republic of Ireland affecting early retirement have reduced pension liabilities by a further 8m, which was also shown as a past service gain in the Group Income Statement in 2006 7.

In 2008 9, 0.7m 2007 8 0.6m has been charged to the Group Income Statement and 0.5m 2007 8 0.7m of benefits were paid.

The purpose of the valuation is to agree a funding plan to ensure that present and future contributions should be sufficient to meet future liabilities.
The actuarial valuation of approved schemes as at 31 March 2008 has been concluded and company contributions are increasing to 11.1% from 10.9%.
On this basis the Group expects to make contributions of approximately 410m to defined benefit pension schemes in the year ending 27 February 2010.

Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 117 Note 31 Business combinations The Group has made a number of acquisitions in the year, of which the most significant acquisitions have been disclosed separately and the remainder shown in aggregate.
The net assets and results of the acquired businesses are included in the consolidated accounts of the Group from the date of acquisition.
Acquisition accounting has been applied and the goodwill arising has been capitalised and is subject to annual impairment testing.
The goodwill acquired in the business combinations listed below has been allocated to the single group of cash-generating units represented by the acquired businesses, as this is the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored internally.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year is attributable mainly to location, the assembled workforce and the synergies expected to be achieved.
The fair values currently established for acquisitions made in the year to 28 February 2009 are provisional.
Fair values will be reviewed based on additional information up to one year from the date of acquisition.
The Directors do not believe that any net adjustments resulting from such a review would have a material effect on the Group.
Had all the combinations listed below taken place at the beginning of the financial year, with the exception of Dobbies Garden Centre PLC which became a subsidiary in 2007 8, the operating profit of the Group would have been 3,391m and revenue would have been 55,750m.
The pro-forma information is provided for comparative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the actual results that would have occurred, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results of operations of the combined companies.

Other acquisitions The other acquisitions in the year include the trade and assets of Sandyholm Garden Centre and some smaller businesses.
The companies acquired undertake retail activities.
Fair value adjustments of 2m were identified in addition to the 3m pre-acquisition carrying amounts of net assets, resulting in the recognition of 5m as the fair value of net assets acquired.
With cash consideration of 10m, this has resulted in the recognition of 5m of goodwill arising on acquisition.
The post-acquisition contribution of the other acquisitions to the Group was 5m to revenue and 1m to operating profit.

Contingent liabilities The Company has irrevocably guaranteed the liabilities, as defined in Section 5 c of the Republic of Ireland Amendment Act 1986, of various subsidiary undertakings incorporated in the Republic of Ireland.
For details of assets held under finance leases, which are pledged as security for the finance lease liabilities, see note 11.
There are a number of contingent liabilities that arise in the normal course of business which if realised are not expected to result in a material liability to the Group.
The Group recognises provisions for liabilities when it is more likely than not a settlement will be required and the value of such a payment can be reliably estimated.
In September 2007, the Office of Fair Trading issued its provisional findings in its Statement of Objections relating to the alleged collusion between certain large supermarkets and dairy processors.
We continue to defend our case vigorously.
No provision has been recognised in the Groups results.
Tesco Personal Finance Group Limited At 28 February 2009, Tesco Personal Finance Group Limited TPF has commitments of formal standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments to lend, totalling 5.7bn.
The amount is intended to provide an indication of the volume of business transacted and not of the underlying credit or other risks.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS compensates customers of UK financial institutions when those institutions are unable to pay out.
Firms are being levied only for interest costs and management expenses of the scheme and not for the capital repayments which will ultimately need to be made, but the amounts have increased significantly compared to prior years.
The levy is calculated based on deposit balances held as at 31 December in each year and as such, this is seen as the trigger event under accounting rules.
TPF was a market participant at 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2008 and has accrued for its share of the 2008 9 and 2009 10 levy which was not material to the Group.
Going forward further provisions in respect of these costs are likely, the ultimate cost of which remains uncertain.

It is Tesco Personal Finance Group Limiteds TPF policy to maintain a strong capital base, to expand it as appropriate and to utilise it efficiently throughout its activities to optimise the return to shareholders while maintaining a prudent relationship between the capital base and the underlying risks of the business.
In carrying out this policy, TPF has regard to the supervisory requirements of the Financial Services Authority FSA.
The FSA uses Individual Capital Guidance ICG as a measure of capital adequacy in the UK banking sector, comparing a banks capital resources with its riskweighted assets the assets and off-balance sheet exposures are weighted to reflect the inherent credit and other risks.
