Directors Remuneration Report continued LongTerm Incentive Plans LTIP Performance Share Plan Shareholder approval was obtained in 2009 for the introduction of a Performance Share Plan PSP from 2010.
The plan replaces the previous Deferred Bonus LTIP for executive directors, which was dependent on the level of annual bonus award and therefore balanced more towards short term performance.
The introduction of a Performance Share Plan under which an award of shares will be made that is in line with the level awarded under the previous LTIP, restricted for three years and vesting in full or part subject to the achievement of a combination of earnings per share EPS growth and total shareholder return TSR targets, is designed to provide a greater focus on achieving key longterm business goals and increased shareholder value.
The first awards under the PSP to be made in 2010 will have the following targets set: EPS TSR Annual compound Proportion of Position relative Proportion of growth award vesting to appropriate award vesting % opportunity group of FTSE 250 % opportunity Food Producers, Retailers & Leisure Companies Less than RPI 3% Nil Below median Nil Threshold RPI 3% 12.5% At median 12.5% Maximum RPI 8% 50% Upper quartile 50% Following the introduction of this plan the Remuneration Committee will now be considering a policy on share ownership guidelines for executive directors.
The comparator group was established following a comprehensive review, including advice taken from Monks, and consists of 28 companies who are General Retailers, Food Producers Manufacturers or Leisure Companies and who were the most appropriate from the FTSE 250.
