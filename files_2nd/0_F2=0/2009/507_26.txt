Notes to the Group Accounts For the year ended 31 December 2009 1 Accounting policies The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The address of the registered office is 120 Bothwell Street, Glasgow G2 7JS, UK.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union, IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value.
For practical reasons, the Group prepares its financial statements on a 52 or 53 week period.
The financial statements for the 2009 financial year reect the 53 week period ended 2 January 2010.
The financial statements for the 2008 financial year reect the 52 week period ended 26 December 2008.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards which are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2009.
IAS 1 revised Presentation of financial statements.
This revised standard prohibits the presentation of items of income and expenses that is non-owner changes in equity in the statement of changes in equity, requiring non-owner changes in equity to be presented separately from owner changes in equity.
All nonowner changes in equity are required to be shown in a performance statement.
Entities can choose whether to present one performance statement the statement of comprehensive income or two statements the income statement and statement of comprehensive income.
The Group has elected to present two statements: an income statement and a statement of comprehensive income.
IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14 Segment reporting.
It requires a management approach under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
This has resulted in: a new segment titled Europe comprising the previously reported segments of Northern Europe and Continental Europe excluding power projects in the Eastern Mediterranean: a new segment titled Middle East & South East Europe MESEE comprising Middle East, previously included within Middle East, Asia-Pacific and South America, and power projects in the Eastern Mediterranean, previously reported in Continental Europe.
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the plc Board of Directors.
IFRS 2 amendment Share-based payment deals with vesting conditions and cancellations.
It clarifies that vesting conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only.
Other features of a share-based payment are not vesting conditions.
These features would need to be included in the grant date fair value for transactions with employees: they would not impact the number of awards expected to vest or valuations there of subsequent to grant date.
All cancellations, whether by the entity or by other parties should receive the same accounting treatment.
The Group has adopted IFRS 2 amendment from 1 January 2009.
The amendment does not have a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2009, but are not currently relevant for the Group.
IFRIC 13, Customer loyalty programmes IFRIC 14, The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction IFRIC 15, Agreements for construction of real estate IFRIC 16, Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation IFRS 7, Amendment, Improving disclosures about Financial instruments 80 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Accounts 1 Accounting policies continued During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards, amendments and interpretations with an effective date for financial years beginning on or after the dates disclosed below and therefore after the date of these financial statements: Effective date IFRS 3 revised Business combinations 1 July 2009 IFRIC 17 Distribution of non-cash assets to owners 1 July 2009 IFRIC 18 Transfers of assets from customers 1 July 2009 IAS 27 revised Consolidated and separate financial statements 1 July 2009 Amendment to IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement 1 July 2009 IAS 38 amendment Intangible assets 1 January 2010 IFRS 5 amendment Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations 1 January 2010 IFRS 2 amendment Group cash-settled share based payment transaction 1 January 2010 IFRIC 19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments 1 July 2010 The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of any of the other above standards or interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Aggreko plc and all its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2009.
Subsidiaries are those entities over which the Group has the power to govern financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding that confers more than half of the voting rights.
The consolidated income statement included the results of the business purchased from the effective date of acquisition.
Revenue recognition Revenue for the Group represents the amounts earned from the supply of temporary power, temperature control, oil-free compressed air and related services and excludes sales taxes and intra-group revenue.
Revenue can comprise a fixed rental charge and a variable charge related to the usage of assets or other services.
In all cases, revenue is recognised in accordance with the contractual arrangements, for fixed rental charges, over the rental period and for variable elements as the asset is utilised or service is provided.
Revenue is accrued or deferred at the balance sheet date depending on the date of the most recent invoice issued and the contractual terms.
Segmental reporting Aggrekos segments comprise Europe, Middle East & South East Europe, North America and International Local together the Groups Local business and International Power Projects IPP.
IPP is managed as a single business, with the deployment of assets varying from year to year depending on the location of projects.
The risks and rewards within IPP are significantly different from those within the Groups Local business.
The Local business focuses on smaller, more frequently occurring events, whereas the International Power Projects business concentrates on large contracts, which can arise anywhere in the world.
This is reected by the Groups divisional management and organisational structure and the Groups internal financial reporting systems.
The segmental analysis is in Note 4 to the Accounts.
Central administrative costs are allocated between segments based on revenue.
Leases Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group are classified as operating leases.
Rentals under operating leases are charged against operating profit on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Exceptional items Items are classified as exceptional gains or losses where they are considered by the Group to be material and are different from events or transactions which fall within the ordinary activities of the Group and which individually, or if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the financial statements are to be properly understood.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost includes purchase price, and directly attributable costs of bringing the asset into the location and condition where it is capable for use.
Borrowing costs are not capitalised since the assets are assembled over a short period of time.
Freehold properties are depreciated on a straight line basis over 25 years.
Short leasehold properties are depreciated on a straight line basis over the terms of each lease.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 81 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2009 1 Accounting policies continued Other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of each asset over its useful life from the date it is available for use.
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
The periods of depreciation are reviewed on an annual basis and the principal periods used are as follows: Rental eet 8 to 10 years Vehicles, plant and equipment 4 to 15 years Capital grants Capital grants in respect of additions to property, plant and equipment are netted against the cost of the related asset and this cost is depreciated in accordance with the policy above.
Intangibles Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised, separately from goodwill, at fair value at the date of acquisition if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line method to allocate the fair value at acquisition of each asset over their estimated useful lives as follows: customer relationships: 10 years: non-compete agreements: over the life of the non-compete agreements.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
These costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which is currently deemed to be 4 years.
The useful life of intangible assets is reviewed on an annual basis.
Goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and is subject to impairment reviews, both annually and when there are indicators that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
For the purpose of the impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, then the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Any impairment of goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets excluding goodwill Property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets are amortised depreciated and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is calculated using estimated cashows.
These are discounted using an appropriate long-term pre-tax interest rate.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash ows cash-generating units.
Foreign currencies Items included in the financial statements for each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates functional currency.
The Groups consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Groups presentational currency.
At individual Company level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the day the transaction occurs.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets are translated at the historical rate.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of subsidiary undertakings are translated into Sterling at closing rates of exchange.
Income and cash ow statements are translated at average rates of exchange for the period.
Gains and losses from the settlement of transactions and gains and losses on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are included in the income statement.
82 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Accounts 1 Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments The activities of the Group expose it directly to the financial risks of changes in forward foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recorded and subsequently measured at fair value, which is calculated using standard industry valuation techniques in conjunction with observable market data.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash ows using market interest rates and the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward foreign exchange market rates at the reporting date.
The treatment of changes in fair value of derivatives depends on the derivative classification.
The Group designates derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions or commitments cash ow hedge.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Cash flow hedge Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated, and effective, as hedges of future cash ows are recognised directly in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in finance costs in the income statement.
If the cash ow hedge is of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction that subsequently results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges of transactions that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in finance costs in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit and loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in finance costs in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to finance costs in the income statement.
Overseas net investment hedges Certain foreign currency borrowings are designated as hedges of the Groups overseas net investments, which are denominated in the functional currency of the reporting operation.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the net investment in foreign entities and of borrowings are taken to equity on consolidation to the extent the hedges are deemed effective.
All other exchange gains and losses are dealt with through other income in the income statement.
Taxation Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill, negative goodwill nor from the acquisition of an asset, which does not affect either taxable or accounting income.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Provision for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained earnings, principally relating to subsidiaries, is only made where there is a current intention to remit such earnings.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 83 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2009 1 Accounting policies continued Current tax The charge for the current tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items, which are non-assessable or disallowed.
It is calculated using taxation rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, using the FIFO or weighted average cost basis.
Cost of raw materials, consumables and work in progress includes the cost of direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Inventory is written down on a case by case basis if the anticipated net realisable value declines below the carrying amount of the inventories.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less cost to completion and selling expenses.
When the reasons for a write-down of the inventory have ceased to exist, the write-down is reversed.
Employee benefits Wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by the employees of the Group.
Where the Group provides long-term employee benefits, the cost is accrued to match the rendering of the services by the employees concerned.
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme and a number of defined contribution pension schemes.
The cost for the year for the defined benefit scheme is determined using the attained age method with actuarial updates to the valuation being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full, directly in retained earnings, in the period in which they occur and are shown in the statement of comprehensive income and expense.
The current service cost of the pension charge as well as the expected return on pension scheme assets and interest on pension scheme liabilities are included in arriving at operating profit.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash ows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds.
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period in which they become chargeable.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
An impairment is recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or large and old outstanding balances, particularly in countries where the legal system is not easily used to enforce recovery, are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible it is written off against the provision for impairment of trade receivables account.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Provisions Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will probably lead to an outow of resources that can be reasonably estimated.
Provisions are recorded for the estimated ultimate liability that is expected to arise, taking into account the time value of money where material.
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation will only be confirmed by future events, or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability.
Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inow of economic benefits is probable.
84 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Accounts 1 Accounting policies continued Share-based payments IFRS 2 Share-based Payment has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions of the standard.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees under the terms of the Groups various employee-share and option schemes.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of the grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for employee sharesave options and using the Monte Carlo option-pricing model for Executive share options.
Own shares held under trust for the Groups employee share schemes are classed as Treasury shares and deducted in arriving at shareholders equity.
No gain or loss is recognised on disposal of Treasury shares.
Purchases of own shares are disclosed as changes in shareholders equity.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits with a maturity of three months or less.
This definition is also used for the cashow statement.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Key assumptions and significant judgements The Group uses estimates and makes judgements in the preparation of its Accounts.
The most sensitive areas affecting the Accounts are discussed below.
Property, plant and equipment Rental eet accounts for 660.3 million, or around 93%, of the net book value of property, plant and equipment used in our business: the great majority of equipment in the rental eet is depreciated on a straight-line basis to a residual value of zero over 8 years, although we do have some classes which we depreciate over 10 years.
The annual eet depreciation charge of 138.1 million 2008: 107.7 million relates to the estimated service lives allocated to each class of eet asset.
Asset lives are reviewed regularly and changed if necessary to reect current thinking on their remaining lives in light of technological change, prospective economic utilisation and the physical condition of the assets.
Intangible assets In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations goodwill arising on acquisition of assets and subsidiaries is capitalised and included in intangible assets.
IFRS 3 also requires the identification of other acquired intangible assets.
The techniques used to value these intangible assets are in line with internationally used models but do require the use of estimates and forecasts which may differ from actual outcomes.
Future results are impacted by the amortisation period adopted for these items and, potentially, by any differences between forecast and actual outcomes related to individual intangible assets.
The amortisation charge for intangible assets in 2009 was 2.7 million 2008: 1.9 million.
Included in this charge was 2.5 million related to the amortisation of intangible assets arising from business contributions 2008: 1.6 million.
Goodwill of 51.3 million 2008: 53.0 million is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
The impairment review calculations require the use of forecasts related to the future profitability and cash generating ability of the acquired assets.
Pensions Pension arrangements vary for our employees and schemes reect best practice and regulation in each country.
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme for UK employees, which was closed to new employees joining the Group after 1 April 2002: most of the other schemes in operation around the world are varieties of defined contribution schemes.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 85 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2009 1 Accounting policies continued Under IAS 19: Employee Benefits Aggreko has recognised a pre-tax pension deficit of 5.8 million at 31 December 2009 2008: 8.0 million which is determined using actuarial assumptions.
The decrease in the pension deficit is a result of the additional contributions made by the Company during the year, over and above the cost of accrual of benefits.
These were: 0.5 million paid in March 2009, in line with the Recovery Plan agreed for the Scheme following the 2005 valuation and 3.5 million paid in December 2009, in line with the Recovery Plan agreed for the Scheme following the actuarial valuation at 31 December 2008.
In addition higher than expected returns were achieved on Scheme assets over the year.
The additional contributions and investment returns have been offset by lower next interest rates used to value the liabilities.
The main assumptions used in IAS 19 valuation for the previous two years are shown in Note 25 of the Accounts.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
An impairment is recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount where there is objective evidence that the Group may not be able to collect all amounts due.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default, or large and old outstanding balances, particularly in countries where the legal system is not easily used to enforce recovery, are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
The majority of the contracts the Group enters into are small relative to the size of the Group and, if a customer fails to pay a debt, this is dealt with in the normal course.
However, some of the contracts the Group undertakes in developing countries are substantial, and are in jurisdictions where payment practices can be unpredictable.
The Group monitors the risk profile and debtor position of all such contracts regularly, and deploys a variety of techniques to mitigate the risks of delayed or non-payment: these include securing advance payments, guarantees and various types of insurance.
As a result of the rigorous approach to risk management, the Group has historically had a low level of bad debt.
At 31 December 2009 the provision for impairment of trade receivables in the balance sheet was 26.2 million 2008: 25.2 million.
Taxation Aggrekos tax charge is based on the profit for the year and tax rates in force at the balance sheet date.
In addition to corporation tax, Aggreko is subject to indirect taxes such as sales and employment taxes across tax jurisdictions in the approximately 100 countries in which the Group operates.
The varying nature and complexity of the tax law in these jurisdictions requires the Group to make judgements in determining the best estimate as to total amount of taxes that will become payable, and should therefore be recorded as a liability at the balance sheet date.
Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include liquidity, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and credit risk.
The Group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to ensure that adequate liquidity is available to meet the Groups funding requirements as they arise, and that financial risk arising from the Groups underlying operations is effectively identified and managed.
The treasury operations are conducted in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board and are reviewed annually.
Financial instruments are only executed for hedging purposes and transactions that are speculative in nature are expressly forbidden.
Monthly reports are provided to senior management and treasury operations are subject to periodic internal and external review.
Liquidity, funding and capital management The Groups objective with respect to managing capital is to maintain a balance sheet structure that is both efficient in terms of providing long term returns to shareholders and safeguards the Groups financial position through economic cycles.
If appropriate the Group can choose to adjust its capital structure by varying the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, by returning of capital to shareholders, by issuing new shares or by adjusting the level of capital expenditure.
Gearing at 31 December 2009 decreased to 29% from 78% at 31 December 2008.
The Group maintains sufficient facilities to meet its normal funding requirements over the medium-term.
These facilities are primarily in the form of committed bank facilities totalling 524.1 million at 31 December 2009, arranged on a bilateral basis with a number of international banks.
The financial covenants attached to these facilities are that Operating Profit should be no less than 3 times interest, EBITDA should be no less than 4 times interest and net debt should be no more than 3 times EBITDA.
The Group does not consider that these financial covenants are restrictive to its operations.
86 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Accounts 1 Accounting policies continued The maturity profile of the borrowings is detailed in Note 17 in the Annual Report and Accounts with the next significant maturity not due until September 2011.
Since the year end the Group has reduced committed facilities by 70.8 million to 453.3 million.
The facilities now in place are currently anticipated to be ample for meeting the Groups requirements for the foreseeable future.
Net debt amounted to 175.5 million at 31 December 2009 and at that date undrawn committed facilities were 344.1 million.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to minimise the exposure to interest rates by ensuring an appropriate balance of fixed and oating rates.
The Groups primary funding is at oating rates through its bank facilities.
In order to manage the associated interest rate risk, the Group uses interest rate swaps to vary the mix of fixed and oating rates.
At 31 December 2009, 107.3 million of the net debt of 175.5 million was at fixed rates of interest resulting in a fixed to oating rate net debt ratio of 61:39 2008: 63:37.
For the year ended 31 December 2009 the Group incurred a charge of 3.1 million as a result of terminating some interest rate swaps as debt declined in the second half of 2009.
The Group monitors its interest rate exposure on a regular basis by applying forecast interest rates to the Groups forecast net debt profile after taking into account its existing hedges.
The Group also calculates the impact on profit and loss of a defined interest rate shift for all currencies.
Based on the simulations performed, the impact on profit or loss of a -100 basis-point shift, after taking into account existing hedges, would be 0.7 million 2008: 1.5 million.
The sensitivity analysis is performed on a monthly basis and is reported to the Board.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is subject to currency exposure on the translation of its net investments in overseas subsidiaries into Sterling.
In order to reduce the currency risk arising, the Group uses direct borrowings in the same currency as those investments.
Group borrowings are predominantly drawn down in the principal currencies affecting the Group, namely US Dollar, Euro and Sterling.
The Group manages its currency ows to minimise foreign exchange risk arising on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and uses forward contracts where appropriate in order to hedge net currency ows.
The positive impact of currency, largely due to the movement in the US Dollar and the Euro, increased our revenues by 145.9 million 2008: 57.1 million and trading profit by 35.9 million 2008: 12.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2009.
The Group monitors the impact of exchange closely and regularly carries out sensitivity analysis.
For every 5 cents movement in the US Dollar to GBP exchange rate there is an approximate impact of 7.2 million 1 2008: 4.4 million in trading profit in terms of translation.
For every 5 cents movement in the Euro to GBP exchange rate there is an approximate impact of 0.3 million 2008: 0.5 million in trading profit in terms of translation.
Currency translation also gave rise to a 30.9 million decrease in reserves as a result of year on year movements in the exchange rates 2008: increase of 99.0 million.
For every 5 cents movement in the Dollar and Euro, there is an approximate impact in equity of 3.4 million and 1.5 million respectively 2008: 9.2 million and 2.8 million, arising from the currency translation of external borrowings which are being used as a net investment hedge, however this will be offset by a corresponding movement in the equity of the net investment being hedged.
Credit risk Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit risk on amounts due from counterparties.
The Group manages this risk by limiting the aggregate amounts and their duration depending on external credit ratings of the relevant counterparty.
In the case of financial assets exposed to credit risk, the carrying amount in the balance sheet, net of any applicable provisions for loss, represents the amount exposed to credit risk.
Management of trade receivables The management of trade receivables is the responsibility of the operating units, although they report monthly to Group on debtor days, debtor ageing and significant outstanding debts.
At an operating unit level a credit rating is normally established for each customer based on ratings from external agencies.
Where no ratings are available, cash in advance payment terms are often established for new customers.
Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis.
Some of the contracts undertaken in our IPP business are substantial, and are in jurisdictions where payment practices can be unpredictable.
The Group monitors the risk profile and debtor-position of all such contracts regularly, and deploys a variety of techniques to mitigate the risks of delayed or non-payment: these include securing advance payments, bank guarantees and various types of insurance.
On the largest contracts, all such arrangements are approved at Group level.
Contracts are reviewed on a case by case basis to determine the customer and country risk.
1 Trading profit represents operating profit before gain on sale of property, plant and equipment.

It will be paid on 21 May 2010 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 23 April 2010.
11 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Trusts which are treated as cancelled.

These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for value in use calculations are those relating to expected changes in revenue and the cost base, discount rates and long-term growth rates.
The discount rate used for business valuations was 9.8% after tax, 13.6% before tax based on the weighted average cost of capital WACC of the Group.
On the basis that the business carried out by all CGUs is closely related and assets can be redeployed around the Group as required, a consistent Group discount rate has been used for all CGUs.
Values in use were determined using current year cashows, a prudent view of future market trends and excludes any growth capital expenditure.
A terminal cash ow was calculated using a long-term growth rate of 2.0%.
As at 31 December 2009, based on internal valuations, Aggreko plc management concluded that the values in use of the CGUs significantly exceeded their net asset value.
The Directors consider that there is no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions made in their impairment calculations that would give rise to an impairment.

The Group assesses credit quality differently in relation to its two business models as explained below: Local business Our Local business serves customers in Middle East & South East Europe, Europe, North America, Asia, Australasia, Latin America and South Africa.
It is a high transaction intensive business focussed on frequently occurring events and the majority of the contracts in this business are small relative to the size of the Group.
There is no concentration of credit risk in this business other than in the case of a major event, for example, the Winter Olympics in Vancouver, which is included in the North American business segment.
Apart from these type of major events there are a large number of customers who are unrelated and internationally dispersed.
The management of trade receivables is the responsibility of the operating units, although they report monthly to Group on debtor days, debtor ageing and significant outstanding debts.
The effectiveness of this credit process has meant that the Group has historically had a low level of bad debt in the Local business.
International Power Projects IPP Our International Power Projects business concentrates on medium to very large contracts.
Most projects in this business are worth over 1 million and some can be worth over 10 million.
Customers are mainly in developing countries and include power utilities, governments, armed forces, oil companies and mining companies.
In addition the majority of the contracts above are in jurisdictions where payment practices can be unpredictable.
The Group monitors the risk profile and debtor position of all such contracts regularly, and deploys a variety of techniques to mitigate the risks of delayed or non-payment: these include securing advance payments, bonds and guarantees.
On the largest contracts, all such arrangements are approved at a Group level.
To date the Group has also had a low level of bad debt in the IPP business although the risk of a major default is high.
The total trade receivables balance as at 31 December 2009 for our IPP business was 80.9 million 2008: 93.8 million.
Within this balance receivable balances totalling 65.1 million 2008: 66.3 million had some form of payment cover attached to them.
This payment cover guards against the risk of customer default rather than the risk associated with customer disputes.
The risk associated with the remaining 15.8 million 2008: 27.5 million is deemed to be either acceptable or payment cover is not obtainable in a cost effective manner.

This 70.8 million is included in the table above as follows: 40.5 million expiring between 1 and 2 years and 30.3 million expiring between 2 and 3 years.
iii Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities The interest rate profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2009, after taking account of the interest rate swaps used to manage the interest profile, was: Fixed rate debt Weighted Weighted average period Floating Fixed average interest for which rate rate rate Total rate is fixed million million million % Years Currency: Sterling 39.0 39.0 US Dollar 18.6 89.5 108.1 4.6 6.8 Euro 15.1 17.8 32.9 5.0 3.6 Other currencies 17.7 17.7 At 31 December 2009 90.4 107.3 197.7 Sterling 36.6 36.6 US Dollar 72.1 189.6 261.7 4.8 4.9 Euro 17.6 37.9 55.5 4.8 3.1 Other currencies 25.5 25.5 At 31 December 2008 151.8 227.5 379.3 The oating rate financial liabilities principally comprise debt which carries interest based on different benchmark rates depending on the currency of the balance.
The principal benchmark rates for oating rate financial liabilities are the relevant LIBOR London Interbank Offered Rate rates for Sterling, US Dollars and Euro and liabilities are normally fixed in advance for periods between one and three months.
The weighted average interest rate on fixed debt is derived from the fixed leg of each interest rate swap.
The effect of the Groups interest rate swaps is to classify 107.3 million 2008: 227.5 million of borrowings in the above table as fixed rate.

i Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December 2009.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
Market values have been used to determine fair values.

Current borrowings and overdrafts Short-term deposits The fair value of short-term deposits and current borrowings and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Non-current borrowings In the case of bank loans and other loans, the fair value approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as all debt is raised on a oating rate basis where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.

It is likely that the majority of overseas earnings would qualify for the UK dividend exemption and therefore no tax liability is expected to arise.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities prior to off setting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12 during the period are shown below.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related deferred tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of 4.2 million 2008: 3.3 million of which 4.2 million 2008: 3.3 million relates to carried forward tax losses as our forecasts indicate that these assets will not reverse in the near future.
Deferred tax assets of 2.6 million 2008: 2.6 million have been recognised in respect of entities which have suffered a loss in either the current or preceding period.

In addition 298,020 shares were allotted to US participants in the Long-term Incentive Plan by the allotment of new shares at 20 pence per share.
Share options The options under the Savings-Related Share Option Schemes have been granted at a discount of 20% on the share price calculated over the three days prior to the date of invitation to participate, mature after three to five years and are normally exercisable in the six months following the maturity date.
The options under the US Stock Purchase Plan have been granted at a discount of 15% to the share price on the date of grant, mature after two years and are normally exercisable in the three months following the maturity date.
The options under the Executive Share Option Scheme are normally only exercisable once three years have elapsed from date of grant and lapse after ten years.
All Executive Options are subject to performance conditions based on both total shareholder return TSR and growth in Earnings Per Share EPS.
TSR is calculated by reference to the increase in the Companys share price plus dividends paid.
EPS is Basic Earnings Per Share as disclosed in the consolidated income statement.
At the time when the individual wishes to exercise the option, the growth in the Companys TSR is compared to that of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts over a specified period.
If the Companys TSR matches or exceeds that index, and the Companys EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 3% per annum, over three consecutive years, the option is capable of exercise.
Retesting of performance conditions is limited to six monthly intervals between 3 and 5 years after the date of grant.
For Executive Share Options granted prior to 25 April 2001, at the time when the individual wishes to exercise the option, the Companys TSR since the date of grant of the option is compared to that of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts.
If the Companys TSR matches or exceeds that index, and the Companys annual EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 3% per annum, over three consecutive years, the option is capable of exercise.

Aggreko has taken the IFRS 1 exemption to apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payment only to options that were granted after 7 November 2002 and were not vested at 1 January 2005.
For the Sharesave and US Stock Options the Black-Scholes option-pricing model was used.
As the Executive options have share price based performance conditions attached the Monte Carlo option-pricing model was used.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free interest rate is the expected return on UK Gilts of a similar life.

United Kingdom The Group operates pension schemes for UK employees.
The Aggreko plc Pension Scheme the Scheme is a funded, contributory, defined benefit scheme.
Assets are held separately from those of the Group under the control of the Directors of Aggreko Pension Scheme Trustee Limited.
The Scheme is subject to valuations at intervals of not more than three years by independent actuaries.
A valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2008 using the Attained Age method to determine the level of contributions to be made by the Group.
The actuaries adopted a valuation basis linked to market conditions at the valuation date.
Assets were taken at market value.
The major actuarial assumptions used were: Return on investments 4.8% Rate of increase in salaries 4.6% Increase in pensions 3.1% At the valuation date, the market value of the Schemes assets excluding AVCs was 32,600,000 which was sufficient to cover 67% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after making allowances for future increases in earnings.
During 2009 Company contributions for benefits building up in the future were 25.4% of pensionable earnings.
As part of the valuation at 31 December 2008, the Company and the trustees have agreed upon a Schedule of Contributions and a Recovery Plan.
From 1 January 2010 the Company will pay contributions for benefits building up in future at a rate of 28.6% of pensionable earnings, plus administration costs.
To address the Scheme deficit the Group made additional contributions of 0.5 million in March 2009 and 3.5 million in December 2009.
The Company plans to make further additional contributions of 3.5 million in 2010, 2.5 million in 2011 and 0.6 million in subsequent years until December 2018.
Employee contributions are 6% of pensionable earnings.
