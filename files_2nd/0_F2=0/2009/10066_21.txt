Annual Report 2009 Melrose PLC 69 Notes to the accounts continued 12 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
The Company estimates discount rates using rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each cash-generating unit.
The growth rates are based on a prudent estimate of long-term industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from financial budgets approved by management and extrapolates cash flows based on estimated growth rates of between 2% and 3%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The pre-tax discount rate applied is between 7% and 9% depending on the risk elements associated with each cash-generating unit.
No impairment was identified and a reasonable possible change in the assumptions applied would not result in any impairment.
Acquisition of subsidiaries On 1 July 2008, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of FKI plc.
During 2009, the Group finalised the acquisition accounting for items calculated on a provisional basis at 31 December 2008 and has recorded adjustments to the opening Balance Sheet of the FKI Group net assets acquired.

The Group arranged a 750 million multi-currency committed bank facility on the acquisition of FKI plc.
This provides term loan and revolving facilities through to 22 April 2013.
A number of Group companies act as guarantors to this facility.
Drawdowns bear interest at interbank rates of interest plus a margin determined by reference to the Groups performance under its debt cover covenant ratio and ranges between 1.25% and 2.35%.
The margin as at 31 December 2009 was 1.75%.
Throughout the year, the Group remained compliant with all covenants under these facilities.
The term loan facility is fully drawn down having originally been set at 500 million.
During the year the Group repaid and cancelled US $80.0 million of the term loan facility following the sale of the Logistex businesses.
During 2009, all drawings under the 250 million revolving facility were repaid following strong operational cash generation in the Group, leaving only 25.1 million of this facility utilised for documentary credits.
At 31 December 2009, the undrawn amount of the revolving facility was 224.9 million 31 December 2008: 108.6 million, 1 January 2008: 25.0 million.
The interest rate re-pricing profile of financial liabilities, after taking into account hedging interest rate derivatives, is described in note 24.
Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of anticipated future cash flows including interest in relation to the Groups financial liabilities, on an undiscounted basis and which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value is shown in the table over the page.
Interest on floating rate debt is based on a 1 month LIBOR curve for each currency, while interest on hedging interest rate swaps is based on the relevant forward LIBOR curve.
Finance lease liabilities are secured by the assets leased, are Euro denominated and are a mix of floating and fixed interest rate debt with remaining repayment periods not exceeding one year.

This property will be retained within the Group for the foreseeable future.
In addition, 1.7 million of liabilities have been reclassified from other payables.
76 Melrose PLC Annual Report 2009 Business performance Governance Financials Shareholder information 20 Provisions continued The provision for surplus leasehold property costs is the estimated net rentals payable over the period of the leases, together with any dilapidation costs.
Environmental and legal provisions relate to the estimated remediation costs of pollution, soil and groundwater contamination at certain sites and estimated future costs and settlements in relation to legal claims.
Incentive scheme related provisions are in respect of long term incentive plans for divisional senior management.
The FKI captive insurance provision relates to known and actuarial assessments of future claims covered by the captive including, but not limited to, public and product liability, employers liability in the UK, workers compensation in the US and automotive claims in the UK and US.

A deferred tax asset of 3.8 million 2008: 18.6 million has been recognised in respect of losses of 13.6 million, together with an asset of 18.3 million 2008: 11.2 million on other timing differences.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 237.8 million 2008: 339.0 million due to the divisional and geographic split of anticipated future profit streams.
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely, subject to certain continuity of business requirements.
A significant part of the retirement benefit obligations recognised in the Group accounts relates to the McKechnie UK Plan, the FKI UK Plans and the FKI US Pension Plan.
A deferred tax asset of 7.4 million 2008: 1.0 million has been recognised on these obligations to the extent that they are expected to generate tax deductions against foreseeable profits.
As at 31 December 2009, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 4.0 million 2008: 3.8 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Annual Report 2009 Melrose PLC 77 Notes to the accounts continued 22 Share-based payments Melrose 2009 Incentive Scheme On 14 August 2007, a share incentive scheme was approved the 2007 Incentive Scheme which was due to expire on 31 May 2012.
On 14 May 2009, pursuant to a shareholder resolution passed at a General Meeting on that date, the 2007 Incentive Shares of 1 each were repurchased at their nominal value and each holder of 2007 Incentive Shares subscribed for the same number of 2009 Incentive Shares at their nominal value.
The rights attaching to the 2009 Incentive Shares are identical to those attaching to the 2007 Incentive Shares, with the exception that the Company may pay a dividend on the 2009 Incentive Shares as an alternative to converting them into Ordinary Shares and the holders may not request early conversion in 2010 and or 2011.
This has not resulted in a change to fair value.
The 2009 Incentive Shares were issued to Directors, senior management and Ogier Employee Benefit Trustee Limited, as trustee of the Melrose PLC Employee Benefit Trust.
The 2009 Incentive Shares do not confer a right to be paid an annual dividend, nor the right to vote at a general meeting.
On winding up, the holders are entitled to participate in the Companys assets equal to an amount to which they would have been entitled if their 2009 Incentive Shares had crystalised as at the date of winding up.
Further details of the 2009 Incentive Shares can be found in the Remuneration report on pages 40 to 43.
The estimated fair value attributable to the 2009 Incentive Shares formerly the 2007 Incentive Shares using a Black Scholes option pricing model at 31 December 2009 was 21.0 million 31 December 2008: 1.0 million, 1 January 2008: 3.7 million.
The inputs into the Black Scholes model used to fair value the Scheme when it was originally established in 2007 were as follows: Valuation assumptions Weighted average share price 1.67 Weighted average exercise price 1.00 Expected volatility 25.0% Expected life as at inception 4.8yrs Risk free interest 2.0% Expected dividend yield 3.2% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price.
The Group recognised total expenses of 1.8 million 2008: 2.0 million in relation to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2009 including National Insurance charges of nil 2008: 0.2 million.
23 Retirement benefit obligations Melrose holds several pension plans covering many of its employees and operating in several jurisdictions.
The most significant defined benefit plans for continuing operations are: The FKI UK Pension Plans which include the FKI UK Pension Plan, the Cleco Plan and the Bridon Group Senior Executive Plan.
These are defined benefit in type and are funded plans where the future liabilities for members benefits are provided for by the accumulation of assets held externally to the Group in separate trustee administered funds.
The McKechnie UK Pension Plan.
This is defined benefit in type and is a funded plan other than 3.3 million of unfunded liabilities where the future liabilities for members benefits are provided for by the accumulation of assets held externally to the Group in separate trustee administered funds.
This is defined benefit in type and is a funded plan where the future liabilities for members benefits are provided for by the accumulation of assets held externally to the Group in separate trustee administered funds.
Other plans include the Dynacast US defined plan and a number of funded and unfunded defined benefit arrangements across Europe.
Further details of the status of the significant plans are disclosed in the Directors report on pages 28 to 35.
The cost of these plans is determined in accordance with IAS 19 with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries on the basis of formal actuarial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
In line with normal practice, these valuations are undertaken triennially in the UK and annually in the US.
The valuations are based on the preliminary UK full actuarial valuations as of 31 December 2008 updated at 31 December 2009 by independent actuaries and US full actuarial valuations as of 1 January 2009 updated at 31 December 2009 by independent actuaries.
78 Melrose PLC Annual Report 2009 Business performance Governance Financials Shareholder information 23 Retirement benefit obligations continued The Group also operates unfunded retiree medical and welfare benefit plans, principally in the US.
However, during the year, a number of these plans have been terminated.
In addition to this, there are a number of defined contribution plans across the Group.
Contributions during the year were 15.1 million 2008: 11.7 million.
The major weighted average assumptions used by the actuaries in calculating the Groups pension plan assets and liabilities are as set out below: 31 December 2009 FKI US US Retiree FKI UK McKechnie Pension Benefit Other Plans UK Plan Plan Plans plans % p. a.

Future improvements are in line with 80% 60% for women of the Long Cohort, subject to a minimum underpin of 1% p. a.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 20.1 years if they are male and for a further 23.5 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2024 at age 65, the assumptions are that they will live for a further 21.7 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 24.9 years after retirement if they are female.
The mortality assumptions are in line with those adopted for the draft triennial valuation results as at 31 December 2008.
Sensitivities Sensitivities around movements in the principal assumptions of the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality are discussed in the Finance Directors review.

In January 2009, the Group entered into a number of interest rate swaps to hedge $546.0 million of US Dollar denominated bank debt into fixed rates of interest.
Under the terms of these swaps the Group will pay an average rate of 2.1% p. a. plus a 2.0% margin annually in arrears and receive 3 month US Dollar LIBOR plus 2.0% quarterly in arrears.
These swaps all mature in January 2013.
These interest rate swaps were overlaid with a number of basis swaps in April 2009.
Under the terms of these basis swaps the Group pays 3 month US Dollar LIBOR quarterly in arrears and receives 1 month US Dollar LIBOR plus 0.3% monthly in arrears.
In April 2009, the Group also took out an interest rate swap to hedge 33.3 million of Euro denominated debt into fixed rates of interest.
The swap is structured in a similar way to the US Dollar interest rate swaps with the Group paying 2.6% plus a 2.0% margin annually in arrears and receiving 3 month EURIBOR plus 2.0% quarterly in arrears.
This swap matures in April 2013.
A corresponding amount of debt drawn under the 750 million loan facility is matched with these swaps.
These interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges and were highly effective throughout 2009.
The fair value of the contracts at 31 December 2009 was a net asset of 0.8 million 2008: nil.
Foreign currency risk The Groups policy for managing foreign currency risk is set out in the Finance Directors review.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis Currency risks are defined by IFRS 7 as the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial asset or liability will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
