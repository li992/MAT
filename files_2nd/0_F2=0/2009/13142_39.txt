Adjusted figures are stated before amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, exceptional restructuring and acquisition related costs, disposals and other non operating items, related tax effects and movements in deferred taxation assets and liabilities that are not expected to crystallise in the near term.
Adjusted operating profit is also grossed up to exclude the equity share of taxes in joint ventures.
Exceptional restructuring costs relate to the major restructuring programmes announced in February 2008 and 2009.
Acquisition related costs relate to acquisition integration and fees incurred in connection with acquisition financing.
Adjusted operating cash flow is measured after net capital expenditure and dividends from joint ventures but before payments in relation to exceptional restructuring and acquisition related costs.
