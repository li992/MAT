About the artist ayne thiebaud, whose work is featured in this report, is one of Americas most acclaimed modern artists.
His iconic images of everyday objects, W bakery and delicatessen goods and other consumer products in rich textured paint, are instantly recognisable and have been exhibited all over the world.
thiebaud was born in 1920 to a Mormon family in Arizona.
He studied in California, but with no formal training in drawing or painting, learned his trade commercially, working as a cartoonist, poster designer, commercial artist and even a stint as an animator at Disney.
Before establishing himself as a painter, thiebaud briefly worked as an art director for two Manhattan advertising agencies.
1 front cover It was in 1962 at the relatively late age of 42, that he came to national prominence with his first new York one-man show.
the event was a sellout drawing rave reviews from critics.
His arrival on the new York art scene coincided with exhibitions by groundbreaking artists Jim Dine, roy lichtenstein and Claes oldenburg, leading to him being linked with the Pop Art movement.
though they shared a focus on commonplace objects of American consumer culture, thiebauds thickly painted, strangely illuminated forms convey a sense of fun and a pathos seldom found in that genre.
With his intense love of paint, he saw himself in the tradition of realist painting his world was store counters, cakes, pies, desserts, deli counters, salamis and cheeses.
Food familiar to every American child, as he has said of his early works.
like Andy Warhol, another contemporary new artist with a background in advertising, thiebauds commercial grounding informs his layout of American consumer imagery fruit, sandwiches, yo-yos, ties, lipsticks, gumball machines.
What thiebaud has called the tattletale signs of our culture.
later in his career, he turned to figurative painting, and then to landscapes, albeit uniquely American ones, and cityscapes such as freeway curves and the giddy gradients of San Francisco.
In parallel with his prolific artistic body of work, thiebaud has a reputation as a fine educationalist.
After more than 30 years as a faculty member 2 pages 12 and 13 at California State university, he retired from full time teaching of art and art history in 1990 at the age of 80. recognition of his standing as an artist and teacher has come in the dozens of medals, awards and honorary degrees bestowed upon him.
In 1994 he was presented with the national Medal of Arts by President Clinton.
PP Annual reports continue their tradition of taking W their visual cues from world economies important to our company and to our clients.
In recent years, weve looked to India, China, Africa and, last year, latin America via Brazil for inspiration.
11 page 64 this year weve focused on the united States, the worlds largest market, a nation whose significance and strength despite the shift in global economic focus from west to east and south remains supreme.
In our own industry, as with so many others, the uS still accounts for the lions share of the world market.
twenty-six of our top 50 clients are headquartered there.
It is a nation in which WPP has deep roots.
All but two of the Groups major networks are based there.
So, in this spirit, and for this, our 25th anniversary Annual report, WPP is honoured to have obtained permission to borrow works from one of Americas most distinguished modern painters, Wayne thiebaud.
