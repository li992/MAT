Notes to the parent company financial statements 1.
Accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified for derivative financial instruments which are held on the balance sheet at fair value see Derivative financial instruments below.
The financial statements comply with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
Fixed asset investments The Companys investments in Group undertakings are held at cost less provision for impairment, except for those amounts designated as being in a fair value hedge see below.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised, subject to certain exceptions, in respect of all material timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and for tax purposes.
Those timing differences recognised include accelerated capital allowances and short-term timing differences.
Timing differences not recognised include those relating to the revaluation of fixed assets in the absence of a commitment to sell the assets, the gain on sale of assets rolled into replacement assets and the distribution of profits from overseas companies in the absence of any commitment by the Company to make the distribution.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date.
Employee benefits i Pension obligations The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution pension arrangements.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Companys defined benefit arrangements is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the scheme assets, shown net of deferred tax.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method as determined annually by qualified actuaries.
The current service cost of providing pension benefits to employees, together with the cost of any benefits relating to past service, is charged to operating profit and included in employee costs.
The interest cost and the expected return on assets are shown as a net amount of finance cost or income adjacent to interest.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in equity.
Curtailments and settlements relating to the Companys defined benefit plan are recognised in the period in which the curtailment or settlement occurs.
For the Companys defined contribution arrangements, the charge against profit is equal to the amount of contributions payable.
ii Share-based compensation The Company operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans, whereby, subject to meeting any relevant conditions, employees are awarded shares or rights over shares.
The cost of such awards is measured at fair value, excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions, on the date of grant.
The expense is generally recognised over the vesting period and is adjusted for the estimated effect, on the number of shares that will eventually vest, of non market-based vesting conditions and forfeitures due to employees leaving the employment of the Company.
Fair values are calculated using a combination of Black-Scholes, Binomial and Monte Carlo simulation models depending on the conditions attached to the particular share scheme.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of FRS 20 in respect of equity-settled awards so as to apply FRS 20 only to those equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 January 2005.
Own shares The cost of own shares held in treasury treasury shares or by the Companys employee share trusts for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of the Groups employee share plans are deducted from shareholders funds in the Company and Group balance sheet.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost taken to the profit and loss account reserve except where the proceeds exceed the consideration paid, where the excess is transferred to the share premium account.
No gain or loss is recognised on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board but unpaid at the period end are not recognised in the financial statements until they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
100 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2009 Operating and Financial Shareholder Overview financial review Reports statements information Glossary Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rates ruling on the dates of the transactions, adjusted for the effects of any hedging arrangements.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the relevant rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
In accordance with FRS 26, the Company applies fair value accounting, in order to hedge part of its euro loan with Mitchells & Butlers Germany GmbH against part of its investment in Mitchells & Butlers Germany GmbH.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation on both of these items using the period end rate are taken to the profit and loss account.
The remainder of the investment in Mitchells & Butlers Germany GmbH is held at cost as described above.
Derivative financial instruments The Company used interest rate swaps and gilt hedges in the prior period to mitigate the anticipated exposure to changes in interest rates and movements in the value of the Groups fixed rate debt.
Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes.
Interest rate swap contracts are initially measured at fair value on the contract date, and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which the changes arise.
Profit and loss account The Company has taken advantage of Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its own profit and loss account and notes.
The Company recorded a loss after tax of 47m 2008 profit of 365m, less dividends of nil 2008 58m.
Auditors remuneration for audit services to the Company was 22,000 2008 22,000.

Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results can differ from those estimates.
Estimates are used when accounting for items such as amortisation, asset impairments, pensions and taxation.
Exchange rates The results of overseas operations have been translated into sterling at weighted average rates of exchange for the year of 1 1.15 2008 1 1.31 and euro denominated assets and liabilities have been translated into sterling at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date of 1 1.09 2008 1 1.26.

Information concerning the pension scheme arrangements operated by the Company and associated current and future contributions is contained within note 7 on pages 72 to 74 to the consolidated financial statements.

Derivative financial instruments In advance of the intended property backed refinancing, a number of derivative instruments were executed by, or transferred to the Company, to mitigate against anticipated movements in the value of the Groups fixed rate debt.
These are explained further in note 20 page 87 to the consolidated financial statements.
These instruments did not qualify for hedge accounting within the Company as they could not be designated as a hedge against the cash flows of any specific financial instrument anticipated as part of a future property backed refinancing.
On 29 January 2008, the Group announced that following the deterioration in the mark-to-market deficit on the hedges and with no near-term prospect of debt markets permitting a property-based transaction, it had closed out, in cash, the hedges no longer required, which included all of the derivative instruments held by the Company.
The total fair value movement of the instruments closed out, during the period to January 2008 when they were settled was a 3m gain.
This movement was recognised directly in the Companys profit and loss account.
The pre-tax cost to the Company of closing out the hedges no longer required was 6m in total.
No derivative financial instruments were held at either the 2009 or 2008 balance sheet dates.
