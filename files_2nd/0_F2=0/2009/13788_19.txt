Other activities include its corporate centre in the UK.

Financial risk management The Groups Board of Directors monitor and manage the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through an internal risk register.
These include commodity, foreign exchange, credit, liquidity and interest rate risks.
Commodity price risk The Groups policy is to consider oil and gas price hedging when and where it is economically attractive to lock-in prices at levels that protect the cash flow of the Salamander Group, its business plan and debt related coverage ratios.
All hedging transactions to date have been related directly to expected cash flows and no speculative transactions have been undertaken.
For 2009, the Groups oil production was all sold at prices relative to the spot market.
During January 2009 the Group purchased Swaps for 3,750 bopd with a price of $54.00.
During May 2009 the Group purchased Zero Cost Collars for 2010 for 2,500 bopd with a put and call price of $60.00 and $78.00 respectively and in July additional Zero Cost Collars for 1,500 bopd with a put and call price of $60.00 and $90.00.
During 2009, 64% of the Groups gas production its Indonesian gas production was sold at fixed prices under long term contracts with the balance its Thai gas production sold at prices relative to the spot market.
The Group held no hedges with respect to its gas production during 2009.
The key variable which affects the fair value of the Groups hedge instruments is market expectations about future commodity prices.

The Group is exposed to the following credit and counter party risks: In respect of cash and cash equivalents, the Groups principal financial asset, the credit risk is deemed limited because the majority of the cash and cash equivalents are deposited with banks with AA or A credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
In respect of the Groups trade sales, the Group manages credit risk through dealing with, whenever possible, either international energy companies or state owned companies based in Thailand and Indonesia and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate.
The Group consistently monitors counterparty credit risk.
The carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the year-end without taking account of any collateral obtained.
In addition, the Groups operations are typically structured via contractual joint venture arrangements.
As such the Group is reliant on joint venture partners to fund their capital or other funding obligations in relation to assets and operations which are not yet cash generative.
The Group closely monitors the risks and maintains a close dialogue with those counterparties considered to be highest risk in this regard.

The following table details the Groups remaining contractual maturities for its derivative financial liabilities: 2009 Less than 13 3 months 1 month months to 1 year Total $000s $000s $000s $000s Oil collar 190 873 8,143 9,206 Interest rate swap 92 185 831 1,108 Total 282 1,058 8,974 10,314 73 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate movements through its lendings, borrowings and cash and cash equivalent deposits, which are at rates fixed to LIBOR.
The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on the Groups exposure to an interest rate movement and is prepared assuming the amount of the net debt and interest rate swaps outstanding at the balance sheet date were outstanding for the whole year.
For net debt, if interest rates had been 1% higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2009 would have decreased or increased as applicable by $1.3 million 2008: $0.4 million.
This is principally attributable to the Group maintaining a lower cash and cash equivalents position as described in note 20.
For interest rate swaps, if interest rates had been 1% higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2009 would have decreased or increased by $1.3 million and $1.8 million respectively no interest rate swaps held in 2008.
Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of the Groups fair value financial assets and liabilities are deemed to be Level 2.
2009 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total $000s $000s $000s $000s Derivative financial liabilities held to hedge the Groups exposure on expected future sales: Derivative financial liabilities 10,314 10,314 10,314 10,314 There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 during the year.

Further details of the PSP are set out in the Remuneration Report.
Awards under the PSP may be satisfied by the issue of new shares, or the transfer of shares from the Companys treasury or shares purchased in the market.
In any ten year period, the Company may not issue or have the possibility to issue more than ten per cent of the issued capital of the Company pursuant to awards granted under the PSP and any other rights granted under any other employee share plan adopted by the Company.
Shares held in treasury will count as new issue shares for the purposes of the above limits unless institutional bodies decide that they need not count.
Shares purchased in the market will not, however, count towards the limit described above.
Movement in PSP Shares during the year was as follows: 2009 2008 Shares Weighted Shares Weighted under opinion average price under opinion average price Number s Number s Outstanding at 1 January 2,489,785 0.10 1,709,026 0.10 Granted during the year 1,994,754 0.10 890,635 0.10 Lapsed during the year 541,946 Forfeited during the year 82,397 109,876 Outstanding at 31 December 3,860,196 0.10 2,489,785 0.10 Exercisable at 31 December The expense recognised for unvested employee share options of $3,433,649 relates wholly to equitysettled share based payment arising from grants made under the PSP.
At 31 December 2009, the total future expense relating to unvested awards not yet recognised was $3,309,937, which is expected to be recognised over the following 3 years.
The weighted average exercise price for options that were forfeited during the year was 0.10.

This was calculated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model based on the following assumptions: 2009 2008 Weighted average share price at date of grant 1.29 2.80 Exercise price 0.10 0.10 Expected volatility 63% 32% Expected life 3 Years 3 Years Expected dividend 0% 0% Risk-free interest rate 1.93% 4.25% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the comparator groups share price, over a period equal to the expected life of the options.
The median of the constituents of the comparator group which had a three year history was used to determine the estimate for the Company volatility.
The mean average of all the constituents of the comparator group including those with only a short listing history was 54% 2008: 57%.
The average comparator group correlation was 22% 2008: 9%.
There is a 12 month window for exercise.
However, as the exercise price is nominal it is assumed that recipients exercise at the end of the performance period.
Therefore an expected life of three years after the date of grant has been assumed.
28 Dividends The Company has declared no dividend for the year 2008: nil.
29 Post balance sheet events During February 2010, the Group increased its equity interest in the Bengara PSC from 25% to 41.67% having assumed incremental equity from PTTEP following the drilling of the South Sebuka gas discovery well in 2009.

Further analysis will be completed during 2010 to determine whether the structure merits further analysis.
