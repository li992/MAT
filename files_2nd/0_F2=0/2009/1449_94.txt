Many of these plans are defined contribution, where the Company contribution and resulting charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
However, several plans, mainly in the UK, the US and Sweden, are defined benefit, where benefits are based on employees length of service and average final salary typically averaged over one, three or five years.
The major defined benefit plans, apart from the collectively bargained Swedish plan which is still open to employees born before 1979, have been closed to new entrants since 2000.
The major defined benefit plans are funded through legally separate,  funds.
The cash funding of the plans, which may from time to time involve special payments, is designed, in consultation with independent qualified actuaries, to ensure that the assets together with future contributions should be sufficient to meet future obligations.
The funding is monitored rigorously by the Company and appropriate fiduciaries specifically with reference to the Companys credit rating, market capitalisation and cash flows.
Post-retirement scheme deficit The assets and obligations of the defined benefit schemes operated by the Group at 31 December 2009, as calculated in accordance with IAS 19 are shown below.
The fair values of the schemes assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present value of the schemes obligations is derived from cash flow projections over long periods and is therefore inherently uncertain.

In these countries the pension obligations are funded with reference to the following financing principles: The Group has a fundamental belief in funding the benefits it promises to employees.
The Group considers its pension arrangements in the context of its broader capital structure.
In general it does not believe in committing excessive capital for funding whilst it has better uses of capital within the business nor does it wish to generate surpluses.
The pension funds are not part of the Groups core business.
Pension funds may take rewarded risks with the investments underlying the funding, subject to adequate controls and the expected rewards outweighing the risks.
The Group recognises that deciding to hold certain investments may cause volatility in the funding position.
The Group would not wish to amend its contribution level for relatively small deviations from its preferred funding level, because it is expected that there will be short-term volatility, but it is prepared to react appropriately to more significant deviations.
In the event that local regulations require an additional level of financing, the Group would consider the use of alternative methods of providing this that do not require immediate cash funding but help mitigate exposure of the pension arrangement to the credit risk of the Group.
These principles are appropriate to AstraZenecas business at the present date: should circumstances change they may require review.
The Company has developed a funding framework to implement these principles.
This determines the cash contributions payable to the pension funds, but does not affect the IAS 19 liabilities.
To reduce the risk of committing excess capital to pension funds, liabilities are based on the expected return on the actual pension assets, rather than a corporate bond yield.
At present this puts a different value on the liabilities than IAS 19.
UK With regard to the Groups UK defined benefit fund, the above principles are modified in light of the UK regulatory requirements and resulting discussions with the Pension Fund Trustee.
The most recent full actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 March 2008.
Under the agreed funding principles for the UK, cash contributions will be paid to the fund to target a level of assets in excess of the current expected cost of providing benefits.
In addition, the Company will make contributions to an escrow account which will be held outside of the pension fund.
The escrow account assets will be payable to the fund in agreed circumstances, for example, in the event of the Company and Trustee agreeing a change to the current long term investment strategy.
The market value of the funds assets at the valuation date was 2,994m $5,951m equivalent, representing 87% of the funds actuarially assessed liabilities as valued in accordance with the funds technical provisions.
The escrow fund held an additional 33m at the valuation date.
During 2009, it was agreed to fund the shortfall by making a transfer of current escrow assets to the fund and by establishing a new funding schedule, making regular payments over seven years of about 42m per annum to the escrow and 132m per annum to the fund.
This includes the contributions required to meet the benefits accruing of about 60m per annum.
In addition, 90m per annum is being paid to the escrow for two years until the next valuation to cover the losses on the funds investments since the valuation date as a result of the market downturn.
Under the agreed funding principles, the key assumptions as at 31 March 2008 for contributions to both the fund and escrow account are as follows: long-term UK price inflation set at 3.5% pa, salary increases at 3.5% pa, pension increases at 3.5% pa and investment returns at 7.1% pa pre-retirement and 5.96% pa post-retirement.
On 28 January 2010, AstraZeneca announced that from 1 February 2010 the Company would commence consultation with its UK employees representatives on proposals regarding changes affecting the Groups UK pension scheme.
The Company does not propose to close the defined benefit fund to existing members, but proposes to freeze pensionable pay at its 30 June 2010 level.
Employees who choose to leave the defined benefit fund will be offered funding which they may contribute to a new Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan.
Should the proposals proceed, implementation is planned from 1 July 2010, following which a review of the funding implications will be completed.
Rest of Group The IAS 19 positions as at 31 December 2009 are shown below for each of the other countries with significant defined benefit plans.
These plans account for 91% of the Groups defined benefit obligations outside of the UK.
In principle, these plans are funded in line with the financing principles and contributions paid as prescribed by the funding framework.
The US defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2009, when plan obligations were $1,834m and plan assets were $1,412m.
This includes obligations in respect of the non-qualified plan which is largely unfunded.
The Swedish defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2009, when plan obligations were estimated to amount to $1,191m and plan assets were $687m.
The German defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2009, when plan obligations amounted to $237m and plan assets were $27m.
On current bases, it is expected that contributions excluding those in respect of past service cost during the year ended 31 December 2010 to the four main countries will be $311m.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2009 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2009 158 Financial Statements 23 Post-retirement benefits continued Post-retirement benefits other than pensions In the US, and to a lesser extent in certain other countries, AstraZenecas employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life assurance benefits for retired employees.
As at 31 December 2009, some 3,944 retired employees and covered dependants currently benefit from these provisions and some 12,658 current employees will be eligible on their retirement.
AstraZeneca accrues for the present value of such retiree obligations over the working life of the employee.
In practice these benefits will be funded with reference to the Financing Principles.
The cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions for the Group in 2009 was $19m 2008: $21m: 2007: $26m.
Plan assets were $285m and plan obligations were $418m at 31 December 2009.
These benefit plans have been included in the disclosure of post-retirement benefits under IAS 19.
Financial assumptions Qualified independent actuaries have updated the actuarial valuations under IAS 19 of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group to 31 December 2009.
The assumptions used by the actuaries are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long-term nature of the scheme, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
These assumptions were as follows: 2009 2008 UK Rest of Group UK Rest of Group Inflation assumption 3.5% 2.3% 2.8% 2.2% Rate of increase in salaries 4.5% 3.4% 3.8% 3.4% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.5% 0.9% 2.8% 0.8% Discount rate 5.5% 5.0% 6.2% 4.6% Long-term rate of return expected at 31 December Equities 8.0% 8.1% 7.9% 7.7% Bonds 5.5% 5.2% 5.2% 4.9% Others 6.5% 4.8% 6.0% 3.5% Rate of increase in medical costs 10.0% 10.0% 10.0% 10.0% The expected return on assets is determined with reference to the expected long-term level of dividends, interest and other returns derived from the plan assets, together with realised and unrealised gains or losses on the plan assets, less any costs of administering the plan, less any tax payable by the plan.
The expected returns are based on long-term market expectations and analysed on a regular basis to ensure that any sustained movements in underlying markets are reflected.
Demographic assumptions The mortality assumptions are based on country-specific mortality tables.
These are compared to actual AstraZeneca experience and adjusted where sufficient data is available.
Additional allowance for future improvements in life expectancy is included for all major schemes where there is credible data to support this continuing trend.
The table below illustrates life expectancy assumptions at age 65 for male members retiring in 2009 and members expected to retire in 2029.
