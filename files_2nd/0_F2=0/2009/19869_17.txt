Taxation UK Commercial Property Trust Limited owns two Guernsey tax exempt subsidiaries, UK Commercial Property GP Limited and UK Commercial Property Holdings Limited.
The two subsidiaries are partners in a Guernsey Limited Partnership and own a Jersey Property Unit Trust.
Both the Partnership and UK Commercial Property Holdings Limited own a portfolio of UK properties and derived rental income from those properties.
As both the Partnership and Trust property holding entities are considered tax transparent in the UK, their taxable results are taxed in the two subsidiaries.
Both are liable to UK income tax at the rate of 20 per cent on their respective net rental income.
A reconciliation of the income tax charge applicable to the results from ordinary activities at the statutory income tax rate to the charge for the year is as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 2009 31 December 2008 000 000 Net profit loss before tax 73,136 135,883 UK income tax at a rate of 20 per cent 2008: 20.5 per cent 14,627 27,856 Effect of: Capital gains losses on revaluation of investment properties not taxable 9,092 33,760 Capital losses realised not taxable 2,823 2,339 Income not taxable 45 504 Inter company loan interest 9,032 9,281 Expenditure not allowed for income tax purposes including set up costs 538 1,169 Deferred tax asset not provided for 181 373 Total tax charge - - The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 12,223,000 arising as a result of the tax loss carried forward.

Fair value is determined by reference to market based evidence, which is the amounts for which the assets could be exchanged between a knowledgeable, willing buyer and a knowledgeable, willing seller in an arms length transaction as at the valuation date.
The market value of these investment properties amounted to 710,485,000 2008: 560,120,000 which is also the fair value.
The property valuer is external to the Group.
The property valuer takes account of deleterious materials included in the construction of the investment properties in arriving at its estimate of open market valuation when the Investment Managers advise of the presence of such materials.
The Group has entered into leases on its property portfolio as lessor See note 18 for further information.
No one property accounts for more than 15 per cent of the gross assets of the Group.
All leasehold properties have more than 60 years remaining on the lease term.
There are no restrictions on the realisability of the Group's investment properties or on the remittance of income or proceeds of disposal.
However, the Groups investments comprise UK commercial property, which may be difficult to realise.
Property and property related assets are inherently difficult to value due to the individual nature of such property.
As a result, valuations are subject to substantial uncertainty.
There is no assurance that the estimates resulting from the valuation process will reflect the actual sales price even where the actual sales occur shortly after the valuation date.
In addition to the above, the property portfolio market value as at 31 December 2009 is partly based on the following: The Estimated Net Annual Rent for each property, which is based on the current rental value of each of the properties, which reflects the terms of the leases where the property, or part of the property, are let at the date of valuation.
If the property, or parts thereof, are vacant at the date of valuation, the rental value reflects the rent the valuer considers would be obtainable on an open market letting as at the date of valuation The valuer has assumed that all rent reviews are upward only and are to be assessed by reference to full current rents.
Also there is the assumption that all tenants will meet their obligations under their leases, and are responsible for insurance, payment of business rates, and all repairs, whether directly or by means of a service charge.
The valuer has not made any adjustments to reflect any liability to taxation that may arise on disposal, nor any costs associated with disposals incurred by the owner.
The valuer assumes an initial yield in the region of 5 to 7% for the majority of the properties, with the reversionary yield being in the region of 7%.
The majority of the leases are on a full repairing basis and as such the Group is not liable for costs in respect of repairs, maintenance or enhancements to its investment properties.
Included within the total market value of the property portfolio, are: Units in the Kensington High Street Jersey Property Unit Trust which holds the property at Kensington High Street, London.
99.5 per cent of the units in this Unit Trust are held by UKCPT Limited Partnership and 0.5 per cent is held by UK Commercial Property Holdings limited.
Units in the Kew Jersey Property Unit Trust which holds the property at Kew Retail Park, Richmond.
58 per cent of the units in this Trust are held by UKCPT Limited Partnership and 42 per cent is held by UK Commercial Property Holdings Limited.
Units in the W-S-M Jersey Property Unit Trust which holds the property at Weston-super-Mare.
99.5 per cent of the units in this Trust are held by UK Commercial Property Holdings Limited and 0.5 per cent is held by UKCPT Limited Partnership.

Financial Instruments The Groups investment objective is to provide Ordinary Shareholders with an attractive level of income together with the potential for income and capital growth from investing in a diversified UK commercial property portfolio.
Consistent with that objective, the Group holds UK commercial property investments.
In addition, the Groups financial instruments consist of cash, receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing its risk exposure.
These policies are summarised below and remained unchanged during the year.
Fair values The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is not different from the carrying value in the financial statements.
Market risk A 10 per cent increase in the value of the investment properties held as at 31 December 2009 would have increase net assets available to shareholders and increased the net profit by 71.0 million 2008 56.0 million.
A 10 per cent decrease in value would have reduced net assets available to shareholders and reduced the net profit by 71.0 million 2008: 56.0 million.
The calculations above are based on investment property valuations at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole, nor reflective of future market conditions.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
At the reporting date, the maturity of the Groups financial assets was: Financial Assets 2009 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Cash 70,163 - - 70,163 Rent receivable 1,644 - - 1,644 Other debtors 23 - 508 531 71,830 - 508 72,338 Financial Assets 2008 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Cash 64,610 - - 64,610 Rent receivable 898 - - 898 Other debtors 600 53 497 1,150 66,108 53 497 66,658 UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 34 In the event of default by an occupational tenant, the Group will suffer a rental shortfall and incur additional costs, including legal expenses, in maintaining, insuring and re-letting the property until it is re-let.
The Board receives regular reports on concentrations of risk and any tenants in arrears.
The Managers monitor such reports in order to anticipate and minimise the impact of defaults by occupational tenants.
The Company has a diversified tenant portfolio.
The maximum credit risk from the rent receivables of the Group at 31 December 2009 is 1,644,000 2008: 898,000.
The Group holds rental deposits of 508,000 2008: 425,000 held as collateral against tenant arrears defaults.
There is no credit risk associated with the financial liabilities of the Group.
All of the cash is placed with financial institutions with a credit rating of A or above.
Bankruptcy or insolvency may cause the Groups ability to access cash placed on deposit to be delayed or limited.
Should the credit quality or the financial position of the banks currently employed significantly deteriorate, the Manager would move the cash holdings to another financial institution.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter in realising assets or otherwise raising funds to meet financial commitments.
The Groups investments comprise UK commercial property.
Property and property related assets are inherently difficult to value due to the individual nature of each property.
