Options granted under the executive plans are valued using a binomial model.
Options granted under employee plans are valued using the Black-Scholes option model as management considered that options granted under these plans are exercised withina  the vesting date.
Optionsgranted undereachplans arevalued separately andaweightedaverage fairvaluecalculated.
The binomial model was used for executive plans so that proper allowance is made for the possibility of early exercise.
At the 2009 grant management expected 95% of the options granted under the 2001 Executive Scheme to vest 2008 95%, 2007 95% and 60% of the 2004 Executive Scheme to vest 2008 60%, 2007 60%.
Each year an assessment is made of the current vesting estimates and they are updated toreflect revised expectations ofthenumberofgrants that willvest.
For all plans the inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant.

Share Based Payments Long-Term Incentive Plans In 2004, a new share based incentiveplan was introducedfor executive directors, executive officers and the next level of senior executives, which replaced the Long-term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The plan includes a PerformanceSharePlan PSP  Plan CIP.
Vesting of the PSP award shares is dependent upon performance relative to the FTSE 100 and an index based  industry.
Under the CIP, participants could elect to use up to a maximum of one-half of their annual bonus to purchase shares.
If the shares are held for three years and the Groups EPSA growth targets are achieved participants  .
From 2009, the CIP was replaced by the Deferred Bonus Plan.
This plan is designed to encourage executives to build-up and maintain a significant shareholding in the Company.
Under the plan, up to one third of any bonus earned at target level or above by an eligible employee will be compulsorily deferred into shares which vest, subject to continued employment, in equal annual tranches over three years i. e. one thirdeachyear.
The fair values of awards granted under long term incentive plans are calculated using a binomial model.
The exercise price for all awards granted under the long term incentive plans is nil.
The PSP containsvesting conditions based on TSR versus a comparator group which represent market-based performance conditions for valuation purposes and an assessment of vesting probability is therefore factored into the award date calculations.
The assumptions include the volatilities for the comparator groups.
Given the wide range of companies within the FTSE 100 a correlation of 30% 2008 15%, 2007 20% has been assumed with the constituents of the group.
A correlation of 30% 2008 15%, 2007 20% has also been assumed for the  sectoras .
The other assumptions used are consistent with the executive scheme assumptions disclosed in Note 26 a ofthe .
