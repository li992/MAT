Further details of the share plans operated by the Company are set out in the Directors remuneration report.
Sharesave Scheme 2001 Sharesave Scheme The Sharesave Scheme, approved by shareholders at the 2001 Annual General Meeting, is approved by HM Revenue & Customs in the UK and is open to all UK employees, including the UK based executive directors, who have completed at least three months of continuous service.
It is linked to a contract for monthly savings of up to 250 per month over a period of either three or five years.
Under the Sharesave Scheme options are granted to participating employees at a discount of up to 20% of the market price prevailing on the day immediately preceding the date of invitation to apply for the option.
Options are normally exercisable either three or five years after they have been granted.
International Sharesave Plan The International Sharesave Plan was introduced following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme by shareholders.
It operates on a similar basis to the Sharesave Scheme save that it is linked to a contract for monthly savings of approximately 250 per month or equivalent in other currencies over a period of three years and options are granted to participating employees at a discount of up to 20% of the market price prevailing shortly before the date of invitation to apply for the option.
Irish Sharesave Plan The Irish Sharesave Plan was also introduced following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme by shareholders.
It is approved by the Irish Revenue Commissioners and operates on a similar basis to the Sharesave Scheme as described above except that it is linked to a contract for monthly savings of the euro equivalent of approximately 250 per month over a period of three years and options are granted to participating employees at a discount of up to 20% of the market price prevailing shortly before the date of invitation to apply for the option.
1994 Executive Share Option Scheme 1994 Scheme The 1994 Scheme was approved by shareholders at the 1994 Annual General Meeting.
No further options have been granted under the 1994 Scheme since it expired in May 2004.
A performance condition, based on the Companys adjusted earnings per share growth relative to UK inflation over three years, had to be satisfied before options would normally be exercisable.
All such performance conditions relating to options granted under the 1994 Scheme have been satisified.
Following the deregistration of the Companys American Depositary Shares ADSs from the Securities and Exchange Commission during 2007, all options granted under the 1994 Scheme to US resident participants with the exception of Mr P L Larmon have been settled in cash rather than through the delivery of shares based upon the market value of the Companys ordinary shares at the time the relevant options were exercised.
As a result of this change, options granted to US resident participants with the exception of Mr P L Larmon are now accounted for as cash settled share based payment transactions.
All other terms of options granted previously to US resident participants remain unchanged.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2004 Annual General Meeting and replaced the 1994 Scheme.
The LTIP is divided into two parts.
Part A allows the Board to grant share options.
In normal circumstances options granted are only exercisable if the relevant performance condition has been satisfied.
Share options granted to date have a performance condition attached based on the Companys adjusted earnings per share growth relative to UK inflation over three years.
Following the deregistration of the Companys ADSs from the Securities and Exchange Commission during 2007, all options granted under Part A of the LTIP to US resident participants with the exception of Mr P L Larmon have been settled in cash rather than through the delivery of shares based upon the market value of the Companys ordinary shares at the time the relevant options were exercised.
Part B of the LTIP allows the Board to award performance shares which is a conditional right to receive shares in the Company for nil consideration.
A performance share award will normally vest i. e. become exercisable on the third anniversary of its grant to the extent that the applicable performance condition has been satisfied.
The extent to which performance share awards granted prior to 2007 will vest will normally be subject to the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance over a three year period relative to the TSR performance of a specified peer group of companies.
The extent to which performance share awards granted thereafter will vest will normally be partly subject to the Companys TSR performance and partly subject to the Companys adjusted earnings per share growth relative to UK inflation over three years.
