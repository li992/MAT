Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP issued by the AIC in January 2009.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investments and derivative financial instruments at fair value.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off to capital at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value which is bid market price for listed investments.
Changes in the fair value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss and gains and losses on sales are included in capital within Losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Gains and losses on sales of investments and exchange differences of a capital nature are accounted in capital reserves within Gains on sales of investments.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end are accounted for in capital reserves within Investment holding gains.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in the revenue column of the income statement on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in the capital column.
Overseas dividends are included gross of any withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in the revenue column of the income statement.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in the capital column.
Deposit interest receivable is taken to the revenue column on an accruals basis.
Stocklending income is taken to the revenue column on a receipts basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.

Annual Report & Accounts 2009 f Financial instruments Cash and short term deposits may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other receivables and payables do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Derivative financial instruments are valued at fair value and are included in current assets or current liabilities in the balance sheet in accordance with FRS26: Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Short term forward currency contracts are classified as derivative financial instruments and the net unrealised gain or loss is included in debtors or creditors respectively.
g Foreign currency In accordance with FRS23: The effects of changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that sterling is the functional currency.
Sterling is also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss on monetary assets arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in revenue or capital, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.
Gains and losses on investments arising from a change in exchange rates are included in losses gains on investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
h Taxation Deferred taxation is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred taxation assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
i VAT Irrecoverable VAT is included in the expense on which it has been suffered.
The basis on which it has been calculated is the partial exemption method using the proportion of taxable supplies to non taxable supplies.

This has arisen from deductible expenses exceeding taxable income.
No asset has been recognised in the accounts as it is uncertain whether the Company will generate taxable revenue in the future.
Given the Companys status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided deferred taxation on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other securities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on page 19.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close co-operation with the Board and the Manager, co-ordinates the Companys risk management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys financial instruments may comprise the following: investments in equity shares of European companies and a Euro liquidity fund which are both held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: and short term forward currency contracts for the purpose of settling short term liabilities.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market price risk is given in parts i to iii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, which policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and the currency in which it reports.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least five occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowing may be used to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the sterling value of the portfolio of investments.
This borrowing is limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset exposure to those currencies.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company may use short term forward currency contracts to manage working capital requirements.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued i Currency risk continued Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31st March are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
Foreign currency sensitivity The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of return after taxation for the year and net assets with regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and the income received in foreign currency and assumes a 10% 2008: 5% appreciation or depreciation in sterling against the Euro, Swiss Franc, Swedish Kroner and the other currencies to which the Company is exposed, which is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on the volatililty of exchange rates during the year.
If sterling had strengthened this would have had the following effect: At 31st March 2009 2008 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 911 295 Capital return 551 322 Total return after taxation for the year 1,462 617 Net assets 1,462 617 JPMorgan European Fledgeling Investment Trust plc.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued i Currency risk continued Foreign currency sensitivity continued Conversely, if sterling had weakened this would have had the following effect: At 31st March 2009 2008 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 911 295 Capital return 551 322 Total return after taxation for the year 1,462 617 Net assets 1,462 617 In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analysis is broadly representative of the whole year.
ii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and the interest payable on the Companys variable rate cash borrowings.
Management of interest rate risk The Company does not normally hold significant cash balances.
Short term borrowings are used when required.
The Company may finance part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
The possible effects on cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when the Company borrows on the multi currency loan facility.
However, amounts drawn down on this facility are for short term one month periods and therefore there is limited exposure to interest rate risk.
Derivatives are not used to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.
Interest rate exposure The Company has no financial assets or liabilities carrying fixed rates of interest.
The exposure of financial assets and liabilities to floating interest rates using the year end figures, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set, is shown below.
At 31st March 2009 2008 000 000 Amounts exposed to floating interest rates: Cash and short term deposits 3,649 2,456 JPM Euro Liquidity Fund 6,206 9,750 Total exposure 9,855 12,206 Interest receivable on cash balances is at a margin below LIBOR.
The target interest earned on the JPMorgan Euro Liquidity Fund is the 7 day Euro London Interbank Bid Rate.
In February 2009, the Company entered into a Euro 40 million 1 year Floating Rate Loan Facility with ING Bank NV.
The facility expires in February 2010.
Under the terms of this agreement the Company may draw down up to Euro 40 million 46 | JPMorgan European Fledgeling Investment Trust plc.
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 at an interest rate of LIBOR as offered in the market for the relevant period, plus a margin of 1.40% per annum plus the mandatory cost rate, which is the cost of complying with the regulatory requirements of the European Central Bank and other regulatory bodies during the term of the advance.
The Company did not draw on this facility during the year.
In the previous year, the Company utilised a similar facility with ING Bank NV but which expired prior to the year end.
Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued ii Interest rate risk continued The exposure to floating interest rates during the year has fluctuated between maximum net cash balances of 49,963,000 and minimum net cash balances of 6,437,000.
During the comparative year exposure to floating interest rates fluctuated between maximum net cash balances of 40,198,000 and maximum net loan balances of 25,584,000.
Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of return after taxation for the year and net assets to a 1% 2008: 1% increase or decrease in interest rates in regards to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
At 31st March 2009 2008 1% Increase 1% Decrease 1% Increase 1% Decrease in rate in rate in rate in rate 000 000 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return increase decrease 99 99 122 122 Capital return Total increase decrease in return after taxation for the year 99 99 122 122 Net assets increase decrease 99 99 122 122 In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analysis is not representative of the whole year due to the fluctuation in the level of cash balances.
iii Other price risk Other price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, which may affect the value of equity investments.
Management of other price risk The Board meets on at least five occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risk exposure The Companys exposure to changes in market prices at 31st March comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: At 31st March 2009 2008 000 000 Equity investments at fair value through profit or loss 264,977 387,581 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to other price risk during the year.
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 | 47 Notes to the Accounts continued for the year ended 31st March 2009 18.
Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued Concentration of exposure to other price risk An analysis of the Companys investments is given on pages 13 to 17.
This shows that nearly all of the investments value is in European equities and there is no concentration of exposure to any one country.
It should also be noted that an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
Other price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of return after taxation for the year and net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% in the fair value of the Companys equities.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities and adjusting for change in the management fee, but with all other variables held constant.
At 31st March 2009 2008 10% Increase 10% Decrease 10% Increase 10% Decrease in fair value in fair value in fair value in fair value 000 000 000 000 Income statement revenue after taxation Revenue return decrease increase 275 275 504 504 Capital return increase decrease 26,498 26,498 38,758 38,758 Total revenue after taxation and net assets increase decrease 26,223 26,223 38,254 38,254 b Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in settling financial liabilities as they fall due.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise readily realisable securities, the liquidity of which in normal markets is frequently tested by the Investment Managers and which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
The Boards policy is for the Company to remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings be used to manage short term liabilities and working capital requirements.
Details of the current loan facility are given in part a ii to this note on page 46.
Liquidity risk exposure Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at the year end, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: At 31st March 2009 2008 Three Three months months or less Total or less Total 000 000 000 000 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Amounts due to brokers 7,727 7,727 12,245 12,245 Other creditors and accruals 121 121 169 169 Derivative financial instrument 11 7,849 7,849 12,414 12,414 c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction fails to discharge its obligations under that transaction which could result in loss to the Company.
