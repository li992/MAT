Tax continued The weighted average rate is calculated based on the tax rates weighted according to the profit or loss before tax earned by the group in each jurisdiction.
The change in the weighted average rate year-on-year relates to the mix of profit and loss in each jurisdiction.
The standard tax rate of UK ring fence profits is 50 per cent.
There are no significant unrecognised temporary differences associated with undistributed profits of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
The amount of unused tax losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised in the balance sheet in the absence of suitable ring fence and non-ring fence forecast profits is US$367.1 million in the UK 2008: US$6.8 million.
This gives rise to a potential deferred tax asset of US$163.3 million 2008: US$1.9 million.
Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit after tax and on the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year.
The denominators for the purposes of calculating both basic and diluted earnings per share for the prior year have been adjusted to reflect the bonus element related to the rights issue in 2009.
Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated as follows: Weighted average Profit after tax number of shares Earnings per share 2008 2008 2009 2008 2009 restated 2009 restated $ million $ million million million cents cents Basic 113.0 98.3 108.6 99.3 104.1 99.0 Outstanding share options 0.2 0.8 Diluted 113.0 98.3 108.8 100.1 103.9 98.2 The inclusion of the outstanding share options in the 2009 and 2008 calculations produces a diluted earnings per share.
The outstanding share options number includes any expected additional share issues due to future share-based payments.
At 31 December 2009 9,337,340 2008 restated: 9,337,340 potential Ordinary Shares in the company that are underlying the companys convertible bonds and that may dilute earnings per share in the future have not been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they are anti-dilutive for the year to 31 December 2009.
In accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per Share the comparatives have been restated to take into account the rights issue by the company during 2009.

These amounts are written off to the income statement as exploration expense unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment.
The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore whether the carrying value of E&E assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements 66 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the year ended 31 December 2009 9.
The impairment loss relates to the Chinguetti field in Mauritania.
The impairment charge was calculated by reference to an assessment of the future discounted cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves measured against the carrying value of the asset.
The future cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10 per cent.
Estimates involved in impairment measurement include estimates of commercial reserves, future oil and gas prices, costs and timing which are inherently uncertain.
Amortisation and depreciation for oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of proved and probable reserves on an entitlement basis at the end of the period plus production in the period, on a field-by-field basis.
Proved and probable reserve estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Management uses established industry techniques to generate its estimates and regularly references its estimates against those of joint venture partners or external consultants.
However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the fields life.

Borrowings continued Convertible bonds In June 2007, the group issued bonds at a par value of US$250 million which are convertible into Ordinary Shares of the company at any time from 6 August 2007 until six days before their maturity date of 27 June 2014.
At the initial conversion price of 15.82 per share there were 8,003,434 Ordinary Shares of the company underlying the bonds.
In April 2009 the conversion price was adjusted from 15.82 per share to 13.56 per share, as a result of the companys 4 for 9 rights issue of new Ordinary Shares.
At the adjusted conversion price of 13.56 per share there are 9,337,340 Ordinary Shares of the company underlying the bonds.
If the bonds have not been previously purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted, they will be redeemed at par value on 27 June 2014.
Interest of 2.875 per cent per annum will be paid semi-annually in arrears up to that date.
The net proceeds received from the issue of the convertible bonds were split between a liability element and an equity component at the date of issue.
The fair value of the liability component was estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the group, was included in equity reserves.
Issue costs were apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component was charged directly against equity.
2009 2008 $ million $ million Liability component at 1 January 202.7 195.6 Interest charged 14.6 14.2 Interest paid 7.2 7.1 Total liability component at 31 December 210.1 202.7 The total interest charged for the year has been calculated by applying an effective annual interest rate of 6.73 per cent 2008: 6.73 per cent to the liability component for the period since the bonds were issued.
The non-cash accrual of interest will increase the liability component as the cash interest is only paid at 2.875 per cent to US$250 million at maturity.
There is no material difference between the carrying amount of the liability component of the convertible bonds and their fair value.
This fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at the market rate.
Obligations under leases 2009 2008 $ million $ million Minimum lease payments under operating leases recognised as an expense in the year 6.6 8.4 Outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: Within one year 6.7 4.9 In two to five years 183.0 15.1 Over five years 86.1 0.9 275.8 20.9 Operating lease payments represent the groups share of rentals payable by the group for FPSOs, and for certain of its office properties, office equipment and motor vehicles.

Further details of this plan are disclosed in note 19.
The decommissioning provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs relating to the UK, West Africa, Pakistan and Vietnam oil and gas interests, which are expected to be incurred up to 2031.
These provisions have been created based on Premiers internal estimates and, where available, operators estimates.
Based on the current economic environment, assumptions have been made which the management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required, which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.
Financial instruments Hedging instruments The groups activities expose it to financial risks of changes, primarily in oil and gas prices but also foreign currency exchange and interest rates.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the groups policies and approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
It is group policy that all transactions involving derivatives must be directly related to the underlying business of the group.
The group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative exposures.
Premier undertakes oil and gas price hedging periodically within Board limits to protect operating cash flow against weak prices.
Oil and gas hedging is undertaken with collar options, swaps and embedded hedges in long-term crude offtake agreements.
The embedded hedges in long-term crude offtake agreements are not fair valued as they qualify for own-use exemption under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Oil is hedged using Dated Brent oil price options.
Indonesian gas is hedged using HSFO Singapore 180cst which is the variable component of the gas price.
Oil production a During the year additional hedges, using both collars and swaps, were undertaken, which both enhanced existing collars and covered a portion of the additional production acquired from the acquisition of Oilexco.
Total premia of US$12.5 million were paid for the collars.
b Forecast production for 2010 is now 69 per cent hedged, for 2011 it is 45 per cent hedged and for 2012 it is 14 per cent.
For the year 2010, 1.4 mmbbls are hedged at an average swap rate of US$75.63 bbl.
In addition 3.24 mmbbls for each of 2010 and 2011 are hedged at a floor of US$51.2 bbl and average cap of US$80.0 bbl.
For 2012, 1.8 mmbbls are hedged at an average floor of US$39.3 bbl and an average cap of US$100.0 bbl.
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements 71 17.
Financial instruments continued c Two offtake agreements have been entered into in which the parameters of the above collars are embedded.
These agreements are as follows: i Offtake agreement effective from 1 July 2008 for four and a half years: and ii A new offtake agreement effective from 1 January 2010 for two years.
These agreements have the effect of replacing the original financially-settled hedges previously in place for the period covered by collars.
d Deferred revenue of US$54.1 million 2008: US$33.6 million has been created due to first-day gains arising from offtake agreements and related options.
This deferred revenue will be amortised over the life of each individual offtake agreement.
For the year ended 31 December 2009 a total of US$8.5 million 2008: US$4.3 million was released to the income statement in respect of this deferred revenue.
During the year oil hedges matured generating a cash cost of US$15.0 million 2008: US$8.1 million.
An unrealised fair value loss was calculated on the swaps for the year of US$9.8 million 2008: US$nil which has been recognised directly in equity reserves as the swaps are 100 per cent effective under hedge accounting rules.
Indonesian gas production Production from 2010 to mid-year 2013 is now 22 per cent hedged with a floor of US$250.0 per metric tonne mt and a cap of US$500.0 mt.
During the year gas hedges matured generating a cash cost of US$nil 2008: US$7.8 million.
While all hedges were assessed to be effective, all movements in the fair values have been recognised in the income statement, as all such movements relate to the time-value portion of hedges under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.

Financial instruments continued The fair values, which have been determined from counterparties with whom the trades have been concluded, have been recognised in the balance sheet in trade and other receivables and trade and other payables.
The key variable which affects the fair value of the groups hedge instruments is market expectations about future commodity prices.
The following illustrates the sensitivity of net income and equity to a 10 per cent increase and a 10 per cent decrease in this variable: Oil Gas Total Increase decrease in mark to market value $ million $ million $ million 10 per cent increase 12.2 13.6 25.8 10 per cent decrease 17.2 11.2 28.4 Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities During the year US$150 million of long-term bank borrowings were swapped from floating rate to fixed rate at an average fixed rate of 1.58 per cent.
Interest is payable on a six-monthly basis and receives US$ 3-month LIBOR on a quarterly basis which matches the payment timing and interest basis of the long-term bank borrowings.
The fair value of this option at 31 December 2009 was a liability of US$0.8 million.
This has been recognised directly in equity reserves.

Share capital continued Share option plans The company has share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the companys shares have been granted to certain executives and employees.
Options granted are normally exercisable not less than three years after their grant and will lapse on their tenth anniversary.
Options cannot be exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved.
Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, eligible employees with six months or more continuous service can join the scheme.
Employees can save to a maximum of 250 per month through payroll deductions for a period of three or five years, after which time they can acquire shares at up to a 20 per cent discount.
Under the Share Incentive Plan employees are invited to make contributions to buy Partnership Shares.
If an employee agrees to buy Partnership Shares the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares Matching Shares, on a one-for-one basis.

The options outstanding at 31 December 2009 had a weighted average exercise price of 4.72 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.8 years.
The fair value of the options granted during the year was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and is not material.
The group recognised a cost of US$27.3 million and US$20.1 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2009 and 2008 respectively.
Asset and Equity Plan The Asset and Equity Plan is designed to reward employees for improvement in the asset value of the business and the market value of the company over a three-year period and is operated by reference to two bonus pools an equity bonus pool and an asset bonus pool.
The asset bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the net asset value per share of the company over a three-year period and the equity bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the equity market value per share of the company over a three-year period.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the equity bonus pool of the plan.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows: Volatility: 30.9% to 31.5% Risk free rate of interest: 4.4% to 4.9% Historic market value growth factor: 99.0% to 109.0% For the asset bonus pool a discounted cash flow model based on the average oil price over the period is used to calculate the final value of the pool and to estimate the value of future asset bonus pools.

Share capital continued Long Term Incentive Plan The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP was introduced to provide a long-term all-employee scheme which motivates all employees and provides a longer-term perspective to the total remuneration package.
Awards under the LTIP comprise three elements: Equity Pool Awards, Performance Share Awards that vest after the expiry of a three-year performance period, and a potential Matching Award that vests at the expiry of a further three-year performance period, commencing at the end of the three-year performance period for Equity Pool and Performance Share Awards.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the equity bonus pool of the plan and of the Performance Share Awards.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows: Volatility: 40.0% Risk free rate of interest: 3.3% Correlation factor with comparator group: 0.29 For the year ended 31 December 2009, the total cost recognised by the company for long-term incentive arrangements is US$46.1 million 2008: US$25.6 million, with a cumulative liability on the balance sheet of US$28.4 million 2008: US$16.3 million.
A credit of US$27.3 million has been recorded in equity 2008: US$20.1 million for all equity-settled payments for the group.
Like other elements of remuneration, this charge is processed through the time-writing system which allocates cost, based on time spent by individuals, to various entities within the Premier Oil plc group.
Part of this cost is therefore capitalised as directly attributable to capital projects and part is charged to the income statement as operating costs, pre-licence exploration costs or general and administration costs.
Ordinary Shares The rights and restrictions attached to the Ordinary Shares are as follows: Dividend rights The rights of the holders of Ordinary Shares shall rank pari passu in all respects with each other in relation to dividends.

The Scheme was closed to new members aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits in 1997 and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, was started.
Both schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
As a consequence of being closed to new entrants, the current service costs of the Scheme under the IAS 19 Employee Benefits valuation will increase as the members approach retirement.
The pension costs for the Scheme are determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The most recent formal valuation was undertaken as at 1 January 2008 using the Attained Age Method and a market-related funding basis, of which the principal financial assumptions were investment return: 5.9 per cent pa, salary growth: 5.4 per cent pa and pension increases: 3.4 per cent pa.
The market value of the Schemes assets was 14.9 million and, on the specific method and assumptions adopted, the assets covered 91 per cent of the members accrued benefits based on projected pensionable salaries.
The current Schedule of Contributions was effected in October 2008.
The employer contributes at a rate of 25 per cent of pensionable salaries with no additional monthly amounts.
The employer expects to contribute 98,000 to the Scheme in 2010.
The following figures have been prepared in compliance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits by an independent actuary on the basis of membership data current as at 31 December 2009 but taking account of pension increases effected on 1 January 2010.
The benefit obligations and service cost have been measured using the Projected Unit Credit Method and the pension expense has been assessed on the basis that the group adopts the policy of fully recognising actuarial gains and losses during the period in which they arise.
The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows: At 31 At 31 December December 2009 2008 % pa % pa Discount rate 5.6 6.0 Salary growth 5.7 5.0 Return on assets 4.9 5.8 Price inflation 3.7 3.0 Pension increases 3.7 3.0 Defined benefit obligations and assets: At 31 At 31 December December 2009 2008 $ million $ million Value of funded benefit obligations 31.2 22.7 less fair value of Scheme assets 25.6 20.7 Liability in balance sheet 5.6 2.0 Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements 80 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the year ended 31 December 2009 23.

In addition, the group is paying an unfunded pension to a former director of the company in regard to which annual increases and a reversionary spouses pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme.
On the same actuarial basis as used to assess the Schemes pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2009 of the future payments projected to be made in respect of UK unfunded pensions is US$0.9 million 2008: US$0.8 million.
A total loss of US$0.1 million 2008: gain of US$0.3 million was recognised directly in equity reserves during the year.
Defined contribution benefit scheme The group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.

Acquisition of subsidiaries On 21 May 2009 the Premier Oil plc group, through its subsidiary Premier Oil Group Ltd, completed the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of Oilexco North Sea Ltd ONSL and its wholly-owned subsidiary Oilexco North Sea Exploration Ltd ONSEL.
The group funded the acquisition and associated costs by way of: a 4 for 9 rights issue of new Ordinary Shares at a price of 485 pence per share to raise gross proceeds of approximately 171 million US$252.2 million : new credit facilities consisting initially of a US$175 million 18-month bridge facility, a US$225 million three-year revolving credit facility and US$63.0 million and 60 million US$97 million three-year letter of credit facilities: and the groups existing cash resources.
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements 82 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the year ended 31 December 2009 25.
Acquisition of subsidiaries continued ONSL is an oil and gas exploration and production company active in the UK, with its producing properties located in the UK Central North Sea.
The acquisition has provided the group with a greater presence in the North Sea, strengthening the groups existing operations in that area by adding a material package of assets comprising existing producing fields, development projects of existing discovered reserves and a portfolio of exploration prospects, together with high quality UK operatorship capabilities.
The transaction has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting with an effective date of 21 May 2009, being the date that the group gained control of ONSL.
The fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities have been reassessed since the half year, to reflect additional information which has become available concerning conditions that existed at the date of acquisition in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The final fair values, together with the changes since the half year, are set out in the following table: Provisional fair values as included in the half yearly Final report Adjustment fair values $ million $ million $ million Net assets acquired: Property, plant and equipment oil and gas properties 569.0 82.5 486.5 Deferred tax asset 146.5 5.7 140.8 Current assets 92.3 22.2 114.5 Current liabilities 39.6 39.6 Deferred tax liabilities 2.1 2.1 Long-term provisions 125.7 11.4 114.3 Total acquired net assets 640.4 54.6 585.8 Total consideration 574.1 0.1 574.2 Excess of fair value over cost 66.3 54.7 11.6 Total consideration also includes US$63.0 million of cash paid by the group which is held in trust for future abandonment obligations, and direct acquisition costs of US$10.5 million.
This excess of fair value over cost has been recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement for the year under review, and has been offset by related acquisition expenses of US$6.0 million.
The principal adjustments from the half year valuation were a reduction in the carrying value of the Shelley field in oil and gas properties, recognition of additional pre-acquisition receivables and determination of fair value for inventories acquired on completion.
The final payments made by the group at completion amounted to US$500.7 million, after adjusting for certain payables, receivables and other items which have occurred between the effective date and completion.
ONSL and ONSEL contributed US$1.0 million to revenue and US$24.0 million to profit before tax for the period between the date of acquisition and the half yearly balance sheet date.
On 1 July 2009, the assets were transferred from ONSL into another group company as part of an internal restructuring of the group.
If the acquisition of ONSL had been completed on the first day of the financial year, group sales revenues for the year would have been US$686.4 million.
As the acquired subsidiary was in administration prior to the acquisition, it is impracticable to calculate a fair estimate of cost of sales, and hence it is not possible to provide a pro forma profit before tax amount for the combined group since 1 January 2009.
Similarly appropriate amounts are not available for carrying values of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities immediately prior to the acquisition.
Due to the inherently uncertain nature of the oil and gas industry the assumptions underlying the final assigned values are judgemental in nature.
