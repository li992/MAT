The provision for the costs of decommissioning these production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives has been estimated using existing technology, at current prices or long-term assumptions, depending on the expected timing of the activity, and discounted using a real discount rate of 1.75% 2008 2.0%.
These costs are generally expected to be incurred over the next 30 years.
While the provision is based on the best estimate of future costs and the economic lives of the facilities and pipelines, there is uncertainty regarding both the amount and timing of incurring these costs.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Generally, this coincides with commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites.
The provision for environmental liabilities has been estimated using existing technology, at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 1.75% 2008 2.0%.
The majority of these costs are expected to be incurred over the next 10 years.
The extent and cost of future remediation programmes are inherently difficult to estimate.
They depend on the scale of any possible contamination, the timing and extent of corrective actions, and also the groups share of the liability.
The litigation category includes provisions for matters related to, for example, commercial disputes, product liability, and allegations of exposures of third parties to toxic substances.
Included within the other category at 31 December 2009 are provisions for deferred employee compensation of $789 million 2008 $792 million and for expected rental shortfalls on surplus properties of $246 million 2008 $251 million.
These provisions are discounted using either a nominal discount rate of 4.0% 2008 2.5% or a real discount rate of 1.75% 2008 2.0%, as appropriate.
