Retirement benefit and other post-retirement obligations Background The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans throughout the world.
For the defined benefit plans, benefits are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
Defined contribution benefits are based on the amount of contributions paid in respect of an individual member, the investment returns earned and the amount of pension this money will buy when a member retires.
The largest plan is the Pearson Group Pension Plan UK Group plan with both defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
From 1 November 2006, all sections of the UK Group plan were closed to new members with the exception of a defined contribution section that was opened in 2003.
This section is available to all new employees of participating companies.
The other major defined benefit plans are based in the US.
Other defined contribution plans are operated principally overseas with the largest plan being in the US.
The specific features of these plans vary in accordance with the regulations of the country in which employees are located.
Pearson also has several post-retirement medical benefit plans PRMBs, principally in the US.
PRMBs are unfunded but are accounted for and valued similarly to defined benefit pension plans.
Assumptions The principal assumptions used for the UK Group plan and the US PRMB are shown below.
Weighted average assumptions have been shown for the other plans, which primarily relate to US pension plans.
2009 2008 UK Group Other UK Group Other % plan plans PRMB plan plans PRMB Inflation 3.50 2.50 2.50 2.80 2.80 2.80 Rate used to discount plan liabilities 5.70 5.25 5.50 6.40 6.25 6.25 Expected return on assets 6.03 6.75 6.33 7.60 Expected rate of increase in salaries 5.00 4.00 4.30 4.50 Expected rate of increase for pensions in 2.60 2.30 payment and deferred pensions to 4.40 to 4.20 Initial rate of increase in healthcare rate 8.50 9.00 Ultimate rate of increase in healthcare rate 5.00 5.00 The UK discount rate is based on the annualised yield on the iBoxx over 15-year AA-rated corporate bond index, adjusted to reflect the duration of our liabilities.
The US discount rate is set by reference to a US bond portfolio matching model.
The expected return on assets is based on market expectations of long-term asset returns for the defined portfolio at the end of the year.
The expected rates of return on categories of plan assets are determined by reference to relevant indices.
The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the plans investment portfolio.
The expected rate of increase in salaries has been set at 5.0% for 2009 with a short-term assumption of 3.0% for three years.
In 2008 the UK mortality assumptions were derived by adjusting standard mortality tables PMFA 92 tables projected forward with medium cohort improvement factors.
In 2009 the Group changed its mortality assumptions in the UK.
The mortality base table assumptions have been derived from the SAPS all pensioners tables for males and the SAPS normal health pensioners tables for females, adjusted to reflect the observed experience of the plan, with medium cohort improvement factors.
In 2008 a 1% improvement floor on the medium cohort was applied.
In 2009 this was changed to 1.5% for males and 1.25% for females, with tapering.
For the US plans, the assumptions used were based on standard US mortality tables.
In 2008 a switch from GAM94 to RP2000 was made, to reflect the mortality assumption now more prevalent in the US.
Retirement benefit and other post-retirement obligations continued Using the above tables, the remaining average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date for the UK and US Group plans is as follows: UK US 2009 2008 2009 2008 Male 22.7 21.5 17.6 17.6 Female 23.5 21.8 20.2 20.2 The remaining average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65, 20 years after the balance sheet date, for the UK and US Group plans is as follows: UK US 2009 2008 2009 2008 Male 25.3 23.3 17.6 17.6 Female 25.6 23.8 20.2 20.2 Financial statement information The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2009 Defined UK Group benefit Defined All figures in millions plan other Sub-total contribution PRMB Total Current service cost 14 3 17 62 2 81 Past service cost 1 1 1 Total operating expense 14 4 18 62 2 82 Expected return on plan assets 83 5 88 88 Interest on plan liabilities 89 8 97 3 100 Net finance expense 6 3 9 3 12 Net income statement charge 20 7 27 62 5 94 Actual return on plan assets 136 8 144 144 2008 Defined benefit UK Group Defined All figures in millions plan other Sub-total contribution PRMB Total Current service cost 33 3 36 41 1 78 Past service cost 1 1 5 6 Total operating expense 33 4 37 41 6 84 Expected return on plan assets 104 7 111 111 Interest on plan liabilities 93 7 100 3 103 Net finance income expense 11 11 3 8 Net income statement charge 22 4 26 41 9 76 Actual loss on plan assets 130 27 157 157 The total operating charge is included in administrative and other expenses.
In 2008 the UK Group plan current service cost included 14m relating to defined contribution sections.
In 2009 the defined contribution section of the UK Group plan is recorded within the defined contribution expense.

Defined contribution assets are no longer disclosed as part of the UK Group plan assets.
The other movements in both the change in value of plan assets and liabilities in 2008 represent the separation out of these defined contribution assets.

The trustees of the plan are required to act in the best interest of the plans beneficiaries.
The plan trustees and the company are currently finalising the latest triennial valuation for funding purposes as at 1 January 2009.
At this point, the Group has contributed an additional 20m to the plan in 2009.
In total the Group contributed 42m 2008: 21m towards the funding shortfall and expects to contribute a similar amount in 2010.
Regular contributions to the plan are estimated to be 23m for 2010.
The Group expects to contribute $83m in 2010 and $126m in 2011 to its US pension plans.
Retirement benefit and other post-retirement obligations continued Sensitivities The net retirement benefit obligations are calculated using a number of assumptions, the most significant being the discount rate used to calculate the defined benefit obligation.
The effect of a one percentage point increase and decrease in the discount rate on the defined benefit obligation and the total pension expense is as follows: 2009 All figures in millions 1% increase 1% decrease Effect on: Decrease increase in defined benefit obligation UK Group plan 260.2 325.4 Decrease increase of aggregate of service cost and interest cost UK Group plan 4.5 3.9 Decrease increase in defined benefit obligation US plan 12.4 14.7 The effect of members living one year more or one year less on the defined benefit obligation and the total pension expense is as follows: 2009 1 year 1 year All figures in millions increase decrease Effect on: Increase decrease in defined benefit obligation UK Group plan 50.7 49.3 Increase decrease in defined benefit obligation US plan 1.3 1.7 The effect of a one percentage point increase and decrease in the assumed medical cost trend rates is as follows: 2009 All figures in millions 1% increase 1% decrease Effect on: Increase decrease in post-retirement medical benefit obligation 3.1 2.7 Increase decrease of aggregate of service cost and interest cost 0.2 0.2
