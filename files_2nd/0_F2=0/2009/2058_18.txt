Directors Report Directors Report Financial Shareholder Business Review Corporate Governance Statements Information Ct 75 Notes to the accounts 1 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS The impact of new accounting standards, amendments and interpretations on BG Groups Financial Statements for 2009 is set out below.
IAS 1 revised Presentation of Financial Statements The International Accounting Standards Board IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 in September 2007 which were applicable for the year ended 31 December 2009.
The main changes from the previous version of IAS 1 are in relation to the reporting of owner changes in equity and comprehensive income.
In accordance with this standard, the Group has continued to report a separate Consolidated Income Statement and has reported a separate Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in place of a Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
In addition, the Group has presented a Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity as part of its primary Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009.
Amendments to IFRS 7 Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments In March 2009 the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 7 which were applicable for the year ended 31 December 2009.
These amendments introduce a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurement disclosures and require entities to provide additional disclosures about the relative reliability of fair value measurements.
In addition, the amendments clarify and enhance existing requirements for the disclosure of liquidity risk.
The additional information required by these amendments can be found in note 18, page 95.
Improvements to IFRSs The IASB issued amendments to a number of IFRSs in May 2008 as part of its annual improvement project.
The amendments included a change to IAS 1 regarding the current non-current classification of derivative financial instruments.
This amendment clarifies that a derivative that is neither held for trading purposes nor a designated hedging instrument should be presented as current or non-current on the basis of its settlement date.
This amendment along with the majority of those resulting from the annual improvement project was applicable for the year ended 31 December 2009.
None of the amendments resulted in a material change to the Groups Financial Statements.
IAS 23 revised Borrowing Costs The IASB issued amendments to IAS 23 in March 2007.
The main change from the previous version of IAS 23 is the removal of the option of immediately recognising as an expense borrowing costs that relate to assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale.
The amendments were applicable for the year ended 31 December 2009 but did not result in any changes to the Groups Financial Statements.
Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment: Vesting Conditions and Cancellations The IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 2 in January 2008.
The amendment clarified the definition of vesting conditions and the accounting treatment of cancellations, including cancellations by parties other than the Company.
The amendment was applicable for the year ended 31 December 2009 but did not result in any changes to the Groups Financial Statements.
Amendments to IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement In March 2009 the IASB issued amendments to IFRIC 9 and IAS 39.
The amendments clarified the accounting treatment of embedded derivatives in relation to financial instruments that have been reclassified out of the at fair value through profit or loss category.
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation The International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC issued IFRIC 16 in July 2008 which was applicable for the year ended 31 December 2009.
The interpretation clarifies the nature and amount of foreign exchange risk that qualifies as a hedged item under a net investment hedge and where, in a group, hedging instruments can be held.
The IFRIC did not result in any changes to the Groups Financial Statements.
IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers The IFRIC issued IFRIC 18 in January 2009, which was applicable on a prospective basis from 1 July 2009.
The interpretation clarifies the requirements for agreements in which an entity receives, from a customer, an item of property, plant and equipment that the entity must then use to connect the customer to a distribution network or provide an ongoing supply of goods or services.
The interpretation also extends to agreements in which an entity receives cash from a customer for the purpose of constructing or acquiring property, plant and equipment for the same purpose.
The IFRIC did not result in any material change to the Groups Financial Statements.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations were also applicable for the year ended 31 December 2009 and were either not relevant to BG Group or had no impact on the Groups Financial Statements: Amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1 Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation: Amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 27 Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate: IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes: and IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate.
BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2009 76 Financial Statements Notes to the accounts continued 1 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS continued The following standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued by the IASB and IFRIC up to the date of this report, but have not been adopted by the Group in these Financial Statements and in some cases have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements provides guidance on the accounting by operators for public-to-private service concession arrangements and will be applied by BG Group for the first time for the year ending 31 December 2010.
IFRIC 12 requires infrastructure considered to be under the control of a regulator rather than an operator to be recognised as an intangible concession asset and amortised over the concession period.
Prior to the adoption of IFRIC 12 such infrastructure was recognised as property, plant and equipment of the operator and depreciated over its useful economic life.
The interpretation also requires additions to the infrastructure incurred by the operator to be accounted for as a construction contract with the regulator, with revenues and associated costs recognised in the income statement on a percentage of completion basis.
The Group has reviewed its concession arrangements in advance of the application date of IFRIC 12 and has concluded that the Comgs concession in Brazil falls within the scope of the interpretation.
Accordingly, on 1 January 2010 infrastructure which forms part of the transmission and distribution network operated by Comgs of approximately 1 billion will be recognised as intangible assets resulting in a corresponding decrease to property, plant and equipment.
BG Group will also restate comparative information in the Groups Financial Statements for the year ending 31 December 2010 to reflect the accounting requirements of IFRIC 12.
The adoption of IFRIC 12 is not expected to have a material impact on the net assets or earnings of the Group.
IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations The IASB issued IFRS 3 revised in January 2008.
The revised standard has introduced changes to the accounting for contingent consideration and transaction costs, as well as allowing an option to calculate goodwill based on the parents share of net assets only or including goodwill relating to minority interests non-controlling interests.
The standard is applicable to business combinations arising in accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 and will be adopted by the Group for the year ending 31 December 2010.
IAS 27 revised Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements The IASB issued IAS 27 revised in January 2008.
The revisions require the effects of transactions with non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity when there is no change in control, and specify the accounting on loss of control.
The revisions are applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 and will be adopted by the Group for the year ending 31 December 2010.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments The IASB issued IFRS 9 in November 2009.
The standard introduces new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets and is applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
BG Group is currently reviewing the standard to determine the likely impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
IAS 24 revised Related Party Disclosures The IASB issued IAS 24 revised in November 2009.
The revisions provide a partial exemption from the disclosure requirements for government-related entities and simplify the definition of a related party.
The revisions are applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: Eligible Hedged Items The IASB issued an amendment to IAS 39 in July 2008.
The amendment clarifies how the existing principles underlying hedge accounting should be applied in the designation of a one-sided risk in a hedged item and inflation in a financial hedged item.
The amendment is applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment: Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions The IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 2 in June 2009.
The amendment clarifies the scope and accounting for group cash-settled share-based payment transactions in the separate or individual financial statements of the entity receiving goods or services when that entity has no obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction.
The amendment is applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
Improvements to IFRSs The IASB issued amendments to a number of IFRSs in April 2009 as part of its annual improvement project.
These amendments will be adopted by the Group for the year ending 31 December 2010 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
Other standards, amendments and interpretations Up to the end of 2009, IFRIC issued IFRIC 17 Distribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners, applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity, applicable for accounting periods on or after 1 July 2010, amendments to IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement, applicable for accounting periods on or after 1 January 2011 and amendments to IAS 32 Classification of Rights Issues, applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 February 2010.
These amendments and interpretations are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
com Directors Report Directors Report Financial Shareholder Business Review Corporate Governance Statements Information 77 2 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS AND RESULTS PRESENTATION BG Groups reportable segments are those used by the Groups Board and management the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined in IFRS 8 Operating Segments to run the business and are based on differences in the Groups products and services.
Segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
BG Groups four principal operating and reporting segments in 2009 comprise Exploration and Production E&P, Liquefied Natural Gas LNG, Transmission and Distribution T&D, and Power Generation Power.
E&P comprises exploration, development, production and marketing of hydrocarbons with a focus on natural gas.
LNG combines the development and use of LNG import and export facilities with the purchase, shipping and sale of LNG and regasified natural gas.
T&D develops, owns and operates major pipelines and distribution networks, and supplies natural gas through these to the end customer.
Power develops, owns and operates natural gas-fired power generation plants.
Other activities primarily comprise costs relating to business development expenditure and certain corporate activities.
In 2009, the operations were structured in four main geographical areas: Europe and Central Asia region, Africa, Middle East and Asia region, Americas and Global LNG region and Australia region.
Intra-group and inter-segment sales are settled at market prices and are generally based on the same prices as those charged to third parties arms length principle.
Group revenue, profit for the year, non-current assets, net assets, gross assets and gross liabilities, depreciation and amortisation and capital investment attributable to BG Group activities are shown on pages 77 to 80, analysed by operating segment.
Additional information on capital investment is also provided on a geographical basis.
The presentation of BG Groups results under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS separately identifies the effect of the re-measurement of certain financial instruments and profits and losses on the disposal and impairment of non-current assets and businesses.
Results excluding disposals, certain re-measurements and impairments Business Performance are used by management and are presented in order to provide readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying operating performance of the Groups ongoing business.
Further information on Business Performance is given on page 129.
The disposals, re-measurements and impairments column includes unrealised gains and losses in respect of certain long-term UK gas sales contracts classified as derivatives under IAS 39, commodity instruments that represent economic hedges but do not qualify for hedge accounting, and financial instruments used to manage foreign exchange and interest rate exposure.
The separate presentation of these items best reflects the underlying performance of the business since it distinguishes between the temporary timing differences associated with re-measurements under IAS 39 rules and actual realised gains and losses.
Under IFRS the results from jointly controlled entities joint ventures and associates are presented net of tax and finance costs on the face of the income statement.
BG Group also presents the operating profit of the Group including results of joint ventures and associates before interest and tax, as this approach provides additional information on the source of the Groups operating profits.
The following tables provide a reconciliation between the overall results and Business Performance and operating profit, including and excluding the results of joint ventures and associates.
The geographical analysis of external revenue is based on destination.

In 2009, the charge in respect of Performance Share Awards was 7m 2008 2m.
The fair value of shares awarded during the year in respect of Performance Share Awards is estimated using a Monte Carlo projection model with the following assumptions: weighted average share price of 10.19 2008 11.19, exercise price of nil 2008 nil, a risk-free rate of 1.9% 2008 3.6% and a vesting period of three years 2008 three years.
The model also contains assumptions for both the Group and each member of the industry peer group as set out on page 53 in respect of volatility, average share price growth and share price correlation.
The fair value reflects the probability of market performance conditions being achieved.
The fair value of shares awarded during the year was 4.79 per share 2008 5.67 per share.
The assumptions used in estimating the fair value of shares for the Performance Share Awards are based on US data because most of the companies selected as industry peers are US-based.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the share price over the previous three-year period.
Share price correlation was determined by calculating the historical correlation of the share price over the previous three-year period.
Average share price growth was determined from historical growth over the previous year.

A charge of 3m has been made in respect of cash-settled CSOS awards 2008 1m, the terms of which are the same as the equity-settled CSOS awards, and a charge of 7m 2008 2m credit has been made in respect of social security costs on employee share option and share plans.
The charge for cash-settled CSOS awards and social security costs on employee share option and share plans covers awards made before and after 7 November 2002.
During the vesting period, the costs of the cash-settled CSOS awards are charged to the income statement based on the fair value of the share option at the balance sheet date and the likelihood of allocations vesting under the scheme.
The fair value of the non-vested cash-settled options at the balance sheet date has been estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: share price of 11.22 2008 9.57, weighted average exercise price of 7.92 2008 7.87, dividend yield of 1.0% 2008 1.0%, volatility of 37.00% 2008 34.10%, a weighted average risk-free rate of 1.67% 2008 2.26% and a weighted average expected life of three years 2008 four years.
The average fair value of non-vested cash-settled CSOS awards at the balance sheet date was 4.25 2008 3.23.
For awards that had vested, but not exercised at the balance sheet date, the fair value was the intrinsic value of the award at the balance sheet date.

Further information on commodity instruments is given in note 18, page 95.
DISPOSAL OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS AND IMPAIRMENTS 2009 Following a significant fall in the Henry Hub gas price in 2009, BG Group reviewed the recoverable amount of its Canadian exploration and production business on a value in use basis using a pre-tax discount rate of 8%.
This resulted in an impairment charge of 131m in the E&P segment post-tax 94m.
Following lower than expected demand in the US power market in 2009, BG Group reviewed the recoverable amount of its US Power assets on a fair value less costs to sell basis.
Fair value less costs to sell is based on the best evidence available to the Group and may include appropriate valuation techniques, market data or sales of comparable assets.
The US Power assets fair value less costs to sell was based on indicative market data.
This resulted in an impairment charge of 83m in the Power segment post-tax 53m.
In 2009, other plant disposals and write-offs resulted in a pre and post-tax credit to the income statement of 1m.
2008 In March 2008, the Group committed to a plan to dispose of certain non-core businesses, within Other activities.
The disposals completed in July 2008 for a cash consideration of 19m, resulting in a pre and post-tax charge to the income statement of 16m.
In 2008, other plant disposals and write-offs resulted in a pre-tax charge to the income statement of 8m post-tax 7m.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that it might be impaired.
As at 31 December 2009, the majority of the goodwill recognised related to Comgs, which is classified within the T&D segment.
Comgs is defined as a CGU for impairment testing purposes.
No goodwill impairment has been recognised in respect of this CGU.
The recoverable amount of the Comgs CGU is determined from value in use calculations, using cash flow projections based on approved financial plans covering a five-year period.
The projected cash flows are adjusted for associated risks and are discounted using a nominal rate of 8% pre-tax.
The volume growth rate assumptions used in the plans were based on past performance and managements expectations of market development.
The annual volume growth rates in the business plan used to determine cash flows beyond the five-year period are between 4% and 5% and do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
During the year an impairment charge was booked against goodwill held in respect of the US power plants amounting to 15m.

As part of its business operations, the Group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives in order to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates.
The Group enters into interest rate derivatives to manage the composition of floating and fixed rate debt.
The Group enters into currency derivatives to hedge certain foreign currency cash flows and to adjust the currency composition of its assets and liabilities.
Certain agreements are combined foreign currency and interest swap transactions, described as cross-currency interest rate swaps.
The Groups policy is to enter into interest or exchange rate derivatives only where these are matched by an underlying asset, liability or transaction.

BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2009 96 Financial Statements Notes to the accounts continued 18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS Within the ordinary course of business the Group routinely enters into sale and purchase transactions for commodities.
The majority of these transactions take the form of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of the commodity in accordance with the Groups expected sale, purchase or usage requirements.
Such contracts are not within the scope of IAS 39.
Certain long-term gas sales contracts in the UK fall within the scope of IAS 39.
These contracts include pricing terms that are based on a variety of commodities and indices.
They are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Certain short-term market traded contracts for the purchase and subsequent resale of third-party commodities are within the scope of IAS 39 and are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The Group uses various commodity based derivative instruments to manage some of the risks arising from fluctuations in commodity prices.
Such contracts include physical and net-settled forwards, futures, swaps and options.
Where these derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges of underlying commodity price exposures, certain gains and losses attributable to these instruments are deferred in equity and subsequently recognised in the income statement when the underlying hedged transaction crystallises.
Commodity derivatives that are not part of a hedging relationship are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
These have all been included within other commodity derivatives in the following tables.
Further information on commodity price exposure is contained in the Principal risks and uncertainties section, pages 30 to 33.

The amounts in respect of other commodity derivatives represent the gross combination of notional principals relating to all purchase and sale contracts and accordingly do not show the extent to which these contracts may offset.
These notional principal amounts give an indication of the scale of derivatives held, but do not reflect the risks that the Group is exposed to from their use.
com Directors Report Directors Report Financial Shareholder Business Review Corporate Governance Statements Information 97 18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued VALUATION All financial instruments that are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value have been classified in accordance with the hierarchy described in IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
Fair value measurement hierarchy The fair value hierarchy, described below, reflects the significance of the inputs used to determine the valuation.
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived directly from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those including inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability directly or indirectly.
The fair value of the Groups interest rate and currency exchange rate derivatives and the majority of the Groups commodity derivatives are calculated from relevant market yield curves at the balance sheet date and are therefore based solely on observable price information.
These instruments are not directly quoted in active markets and are accordingly classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include significant inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Where observable market valuations of commodity contracts are unavailable, the fair value on initial recognition is the transaction price and is subsequently determined using the Groups forward planning assumptions for the price of gas, other commodities and indices.
Due to the assumptions underlying their fair value, long-term UK gas contracts are categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
One of the assumptions used for their valuation is that the gas market in the UK is liquid for two years.
As at 31 December 2009, the average two-year forward price for UK gas was 42p per therm 2008 57p per therm.
Beyond this period a seasonally adjusted UK gas price of 45p per therm 2008 45p per therm has been used, along with an electricity price of 45 per megawatt hour 2008 45 per megawatt hour.
The fair values of the long-term commodity contracts are then discounted using the market yield curve at the balance sheet date.
Using these assumptions, the change in fair value of long-term UK gas contracts credited to the income statement in the year was 53m 2008 131m.
As at 31 December 2009, the potential change in the fair value of long-term UK commodity contracts, assuming changes in the price assumptions of gas 15 pence per therm, Brent $10 per bbl and electricity 15 per megawatt hour, was 72m 2008 79m.

All of the gains or losses for the period are related to financial assets and liabilities held at 31 December 2009.
A reasonably possible change in the valuation assumptions underlying other commodity derivatives above would not significantly change their fair value measurement.

HEDGE ACCOUNTING In line with the Groups risk management policies, certain derivative and non-derivative instruments are designated as hedges of currency, interest rate and commodity price exposures in accordance with IAS 39.
Further information can be found in the Principal risks and uncertainties section, pages 30 to 33.
Fair value hedges As at 31 December 2009, the Group held a number of interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as hedges of the fair value risk associated with the Groups fixed rate debt.
The Group also held a number of commodity derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value risk associated with fixed price firm sales commitments.
The hedged items and the related derivatives have the same critical terms to ensure that they are an effective hedge under IAS 39.
The fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges outstanding as at 31 December 2009 is 3m 2008 36 m. During 2009, adjustments of 42 m 2008 50m have been made to hedged items in respect of the risks being hedged.
Cash flow hedges The Group has forward commodity contracts, currency exchange rate derivatives and interest rate derivatives designated as hedges of highly probable forecast purchases and sales, and of interest flows on floating rate debt.
As at 31 December 2009, an unrealised pre-tax gain of 69m 2008 750m was deferred in equity in respect of effective cash flow hedges.
The hedged transactions are expected to occur within 28 years 2008 three years following the year end and the associated gains and losses deferred in equity will be released to the income statement as the underlying transaction crystallises.
As at 31 December 2009, deferred pre-tax gains of 176m 2008 397m are expected to be released to the income statement within one year.
The fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges outstanding as at 31 December 2009 is 221 m 2008 745m : these amounts exclude dedesignated cash flow hedges.
During 2009, certain forecast commodity sales for which cash flow hedge accounting was used were no longer expected to occur.
This resulted in the transfer of an unrealised pre-tax gain of 43m from equity to the income statement.
The related cash flow hedges were discontinued prospectively.
Page 70 identifies the amounts that have been transferred from equity in respect of transactions completed during the year.
These items are reported within the income statement or non-current assets to match against the underlying transaction.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations As at 31 December 2009, certain borrowings and currency derivatives have been designated as hedges of the currency risk associated with net investments in foreign operations.
The portion of gains or losses on the hedging instruments determined to be an effective hedge are transferred to equity to offset the gains and losses arising on the retranslation of net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
The pre-tax loss on effective hedging instruments deferred within equity as at 31 December 2009 is 74m 2008 92m.
The fair value of financial instruments designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations outstanding as at 31 December 2009 is 452m 2008 37 m. www.

The fair values of the fixed rate borrowings and joint venture and associate loans have been estimated based on quoted market prices where available, or by discounting all future cash flows by the relevant market yield curve at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of floating rate borrowings and joint venture and associate loans approximate book value as interest rates on these instruments reset on a frequent basis.
Fair values have not been obtained for the non-interest bearing loans to joint ventures and associates as repayment of these loans is linked to the performance of the individual joint venture or associate and other considerations and it is therefore not practicable to assign fair values.
THE COMPANY The Companys financial instruments are all denominated in Pounds Sterling and consist of short-term receivables of 2 856m 2008 1 204m, short-term creditors of 62m 2008 68m and cash and cash equivalents of 1m 2008 1m.
Short-term receivables comprise amounts owed by Group undertakings, of which 2 852m 2008 1 196m earns interest at LIBOR minus an agreed margin.
The remaining short-term receivables of 4m 2008 8m are non-interest bearing.
Short-term creditors are contractually payable within one year and are non-interest bearing.

BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2009 100 Financial Statements Notes to the accounts continued 18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS The principal financial risks arising from financial instruments are commodity price risk, exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and credit and liquidity risk.
A description of these principal risks is outlined in the Principal risks and uncertainties section, pages 30 to 33.
Additional quantitative information and market sensitivities in relation to certain principal market risks are included in the section below.
Liquidity risk The Group limits the amount of borrowings maturing within any specific period and the Groups financial assets are primarily held as short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash.
These measures keep liquidity risk low.
The Group proposes to meet its financial commitments from both the operating cash flows of the business and from use of the money and capital markets, including existing committed lines of credit.
The undiscounted contractual cash flows receivable payable under financial instruments as at the balance sheet date are as follows: THE GROUP Within Between one Between two After as at 31 December 2009 one year and two years and five years five years Total m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 821 263 1 590 2 529 5 203 Short-term creditors 705 705 Other financial liabilities 32 32 1 526 263 1 590 2 561 5 940 Outflows from derivative financial instruments Currency exchange and cross-currency interest rate derivatives 3 829 1 619 1 536 550 7 534 Gross settled commodity derivatives 1 264 320 88 1 672 Net settled commodity derivatives 318 123 91 532 5 411 2 062 1 715 550 9 738 Non-derivative financial assets and inflows from derivative financial instruments 8 677 2 906 2 771 2 068 16 422 Total as at 31 December 2009 1 740 581 534 1 043 744 Within Between one Between two After as at 31 December 2008 one year and two years and five years five years Total m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 433 283 780 1 993 3 489 Short-term creditors 822 822 Other financial liabilities 29 29 1 255 283 780 2 022 4 340 Outflows from derivative financial instruments Currency exchange and cross-currency interest rate derivatives 3 829 1 918 1 548 817 8 112 Gross settled commodity derivatives 1 502 741 253 2 496 Net settled commodity derivatives 167 87 25 279 5 498 2 746 1 826 817 10 887 Non-derivative financial assets and inflows from derivative financial instruments 9 586 4 039 2 802 1 772 18 199 Total as at 31 December 2008 2 833 1 010 196 1 067 2 972 www.
com Directors Report Directors Report Financial Shareholder Business Review Corporate Governance Statements Information 101 18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS CONTINUED Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to wholesale customers including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of A are normally accepted.
Limits are established for banks and financial institutions and Group management monitors exposures periodically.
If wholesale customers are independently rated, these ratings are used.
Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, business credit policies dictate the credit quality assessment which takes account of financial position and other factors.
Limits are established for wholesale trading businesses and business and Group management monitors overall exposures periodically.
As at 31 December 2009, the Groups maximum credit risk exposure after the impact of any netting arrangements under interest rate related derivatives was 71m 2008 19m, currency derivatives 160m 2008 271m and commodity related derivatives 396m 2008 937m.
The Groups credit risk exposure under short-term receivables and other financial assets is represented by the book values.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposures spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Sensitivity analysis Financial instruments used by the Group that are affected by market risks primarily comprise cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and derivative contracts.
The principal market variables that affect the value of these financial instruments are UK and US interest rates, US Dollars to Pounds Sterling exchange rates, UK and US gas prices, and Japan Crude Cocktail JCC and Brent oil prices.
The table below illustrates the indicative post-tax effects on the income statement and equity of applying reasonably foreseeable market movements to the Groups financial instruments at the balance sheet date.

E LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Criminal charges have been brought in Italy against certain former employees and consultants of BG Group in connection with allegations of improper conduct associated with the authorisation process for the planned Brindisi LNG S. p. A. Brindisi LNG regasification terminal.
BG Italia S. p. A. BG Italia, a wholly owned subsidiary of BG Group, has also been charged in relation to some of these allegations under Italian Legislative Decree No.
231 2001, an Italian anti-corruption statute which imposes liability on corporate entities under certain circumstances in the event certain criminal acts are committed by management or employees of the company.
Charges have also been brought against certain former directors of Brindisi LNG, a wholly owned subsidiary of BG Italia, who are alleged to have unlawfully permitted the occupation and alteration of public land, namely the port area in Brindisi where the regasification terminal is due to be constructed, as a result of improperly authorised permits.
The charges in relation to this offence against some of these former directors were extinguished via an Oblazione granted by the court.
The decision to grant the Oblazione has been challenged by the Public Prosecutor.
The trial in relation to the criminal charges commenced on 4 February 2009.
In addition, the Italian authorities may still be carrying out further investigations, the scope of which is unknown.
The Municipality of Brindisi, Province of Brindisi and Region of Puglia and three groups of environmentalists Italia Nostra, Legambiente and World Wildlife Fund WWF Italia have separately commenced civil claims seeking damages against the accused individuals and against BG Italia.
These claims have been brought within the framework of the criminal case.
In October 2007, BG Group received formal notification from the Ministry of Economic Development that the original Article 8 authorisation for the construction and operation of Brindisi LNG had been suspended pending the submission by BG Group of a full Environmental Impact Assessment EIA and confirmation from the Italian authorities as to the validity of the Article 8 authorisation.
On 15 January 2008, BG Group commenced the EIA approval process by submitting an EIA.
The EIA was re-published on 7 August 2009 and BG Group expects to receive the EIA Decree in the first half of 2010.
Notwithstanding the EIA approval process, BG Group challenged in the administrative courts the October 2007 suspension of the Article 8 authorisation.
The Municipality of Brindisi also challenged the suspension, arguing that the authorisation should have been annulled rather than suspended.
This action, if successful, could result in the authorisation being annulled, subject to any rights of appeal.
There are various other ongoing legal proceedings relating to the Brindisi LNG regasification terminal, for example relating to consents necessary for the construction work and environmental procedures.
The impact of these legal proceedings cannot yet be quantified but could delay or deny BG Group access to the Brindisi LNG terminal site.
BG Karachaganak Ltd, as one of the Karachaganak Contracting Companies KCC, has made claims against the Republic of Kazakhstan ROK.
An arbitration process has been commenced by the KCC and Karachaganak Petroleum Operating B. V. KPO.
The arbitration relates to certain taxes, fines and penalties paid by KPO and the KCC.
There is also a dispute in relation to certain unresolved items of expenditure incurred by the KCC which has led to the ROK making certain claims against the KCC.
The KCC and the ROK are seeking a negotiated solution.
It is not practicable at this time to estimate the financial effects, indicate the uncertainties relating to the amounts or timing of any economic inflow or outflows nor the possibility of any reimbursements in relation to the legal proceedings detailed above.
In addition, various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
While the outcome of some of these matters cannot readily be foreseen, it is considered that they will be resolved without material effect on the net asset position as shown in these Financial Statements.

com Directors Report Directors Report Financial Shareholder Business Review Corporate Governance Statements Information 107 25 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The majority of the Groups UK employees participate in the BG Pension Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme is of the defined benefit type.
It is a registered pension scheme established under trust.
The Trustee is BG Group Pension Trustees Limited.
The Scheme is funded to cover future pension liabilities in respect of service up to the balance sheet date.
It is subject to an independent valuation at least every three years, on the basis of which the independent qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers contributions that, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the Schemes assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the Scheme.
Participating employers contributions are certified by the Schemes independent qualified actuary.
For the year ended 31 December 2009, the employers contribution rate in respect of most Scheme members was effectively 26.9% of pensionable pay up to 31 July 2009 including Scheme expenses and 35.2% of pensionable pay thereafter excluding Scheme expenses which are now met directly by the Company.
In addition, 3% of pensionable pay was contributed by most members either directly or by their employer via a salary sacrifice arrangement.
A full independent actuarial valuation of the Scheme for funding purposes was completed as at 31 March 2008.
This showed that the aggregate market value of the Schemes assets at 31 March 2008 was 577m, representing some 83% of the accrued liabilities.
The Group made one payment of 27m in 2009 and intends to make five further payments of 27m in the years to 2014 in order to reduce the Schemes deficit.
Aggregate Company contributions for the year ending 31 December 2010 are expected to be 71m.
The BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme is available to provide benefits in excess of the lifetime allowance.
This scheme is an unfunded, unregistered arrangement.
With effect from 2 April 2007, new UK employees have been offered membership of a defined contribution stakeholder pension plan, the BG Group Retirement Benefits Plan the Plan.
Life assurance and income protection benefits are also provided under separate plans: these benefits are fully insured.
Members may choose the rate at which they contribute to the Plan, either directly or via salary sacrifice, and the additional employers contribution is determined by the rate that the member selects.
A wide range of funds is available from which members may choose how the contributions will be invested.
The cost of the Plan has been included in the amounts recognised in the consolidated income statement in the table below.
There is an unfunded post-retirement employee benefit plan for healthcare in respect of employees of Comgs.
Provision has been made in respect of this plan.
The Group also has a number of defined contribution schemes and smaller defined benefit schemes.
These are not material in Group terms.
The following information in respect of the Scheme, the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme and the Comgs post-retirement healthcare plan described hereafter as the plans has been provided in accordance with IAS 19.
Valuations of all of the plans assets and expected liabilities as at 31 December 2009 were carried out by independent actuaries in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19.
In calculating the charge to the income statement including any recognised actuarial gains and losses, a 10% corridor was applied.
This means that a portion of actuarial gains and losses is recognised as income or expense only if it exceeds the greater of: a 10% of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at that date before deducting plan assets : and b 10% of the fair value of any plan assets at that date.
These limits are calculated and applied separately for each defined benefit plan at each balance sheet date and the portion of actuarial gains and losses to be recognised in future years for each plan is the excess of actuarial gains and losses over and above the 10% limits divided by the expected average remaining working lives of the employees participating in that plan.
The valuations as at 31 December were based on the following assumptions: 2009 2008 Comgs Comgs healthcare healthcare BG plans plan BG plans plan % % % % a Rate of price inflation and benefit increases 3.9 4.5 3.3 5.0 Future increases in earnings 5.9 n a 5.3 n a Discount rate 5.7 11.2 6.3 13.1 Healthcare cost trend rate n a 10.0 n a 8.1 a Rate of increase of deferred pensions and pensions in payment in excess of any Guaranteed Minimum Pension element.
If the discount rate used for the valuation of the BG plans was reduced by 0.1% to 5.6%, the defined benefit obligation would increase by 21m and the service cost for 2010 would increase by 2m.
BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2009 108 Financial Statements Notes to the accounts continued 25 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued In determining the defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2009 for the BG Group plans, mortality assumptions are based on the 00 mortality series issued by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, appropriate to the members year of birth, with an allowance for projected longevity improvements in line with the CMI Bureaus medium cohort tables, subject to a minimum rate of improvement on the projected mortality rates of 1% per annum.
Based on these assumptions, the life expectancies of pensioners on the measurement date and also of pensioners in ten years time are as follows: Life expectancy of pensioners years 31 Dec 2009 31 Dec 2019 Male age 60 27.5 28.6 Male age 65 22.6 23.6 Female age 60 30.1 31.0 Female age 65 25.0 26.0 If the life expectancy of a member currently age 60 was increased by one year, with consistent changes for members at other ages, the defined benefit obligation in respect of the BG Group plans would increase by 21m and the service cost for 2010 would increase by 1m.
As at 31 December 2009, the value of the plans assets and expected rates of return, together with the liabilities in the plans, were as follows: 2009 2008 Expected Expected rate of Percentage of rate of Percentage of return a plans assets Value return a plans assets Value % % m % % m Equities 8.1 74 493 8.2 58 295 Absolute return strategies 8.1 10 66 8.2 15 73 Index-linked gilts 4.6 5 33 4.3 5 24 Corporate bonds 5.7 10 69 6.3 9 48 Money market funds and cash 4.6 1 4 4.1 13 66 Total market value of assets 665 506 Present value of liabilities 1 031 734 Deficit in plans 366 228 Unrecognised net loss 194 50 Net benefit liability 172 178 a Long-term expected rate of return.

A real return relative to price inflation of 4.0% a premium of 3.3% over the yield on index-linked gilts is expected on equities and absolute return strategies.
The overall expected rate of return as at 31 December 2009 was 7.7%.
The actual return on the plans assets was 104m 2008 122 m.
