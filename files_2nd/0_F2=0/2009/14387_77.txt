7 Post-retirement benefits The Company operates three defined benefit plans in the UK.
The largest of them is a funded scheme with assets held in a separate trusteeadministered fund.
The Company is the sole employer in that scheme and, accordingly, accounts for it as a defined benefit pension plan, in accordance with FRS 17.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the funded scheme was performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 31 March 2006.
This has been rolled forward to 31 July 2009.
Contributions to the funded scheme are made on the advice of the actuaries with the objective that the benefits be fully funded during the scheme members average working lives.
The principal assumptions used in updating the valuations are set out below: 31 July 2009 31 July 2008 Rate of increase in salaries 3.8% 4.1% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.3% 3.5% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.3% 3.6% Discount rate 5.9% 6.6% Inflation rate 3.3% 3.6% Healthcare cost increases 5.0% 5.0% The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
The mortality assumptions used in the principal UK schemes are based on the recent actual mortality experience of members within each scheme.
The assumptions are based on the new SAPS All Birth tables with relevant scaling factors based on the experience of the schemes.
The assumption also allows for future improvements in life expectancy in line with 80% 60% of the long cohort for males females respectively and an annual 1% underpin.
The assumptions are that a member who retires next year at age 65 will live on average for a further 22 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 24 years after retirement if they are female.
For a member who is currently 45, when they retire in 20 years time they are assumed to live on average for a further 24 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 25 years after retirement if they are female.
