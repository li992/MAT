NOTES CONTINUED financial benets with reference, as appropriate, to contractual terms, assessed life of customer relationships or trademarks.
Research and Development Expenditure All on-going research expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred.
Where a product is technically feasible, production and sales are intended, a market exists, and sufficient resources are available to complete the project, development costs are capitalised and subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the product concerned from commercial launch.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Where these conditions are not met development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The estimated useful lives for development expenditure are estimated to be in a range of between 6 and 18 months.
Capitalised development expenditure is not treated as a realised loss for the purpose of determining the Companys distributable profits as the costs meet the conditions required to be treated as an asset in accordance with IAS 38.
The amortisation of capitalised development expenditure is charged to the Income Statement in research and development expenditure within Administrative expenses category.
Impairment Charges The Company considers at each reporting date whether there is any indication that non-current assets are impaired.
If there is such an indication, the Company carries out an impairment test by measuring an assets recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use effectively the expected cash to be generated from using the asset in the business.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount an impairment loss is recognised, and the asset is written down to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying value does not exceed the amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Exceptional Items Items which are significant by virtue of their size or nature and which are considered non-recurring are classied as exceptional operating items.
Such items, which include for instance the costs of opening or closing premises, costs of significant restructurings and profits and losses made on the disposal of properties are included within the appropriate consolidated income statement category but are highlighted separately in the notes to the financial statements.
Exceptional operating items are excluded from the profit measures used by the Board to monitor underlying performance.
Revenue Recognition Revenue comprises the value of sales of goods and services to third party customers occurring in the period, stated exclusive of value added tax and net of trade discounts and rebates.
Revenue on the sale of goods is recognised when substantially all of the risks and rewards in the product have passed to the customer, and substantially all of the Groups work is completed which is usually upon delivery to the customer, or his agent.
Revenue in respect of services rendered, including engineering consultancy and support and software services, is recognised over the period over which they are performed, in relation to the level of work undertaken, project milestones achieved and any future obligations remaining.
The Company does not enter into contracts that cover both the provision of hardware and services in combination.
Government Grants Grants in respect of specic research and development projects are credited to research and development costs within the income statement or against the capitalised development expenditure as appropriate to match to the projects related expenditure.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management system are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash ows.
Allowance for Doubtful Debts Trade receivables are assessed individually for impairment, or collectively where the receivables are not individually significant.
Where necessary, provisions for doubtful debts are recorded in the income statement.
PACE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 42 NOTES CONTINUED Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on a first-in-first-out basis and includes appropriate transport and handling costs but excludes royalties due only on ultimate sale.
Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventory.
Property, Plant and Equipment The cost of items of property, plant and equipment is its purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the asset concerned, the cost of property, plant and equipment, less any estimated residual values, which are adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
The principal economic lives used for this purpose are: s, ONG, EASEHOLD PROPERTIES 0ERIOD OF LEASE s 0LANT AND MACHINERY NE TO TEN YEARS s 3HORT, EASEHOLD PROPERTIES 0ERIOD OF LEASE sOTOR VEHICLES &OUR YEARS Provision is made against the carrying value of items of property, plant and equipment where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Leased Assets Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classied as finance leases.
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over their expected useful lives.
The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Currency Translation Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate approximate to the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transactions.
Exchange differences from the above are taken directly to the translation reserve.
They are released to the income statement on disposal.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments, usually forward foreign exchange contracts, to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risks arising from operational, nancing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Following enhancements in the Groups hedging policy and changes in the Groups currency proles following the acquisition of Pace France in 2008, the directors have determined that the instruments qualify for cash ow hedge accounting.
Derivative financial instruments are classied as cash-ow hedges when they hedge the Groups exposure to variability in cash ows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Derivatives are reviewed quarterly for effectiveness.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash ows of a recognised asset or liability, or highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the movement in fair value of the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity.
The gain or loss on any ineffective part of the hedge is immediately recognised in the income statement within finance income costs.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or liability, the associated cumulative gains or losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassied into the income statement when the transaction occurs.
Taxes Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing where relevant for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability settled.
43 PACE PLC ANNUAL REPORT NOTES CONTINUED A net deferred tax asset is recognised only when it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available in the foreseeable future from which the reversal of the temporary differences can be deducted.
Share-based Payments The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured by the Company and the Group at fair value at the date of grant.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The value of the charge is adjusted in the income statement of the Company and the Group over the remainder of the vesting period to reect expected and actual levels of option vesting, with the corresponding adjustment made in equity.
The Company has applied the exemption available under IFRS 2, to apply its provisions only to those options granted after 7 November 2002 and which were outstanding at 1 January 2005.
Employee Share Ownership Plans The material assets, liabilities, income and costs of the Pace plc Employee Benets Trust are treated as being those of the Company.
Until such time as the Companys own shares vest unconditionally with employees, the consideration paid for the shares is deducted in arriving at equity.
Employee Benets Obligations for contributions to dened contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
The Group has no dened benefit arrangements in place.
Available for Sale Financial Assets Available for sale financial assets are stated at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Finance Income Finance income relates to interest income, which is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Equity Instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Dividends Payable Distributions to equity holders are disclosed as a component of the movement in shareholders equity.
A liability is recorded for a final dividend when the dividend is declared by the Companys shareholders, and, for an interim dividend, when the dividend is paid.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outow of economic benets will be required to settle the obligation.
a Royalties A provision for royalties is recognised where the owners of patents covering technology allegedly used by the Group have indicated claims for royalties relating to the Groups use including past usage of that technology.
The provision is based on the latest information available.
b Warranties A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
The level of warranty provision required is reviewed on a product by product basis and provisions adjusted accordingly in the light of actual performance.
c Restructuring A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
d Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benets to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
PACE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 44 NOTES CONTINUED Change in accounting policy Determination and presentation of operating segments As of 1 January 2009 the Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided to the Board of Directors, which is the Groups chief operating decision maker CODM.
This change in accounting policy is due to the adoption of IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
Previously operating segments were determined and presented in accordance with IAS 14 Segment Reporting.
The new accounting policy in respect of operating segment disclosures is presented as follows.
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Groups other components.
An operating segments operating results are reviewed regularly by the CODM to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
Since the change in accounting policy only impacts presentation and disclosure aspects, there is no impact on earnings per share.
Under both IFRS 8 Operating Segments and IAS 14 Segment Reporting the group has determined that it only has one reportable segment.
IFRS 8 has been applied to aggregate operating segments on the grounds of similar economic characteristics.
This position will be monitored as the Group develops.
Presentation of financial statements The Group applies revised IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements 2007, which became effective as of 1 January 2009.
As a result, the Group presents in the consolidated statement of changes in equity all owner changes in equity, whereas all non-owner changes in equity are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
This presentation has been applied in these financial statements as of and for the year ended on 31 December 2009.
Comparative information has been re-presented so that it also is in conformity with the revised standard.
Since the change in accounting policy only impacts presentation aspect, there is no impact on earnings per share.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2009, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
None of these will have an effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except for Eligible Hedged Items - Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, which claries the existing principles that determine whether specic risks or portions of cash ows are eligible for designation in a hedging relationship.
The amendment, which becomes mandatory for the Groups 2010 consolidated financial statements, is not expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
3 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS The Groups principal activities are the development, design and distribution of digital receivers and receiver decoders, for the reception of digital television and the reception transmission of interactive services, telephony and high speed data set-top boxes.
The Group also provides engineering design, software applications and support services to Multiple Service Operators, broadcasters, telecommunications companies and retail markets worldwide.
Each of these services may be delivered over satellite, cable, terrestrial and IP network transmission systems.
The Group operates through a number of operating segments, being groupings of Customer Account Teams underpinned by the conditional access technology used in the set-top box.
With the exception of the Networks Customer Account Team, which is newly established and not currently material to the Group, each Customer Account Team is involved in the design and distribution of settop boxes to major PayTV Operators and retailers.
Consideration of IFRS 8 Operating Segments Following the introduction of the above accounting standard, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, the Group has made the following considerations to arrive at the disclosure made in these financial statements.
IFRS 8 requires consideration of the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM within the Group.
In line with Groups internal reporting framework and management structure, the key strategic and operating decisions are made by the Board of Directors, who review internal monthly management reports, budget and forecast information as part of this.
Accordingly the Board of Directors are deemed to be the CODM.
Operating segments have then been identied based on the internal reporting information, and management structures within the Group.
From such information Customer Account Teams are determined to represent operating segments, given the existence of segment managers, as dened by IFRS 8, within the structures.
Following the identication of operating segments, the Group has then assessed the similarity of the economic characteristics of the various operating segments.
Given the similarity of the products and services and markets operated in within each Customer Account Team excluding the Networks Customer Account Team referred to below it has been concluded that each operating segment has fundamentally the same economic characteristics.
Given this, the Group has considered the overriding core principles of IFRS 8 and has determined that it is appropriate to aggregate the operating segments into one reportable segment for the purposes of disclosure in the financial statements.
45 PACE PLC ANNUAL REPORT NOTES CONTINUED In the consideration of economic characteristics of the Customer Account Teams the newly formed Networks Customer Account Team does represent a different product and markets from the other Customer Account Teams.
At the current time, such Customer Account Team is not material to the Group, thereby not requiring separate disclosure under IFRS 8, but given the anticipated growth in this business, it is expected that this will represent a separate reportable segment in the future.
Reconciliations of reportable segment revenues, profit or loss, assets and liabilities and other material items Information regarding the results of the reportable segment is included below.
Performance is measured based on segment profit before income tax, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Board of Directors.
Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.
There are no material inter-segment transactions however when they do occur, pricing between segments is determined on an arms length basis.
Revenues disclosed below materially represent revenues to external customers.

This will be payable on 2 July 2010 to shareholders on the register at 4 June 2010, subject to approval by shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
The goodwill at 31 December 2009 related to know-how acquired with the purchase of Xcom Multimedia Communications SA in February 2001 and the expected synergies, future revenue streams and know-how acquired with the purchase of Pace France in April 2008.
These assets are used as an integral part of the development of products which, to date, have been sold mainly by the Nagra, Telcoms and Retail Customer Account Teams.
Accordingly, for the impairment testing purposes the goodwill has been allocated to a single cash generating unit which comprises these three Customer Account Teams which approximate the legal entity structure.
The recoverable amount of the above unit including the goodwill is based upon a value in use calculation and is higher than the carrying value of the assets and goodwill allocated to this unit.
The calculations use cash-ow projections based on actual operating results, budgets and 3 year forecasts, reecting known purchase orders, sales contracts and the net result from planned product launches.
Therefore the key assumptions are a growth rate of 1% 2008: 1% on sales and 2% 2008: 2% on overheads which has been used to extrapolate results.
A discount rate of 12% 2008: 12% has been used.

b Currency exposures The table below shows the Groups currency exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group which are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
The Group endeavours to obtain as much of its income as possible in US Dollars but a significant proportion of income is currently received in Sterling or Euros.
The Groups policy is to hedge forward progressively against movements in the value of foreign currencies, in respect of cash receipts and payments expected from transactions over the next 12 months.

d Credit risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
Credit risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one customer depending upon their credit rating.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
There were no significant impairments in the periods under review.
Credit risk Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: Carrying amount 31 Dec 2009 31 Dec 2008 000 000 Trade receivables 205,204 229,511 Cash and cash equivalents 73,509 37,717 Forward exchange contracts used for hedging Assets 172 - 278,885 267,228 The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: Carrying amount 31 Dec 2009 31 Dec 2008 000 000 Domestic 14,126 17,848 Euro-zone countries 79,689 98,464 United States 111,374 112,879 Other regions 15 320 205,204 229,511 The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because counterparties are banks with high credit ratings.
At each balance sheet date there was no significant concentration of credit risk, other than those customers with revenues in excess of 10% of the Groups total revenues, as explained in note 3 of the financial statements.
Of the trade receivables at 31 December 2009 95% was within payment terms 2008: 93%.
The balance was less than 30 days past due 2008: 100%.
There were no material bad debt provisions deemed necessary against such balances, in the current or preceding years.
59 PACE PLC ANNUAL REPORT CONSOLID NOTES ATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY A CONTINUED T 31 DECEMBER 2008 e Liquidity risk Cash resources are largely and normally generated through operations.
Short term exibility is achieved by the banking facilities in place note 17.
Liquidity risk The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments and excluding the impact of netting arrangements.
Carrying Contractual 6 months 6-12 1-2 Amount cash ows or less months years 000 000 000 000 At 31 December 2009: Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables within one year 258,851 258,851 258,851 - - Other payables due after one year 2,232 2,232 - - 2,232 Derivative financial liabilities Forward exchange contracts used for hedging Outow 3,733 252,943 121,042 96,926 34,975 Inow - 249,210 115,128 98,116 35,966 Total 264,816 264,816 264,765 1,190 1,241 At 31 December 2008: Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables within one year 273,739 273,739 273,739 - - Derivative financial liabilities Forward exchange contracts used for hedging Outow 4,979 133,877 63,575 70,302 - Inow - 128,898 66,528 62,370 - Total 278,718 278,718 270,786 7,932 - It is not expected that the cash ows included in the maturity analysis could occur signicantly earlier, or at signicantly different amounts.
The directors have considered the periods in which the cash ows associated with the derivatives that are cash ow hedges are expected to occur, together with the timing of impact on profit or loss, and have determined that the timings are as disclosed in the above table.
f Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short term uctuations on the Groups earnings.
Over the long term, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
The Directors consider that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates at any period end would not have a material impact on cash ows.
The Groups key foreign exchange exposures are in respect of the Euro and US Dollar.
A 5% strengthening in sterling against the Euro and Dollar would have an adverse impact of 3.5m on the profit pre hedging reported in the year ended 31 December 2009 and an adverse impact of 7.5m on equity.
A 5% weakening in sterling against the Euro and Dollar would have a favourable impact pre hedging of 5.0m on profit reported in the year ended 31 December 2009 and a favourable impact of 8.5m on equity.
g Capital management In line with the disclosure requirements of IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, the Company regards its capital as being the issued share capital together with its banking facilities, used to manage short term working capital requirements.
Note 20 to the Financial Statements provides details regarding the Companys share capital and movements in the period.
There were no breaches of any requirements with regard to any relevant conditions imposed by either the UKLA or the Companys Articles of Association during the periods under review.
PACE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 60 NO COMP TES ANY BALANCE SHEET CONTINUED AT 31 DECEMBER 2008 Details of the Companys working capital facilities are given in Note 17.
Such facilities are subject to certain financial performance covenants.
There have been no breaches of these covenants in the period under review.
h Fair values Fair values versus carrying amounts The directors have considered the fair values of financial assets and liabilities and have determined that these are not materially different from the carrying amounts shown in the Group balance sheet.
Fair value hierarchy The Groups financial instruments, namely forward exchange contracts, have been determined to represent Level 1 instruments characterised by the existence of quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
i Exchange rates The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: Average rate Spot rate 2009 2008 2009 2008 Euro 1.12 1.25 1.12 1.02 US Dollar 1.57 1.84 1.61 1.45 19 PROVISIONS Royalties under negotiation Warranties Other Total 000 000 000 000 Group At 31 December 2008 8,811 21,448 5,261 35,520 Net charge for the year 2,705 15,796 - 18,501 Utilised 569 17,324 1,865 19,758 Exchange adjustments - 410 - 410 At 31 December 2009 10,947 19,510 3,396 33,853 Due within one year - 11,117 3,396 14,513 Due after one year 10,947 8,393 - 19,340 Royalties under negotiation Warranties Total 000 000 000 Company At 31 December 2008 8,811 6,934 15,745 Net charge for the year 2,705 10,980 13,685 Utilised 569 8,045 8,614 At 31 December 2009 10,947 9,869 20,816 Due within one year - 6,812 6,812 Due after one year 10,947 3,057 14,004 Royalties under negotiation The owners of patents covering technology allegedly used by the Group have indicated claims for royalties relating to the Groups use including past usage of that technology.
Negotiations over these liabilities continue for long periods of time.
The directors have made provision for the potential royalties payable based on the latest information available.
Having taken legal advice, the Board considers that there are defences available that should mitigate the amounts being sought.
The Group will vigorously negotiate or defend all claims but, in the absence of agreement, the amounts provided may prove to be different from the amounts at which the potential liabilities are nally settled.
61 PACE PLC ANNUAL REPORT CONSOLID NOTES ATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY A CONTINUED T 31 DECEMBER 2008 Given the nature of the claims it is not possible to be more specic with regard to the timing of outows.
The directors consider that to disclose the amounts unused following the negotiation of royalty claims during the year would be seriously prejudicial to other royalty claims under negotiation, in litigation or dispute.
Accordingly the directors have aggregated amounts released unused with additional provisions made in order to arrive at the net charge for the year shown above.
Other provisions Other provisions relate to onerous leases and restructuring provisions in relation to the restructuring of the Pace Europe business.
Warranties Pace provides product warranties for its set-top boxes from the point of sale and a provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty data, principally historical failure rates and related cost of repair information, and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
Although it is difficult to make accurate predictions of potential failure rates or the possibility of an epidemic failure, as a warranty estimate must be calculated at the outset of product shipment before eld deployment data is available, these estimates improve during the lifetime of the product in the eld.
It is expected that the expenditure with regard to warranties will be incurred within three years of the balance sheet date.

The amount claimed is circa $7.2m.
The Directors believe that they have good defences to the claim and that, in the absence of any liability, no provision has been made.
In addition on 15 July 2007 Pace led a counter claim for circa $10m against this former customer and a related third party.
EU Import duty classication Pace, along with other set top box manufacturers and broadcasters, has continued to monitor the re-interpretation by European Union customs authorities of customs regulations that could result in the extension of import duties to interactive set-top boxes with hard drives manufactured outside, but imported into, the EU.
On 7th May 2008 the Nomenclature Committee of the European Commission issued an Explanatory Note EN 0590 2007 to the Combined Nomenclature setting out their view that set-top boxes with a hard drive should be classied under Customs Tariff heading 8521 90 00 and so subject to a 13.9% ad valorem duty on importation to the European Union.
As a consequence, Pace is potentially exposed to a retrospective Customs Duty liability in respect of such set-top boxes it has imported.
Having previously obtained Binding Tariff Information BTI rulings from HMRC, which provide protection in respect of much of the potential period of retrospective application of duty on relevant products and having taken legal advice, Managements opinion is that the retrospective application of the Explanatory Note would not be supportable in law.
Accordingly Pace is in common with other affected importers, appealing any retrospective assessment made and will defend its position on this matter.
As of the date of this announcement, an assessment has been received from HMRC in an amount of 7.7m representing import duty relating to imports prior to 7 May 2008.
Having taken advice, managements best estimate is that no material outow of economic benefit would be required to discharge this obligation.
As such, at 31 December 2009 any potential liability should be considered contingent.
A bank guarantee is held whilst the appeal continues.
