NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 14.
GooDwiLL continued Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the cash-generating unit CGU expected to benefit from that business combination.
All of the carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the waste management segment which is considered to be a single CGU, as it is an integrated business.
Goodwill is reviewed annually or when other events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
The recoverable amount of the waste management segment is determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions in those calculations relate to discount rates, cash flows, price increases and for landfill, the compaction rate.
Cash flow projections are based on approved budgets and plans for the next five years and beyond this period on long-term growth rates for the waste sector based on UK Gross Domestic Product.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 12.5% which reflects the overall business risks associated with the waste management segment activities.
