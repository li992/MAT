These projects affect sales and marketing, manufacturing and central support functions in a number of markets and will be implemented progressively over a period of three years.
Costs in 2009 also include expenses related to the closure of our Tampa, Florida, USA cigar factory announced in June 2009.
In addition to the European Integration projects, restructuring costs in 2008 include expenses relating to the closure of our cigar factory in Selma, Alabama, USA, the integration with Commonwealth Brands of the Lignum 2 operation acquired in May 2008, and costs in relation to streamlining Logistics operations in France.
The net charge of 145 million in 2009 includes 23 million of unused restructuring provisions reversed during the period, 95 million booked as additional restructuring provisions, 15 million booked as an impairment of property, plant and equipment and 19 million booked against net retirement benefits liabilities.
The remaining charge of 39 million was booked directly to the income statement as these costs did not meet the provisioning requirements of IAS 37.
Restructuring costs are included within administrative and other expenses in the consolidated income statement.

At the year end, the shareholders had not yet approved the final dividend and therefore it is not included in the balance sheet as a liability.
The dividend per share figures included in the table above reflect the bonus element of the rights issue as described in note 20.

Diluted earnings per share have been calculated by taking into account the weighted average number of shares that would be issued if rights held under the employee share schemes were exercised.
No instruments have been excluded from the calculation on the grounds that they are anti-dilutive.

IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009 93 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Financial Statements continued Goodwill and intangible asset impairment review Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are allocated to the Groups cash-generating units CGUs.
For the Tobacco segment these are based on the geographic areas in which the Group operates.
A summary of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives is set out below.
The joint ventures that distribute Cuban cigars worldwide were previously presented within the Rest of the World, but have been reported separately in the current year as sensitivity disclosures are being provided for this CGU.
2009 2008 Intangible Intangible assets with assets with In s million Goodwill indefinite lives Goodwill indefinite lives European Union 6,742 135 5,818 115 Americas 1,783 103 1,598 88 Rest of the World 3,071 360 2,655 312 Cuban cigar joint ventures 284 246 255 211 Tobacco 11,880 844 10,326 726 Logistics 1,795 1,549 13,675 844 11,875 726 Goodwill has arisen principally on the acquisitions of Reemtsma in 2002 mainly EU and Rest of the World, Commonwealth Brands in 2007 Americas and Altadis in 2008 all CGUs.
The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that impairment may have arisen.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections derived from three year financial budgets which are based on managements experience and expectations and are approved by the Board annually.
The compound annual growth rates implicit in these value-in-use calculations are shown below.
Cash flows beyond the budget period are extrapolated using the estimated long-term growth rate of three per cent per annum.
Discount rates used are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the different risk profiles of the CGUs.
Pre-tax discount rates ranged from 8.6 per cent to 11.4 per cent.
Initial growth Long term 1 2 rate growth rate European Union 4.3% 3.0% Americas 9.1% 3.0% Rest of the World 9.0% 3.0% Cuban cigar joint ventures 5.0% 3.0% Logistics 0.8% 3.0% 1 Weighted average compound annual growth rate used for first three years in value-in-use calculations.
2 Weighted average compound annual growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the initial three years.
For the Tobacco business in the European Union, Americas and the Rest of the World, and for Logistics, any reasonable movement in the assumptions of the impairment test would not result in an impairment.
In addition to the initial growth rates shown above applied to cash flows arising in existing markets, the valuation of the Cuban cigar joint ventures includes assumptions about the timing and extent of cash flows from entry to new markets.
The impairment test for the Cuban cigar joint ventures indicated headroom of 100 million and that a reduction of 15 per cent or more in the value of overall cash flows would result in an impairment.
We do not consider that any reasonable movement in other assumptions relating to the Cuban cigar joint ventures would result in an impairment.
No impairment charges have been recognised in the year in respect of goodwill and intangible assets.
In 2008 goodwill impairment of 21 million was recognised in respect of the Sinclair Collis business included in European Union CGU, reducing the carrying value to nil.
This impairment reflected the decline in UK vending sales as a result of the introduction of restrictions on smoking in licensed premises and anticipated access restrictions.

It is generally recognised industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventory as a current asset although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the processing cycle, ordinarily would not be consumed within one year.
Leaf tobacco held within raw materials inventories at the balance sheet date will ordinarily be utilised within two years.

It does not operate as a profit centre, nor does it enter into speculative transactions.
The Group Treasury Committee GTC oversees the operation of Group Treasury in accordance with terms of reference set out by the Board.
The Board reviews and approves all major treasury decisions.
The GTC currently comprises the Finance Director, the Director of Accounting, Forecasting and Tax, Director of Investor Communications, Cigar Business Unit Finance Director, Senior Group Management Accountant Manufacturing, Group Treasurer and Deputy Group Treasurer.
The GTC agrees a framework which sets out the current expectations and boundaries to assist in the effective oversight of Group Treasury activities, covering all key areas within Group Treasury.
The Group Treasurer reports on a regular basis to the Board, including the provision of a monthly treasury report, which is also provided to the GTC.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates due to its commercial trading transactions denominated in foreign currencies, foreign currency cash deposits, borrowings and non-sterling derivatives.
The Groups policy is to manage its balance sheet translation risk by funding acquisitions and the underlying business assets with borrowings post cross currency swaps in the currency of the underlying net assets.
This results in foreign currency profits from operations being reduced by foreign currency interest costs thereby minimising the translation exposure on foreign currency profits after tax.
The Group issues debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance and uses derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps where necessary, to change the debt into the desired currency and into floating interest rates shortly after issue.
At 30 September 2009, approximately 13 per cent 2008: 13 per cent of adjusted net debt was denominated in sterling, 56 per cent in euro 2008: 62 per cent and 31 per cent in US dollars 2008: 25 per cent.
In 2009, 82 per cent of revenue 2008: 77 per cent and 80 per cent of adjusted profit from operations 2008: 74 per cent was in markets outside the UK.
Certain sales in these markets are invoiced in currencies other than the functional currency of the selling company.
The material foreign currency denominated costs include the purchase of tobacco leaf, which is sourced from various countries but purchased principally in US dollars, and packaging materials which are sourced from various countries and purchased in a number of currencies.
After taking into account other US dollar inflows the Group currently does not consider the foreign exchange risk here to be material enough to hedge.
The Groups sterling dividend to shareholders is partly sourced from foreign subsidiary earnings.
In order to provide certainty as to the amount of sterling available to pay future dividends the Group has entered into transactional cross currency swaps maturing between 2011 and 2015 that will convert forecast euro dividends from subsidiaries into sterling.
Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group Treasury monitors the Groups borrowing levels using adjusted net debt which excludes interest accruals, the fair value of derivative financial instruments providing commercial cash flow hedges and finance lease liabilities.
The Groups financial results are currently principally exposed to gains or losses arising from fluctuations in sterling, euro and US dollar interest rates.
In order to manage the interest rate risk on its borrowings, the Group separates its borrowing activities from its interest rate risk management decisions by issuing debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance and uses derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps where necessary, to change the debt into the desired currency and into floating interest rates shortly after issue.
The Group then transacts interest rate swaps at other times for different notional amounts and for different maturities to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate risk.
At 30 September 2009, 32 per cent 2008: 38 per cent of adjusted net debt was at a floating rate of interest, 67 per cent 2008: 60 per cent at a fixed rate of interest and one per cent 2008: two per cent floating within a set range.
The Group manages its interest rate exposure on a regular basis and reports the position monthly to the Board and GTC.
This report shows the profit or loss impact of a defined interest rate shift for each of the major currencies of borrowings and forecast percentage of debt fixed for at least the next 10 years, together with other relevant information.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities IAS 39 requires that all derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair value being recognised in the income statement unless the instrument satisfies the hedge accounting rules under IFRS and the Group chooses to designate the derivative financial instrument as a hedge.
The Group hedges underlying exposures in an efficient, commercial and structured manner.
However, the strict hedging requirements of IAS 39 may lead to some commercially effective hedge positions not qualifying for hedge accounting.
As a result, the Group has decided not to apply cash flow or fair value hedge accounting for its derivative financial instruments as permitted under IAS 39.
However, the Group does apply net investment hedging, designating certain borrowings and derivatives as hedges of the net investment in the Groups foreign operations, as permitted by IAS 39, in order to minimise income statement volatility.
See section vi below for details.
The information contained in sections ii and iii below shows the underlying borrowing position before the effect of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps.
98 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009 1849 Black Sun ImpTob p72 p132:Layout 1 30 11 09 21:40 Page 99 Sensitivity analysis IFRS 7 requires a sensitivity analysis that illustrates the estimated impact on the income statement and items recognised directly in equity due to hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates in relation to all of the Groups financial instruments.
The Group considers that the movements in interest rates and sterling foreign exchange rates shown in the table below represent reasonably possible changes.
The impact on income and equity of these changes are shown in the table below.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the net investment hedge designations in place at 30 September 2009.
The sensitivity analysis does not reflect any change to sales or costs that may result from changing interest or exchange rates.
All financial assets and liabilities held in the functional currency of subsidiary companies are not included in the analysis.
The analysis excludes instruments that expose the Group to interest rate and foreign exchange risk where such risk is fully hedged with another financial instrument.

The impact in the income statement from foreign exchange rate movements primarily relates to derivative financial instruments that commercially hedge net investments, but are not accounted for as hedges under IAS 39 although they are commercially effective.
This value is expected to be fully offset by the retranslation of the hedged foreign currency net assets leaving a net impact on shareholders funds of zero.
This gain or loss is excluded from our adjusted performance measures.
The equity impact shown for foreign exchange sensitivity relates to derivative and non-derivative financial instruments hedging net investments.
This value will be more than fully offset by the retranslation of the hedged foreign currency net assets.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk arising from its trade receivables due from customers, as well as from cash and cash deposits and the mark-to-market of derivative financial instruments transacted with financial institutions.
The Group has some significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
However, the Group has implemented policies to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history and obtains guarantees or other means of credit support to reduce the risk where this is considered to be necessary.
Analysis of trade and other receivables is provided in note 13.
The Group has no material concentrations of credit risk from financial institutions.
The Group has cash and has placed cash deposits and entered into derivative financial instruments with a diversified group of financial institutions with suitable credit ratings in order to manage its credit risk to any one financial institution.
The table below summarises the Groups major financial institution counterparties by credit rating and balances at 30 September 2009: 30 September 2009 30 September 2008 Maximum Maximum S&P Credit exposure to S&P Credit exposure to Counterparty Rating credit risk m Rating credit risk m Financial institution A AA 143 AA- 89 Financial institution B A 106 AA- 95 Financial institution C A 103 AA- 25 Financial institution D AA 95 AA 60 Financial institution E AA 89 AA 8 Financial institution F A 81 A 50 Financial institution G A 81 AA- 70 Management do not expect these counterparties to default on their current obligations.
On 15 September 2008 Lehman Brothers Holdings announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
The Group had various financial instruments in place with Lehman Brothers International Europe at that date.
On 2 October 2008 the Group served a default notice to terminate these financial instruments and filed a claim for settlement of the outstanding mark-to-market plus interest for 11.1 million.
The mark-to-market of these financial instruments was fully provided against at 30 September 2008.
The claim was subsequently sold on to a third party for 2.1 million in September 2009.

However, the Group actively maintains a mixture of short, medium and long-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for the forecast requirements of the Group over the short to medium-term.
At 30 September 2009 the Group had 3,109 million 2008: 2,053 million of undrawn committed facilities, maturing between July 2010 and July 2012.
As well as forecasting and monitoring the Groups core liquidity needs, the Group Treasury function is in regular dialogue with subsidiary companies to ensure their liquidity needs are met.
Subsidiary companies are funded by a combination of share capital and retained earnings, loans from central finance companies on commercial terms, or through local borrowings by the subsidiaries in appropriate currencies.
Funds over and above those required for short-term working capital purposes by subsidiary companies are remitted to Group Treasury where practical and possible and are used to pay down debt whenever possible.
The table below summarises the Groups financial liabilities and derivatives analysed by maturity date based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, which have been calculated using spot rates at the relevant balance sheet date, including interest to be paid.
The carrying value of derivative financial liabilities excludes collateral transferred in respect of certain derivatives with negative fair values for which there is no reasonable basis upon which to allocate future cash flows to maturity groupings.

The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in that there may be fluctuations in the price of tobacco leaf.
As with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf tends to be cyclical as supply and demand considerations influence tobacco plantings in those countries where tobacco is grown.
Also, different regions may experience variations in weather patterns that may affect crop quality or supply and so lead to changes in price.
The Group seeks to reduce this price risk by sourcing tobacco leaf from a number of different countries, sourcing from various counterparties and by varying the levels of tobacco leaf held.
100 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009 1849 Black Sun ImpTob p72 p132:Layout 1 30 11 09 21:40 Page 101 Capital risk management The Group manages the capital structure in an efficient manner in order to minimise the cost of capital whilst ensuring that we have access to ongoing sources of finance such as the debt capital markets.
The Group defines capital as adjusted net debt see note 27 and equity attributable to equity holders of the Company see note 22.
The only externally imposed capital requirements for the Group are interest cover and gearing covenants under the terms of the Senior Bank Facility.
The Group therefore manages the capital structure to maintain an investment grade credit rating and has and will continue to take the appropriate measures to maintain this.
For example, where new equity is needed, the Group will issue the minimum required in order to maintain an investment grade credit rating.
This is determined in connection with detailed discussions with credit rating agencies.
Fair value estimation The fair values of derivatives are determined using valuation techniques based on market data such as yield curves and foreign exchange rates to calculate the present value of the estimated future cash flows at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities maturing within one year are approximate to their carrying value.
For liabilities with a maturity of more than one year the fair value is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Certain borrowings drawn under revolving credit facilities have been classified as non-current borrowings, in accordance with the maturity date of those facilities.
The Group has not defaulted on any loans during the year 2008: no defaults.

All financial assets and liabilities are carried at amortised cost, other than derivative financial instruments that are carried at fair value.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and trade payables are approximate to their fair value and so are excluded from the analysis below.
Derivative financial instruments are excluded as they are carried at fair value.

Deferred tax assets of 20 million 2008: 14 million have not been recognised due to the potential uncertainty of the utilisation of the underlying tax losses in certain jurisdictions.
Of these unrecognised deferred tax assets, 11 million 2008: 9 million will expire within five years.
Also within other temporary differences, deferred tax assets of 77 million 2008: 54 million are recognised for tax credits carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits are probable.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 8 billion 2008: 6 billion.
A provision of 9 million 2008: nil has been made for taxation expected to arise on a planned future dividend payment of 125 million from one subsidiary.
No other liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The bond return is based on current market yields.
The corporate bond yield has been reduced to allow for an element of default risk.
The return on equities and property is based on a number of factors including the income yield at the measurement date, the long-term growth prospects for the economy in general, the long-term relationship between each asset class and bond returns, and the movement in market indices since the previous measurement date.
Excluding any self-investment through pooled fund holdings, the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund has no investments 2008: nil in Imperial Tobacco Group PLCs own financial instruments.

An actuarial valuation of the ITPF the triennial valuation for funding purposes was made at 31 March 2007 by Watson Wyatt Limited.
The assumptions which had the most significant effect when valuing the ITPFs liabilities were those relating to the rate of investment return on the ITPFs existing assets, the rates of increase in pay and pensions and estimated mortality rates.
On the basis that the ITPF is continuing, it was assumed that the future investment returns relative to market values at the valuation date would be 5.20 per cent per annum and that pay and pension increases would average 4.5 per cent and 3.0 per cent respectively.
The assets were brought into account at their market value.
At 31 March 2007 the market value of the invested assets of the ITPF was 2,951 million.
The total assets were sufficient to cover 114 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members for past service, after allowing for expected future pay increases.
The total assets were sufficient to cover 102 per cent of the total benefits that had accrued to members for past service and future service benefits for current members.
As there was no actuarial deficiency, it was agreed with the trustees that, with effect from 31 March 2007, no employer contributions are required.
The financial position of the ITPF and the level of contributions to be paid will be reviewed at the next triennial valuation, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2010 and will consider the scheme as at 31 March 2010.

They affect sales and marketing, manufacturing and central support functions in a number of markets and will be implemented progressively over a period of three years.
These liabilities are expected to crystallise over a number of years.
Redundancy and social plan costs have been discounted at 5.0 per cent.
Other provisions principally relate to commercial legal claims and disputes.
The majority of other provisions represent the fair value at acquisition of current and potential Altadis commercial disputes, litigation and duty claims arising in the normal course of business.
These liabilities are expected to crystallise within the next five years.

The options may normally be exercised during the six months after expiry of the savings contract, three years after entering the Plan.
The majority of awards under the International Sharesave Plan are equity-settled.

The UK Sharesave Plan is equity-settled.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Each year since demerger in 1996, annual conditional awards specified as a percentage of base salary have been made under the LTIP to Executive Directors and senior executives.
The conditional awards, which vest three years after grant, are subject to the satisfaction of specified performance criteria, measured over a three year performance period.
All conditional awards are at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, with no employee having the right to receive such a conditional award.
Further information relating to the performance criteria and the terms of the LTIP are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report.
In respect of the November 2005 November 2008 award, 93.9 per cent of the EPS related element, 77.6 per cent of the TSR related element linked to the FTSE 100 ranking, and nil per cent of the TSR element linked to the tobacco and alcohol companies comparator group, vested on 25 November 2008.
Overall 66.3 per cent of the award vested on that date.
In respect of the November 2006 November 2009 award, 100 per cent of the EPS related element, 100 per cent of the TSR related element linked to the FTSE 100 ranking, and 76.7 per cent of the TSR element linked to the tobacco and alcohol companies comparator group, vested on 1 November 2009.

All of the awards under the Share Matching Scheme are equity-settled.
Executive Directors and most of the Groups management may elect to invest any proportion of their gross bonus capped at 100 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive and the Finance Director and 75 per cent for the other Executive Directors in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares to be held by the Employee Benefit Trusts.
For the financial year ending 30 September 2010 the cap will be 100 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive, Finance Director and Chief Operating Officer and 85 per cent for the Group Sales and Marketing Director.
Provided the shares are left in the Trusts for three years, and the individual remains in employment within the Group, the participant will retain the original shares and receive additional shares on a 1:1 ratio.
The matching of the Executive Directors shares is subject to a performance criterion as set out in the Directors Remuneration Report.
Employee Share Ownership Trusts The Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Employee and Executive Benefit Trust and the Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2001 Employee Benefit Trust the Trusts have been established to acquire ordinary shares in the Company to satisfy rights to shares arising on the exercise of Sharesave and LTIP options and on the vesting of the Share Matching Schemes.

The acquisition of shares by the Trusts has been financed by a gift of 19.2 million and an interest free loan of 169.5 million.
None of the Trusts shares has been allocated to employees or Executive Directors as at 30 September 2009.
All finance costs and administration expenses connected with the Trusts are charged to the income statement as they accrue.

Following the rights issue described in note 20, adjustments were made to the share plans.
In respect of the Share Matching Scheme, the Trustees sold sufficient rights nil paid to enable the balance of the rights to be taken up.
In the case of the Sharesave and LTIP plans the number of shares under option, or subject to awards, was adjusted by the relevant bonus factor.
In the case of the Sharesave Scheme the option price was also adjusted by the relevant bonus factor.

Pricing For the purposes of valuing awards to calculate the share-based payment charge, the Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used for all the share option and share matching schemes and for the LTIPs except for those granted since November 2005, where the Monte Carlo model has been used.
A summary of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for 2009 and 2008 is as follows: 2009 2008 Sharesave Share match Sharesave Share match Risk-free interest rate 2.2% 3.0% 1.7% 4.1% 5.5% 4.1% Volatility 31.0% 36.0% 35.0% 24.0% 26.0% 21.0% Expected lives of options granted 3 5 yrs 6 mths 3 yrs 3 5 yrs 6 mths 3 yrs Dividend yield 3.1% 3.1% 3.3% 3.3% Fair value 4.67 4.93 16.21 3.77 5.30 19.18 Share price used to determine exercise price 15.67 16.13 17.80 21.87 22.24 21.17 Exercise price 12.54 12.91 n a 17.50 17.81 n a Volatility is determined based on the three or five year share price history the time period being determined by the length of the scheme.
Market condition features were incorporated into the Monte Carlo model for the total shareholder return elements of the LTIP, in determining fair value at grant date.

The holding was already 100 per cent consolidated as control was obtained in prior periods.
2008 On 25 January 2008 the Spanish Securities Exchange Commission, the Comision Nacional del Mercado fide Valores CNMV, announced that acceptances representing 95.81 per cent of Altadis, S. A. s share capital had been received and Imperial Tobaccos offer to purchase Altadis had become unconditional.
The Group exercised the squeeze-out provision available under Spanish law on 25 January 2008 to compulsorily purchase the remaining shares at the offer price of 50 per share.
The squeeze-out was completed on 21 February 2008.
As a consequence the acquisition was fully consolidated from 25 January 2008 when the Group obtained control of Altadis.
Through the acquisition of Altadis, the Group acquired direct control of Logista, and pursuant to its obligations under Spanish regulations, the Group made an offer for those shares in Logista not already owned by Altadis.
The offer, at a price of 52.50 per share, completed on 6 May 2008, resulting in a total shareholding in Logista of 96.92 per cent.
The remainder of the shares were subsequently acquired on 9 June 2008 by using the squeeze-out provision available under Spanish law.
In the period from 25 January 2008 to 30 September 2008, the acquired business contributed revenue of 6,916 million and loss from operations of 153 million after charging 245 million for amortisation of acquired intangibles and after one-off charges of 118 million in relation to stock revalued to fair value at acquisition and sold during the period.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2007, Group revenue would have been 23,602 million and Group profit from operations for the year would have amounted to 1,212 million, these amounts having been estimated by including Altadis results for the four months prior to acquisition adjusted to reflect the Groups accounting policies and changes in depreciation and amortisation due to fair value adjustments.
In May 2008, the Group acquired Lignum 2 Inc. a seller of quality discount cigarettes in the United States, for a total of 11 million cash.
Its net assets had nil book and fair value, giving rise to goodwill of 11 million.
During the year the Group also acquired interests in a number of small businesses.
The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions amounted to 3 million.
Full IFRS disclosures have not been provided for these small acquisitions as they are not considered to be significant to the Group as a whole.
During 2005 the Group acquired a 43 per cent interest in Skruf Snus AB.
The acquisition agreement included a commitment to acquire the remaining shares and provided the Group with immediate control of its operating and financial policies.
Accordingly the acquisition was accounted for as a 100 per cent subsidiary to reflect the substance of the transaction.
In June 2008 the Group acquired the remaining 57 per cent for a consideration of 39 million.
This amount exceeded the 10 million contingent consideration originally booked by 29 million, which has been recorded as goodwill.
No further consideration is payable to the former shareholders.
122 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009 1849 Black Sun ImpTob p72 p132:Layout 1 30 11 09 21:40 Page 123 Details of Altadis net assets and goodwill arising on the acquisition of Altadis and the subsequent purchase of the minority interest in Logista are as follows: Fair value In s million Book value adjustments Fair value Intangible assets 484 6,038 6,522 Property, plant and equipment 638 373 1,011 Investments in associates 13 13 Inventories 1,378 81 1,459 Trade and other receivables 2,020 2,020 Derivative financial instruments 28 6 22 Cash 593 593 Borrowings 1,715 40 1,675 Trade and other payables 4,493 23 4,516 Current and deferred tax 152 2,095 1,943 Retirement benefit net liabilities 148 148 Provisions 210 249 459 Investment in Aldeasa 50 152 202 Net assets 1,210 4,311 3,101 Minority interests 183 230 413 Goodwill 6,712 Consideration for the acquisition of Altadis 9,400 Minority interest in Logista at 6 May 2008 420 Additional goodwill 311 Consideration for the purchase of Logista minority 731 Total goodwill in relation to Altadis and Logista 7,023 Total consideration for Altadis and Logista 10,131 The fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of Altadis were finalised in January 2009, with adjustments made to the previously published provisional fair values as follows.
Provisions and tax liabilities were increased by 7 million and 15 million respectively and property, plant and equipment were reduced by 3 million.
Goodwill on the acquisition of Altadis consequently increased by 25 million.
The consolidated balance sheet at 30 September 2008 has been restated to reflect the finalisation of the fair value adjustments.
The fair value adjustments represent managements best estimates of the adjustments required to restate Altadis assets from book value to fair value at acquisition.
The principal fair value adjustments are in respect of intangibles, which comprise cigarette and cigar trademarks and supply contracts and have been independently valued using the income method, and property, plant and equipment for which we engaged independent valuers.
With the exception of premium cigar trademarks that the Directors have determined have an indefinite life, cigarette and mass market cigar trademarks are being amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from 20 to 30 years.
Supply contracts are being amortised over periods ranging from 3 to 15 years.
The goodwill of 7,023 million arising on the acquisition of Altadis represents a strategic premium to acquire Altadis leading positions in the world cigar market and the western European logistics market, the synergies expected to be realised following acquisition and the assembled sales, manufacturing and distribution workforces.
The Groups share of Aldeasas assets and liabilities was classified as held for sale upon acquisition and fair valued at that date at 275 million 202 million.
The investment in Aldeasa was disposed of on 14 April 2008 for cash consideration of 275 million at no profit or loss.

In the opinion of the Groups lawyers, the Group has meritorious defences to these actions, all of which are being vigorously contested.
Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation, the Directors believe that the pending actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of the operations, cash flow or financial condition of the Group.
Consequently, the Group has not provided for any amounts in respect of these cases in the consolidated financial statements.
In October 2003 the UK Office of Fair Trading OFT commenced an investigation under the Competition Act 1998 into the operation of the UK tobacco supply chain.
On 24 April 2008, the OFT issued a Statement of Objections SO which set out the OFTs allegations against the tobacco manufacturers Imperial Tobacco Group and Gallaher, and 11 retailers.
The OFT alleges that these tobacco manufacturers and retailers variously engaged in one or more unlawful practices in relation to retail prices for some or all of a number of tobacco products in breach of Chapter 1 of the Competition Act 1998.
Following the issue of the SO, the OFT invited recipients of the SO to enter into settlement discussions on a without prejudice basis to reach early resolution agreements with the OFT.
On 11 July 2008, the OFT announced that six of the parties subject to the SO had reached early resolution agreements with the OFT, agreeing to pay a combined figure of some 132.3 million if all leniency and early resolution discounts are taken into account.
Other than Imperial Tobacco Group, the parties which have also not settled with the OFT and are therefore contesting the OFTs allegations, are the Co-operative Group, Morrisons including Safeway, Shell and Tesco.
124 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009 1849 Black Sun ImpTob p72 p132:Layout 1 30 11 09 21:40 Page 125 Imperial Tobacco Groups detailed written response to the SO was submitted to the OFT on 15 August 2008 and Imperial Tobaccos representatives made submissions to the OFT in defence of the allegations at an oral hearing on 3 December 2008.
The OFT indicated in a letter dated 12 October 2009 that it currently intends to notify the parties of its final decision in the investigation in the first quarter of 2010.
We have no indication of whether that will be an infringement decision, a file closure decision or some other form of decision.
If the OFT proceeds to an infringement decision, it may impose a fine.
The maximum amount of any fine, under the statutory regime we believe that the OFT may apply, is 10 per cent of a companys UK turnover for up to three years although the actual amount may be less.
By way of example, in the three years to 30 September 2003, Imperial Tobacco Groups aggregate net UK turnover was 2,215 million.
The applicable turnover on which the amount of a fine is based expressly excludes VAT and other taxes directly related to turnover, which Imperial Tobacco Group has been advised would also exclude duty.
In addition, if the OFT were to make an infringement finding, it could issue orders prohibiting that activity in the future, whilst the infringing company might face the prospect of damages actions from third parties.
If the OFT were to make an infringement decision, Imperial Tobacco Group would be able to appeal the OFTs decision to the Competition Appeal Tribunal, and ultimately, on a point of law to the Court of Appeal.
We take compliance with competition law very seriously and reject any suggestion that we have acted in any way contrary to the interests of consumers.
Consequently, the Group has not provided for any amount in the consolidated financial statements.
