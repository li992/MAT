Financial instruments and risk management Derivative fi financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fl uctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price movements that arise in the normal course of the groups business.
The groups treasury objectives, risk management strategies and policies are disclosed in the Business review see Risk management.
a Currency risk The group publishes its consolidated fi financial statements in sterling and conducts business in many foreign currencies.
As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements, which will aff ect the groups transaction costs and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign operations.
Where hedge accounting is applied, hedges are documented and tested for hedge eff ectiveness on an ongoing basis.
Diageo expects hedges entered into to continue to be eff ective and therefore does not expect the impact of ineff ectiveness on the income statement to be material.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The group hedges a substantial portion of its exposure to fl uctuations on the translation into sterling of its foreign operations by designating net borrowings held in foreign currencies and by using foreign currency swaps and forwards.
Where a liquid foreign exchange market exists, the groups policy approved by the board is to seek to hedge currency exposure on its net investment in foreign operations within the following percentage bands: 80% to 100% for US dollars, 80% to 100% for euros and 50% to 100% for other signifi cant currencies.
Exchange diff erences arising on the retranslation of foreign currency borrowings including foreign currency swaps and forwards, to the extent that they are in an eff ective hedge relationship, are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense to match exchange diff erences on net investments in foreign operations.
Exchange diff erences on foreign currency borrowings not in a hedge relationship and any ineff ectiveness are taken to the income statement.
Transaction exposure hedging For currencies in which there is an active market, the groups policy approved by the board is to seek to hedge between 60% and 100% of forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk, for up to a maximum of 21 months forward, using forward foreign currency exchange contracts with coverage levels increasing nearer to the forecast transaction date.
The eff ective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense and recycled into the income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction aff ects the income statement.
Any ineff ectiveness is taken to the income statement.
Hedge of foreign currency debt The group uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the forward foreign currency risk associated with certain foreign currency denominated bonds.
At 30 June 2009, as a result of the net investment, transaction exposure and foreign currency debt cover outlined above, the group had outstanding gross foreign exchange contracts as disclosed in note 22 f. Further quantitative analysis of the sensitivity to movements in currency rates is reported in the Market risk sensitivity analysis in the Business review.
b Commodity price risk The group uses long term purchase and commodity futures contracts to hedge against price risk in certain commodities.
Long term purchase contracts are used to secure prices with suppliers to protect against volatility in commodity prices.
All commodity futures contracts hedge a projected future purchase of raw material.
Commodity futures contracts are held in the balance sheet at fair value.
To the extent that they are considered an eff ective hedge, the fair value movements are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense and recycled into the income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction aff ects the income statement.
Realised net losses recognised in the income statement in the year ended 30 June 2009 were 5 million 2008 4 million gains.
There were no open deals on the balance sheet at 30 June 2009 2008 nil as all commodity futures contracts had been sold before that date.
c Interest rate risk The group has an exposure to interest rate risk, arising principally on changes in US dollar, euro and sterling interest rates.
To manage interest rate risk, the group manages its proportion of fi xed to fl oating rate borrowings within limits approved by the board, primarily through issuing fi xed and fl oating rate term debt and commercial paper, and by utilising interest rate derivatives.
These practices serve to reduce the volatility of the groups reported fi financial performance.
To facilitate operational effi ciency and eff ective hedge accounting, the groups policy is to maintain fi xed rate borrowings within a band of 40% to 60% of projected net borrowings, and the overall net borrowings portfolio is managed according to a duration measure.

Amounts are shown on an undiscounted basis.
Where interest payments are on a fl oating rate basis, it is assumed that rates will remain unchanged from the last business day of the years ended 30 June 2009 and 30 June 2008 until maturity of the investments.
The group had available undrawn committed bank facilities as follows: 2009 2008 million million Expiring within one year 242 503 Expiring between one and two years 655 452 Expiring after two years 1,212 668 2,109 1,623 Commitment fees are paid on the undrawn portion of these facilities and accounted for on an accruals basis.
Borrowings under these facilities will be at prevailing LIBOR rates dependent on the period of drawdown plus an agreed margin.
These facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and, together with cash and cash equivalents, support the groups commercial paper programmes.
There are no fi financial covenants on the above short and long term borrowings.
Certain of these borrowings contain cross default provisions and negative pledges and related sale and lease back provisions.
The committed bank facilities are subject to a single fi financial covenant, being minimum interest cover ratio of two times defi ned as the ratio of operating profi t before exceptional items, aggregated with share of associates profi ts after tax, to net interest.
They are also subject to pari passu ranking and negative pledge covenants.
Any non-compliance with covenants underlying Diageos fi nancing arrangements could, if not waived, constitute an event of default with respect to any such arrangements, and any non-compliance with covenants may, in particular circumstances, lead to an acceleration of maturity on certain notes and the inability to access committed facilities.
Diageo was in full compliance with its fi financial, pari passu ranking and negative pledge covenants throughout each of the years presented.

155 Principal group companies ii Derivative fi financial instruments not designated in hedging relationships.
All derivative fi financial instruments not in a hedge relationship are classifi ed as trading derivatives with fair value changes recorded in the income statement.
The group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes.
All transactions in derivative fi financial instruments are initially undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
The fair values of borrowings, derivatives and fi financial instruments are estimated by discounting the future contractual cash fl ows using the appropriate yield curves at 30 June each year.
As at 30 June 2009 and 30 June 2008, the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, bank overdrafts, other assets and other liabilities were considered to approximate fair values.
Fair value hedging relationships Certain borrowings due within and after one year are part of qualifying fair value interest rate hedging relationships.
Accordingly there is a fair value adjustment for these liabilities with respect to the hedged interest rate risk, with changes being recognised in the income statement, as disclosed in note 22 f. Diageo has not designated any non-derivative fi financial assets or liabilities at fair value.
f Hedging instruments Diageo designates derivatives which qualify as hedges for accounting purposes as either: i a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability fair value hedge : ii a hedge of a forecast transaction or the cash fl ow risk from a change in interest rates or foreign exchange rates cash fl ow hedge : or iii a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations.
The accounting treatment for hedges is disclosed in Accounting policies of the group.
Diageo tests eff ectiveness on a prospective and retrospective basis.
Methods for testing eff ectiveness include dollar off set, critical terms, regression analysis, hypothetical derivative method and volatility reduction.
All fair value hedging relationships were eff ective during the year.
The gain on hedging instruments for the year was 92 million 2008 47 million gain and the loss on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks was 102 million 2008 47 million loss.
All cash fl ow hedges were eff ective in the year and gains of 90 million 2008 26 million gains have been recognised in equity due to changes in fair value.
A loss of 53 million and a gain of 124 million have been transferred out of equity to other operating expenses and to other fi finance income, respectively, in the year 2008 63 million gain to other operating income and 6 million gain to other fi finance income, respectively.
With respect to hedges of forecast transactions and the cash fl ow risk from a change in interest rates, based on year end interest and foreign exchange rates, balances related to cash fl ow hedged items at 30 June 2009 will aff ect the income statement in 2010 and 2011 by 3 million and 2 million, respectively.
With respect to hedges of the cash fl ow risk from a change in forward foreign exchange rates using cross currency interest rate swaps, the retranslation of the related bond principal to closing foreign exchange rates and recognition of interest on the related bonds will aff ect the income statement at each period end date until the related bonds mature in 2016 and 2036.
Foreign exchange retranslation and the interest on the hedged bonds taken to the income statement is expected to off set against the foreign exchange retranslation and the interest on the cross currency swaps in each of the years.
