61 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 Accounting policies Statement of compliance easyJet plc the Company and its subsidiaries easyJet or the Group as applicable is a low cost airline carrier operating principally in Europe.
The Company is a public limited company whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol EZJ and is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of its registered office is Hangar 89, London Luton Airport, Bedfordshire LU2 9PF.
The accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union, taking into account International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Acts 1985 and 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
IFRS as adopted by the EU differs in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
References to IFRS hereafter should be construed as references to IFRS as adopted by the EU.
Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared based on the historical cost convention except for certain financial assets and liabilities including derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all years presented in these accounts.
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the accounts, the Directors have considered the business activities as set out on pages 16 to 19 as well as easyJets principal risks and uncertainties as set out on pages 28 to 29.
Based on easyJets cash flow forecasts and projections, the Board is satisfied that easyJet will be able to operate within the level of its facilities and available cash for the foreseeable future.
For this reason easyJet continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its accounts.
Significant judgements, estimates and critical accounting policies The preparation of accounts in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, events or actions may mean that actual results ultimately differ from those estimates, and these differences may be material.
The estimates and the underlying assumptions are reviewed regularly.
The following four accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies as they require a significant amount of management judgement and the results are material to easyJets accounts.
Goodwill and landing rights note 7 Goodwill and landing rights are tested for impairment at least annually.
easyJet has one cash-generating unit, being its route network.
In making this assessment, easyJet has considered the manner in which the business is managed including the centralised nature of its operations and the ability to open or close routes and redeploy aircraft and crew across the whole route network.
The value in use of the cash-generating unit is determined by discounting future cash flows to their present value.
When applying this method, easyJet relies on a number of estimates including its strategic plans, fuel prices, exchange rates, long-term economic growth rates for the principal countries in which it operates and its pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
Assets held for sale note 11 When an aircraft is held for sale, the carrying value of the asset is assessed by comparison with its fair value less costs to sell the asset.
The underlying market for aircraft is conducted in US dollars.
In the current economic environment, where the market for used aircraft is thin, there are few transactions against which a market comparison of fair value can be made.
In these circumstances easyJet uses data available from third party agencies and indications of interest from prospective purchasers to estimate the fair value at the balance sheet date.
The time it will take to sell the aircraft held for sale is also uncertain, and asset values in sterling could rise or fall before a sale is completed.
Aircraft maintenance provisions note 17 easyJet incurs liabilities for maintenance costs in respect of aircraft leased under operating leases during the term of the lease.
These arise from legal and constructive contractual obligations relating to the condition of the aircraft when it is returned to the lessor.
To discharge these obligations, easyJet will also normally need to carry out one heavy maintenance check on each of the engines and the airframe during the lease term.
A charge is made in the income statement based on hours or cycles flown to provide for the cost of these obligations.
Estimates required include the likely utilisation of the aircraft, the expected cost of the heavy maintenance check at the time it is expected to occur, the condition of the aircraft and the lifespan of life-limited parts.
The bases of all estimates are reviewed once each year, and also when information becomes available that is capable of causing a material change to an estimate, such as renegotiation of end of lease return conditions, increased or decreased utilisation, or changes in the cost of heavy maintenance services.
Tax note 5 In drawing up the accounts, estimates are made of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities for each jurisdiction in which easyJet operates.
These estimates are affected by transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination was uncertain at the time the accounts were finalised.
The issues involved are often complex and may take an extended period to resolve.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
62 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 1 Accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts incorporate those of easyJet plc and its subsidiaries for the years ended 30 September 2008 and 2009.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by easyJet.
Control exists when easyJet has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to benefit from its activities.
Intragroup balances, transactions and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated accounts.
Foreign currencies The primary economic environment in which a subsidiary operates determines its functional currency.
The consolidated accounts of easyJet are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional currency and the Groups presentation currency.
Certain subsidiaries have operations that are primarily influenced by a currency other than sterling.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of these foreign operations are taken to reserves until all or part of the interest is sold, when the relevant portion of the exchange gains or losses is recognised in the income statement.
Profits and losses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange during the year, since this approximates the rates on the dates of the transactions.
Transactions arising in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and except where the asset or liability is designated as a cash flow hedge the gains or losses on translation are included in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the transactions were effected.
Revenue recognition Revenues comprise the invoiced value of airline services, net of air passenger duty, VAT and discounts, plus ancillary revenue.
Passenger revenue arises from the sale of flight seats and is recognised when the service is provided.
Unearned revenue represents flight seats sold but not yet flown and is included in trade and other payables until it is realised in the income statement when the service is provided.
Ancillary revenue is generally recognised when the flight to which it relates departs.
Certain types of ancillary revenue are recognised at the time the benefit of the service provided passes to the customer.
Ancillary revenue in the form of fixed annual fees is recognised evenly throughout the year.
Amounts paid by no-show customers are recognised as passenger or ancillary revenue as appropriate when the booked service is provided as such customers are not generally entitled to change flights or seek refunds once a flight has departed.
Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over easyJets interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
It has an indefinite expected useful life and is tested for impairment at least annually or where there is any indication of impairment.
Landing rights are stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
They are considered to have an indefinite useful life as they will remain available for use for the foreseeable future provided minimum utilisation requirements are observed, and are tested for impairment at least annually or where there is any indication of impairment.
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation, which is calculated to write off their cost, less estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives.
Expected useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually.
Expected useful life Computer software 3 years Contractual rights Over the length of the related contracts 63 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of assets on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives.
Expected useful lives are reviewed annually.
Expected useful life Aircraft 23 years Aircraft spares 14 years Aircraft improvements 37 years Aircraft prepaid maintenance 310 years Leasehold improvements 510 years or the length of lease if shorter Fixtures, fittings and equipment 3 years or length of lease of property where equipment is used if shorter Computer hardware 5 years Items held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their expected useful lives, as shown above.
Residual values, where applicable, are reviewed annually against prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date for equivalently aged assets and depreciation rates adjusted accordingly on a prospective basis.
The carrying value is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
An element of the cost of a new aircraft is attributed on acquisition to prepaid maintenance and is depreciated over a period ranging from three to ten years from the date of manufacture.
Subsequent costs incurred which lend enhancement to future periods, such as long-term scheduled maintenance and major overhaul of aircraft and engines, are capitalised and depreciated over the length of period benefiting from these enhancements.
All other maintenance costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.
The cost of new aircraft comprises the invoiced price of the aircraft from the supplier less the estimated value of other assets received by easyJet for nil consideration.
These other assets principally comprise cash recognised as an asset and aircraft spares and service credits.
Pre-delivery and option payments made in respect of aircraft are recorded in property, plant and equipment at cost.
Impairment of non-current assets An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the higher of the assets fair value less cost to sell and its value in use.
Impairment losses recognised on assets other than goodwill are only reversed where changes in the estimates used result in an increase in recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised on goodwill are not reversed.
Leases Non-contingent operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
A number of operating leases require easyJet to make contingent rental payments based on variable interest rates: these are expensed as incurred.
easyJet enters into sale and leaseback transactions whereby it sells to a third party rights to acquire aircraft.
On delivery of the aircraft, easyJet subsequently leases the aircraft back, by way of an operating lease.
Surpluses arising on disposal, where the price that the aircraft is sold for is above fair value, are recognised in deferred income and amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term of the asset.
Finance leases, which transfer to easyJet substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are recognised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset, or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Any directly attributable costs of entering into financing sale and leasebacks are included in the value of the asset recognised.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are included in interest payable and other financing charges.
Financial instruments Financial instruments are recognised when easyJet becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.
Where market values are not available, the fair value of financial instruments is calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
64 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 1 Accounting policies continued Non-derivative financial assets Non-derivative financial assets are recorded at amortised cost and include loan notes, trade receivables, cash and money market deposits.
Restricted cash comprises cash deposits which have restrictions governing their use and is classified as a current or non-current asset based on the estimated remaining length of the restriction.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held in bank accounts with no access restrictions and bank or money market deposits repayable on demand or maturing within three months of inception.
Impairment losses are recognised on financial assets carried at amortised cost where there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred.
The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
If, subsequently, the amount of the impairment loss decreases, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event that occurred after the impairment was recognised, the appropriate portion of the loss is reversed.
Both impairment losses and reversals are recognised in the income statement as components of net finance charges income.
Investments in equity instruments are carried at cost where fair value cannot be reliably measured due to significant variability in the range of reasonable fair value estimates.
Interest income on cash and money market deposits is recognised using the effective interest method.
Non-derivative financial liabilities Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless there is an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Interest expense on loans is recognised using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are used to mitigate operating and investing transaction exposures to movements in jet fuel prices and currency exchange rates.
Hedge accounting is applied to these instruments.
Changes in intrinsic fair value are recognised in shareholders funds to the extent that the cash flow hedges are determined to be effective.
All other changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where the hedged item results in a non-financial asset or liability, the accumulated gains and losses previously recognised in shareholders funds form part of the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
Otherwise accumulated gains and losses are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged items affect the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging instrument is derecognised e. g. through expiry or disposal, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Where the hedged item is a highly probable forecast transaction, the related gains and losses remain in shareholders funds until the transaction takes place.
When a hedged future transaction is no longer expected to occur, any related gains and losses previously recognised in shareholders funds are immediately recognised in the income statement.
Tax Tax expense in the income statement consists of current and deferred tax.
The charge for current tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for income that is exempt and expenses that are not deductible using tax rates that are applicable to the taxable income.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to shareholders funds, in which case it is recognised in shareholders funds.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences relating to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, where it is probable that the recovery or settlement will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither taxable income nor accounting profit.
deferred tax arising on investments in subsidiaries is not recognised where easyJet is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which recovery of assets and settlement of liabilities are expected to take place, based on tax rates or laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets represent amounts recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, losses and tax credits carried forward.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be suitable taxable profits from which they can be deducted.
Deferred tax liabilities represent the amount of income taxes payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis.
65 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 Aircraft maintenance provisions The accounting for the cost of providing major airframe and certain engine maintenance checks for owned and finance leased aircraft is described in the accounting policy for property, plant and equipment.
easyJet has contractual obligations to maintain aircraft held under operating leases.
Provisions are created over the term of the lease based on the estimated future costs of major airframe checks, engine shop visits and end of lease liabilities.
These costs are discounted to present value where the amount of the discount is considered material.
A number of leases also require easyJet to pay supplemental rent to the lessor.
Payments may be either a fixed monthly sum up to a cap or are based on usage.
The purpose of these payments is to provide the lessor with collateral should an aircraft be returned in a condition that does not meet the requirements of the lease.
Supplemental rent is either refunded when qualifying maintenance is performed, or is offset against end of lease liabilities.
Where the amount of supplemental rent paid exceeds the estimated amount recoverable from the lessor, provision is made for the non-recoverable amount.
Employee benefits easyJet contributes to defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of easyJet in independently administered funds.
easyJets contributions are charged to the income statement in the year in which they are incurred.
The expected cost of compensated holidays is recognised at the time that the related employees services are provided.
Share-based payments easyJet has a number of equity settled share incentive schemes.
The fair value of share options is measured at the date of grant using the Binomial Lattice option pricing model.
The fair value of awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan and awards of free shares is the share price at the date of grant.
The fair value of the estimated number of options and awards that are expected to vest is expensed to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period that employees services are rendered, with a corresponding increase in shareholders funds.
Where performance criteria attached to the share options and awards are not met, any cumulative expense previously recognised is reversed.
Segmental disclosures easyJet has one business segment: the provision of a low cost airline service.
easyJet has one geographical segment relating to the origin of its turnover which is Europe.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment, in the entity accounts.
Assets held for sale Where assets are available for sale in their current condition, and their disposal is highly probable, they are reclassified as held for sale and are measured at the lower of their carrying value and the fair value less costs to sell.
Depreciation ceases at the point of their reclassification from non-current assets.

There are no unrecognised deferred tax assets.
70 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 6 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit for the year by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year after adjusting for shares held in employee share trusts.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares.
Share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year are considered to be dilutive potential shares.
Where share options are exercisable based on performance criteria and those performance criteria have been met during the year, these options are included in the calculation of dilutive potential shares.
Earnings per share is based on: 2009 2008 million million Profit for the year 71.2 83.2 million million Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year used to calculate basic earnings per share 421.9 419.4 Weighted average number of dilutive share options 6.4 9.2 Weighted average number of ordinary shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share 428.3 428.6 Earnings per share 2009 2008 pence pence Basic 16.9 19.8 Diluted 16.6 19.4 7 Goodwill and other intangible assets Other intangible assets Landing Contractual Computer Goodwill rights rights software Total million million million million million Cost At 1 October 2008 originally reported 359.872.62.5 12.687.7 Adjustment re acquisition of GB Airways note 23 5.6 At 1 October 2008 restated 365.4 72.6 2.5 12.6 87.7 Additions 1.4 4.15.5 At 30 September 2009 365.4 74.0 2.5 16.7 93.2 Amortisation At 1 October 2008 0.7 6.4 7.1 Charge for the year 1.0 3.4 4.4 At 30 September 2009 1.7 9.8 11.5 Net book value At 30 September 2009 365.4 74.0 0.8 6.9 81.7 At 1 October 2008 restated 365.4 72.6 1.8 6.2 80.6 71 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 Other intangible assets Landing Contractual Computer Goodwill rights rights software Total million million million million million Cost At 1 October 2007 309.6 6.4 6.4 Acquisition of GB Airways note 23 55.8 72.4 2.5 74.9 Additions 0.2 6.26.4 At 30 September 2008 365.4 72.6 2.5 12.6 87.7 Amortisation At 1 October 2007 4.6 4.6 Charge for the year 0.7 1.8 2.5 At 30 September 2008 0.7 6.4 7.1 Net book value At 30 September 2008 365.4 72.6 1.8 6.2 80.6 At 1 October 2007 309.6 1.8 1.8 easyJet has one cash-generating unit, being its route network.
The recoverable amount of goodwill and other assets with indefinite expected useful lives has been determined based on value in use of the route network.
Pre-tax cash flow projections have been derived from the five-year strategic plan approved by the Board in June 2009, using the following key assumptions: Pre-tax discount rate derived from weighted average cost of capital 10.69% Fuel price, per metric tonne, in US dollars 775 Exchange rates US dollar 1.55 Euro 1.20 Swiss franc 1.70 Both fuel price and exchange rates have been volatile during the past year, and the assumptions used represent managements view of reasonable average rates.
Operating margins are sensitive to significant changes in these rates.
Cash flow projections beyond the forecast period have been extrapolated using real growth rate scenarios ranging from zero up to an estimated average of long-term economic growth rates for the principal countries in which easyJet operates.
No impairment resulted from any of these scenarios.
No reasonably possible combination of changes in the key assumptions above would result in the carrying value of the cash-generating unit exceeding its recoverable amount.

The net book value of aircraft at 30 September 2009 includes 148.5 million 2008: 188.1 million relating to advance and option payments for future delivery of aircraft.
This amount is not depreciated.
The net book value of aircraft held under finance leases at 30 September 2009 was 71.1 million 2008: 74.5 million.
3.4 million of the related accumulated depreciation was charged in the year ended 30 September 2009 2008: 3.3 million.
At 30 September 2009, aircraft with a net book value of 984.5 million 2008: 610.9 million were mortgaged to lenders as loan security.
9 Loan notes In 2001, easyJet in consortium with six other UK airlines formed The Airline Group Limited in order to acquire a minority interest in NATS, the company that owns the UK air traffic control system.
easyJets investment is principally in the form of unsecured loan notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 8%.
Interest receivable is settled by the issue of additional loan notes.
Redemption is governed by a priority agreement among the consortium members.

This carrying value was subsequently restated see note 23.
During the year, three Airbus A321 aircraft have been sold, realising a net profit of 11.0 million.
easyJet continues to market the remaining four A321 aircraft, and although the period over which the asset is classified as held for sale exceeds one year, the Directors consider that this classification remains appropriate.
In view of current market conditions and the challenges for potential purchases in arranging finance, the five A319 aircraft have been transferred back to property, plant and equipment, with a corresponding catch-up of related depreciation charged to the income statement.

Amounts due from trade receivables are short term in nature and largely comprise credit card receivables due from financial institutions with credit ratings of at least A and, accordingly, the possibility of significant default is considered to be unlikely.

Discretionary schemes Options awarded in 2001 in connection with easyJets admission to the Official List had a three-year vesting period and no performance conditions.
All other awards have a three-year vesting period and performance conditions based on growth in earnings per share.
During the year 54% of the options granted in December 2005 vested.
Sharesave Sharesave is open to all employees on the UK payroll.
Participants may elect to save up to 250 per month under a three-year savings contract.
An option is granted by the Company to buy shares at a discount of 20% from market price at the time of the grant.
At the end of the savings period, a tax-free bonus is applied to the savings and the option becomes exercisable for a period of six months.
Employees who are not paid through the UK payroll may save under similar terms and conditions, albeit without tax benefits.
Share incentive plan The share incentive plan is open to all employees on the UK payroll.
Participants may invest up to 1,500 of their pre-tax salary each year to purchase partnership shares in easyJet.
For each partnership share acquired easyJet purchases a matching share.
Employees must remain with easyJet for three years from the date of purchase of each partnership share in order to qualify for the matching share, and for five years for the shares to be transferred to them tax free.
The employee is entitled to dividends and to vote at shareholder meetings.
In October 2006 and December 2007, easyJet also awarded free shares to all employees under the share incentive plan.
Long term incentive plan The plan is open, by invitation, to Executive Directors and senior management, and provides for annual awards of performance shares worth up to 200% of salary each year and matching shares linked to the investment of up to 50% of annual bonus in easyJet shares.
The vesting of these awards is dependent on return on equity targets being achieved.
Chief Executive recruitment award In December 2005, on Andrew Harrison acquiring and retaining 1,000,000 worth of easyJet shares using his own funds, he was granted an equal number of shares with a three-year vesting period.
Half of the award is subject to performance conditions relating to the growth in EPS over the three years to September 2008.
The other half is subject to the same return on equity targets as the 2005 long term incentive plan award.
During the year 50% of the award related to growth in EPS and 67% of the award related to return on equity vested.
The weighted average remaining contractual life for each class of share award is as follows: Years Pre-flotation scheme 0.5 Discretionary schemes 5.1 Sharesave 2.5 Share incentive plan 3.0 Long term incentive plan 2.2 In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 2, fair values have not been calculated for grants of share options that occurred before 8 November 2002.
Exercise prices for these options lie between 1.61 and 3.65.
78 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 19 Share incentive schemes continued The fair value of other grants under the discretionary and sharesave schemes is estimated by applying the Binomial Lattice option pricing model using the following key assumptions.
The fair value of grants under all other schemes is the share price on the date of grant.
Share price is the closing share price from the last working day prior to the date of grant.
Exercise price for the discretionary schemes was determined using a five-day weighted average price.
For the Sharesave scheme, a 20% discount has been given between share price and exercise price.
Expected volatility is based on historical volatility over a period comparable to the expected life of each type of option.
In all cases the assumed dividend yield is zero as easyJet does not pay dividends.
Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages.

Where carrying value does not equal fair value, the fair value has been estimated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
For all other financial instruments fair value approximates to carrying value.
Non-financial instruments represent amounts recognised in the balance sheet for the line items disclosed above that do not meet the definition of a financial instrument and are disclosed to permit reconciliation of the carrying values of financial instruments to line items presented in the balance sheet.

83 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges All derivatives to which hedge accounting is applied are designated as cash flow hedges, with only the intrinsic value being designated for option instruments.
Changes in fair value are recognised directly in shareholders funds, to the extent that they are effective, with the ineffective portion being recognised in the income statement.
Where the hedged item results in a non-financial asset or liability, the accumulated gains and losses previously recognised in shareholders funds are included in the carrying value of that asset or liability.
Otherwise accumulated gains and losses are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged items affects the income statement.
easyJet uses forward contracts and zero cost collars to hedge transaction currency risk, jet fuel price risk and surplus euro and Swiss franc monetary balances.
Transaction currency risk includes capital expenditure, lease payments, debt repayments and fuel payments.
Where these hedges are assessed as highly effective, gains and losses are deferred in shareholders funds and transferred to the income statement or cost of property, plant and equipment when the related cash flow occurs.
The cumulative net gains losses deferred in shareholders funds and their expected maturities are as follows: Within 1 year 12 years Total At 30 September 2009 million million million Hedges of transaction currency risk 13.4 1.8 15.2 Hedges of jet fuel price risk 53.1 4.7 48.4 39.7 6.5 33.2 Related deferred tax 9.3 Net losses 23.9 Within 1 year 12 years Total At 30 September 2008 million million million Hedges of transaction currency risk 86.0 15.7 101.7 Hedges of jet fuel price risk 67.3 3.8 63.5 18.7 19.5 38.2 Related deferred tax 10.6 Net gains 27.6 The amount deferred and recognised in shareholders funds during each financial year is disclosed in note 20.

easyJet has no other significant currency net monetary exposure at each balance sheet date.
In accordance with IAS 21, monetary assets and liabilities are revalued using exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
This exposure is managed by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Net US dollar monetary liabilities at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2009 2008 million million Cash and money market deposits 559.7 432.5 Borrowings 935.9 453.5 Maintenance provisions 180.8 101.9 Other 38.3 58.1 518.7 181.0 Amounts recorded in the income statement in respect of revaluation of the monetary assets and liabilities and the gains and losses on derivatives designated as held for trading are as follows: 2009 2008 million million Operating profit Unrealised revaluation gains on non-derivative financial instruments 30.9 15.5 Unrealised revaluation losses on other monetary assets and liabilities 26.0 13.5 Realised foreign exchange losses on financial instruments 16.4 6.7 Unrealised gains on derivatives 1.3 1.4 Realised gains on derivatives 16.6 10.8 6.4 7.5 Net finance charges income Unrealised revaluation gains on other financial instruments 12.8 0.7 Unrealised gains on derivatives 10.1 0.3 Realised losses gains on derivatives 18.8 3.3 4.1 4.3 Net gains 10.5 11.8 25 Financial risk and capital management easyJet is exposed to financial risks including fluctuations in exchange rates, jet fuel prices and interest rates.
Financial risk management aims to limit these market risks with selected derivative hedging instruments being used for this purpose.
easyJet policy is not to trade in derivatives but to use the instruments to hedge anticipated exposure.
As such, easyJet is not exposed to market risk by using derivatives as any gains and losses arising are offset by the outcome of the underlying exposure being hedged.
In addition to market risks, easyJet is exposed to credit and liquidity risk.
The Board is responsible for setting financial risk and capital management policies and objectives which are implemented by the treasury function on a day-to-day basis.
The policy outlines the approach to risk management and also states the instruments and time periods which the treasury function is authorised to use in managing financial risks.
The policy is under ongoing review to ensure best practice in light of developments in the financial markets.
There have been no changes to the policy in the current year.
Capital management The objective of capital management is to ensure that easyJet is able to continue as a going concern whilst delivering shareholder expectations of a strong capital base as well as returning benefits for other stakeholders and optimising the cost of capital.
easyJet manages its capital structure in response to changes in both economic conditions and strategic objectives.
The cash and net debt position, together with the maturity profile of existing debt, is monitored to ensure the continuity of funding.
During the year, funding totalling $217 million for seven A320 aircraft was put in place and utilised.
On 16 November 2009 lease funding for a further six A320 aircraft totalling $222 million was agreed.
The principal measure used by easyJet to manage capital risk is the gearing ratio of debt defined as debt plus seven times aircraft operating lease payments less cash, including money market deposits and restricted cash to shareholders funds.
Gearing increased in the year from 28.8% to 37.6%, principally due to the acquisition of new aircraft and the strengthening of the US dollar against sterling.
85 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 Liquidity risk management The objective of easyJets liquidity risk management is to ensure sufficient cash resources and the availability of funding as required.
easyJet holds financial assets either for which there is a liquid market or which are expected to generate cash inflows that are available to meet liquidity needs.
In addition, easyJet has committed undrawn bank facilities of $528 million 2008: $1,135 million, being a $250 million revolving credit facility and a remaining $278 million from facilities of $937 million put in place in December 2007.
The cash, cash equivalent, restricted cash balances and money market deposits at 30 September 2009 totalled 1,147.2 million 2008: 928.7 million.
easyJet continues to hold significant cash and liquid funds to mitigate the impact of potential business disruption events with Board approved policy stating an absolute minimum level of liquidity that must be maintained at all times.
Surplus funds are invested, in line with Board approved policy, in high quality short-term liquid instruments, usually money market funds or bank deposits.
The maturity profile of easyJets financial liabilities based on the remaining contractual maturities is set out below.
The analysis represents undiscounted gross anticipated future cash flows.
Within Over 1 year 12 years 25 years 5 years 30 September 2009 million million million million Borrowings 138.5 150.5 418.9 525.1 Trade and other payables 338.6 Derivative contracts receipts 1,482.2 217.7 Derivative contracts payments 1,541.3 232.8 Within Over 1 year 12 years 25 years 5 years 30 September 2008 million million million million Borrowings 85.5 96.9 291.2 296.0 Trade and other payables 304.1 Derivative contracts receipts 1,759.9 336.9 Derivative contracts payments 1,729.6 310.3 Credit risk management easyJet is exposed to credit risk arising from liquid funds, derivative financial instruments and trade and other receivables.
Credit risk management aims to reduce the risk of counterparty default through limiting aggregate credit exposure to any one individual counterparty, based on its credit rating.
Such counterparty exposures are regularly reviewed and adjusted as necessary.
Accordingly, the possibility of material loss arising in the event of non-performance by counterparties is considered to be unlikely.
Credit risk is limited to the carrying amount recognised at the balance sheet date.
Disclosure relating to the credit quality of trade and other receivables is detailed in note 12.
The credit risk for liquid funds and other short-term financial assets is considered negligible, since the counterparties are reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.
For deposits with financial institutions, internal limits are placed on the maximum exposure to individual counterparties and a minimum external credit rating of A is required.
Foreign currency risk management The principal exposure to currency exchange rates arises from fluctuations in both the US dollar and euro rates which impact operating, financing and investing activities.
The aim of foreign currency risk management is to reduce the impact of exchange rate volatility on the results of easyJet.
Foreign exchange exposure arising from transactions in various currencies is reduced through a policy of matching, as far as possible, receipts and payments in each individual currency.
Any remaining significant anticipated exposure is managed through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and zero cost collars.
No new zero cost collars were put in place during the year ended 30 September 2009, and all existing positions matured prior to 30 September 2009.
In addition, easyJet has substantial US dollar balance sheet liabilities, partly offset by holding US dollar cash: any residual net liability is managed through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Financing and interest rate risk management Interest rate cashflow risk arises on floating rate borrowings and cash investments.
Interest rate risk management policy aims to provide certainty in a proportion of financing while retaining the opportunity to benefit from interest rate reductions.
Interest rate policy is used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
All borrowings are at floating interest rates repricing every three to six months.
A significant proportion of the US dollar loans are matched with US dollar cash, with the cash being invested to coincide with the repricing of the debt.
Operating leases are a mix of fixed and floating rates.
Of the operating leases in place at 30 September 2009 approximately 60% of lease payments were based on fixed interest rates and 40% were based on floating interest rates 2008: 60% fixed, 40% floating.
All debt is asset related, reflecting the capital intensive nature of the airline industry and the attractiveness of aircraft as security to lenders.
These factors are also reflected in the medium-term profile of easyJets borrowings and operating leases.
During the year four aircraft were cash acquired 2008: 13 aircraft.
Committed financing is in place for up to 21 of the 27 aircraft due to be delivered during the year to 30 September 2010.
86 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 25 Financial risk and capital management continued Fuel price risk management easyJet is exposed to fuel price risk.
The objective of the fuel price risk management policy is to provide protection against sudden and significant increases in jet fuel prices thus mitigating volatility in the income statement in the short term.
In order to manage the risk exposure, forward contracts are used in line with Board approved policy to hedge between 50% and 80% of estimated exposures up to 12 months in advance, and to hedge a smaller percentage of estimated usage up to 24 months in advance.
In exceptional market conditions, the Board may accelerate or limit the implementation of the hedging policy.
Market risk sensitivity analysis Financial instruments affected by market risks include borrowings, deposits, trade receivables, trade payables and derivative financial instruments.
The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the sensitivity of such financial instruments to changes in relevant foreign exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices.
It should be noted that the sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on profit or loss after tax for the year and shareholders funds on financial instruments held at the reporting date.
It does not reflect changes in revenue or costs that may result from changing currency rates, interest rates or fuel prices.
Each sensitivity is calculated based on all other variables remaining constant.
The analysis below is considered representative of easyJets exposure over the 12 month period.
The currency sensitivity analysis is based on easyJets foreign currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date taking into account forward exchange contracts and zero cost collars that offset effects from changes in currency exchange rates.
The increased sensitivity in the US dollar and euro rate represents sterling weakening against each variable currency with the 10% sensitivity showing a stronger sterling sensitivity.
The interest rate analysis assumes a 1% change in interest rates over the reporting year applied to end of year financial instruments.
The fuel price sensitivity analysis is based on easyJets fuelrelated derivative financial instruments held at the end of each reporting period.
The sensitivity applied to both currency rates and the fuel price is based on a reasonably possible change in the rate applied to the value of financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
Currency rates Interest rates Fuel price US dollar 10% US dollar 10% Euro 10% Euro 10% 1% increase 10% increase At 30 September 2009 million million million million million million Income statement impact: gain loss 17.9 13.8 1.1 0.9 0.4 Impact on shareholders funds: increase decrease 44.9 37.6 14.5 12.0 31.4 Currency rates Interest rates Fuel price US dollar 10% US dollar 10% Euro 10% Euro 10% 1% increase 10% increase At 30 September 2008 million million million million million million Income statement impact: gain loss 3.6 2.92.3 1.9 2.4 Impact on shareholders funds: increase decrease 86.8 70.5 27.1 22.1 27.6 The impact of a 1% increase in interest rates and a 10% increase in the fuel price is disclosed above.
A corresponding decrease in each of the rates results in an equal and opposite impact on the income statement and shareholders funds in both reporting periods.

27 Contingent liabilities easyJet is involved in various disputes or litigation in the normal course of business.
Whilst the result of such disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, management considers that the ultimate resolution of these disputes will not have a material effect on easyJets financial position, results or cash flows.
At 30 September 2009 easyJet had outstanding letters of credit and performance bonds totalling 29.4 million of which 28.7 million expires on or before 30 September 2010.
The fair value of these instruments was approximately equal to their carrying value.
