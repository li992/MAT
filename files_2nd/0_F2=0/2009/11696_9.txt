5 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 26,409 15,799 39 PACE PLC ANNUAL REPORT NOTES 1 BASIS OF PREPARATION AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the financial statements.
Basis of Preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost convention as modied by the revaluation of derivative instruments.
International Financial Reporting Standards The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as endorsed by the European Union.
The Companys financial statements have been prepared on the same basis and as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no income statement is presented for the Company.
Financial Year End The current years financial statements are for the year ended 31 December 2009 and the previous years financial statements are for the year ended 31 December 2008.
Basis of Consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and of its subsidiary undertakings note 12 drawn up to 31 December 2009.
The results of subsidiaries acquired in the period are included in the income statement from the date they are acquired.
On acquisition, all of the subsidiaries assets and liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reecting their condition at that date.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
Intra-group transactions, including sales, profits, receivables and payables, have been eliminated on the Group consolidation.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment loss in the financial statements of the Company.
significant judgements, key assumptions and estimation uncertainty The Groups main accounting policies affecting its results of operations and financial condition are set out on pages 40 to 45.
Judgements and assumptions have been required by management in applying the Groups accounting policies in many areas.
Actual results may differ from the estimates calculated using these judgements and assumptions.
Key areas of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgements are as follows: Warranties Pace provides product warranties for its set-top boxes.
Although it is difficult to make accurate predictions of potential failure rates or the possibility of an epidemic failure, as a warranty estimate must be calculated at the outset of a product before eld deployment data is available, these estimates improve during the lifetime of the product in the eld.
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
The level of warranty provision required is reviewed on a product by product basis and provisions adjusted accordingly in the light of actual performance.
Royalties Paces products incorporate third party technology, usually under licence.
Inadvertent actions may expose Pace to the risk of infringing third party intellectual property rights.
Potential claims can still be submitted many years after a product has been deployed.
Any such claims are always vigorously defended.
A provision for royalties is recognised where the owners of patents covering technology allegedly used by the Group have indicated claims for royalties relating to the Groups use including past usage of that technology.
Having taken legal advice, the board considers that there are defences available that should mitigate the amounts being sought.
The Group will vigorously negotiate or defend all claims but, in the absence of agreement, the amounts provided may prove to be different from the amounts at which the potential liabilities are nally settled.
The provision is based on the latest information available.
Operating segments Following the introduction of IFRS 8 Operating Segments, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, the Group has determined that, based on its internal reporting framework and management structure, that it has only one reportable segment.
Such determination is necessarily judgmental in its nature and has been determined by management in preparing the financial statements.
The level of disclosure of segmental and other information is determined by such assessment.
Further details of the considerations made and the resulting disclosures are provided in note 3 to the financial statements.
PACE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 40 NOTES CONTINUED Intangible assets The Groups business includes a significant element of research and development activity.
Under accounting standards, principally IAS38 Intangible Assets, there is a requirement to capitalise and amortise development spend to match costs to expected benets from projects deemed to be commercially viable.
The application of this policy involves the ongoing consideration by management of the forecasted economic benefit from such projects compared to the level of capitalised costs, together with the selection of amortisation periods appropriate to the life of the associated revenues from the product.
Such considerations made by management are a key judgement in preparation of the financial statements.
EU Import duty classication Pace, along with other set top box manufacturers and broadcasters, has continued to monitor the re-interpretation by European Union customs authorities of customs regulations that could result in the extension of import duties to interactive set-top boxes with a hard drive manufactured outside, but imported into, the EU.
On 7th May 2008 the Nomenclature Committee of the European Commission issued an Explanatory Note EN 0590 2007 to the Combined Nomenclature setting out their view that set-top boxes with a hard drive should be classied under Customs Tariff heading 8521 90 00 and so subject to a 13.9% ad valorem duty on importation to the European Union.
As a consequence, Pace is potentially exposed to a retrospective Customs Duty liability in respect of such set-top boxes it has imported.
Having previously obtained Binding Tariff Information BTI rulings from HMRC, which provide protection in respect of much of the potential period of retrospective application of duty on relevant products and having taken legal advice, managements opinion is that the retrospective application of the Explanatory Note would not be supportable in law.
Accordingly Pace is, in common with other affected importers, appealing any retrospective assessment made and will defend its position on this matter.
An assessment has been received from HMRC in an amount of 7.7m representing import duty relating to imports prior to 7 May 2008.
Having taken advice, managements best estimate is that no material outow of economic benefit would be required to discharge this obligation.
As such, at 31 December 2009 any potential liability should be considered contingent.
A bank guarantee is held whilst the appeal continues.
Writ Issued against Company A writ has been issued against the Company by a former customer relating to the supply of set-top boxes in 2000 2001.
The Directors believe that they have good defences to the claim and that, in the absence of any liability, no provision has been made.
In addition on 15 July 2007 Pace led a counter claim for circa $10m against this former customer and a related third party.
Going concern The Group has borrowing facilities, to a maximum of 35m, in place until December 2011.
These facilities are subject to financial performance covenants.
The Board has prepared a working capital forecast based upon assumptions as to trading and the matters above, as well as building in the other circumstances noted in the Business Environment section within the Directors Report and the availability of cash reserves.
Based upon this analysis the Board has concluded that the Group has adequate working capital, will meet the financial performance covenants and futher it is appropriate to use the going concern basis of preparation for this financial information.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid on acquisition of a business over the fair value of the assets, including any intangible assets identied and liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is not amortised but is measured at cost less impairment losses.
In determining the fair value of consideration, the fair value of equity issued is the market value of equity at the date of completion, and the fair value of contingent consideration is based upon the extent to which the directors believe performance conditions will be met and thus whether any further consideration will be payable.
As permitted by IFRS 1, goodwill arising on acquisitions before 29 May 2004 date of transition to Adopted IFRS has been frozen at the UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment annually.
The Group performs its annual impairment review at the cash-generating unit level.
Other intangibles Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have nite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
The useful economic life is estimated based upon a determination of ongoing 41 PACE PLC ANNUAL REPORT
