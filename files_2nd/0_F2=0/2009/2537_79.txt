FInanCIaL InSTRUMEnTS continued hedging activities Cash flow hedges At 27 September 2009, the group held 44 2008: 32 US dollar and 67 2008: 8 euro forward exchange contracts designated as hedges of expected future purchases from overseas suppliers in US dollars and euros for which the group believe to be highly probable transactions.
The forward currency contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of these highly probable transactions.
The terms of these contracts are as follows: Average Maturity range exchange rate Forward contracts to hedge expected future purchases 2009 US$14,085,000 September 09 to August 10 US$1.57 26,515,000 September 09 to August 10 1.17 2008 US$13,003,417 October 08 to September 09 US$1.89 3,045,235 October 08 to March 09 1.27 The terms of the forward currency contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments.
The cash flow hedges of the expected future purchases in the period to August 2010 have been assessed to be effective and a net unrealised gain of 1.3m 2008: unrealised gain of 0.3m, with a related deferred tax liability of 0.4m 2008: related deferred tax liability of 0.1m, has been included in equity in respect of these contracts.
During the period a gain of 3.0m 2008: 0.3m was removed from equity and included in the group income statement.
In February 2007, Britvic plc issued US$375m and 38m of Senior Notes in the United States Private Placement market.
As a result of this transaction further cash flow hedges were entered into.
These are detailed in note 23. hedge of net investments in foreign operations Included in unsecured bank loans at 27 September 2009 was a borrowing of 100.0m 2008: 100.0m which has been designated as a hedge of the net investment in Britvic Ireland and is being used to hedge the groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on this investment.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of this borrowing are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investment in Britvic Ireland.

ShaRE-BaSED PayMEnTS The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the 52 weeks ended 27 September 2009, including national insurance, is 7.
All of that expense arises from transactions which are expected to be equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
The Britvic Share Incentive Plan SIP The SIP is an all-employee plan approved by HMRC.
The plan allows for annual awards of free ordinary shares with a value of 3% of salary subject to HMRC maximum limits together with an offer of matching shares on the basis of one free matching share for each ordinary share purchased with a participants savings, up to a maximum of 75 per four week pay period.
Employees are entitled to receive the annual free share award provided they are employed by the company on the last day of each financial year and on the award date.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Awards made during the period are shown in the table below.
The fair value of these awards is equivalent to the intrinsic value of the shares.
of shares 2009 2008 Annual free shares award 675,573 477, 862 Matching shares award 1 free share for every ordinary share purchased 464,205 422,225 The Britvic Executive Share Option Plan Option Plan The Option Plan allows for options to buy ordinary shares to be granted to selected employees.
The option price is the average market price of Britvic plcs shares on the three business days before the date of grant.
Options become exercisable on the satisfaction of the performance condition and remain exercisable until ten years after the date of grant.
The performance condition requires average growth in EPS of 7% pa over a three year period in excess of the growth in RPI over the same period for the options to vest in full.
If EPS growth averages 3% per annum in excess of RPI growth, 25% 2008: 40% of the options will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the number of options that vest and no options will vest if average EPS growth is below the lower threshold.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the company, an optionholder who exercises his her option may receive a cash payment rather than the ordinary shares under option.
The cash payment would be equal to the amount by which the market value of the ordinary shares under option exceeds the option price.
However, it is expected that this plan will be equity-settled and as a consequence has been accounted for as such.

The weighted average fair value of options granted during the period was 52.3p 2008: 67.
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial model, taking account of the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.

The Britvic Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP allows for awards of ordinary shares to be made to selected employees subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition.
Different performance conditions apply to different groups of employees.
The total number of awards granted to members of the senior leadership team during the current period is divided equally between the total shareholder return TSR and return on invested capital ROIC performance conditions described below.
In prior years, all of the awards granted to this group were subject to the TSR condition.
Awards granted to members of the senior leadership team are subject to a performance condition which measures the companys TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group consisting of 22 companies over a three year performance period.
The awards will not vest unless the companys position in the comparator group is at least median.
At median 25% 2008: 40% will vest, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting at upper quartile.
Awards granted to members of the senior leadership team are subject to a performance condition which requires the companys ROIC to be at least 18.8% over the three year performance period for the award to vest in full.
If ROIC is 16.8% over the performance period, 25% of the award will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the percentage of awards that vest and no awards will vest if ROIC is below the lower threshold.
Awards granted to members of the senior management team will be subject to a performance condition which requires average growth in EPS of 7% pa over a three year period in excess of the growth in RPI over the same period for the awards to vest in full.
If EPS growth averages 3% pa in excess of RPI growth, 25% 2008: 40% of the awards will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the number of awards that vest and no awards will vest if average EPS growth is below the lower threshold.
In addition, a transitional award has been made to members of both the senior leadership team and the senior management team shortly after flotation, at levels varying according to seniority.
These awards will vest in tranches over a period of up to three years, subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition.
The performance condition requires the companys ROIC to be at least 17% over the performance period for the award to vest in full.
If ROIC is 15% over the performance period, 50% of the award will vest.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the company, vested awards may be satisfied by a cash payment rather than a transfer of ordinary shares.
