Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued The following standards and interpretations have not yet been adopted but will be applicable to Accounting policies the Group: 02 for the Group financial statements continued International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS Accounting Periods Commencing After IFRS 2 Group Cash-settled share based payment arrangements 1 January 2010 IFRS 3 Business Combinations Revised 1 July 2009 IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 1 July 2009 IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement 1 July 2009 Eligible Hedged Items Amendment IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners 1 July 2009 IFRS 2: Group Cash-settled share based payment arrangements The IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 2 that clarifies the scope and the accounting for group cash-settled share based payment transactions.
The Group does not expect the standard to have an impact on the Group.
IFRS 3: Business Combinations Revised and IAS 27: Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements Amended IFRS 3 Revised introduces significant changes in the accounting for business combinations occurring after this date.
Changes affect the valuation of non-controlling interests, the accounting for transaction costs, the initial recognition and subsequent measurement of a contingent consideration and business combinations achieved in stages.
These changes will impact the amount of goodwill recognised, the reported results in the period that an acquisition occurs and future reported results.
IAS 27 Amended requires that a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without loss of control is accounted for as a transaction with owners in their capacity as owners.
Therefore, such transactions will no longer give rise to goodwill, nor will it give rise to a gain or loss.
Furthermore, the amended standard changes the accounting for losses incurred by the subsidiary as well as the loss of control of a subsidiary.
The changes by IFRS 3 Revised and IAS 27 Amended will affect any future acquisitions or loss of control of subsidiaries and transactions with non-controlling interests.
IAS 39: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement Eligible Hedged Items the amendment clarifies that an entity is permitted to designate a portion of the fair value changes or cash flow variability of a financial instrument as a hedged item.
This also covers the designation of inflation as a hedged risk or portion in particular situations.
The Group has concluded that the amendment will have no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group, as the Group has not entered into any such hedges.
IFRIC 17: Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners It provides guidance on how to account for non-cash distributions to owners.
The interpretation clarifies when to recognise a liability, how to measure it and the associated assets, and when to derecognise the asset and liability.
The Group does not expect IFRIC 17 to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.
No other standard or interpretation issued in the period is expected to have an impact on the Group.
