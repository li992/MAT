McBride plc The figures 60 Annual report and accounts 2009 Notes to the Group financial statements Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised by the Group and movements during the current and prior reporting period.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of timing differences associated with the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and either it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future or if a distribution of profits is foreseen, based on the current repatriation policy of the Group no incremental tax is expected to be paid.
Unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries at the balance sheet date totalled 102.8 million 2008: 91.3m.
At the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses of 15.0 million 2008: 15.4m available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised of 0.6 million 2008: 2.0m of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
3.5 million 2008: 3.9m of unrecognised tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the Group had surplus ACT of 6.5 million 2008: 6.5m available to offset against future tax liabilities.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of surplus ACT of 4.1 million 2008: 4.6m.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in relation to the remaining surplus ACT of 2.4 million 2008: 1.9m due to uncertainty as to future ACT capacity.
