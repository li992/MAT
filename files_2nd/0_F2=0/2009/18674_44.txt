Credit risk Credit risks arise from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed.
To manage this risk the Group periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial position, past experience and other factors.
As at 31 March 2009 Helical has total credit risk excluding cash of 61.6m of which 21.0m is available-for-sale assets and 40.6m is loans and receivables.
Available-for-sale assets are analysed in note 18.
Of the trade receivables held at 31 March 2009, 8.9m is due from a business partner which has security on a property which is deemed to be worth more than the debt, 2.3m is due on development sales in Southall for which monies were received on 15 April 2009 and a further 2.7m related to rent due from tenants which is deemed recoverable.
All other debtors are deemed to be recoverable.
For further information on trade and other receivables, see note 24.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group would not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
Liquidity and funding risks, related processes and policies are overseen by management.
Helical manages its liquidity risk on a consolidated basis based on business needs, tax, capital or regulatory considerations, if applicable, through numerous sources of finance in order to maintain flexibility.
Management monitors the Groups net liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents are held with major regulated financial institutions and the directors regularly monitor the financial institutions that the group uses to ensure its exposure to liquidity risk is minimised.
For further information on borrowing facilities, see notes 27 and 28.
The Group had the following contracted liabilities as at 31 March 2009.
The above contracted liabilities assume that no loans are extended beyond their current facility expiry date.
The management believe that these facilities together with anticipated sales and the renewal of some of these loan facilities means that Helical can meet its contracted liabilities as they fall due.
Notes to the financial statements Helical Bar plc report & accounts 2009 Market risk 66 Helical is exposed to market risk, primarily related to interest rates, foreign currency exchange movements, the market value of the investments and accrued development profits.
The Group actively monitors these exposures.
Interest rate risk It is the Groups policy and practice to minimise interest rate cash flow exposures on long-term financing.
Helical does this by using a number of derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and interest rate caps.
The purpose of these derivatives is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Groups sources of finance.
The Group does not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Details of financing and financial instruments can be found in note 28.
In the year to 31 March 2009, if interest rates had moved by 1%, this would have resulted in the following movement to pre-tax losses and equity due to movements in interest charges and mark-to-market valuations of derivatives.
31 March 2009 Impact on Equity results impact 000 000 1% increase increase in net results and equity 5,282 5,282 1% decrease decrease in net results and equity 5,043 5,043 There would have been no significant impact on the results or on the equity of the Company if interest rates had increased or decreased.
Foreign currency exchange risk Due to its operations in Poland and its investment in a non-UK based property developer, Helical has exposure to exchange movements on foreign currencies.
Helicals management monitors its exposure to risks associated with foreign currency exchange risk and reviews any requirements to act to minimise these risks.
In the year to 31 March 2009 the Group made foreign exchange gains of 4.0m resulting from foreign exchange movements on the consolidation of the results of its Polish operations.
The Groups Polish operations have zloty denominated receivables, cash and payables.
Had the Polish zloty been 10% weaker against the euro at the balance sheet date the loss before tax would have been 393,000 greater and the shareholder funds would have decreased by 437,000.
Had the Polish zloty been 10% stronger against the euro at the balance sheet date the loss before tax would have been 481,000 less and shareholder funds would have increased by 534,000.
The Groups Polish operations were partially financed by intra-group loans.
Had the Polish zloty been 10% weaker against sterling at the balance sheet date the loss before tax would have increased by 1,314,000.
Had the Polish zloty been 10% stronger against sterling at the balance sheet date the loss before tax would have decreased by 1,605,000.
Had the euro been 10% weaker against sterling at the balance sheet date the loss before tax would have increased by 920,000.
Had the euro been 10% stronger against sterling at the balance sheet date the loss before tax would have decreased by 1,116,000.
