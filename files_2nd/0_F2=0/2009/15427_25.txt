Therefore, the Group considered it appropriate to adjust downward some of the previous assumptions in relation to future selling prices in the first half of 2009.
The Group have, inter alia, also reviewed in detail and revised where appropriate the previous assumptions for costs and other risks.
This has resulted in further land and work in progress net write downs of 527.0m 31 December 2008: 1,012.8m to the lower of cost and net realisable value in the first half of 2009.
During the year the Group reversed 29.8m of write downs 2008: 59.0m where managements estimates of the recoverable value for certain land and work in progress had improved.
This reversal is treated as exceptional income and netted off the exceptional charge.
Restructuring costs of 8.9m 31 December 2008: 35.1m are predominantly in relation to the ongoing rationalisation of the UK business.
The costs incurred in both years include redundancy costs and costs incurred in relocating certain functions and operations.
Refinancing costs of 44.8m 31 December 2008: 20.5 were predominantly exceptional fees in relation to the refinancing of the Groups debt.
Additional refinancing interest related costs of 23.1m 31 December 2008: 10.5m are included within exceptional finance costs in the Income Statement.
