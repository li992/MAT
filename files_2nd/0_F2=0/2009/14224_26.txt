The effective tax charge for the Group on profit before tax before the amortisation of intangibles, impairment charges, restructuring costs and gains and losses on derivative financial instruments of 60.6m is 29.7% 2008: 29.3%, which comprises a charge of 33.0% 2008: 30.3% in respect of current year profits and a tax credit of 3.3% 2008: 1.0% in respect of prior years.
The following factors that will affect the Groups future total tax charge as a percentage of underlying profits are: the mix of profits between the UK and overseas: in particular, France Germany Belgium corporate tax rates greater than 28% and Ireland Poland Netherlands Czech Republic Slovakia corporate tax rates less than 28%.
If the proportion of profits from these jurisdictions changes, this could result in a higher or lower group tax charge: the impact of non-deductible expenditure and non-taxable income: agreement of open tax computations with the respective tax authorities: and the recognition or utilisation with corresponding reduction in cash tax payments of unrecognised deferred tax assets see note 21. in addition to the amounts charged to the consolidated income statement, the following amounts in relation to taxes have been charged credited directly to equity and are shown in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of changes in equity: 2009 2008 m m deferred tax movement associated with actuarial loss 1.3 3.0 current and deferred tax on share options 0.7 Tax charge credit on exchange difference arising on borrowings and derivative financial instruments 5.5 13.8 4.2 16.1 1 SHI ar09 back.

the effect of this is to increase the weighted average number of shares for the reported prior period, with a resulting reduction in the reported basic and diluted eps for the year ended 31 december 2008.

The Group recognised a total credit of 0.5m 2008: charge of 1.0m in the year relating to equity-settled share-based payment transactions issued after 7 november 2002 with a corresponding entry to the share option reserve.
the current year credit arose as charges made in previous years were reversed following an assessment of the number of shares expected to vest on share options granted in previous years.
the weighted average fair value of each option granted in the year was 134p 2008: 418p.
details of each of the schemes are provided below.
Following the placing and open offer and firm placing of 455,047,973 ordinary shares announced on 18 March 2009, the Group decided to issue additional share options under the saye, esos, ltip and dabs schemes to eliminate the dilutive effect that the increase in share capital would have on the value of outstanding share options.
As the additional options have merely preserved the original benefit of the share options, no further charge has been made in accordance with ifrs 2 share-based payment.
A SAVE AS YOU EARN SAYE SChEME The Company operates a SAYE scheme within the UK which is open to all UK employees and is linked to a monthly savings contract over three and five year periods.
Options have been granted to scheme participants at 80% of the prevailing market price.
The market price is taken approximately one month prior to the official grant date.
Similar arrangements have existed since 17 May 2002 in Ireland.
There are no performance conditions attached to the exercise of these options.
These options may be exercised within a fixed six month period, three or five years from the date of grant.
no saye options have been granted in the uk in 2009 or 2008. instead, the company has issued share options in 2009 and 2008 under a share investment plan sip as approved at the 2004 annual general meeting see page 87. whilst no saye share options were granted in the year, following the groups equity raise in 2009, additional saye options were granted to existing members of the scheme in proportion to the bonus element of the placing and open offer and firm placing of 14 April 2009.

E ShARE INCENTIVE PLAN SIP Shares were granted under the SIP scheme for the first time in 2005.
The SIP is a HM Revenue and Customs approved scheme and operates by inviting participants, including Executive Directors, to purchase shares in the Company in a tax efficient manner on a monthly basis.
For each share purchased by the employee, the Company will match one free share up to a maximum of four free shares per month.
no performance criteria is attached to these matching shares other than to avoid forfeiture they must remain within the plan for a minimum of two years.
in 2009, 64,122 2008: 69,702 matching shares were granted during the year.
given the nature of the scheme, the fair value of the matching shares equates to the cost of the company acquiring these shares.
Included within additions are net additions in relation to hire stock of 2.2m 2008: 4.4m.
impairment charges of 6.8m 2008: nil represent the write down of certain assets following the groups cost saving and restructuring programme.
these assets have been considered surplus to current requirements and have been written down to their fair value less costs to sell based upon guidance received from third parties.
as a result, the impairment charge of 6.8m has been included within operating expenses in the other items column in the consolidated income statement.

the group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
the recoverable amounts of the cgus are determined from value in use calculations.
the key assumptions for these value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs.
The Directors estimate discount rates using pre tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the individual CGU.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts using the following years operating budget approved by the Directors and an appropriate projection of cash flows based upon industry expectations over a period of five years.
In instances where significant investment is expected, a rate in excess of the industry growth is used in the five year forecast.
After this period, the growth rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are no more than 2% and do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the industry or economy.
The discount rates applied to all impairment reviews represent pre tax rates and range between 11% and 13%.
During the year SIGs Irish business has continued to experience a significant reduction in demand for its products.
The resulting value in use calculation for the Ireland cgu indicated that the carrying value of goodwill was not supportable, therefore the cgu has been further reduced to its recoverable amount through the recognition of an impairment charge as follows: m at 31 december 2008 40.7 adjustments in respect of prior period acquisitions 0.2 exchange difference 5.4 impairment charge recognised 30.0 At 31 December 2009 5.1 1 SHI ar09 back.

in the event that turnover is lower than that forecast in the impairment reviews, a number of the cgus may be at risk of impairment.
In addition, the Group has an indefinite life intangible asset Leaderflush Shapland brand of 12.6m.
Further details of impairment reviews performed on this asset are provided in note 12.
12 INTANGIBLE ASSETS the intangible assets presented below relate entirely to acquired intangibles.
these arise as a result of applying ifrs 3 which requires the separate recognition of acquired intangibles from goodwill.
As detailed in the Statement of Significant Accounting Policies, the Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to acquisitions that took place before 1 January 2004.
During 2009 and 2008, the Group owned purchased intangible assets with an insignificant book value mainly software separable from any associated hardware and these have not been reclassified from property, plant and equipment on the grounds of materiality.

The weighted average amortisation period for each category of intangible asset is disclosed in the Statement of Significant Accounting Policies on page 72.
In the opinion of the Directors, the only intangible asset which has an indefinite useful life is the brand attributable to the acquisition of Leaderflush Shapland Limited.
The carrying value of the Leaderflush Shapland brand at the balance sheet date is 12.6m.
An indefinite useful life has been determined for the Leaderflush Shapland brand on the basis that it is expected to be maintained indefinitely and is expected to continue to drive value for the Group.
The recoverable value of the brand is based upon value in use calculations.
further information on value in use calculations is provided within note 11. the directors have used past experience in determining each of the key assumptions in the value in use calculation for the Leaderflush Shapland brand.
The growth rates assumed are in line with industry expectations and, for periods beyond those covered by its management forecasts, do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the industry.
the discount rate applied is 11%, equivalent to its pre tax weighted average cost of capital.

the concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
the directors therefore believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
included in the allowance for doubtful debts are trade receivables with a gross balance of 57.0m 2008: 64.8m and a provision for impairment of 35.0m 2008: 34.1m.
The impairment represents the difference between the carrying amount of the specific trade receivable and the present value of the expected recoverable amount.
the directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.

Trade receivable credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are set, reviewed and approved by operational management on a regular basis.
trade receivables consist of a large number of typically small to medium sized customers, spread across a number of different market sectors and geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single customer.

Where the Group does not meet these rules, movements in the fair value will be recognised as gains and losses on derivative financial instruments in the consolidated income statement in the column entitled other items.
In order to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate and exchange rate changes, the Group utilises both currency and interest rate derivative financial instruments.
The fair values of these derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting the associated future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
The Group is required to analyse financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of the financial instruments below are categorised as Level 2.
A NET INvESTMENT hEDGES As at 31 December 2009, the Group had entered into two 2008: two cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instruments which form a net investment hedge of the groups euro denominated trade assets.

The cash flow hedges described below are expected to impact both profit and loss and cash flow annually over the life of the hedging instrument and the related debt as interest falls due and upon maturity of the debt and related hedging instrument.
As at 31 December 2009, the Group had entered into five 31 December 2008: five cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instruments which swap fixed US Dollar denominated debt held in the UK into fixed Sterling denominated debt.
In addition, as at 31 December 2009, the Group had entered into one 31 December 2008: one cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instrument which swaps fixed US Dollar denominated debt held in the UK into variable Sterling denominated debt.
These derivative financial instruments form a cash flow hedge as they fix the functional currency cash flows of the Group.
All of these derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income.
at 31 december 2009, the average maturity date of these swaps is 5.4 years 2008: 6.4 years.

Prior to settlement, all of these interest rate derivative financial instruments were designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value movement was therefore deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

These derivative financial instruments form a cash flow hedge as they fix the functional post tax cash flows of the Group and are therefore fully effective.
As these derivative financial instruments were entered into on 31 December 2008 at market rates prevailing at that date, the fair value of these derivative financial instruments at 31 December 2008 was nil.
At 31 December 2008, the average maturity date of these swaps was one year.

All of these interest rate derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as fair value hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
this is offset by the change in fair value attributable to the hedged item which is also recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.

19 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IFRS 7 requires the disclosure of a sensitivity analysis that details the effects on the Groups profit or loss and other equity of reasonably possible fluctuations in market rates.
This sensitivity analysis has been prepared to illustrate the effect of the following hypothetical variations in market rates on the fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities: i a 1% 100 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates: and ii a 10% strengthening or weakening of Sterling against all other currencies that the Group is exposed to.
A INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY the group is currently exposed to sterling, euro and us dollar interest rates.
to a lesser extent the group is also exposed to polish Zloty and czech koruna interest rates.
In order to illustrate the Groups sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, the table overleaf details the Groups sensitivity to a 100 basis point change in each respective interest rate.
the sensitivity analysis of the groups exposure to interest rate risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit or loss and other equity.

The last formal actuarial valuation of the SIG plc Retirement Benefits Plan, the UK scheme, was conducted at 31 December 2007 and showed that the market value of the schemes assets were 75.0m and their actuarial value covered 83% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
the other four schemes are book reserved schemes whereby the sponsoring company does not hold any separate assets to fund the pension scheme but makes a reserve in its accounts.
therefore, these schemes do not hold separate scheme assets.
the liabilities of the schemes are met by the sponsoring companies.
CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT ChArGES The pension charge for the year relating to the defined benefit pension schemes was 2.9m 2008: 1.7m.
In accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits, the charge for the defined benefit schemes has been calculated as the sum of the cost of benefits accruing in the year, the increase in the value of benefits already accrued and the expected return on assets.
The actuarial valuations described previously have been updated at 31 December 2009 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of ias 19. investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
The UK defined benefit scheme is closed to new members, has an age profile that is rising and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
the four overseas book reserved schemes remain open to new members.
