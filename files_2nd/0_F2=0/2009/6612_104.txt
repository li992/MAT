The Group operates in countries where the tax rate differs from the UK tax rate.
The impact of these overseas taxes on the overall rate of tax is shown above.
Profits arising from certain operations in Singapore are accorded special status and are taxed at reduced rates compared with the normal rates of tax in this territory.
The effect of this reduction in the taxation charge increased earnings per share by 2.8p in 2009, 2.8p in 2008 and 4.9p in 2007.
The Group is required under IFRS to create a deferred tax asset in respect of unrealised intercompany profit arising on inventory held by the Group at the year-end by applying the tax rate of the country in which the inventory is held rather than the tax rate of the country where the profit was originally made and the tax paid, which is the practice under UK and US GAAP.
As a result of this difference in accounting treatment the Group tax rate on current period intercompany profit under IFRS increased by 0.5% in 2009 2008 2.1% increase: 2007 0.8% decrease arising from changes in the location of work-in-progress and finished goods.
The integrated nature of the Groups worldwide operations, involving significant investment in research and strategic manufacture at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets, gives rise to complexity and delay in negotiations with revenue authorities as to the profits on which individual Group companies are liable to tax.
Resolution of such issues is a continuing fact of life for GSK.
GSK Annual Report 2009 116 Notes to the financial statements 14 Taxation continued Following its audit of the period 2001 to 2003, the IRS issued Statutory Notices of Deficiency to GSK asserting income and withholding tax deficiencies, and associated penalties, arising from the IRSs reclassification of an intercompany financing arrangement in those years from debt to equity, and its consequent recharacterisation of the amounts paid as dividends subject to withholding tax under the US UK treaty.
All amounts due under the financing arrangement were paid on a timely basis, with the final payment made in April 2008.
GSK disagreed with the IRSs position and, in August 2008, initiated actions in the United States Tax Court to contest the Statutory Notices of Deficiency.
On 19th November 2009, GSK and the IRS filed a Stipulation with the Tax Court in which the IRS conceded all asserted tax deficiencies and penalties arising from its reclassification of the above intercompany financing arrangement from debt to equity, resulting in no additional tax cost to GSK.
The IRS claim had previously been estimated at $864m for 2001-2003.
GSK and the IRS are now in the process of finalising the tax computations for the 2001 to 2003 tax years.
It is anticipated that resolution of the issue in the years 2004 to 2008 will be reflected in a closing agreement.
Resolution of the issue had no impact on the Groups results.
In Canada, GSK is continuing to contest a court decision in respect of transfer pricing in the early 1990s.
The date of the appeal hearing has been set for March 2010.
GSK continues to believe that it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from periods which are open and not yet agreed by tax authorities.
The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation where appropriate or by agreement with the relevant tax authorities.
No provision has been made for taxation which would arise on the distribution of profits retained by overseas subsidiaries, on the grounds that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The aggregate amount of these unremitted profits at the balance sheet date was approximately 29 billion 2008 28 billion.
The introduction of the UK dividend exemption on 1st July 2009, now enables the reasonable quantification of the incremental liability from repatriation of profits to the UK.
The deferred tax on unremitted earnings at 31st December 2009 is estimated to be approximately 500 million, which relates to taxes payable on repatriation and dividend withholding taxes levied by overseas tax jurisdictions.
