Group accounts 61 100 Babcock International Group PLC 65 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Notes to the Group financial statements 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historic cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are disclosed below: Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements comprise the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 March.
a Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
Acquisitions are included from the date of acquisition and the results of the businesses disposed of or terminated are included in the results for the year up to the date of relinquishing control or closure and analysed as continuing or discontinued operations.
b Joint ventures The Groups interest in jointly controlled entities are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recorded at cost.
The Groups investment in jointly controlled entities includes goodwill net of any accumulated impairment loss identified on acquisition.
The Groups share of its jointly controlled entities post-acquisition profits or losses after tax is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves.
The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.
Unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its jointly controlled entity are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the joint controlled entity.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: a Sale of goods Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and can be reliably measured and recovery of consideration is considered probable.
b Rendering of services Revenue from services rendered is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction.
The provision of services over a long-term period are accounted for under the principles of construction contracts, and the revenue recognised as set out below.
c Long-term service contracts Revenue from long-term service contracts, is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract.
The stage of completion is determined according to the nature of the specific contract concerned.
Methods used to assess the stage of completion include incurred costs as a proportion of total costs, labour hours incurred or earned value of work performed.
Profit attributable to the contract activity is recognised if the final outcome of such contracts can be reliably assessed.
An expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Exceptional items Items that are exceptional in size or nature, are presented as exceptional items within the consolidated income statement.
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
Events which may give rise to the classification of items as exceptional include gains or losses on the disposal of properties and businesses along with the restructuring of businesses and asset impairments.
Transactions with minorities The Group policy is to treat transactions with minorities as transactions with equity holders and therefore result in movements in reserves.
Babcock International Group PLC 66 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Goodwill and intangible assets a Goodwill When the fair value of the consideration for an acquired undertaking exceeds the fair value of its separable net assets, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill and is capitalised.
When the fair value of the consideration for an acquired undertaking is less than the fair value of its separable net assets, the difference is taken directly to the income statement.
Goodwill relating to acquisitions prior to 1 April 2004 is maintained at its net book value on the date of transition to IFRS.
From that date goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed at least annually for impairment.
b Acquired intangibles Intangible assets, which are capable of being recognised separately and measured reliably on acquisition of a business, are capitalised at fair value on acquisition.
These intangibles will include contracts and customer relationships.
Where these assets have a finite life, they are amortised over the period which they are expected to generate benefits, but generally not exceeding ten years.
Customer contracts and relationships valued on acquisition are expected to generate higher benefits in the early years following such acquisition as the existing contracts unwind.
c Research and development Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Costs incurred on development projects are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will be a success considering its commercial and technological feasibility, and only if the cost can be measured reliably.
Other development expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Development costs that have been capitalised are amortised from the date the product is available for use on a straight-line basis over the period of its expected benefit but not exceeding seven years.
d Computer software Computer software costs are amortised over their expected useful lives of between three and five years.
Property, plant and equipment PPE Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment, except for land, which is shown at cost less impairment.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost of PPE over the estimated useful lives to their estimated residual value reassessed at each balance sheet date at the following annual rates: Freehold land Nil Freehold property 2% to 8% Short leasehold property lease term Plant, machinery and motor vehicles 6.6% to 33.3% PPE are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the fixed asset may not be recoverable.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount exceeds the higher of an assets fair value less cost to sell or value in use.
Leases Assets under finance leases are capitalised and the outstanding capital element of instalments is included in borrowings.
The interest element is charged against profits so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the outstanding obligations.
Depreciation is calculated to write the assets off over their expected useful lives or over the lease terms where these are shorter.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement.
A provision is made where the operating leases are deemed to be onerous.
Inventory and work in progress Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on a first-in first-out method.
In the case of finished goods and work in progress, cost comprises direct material and labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Contract accounting The Group presents as an asset the gross amount due from customers for contract work for all contracts in progress for which costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses exceed progress billings.
The Group presents as a liability the gross amount due to customers for contract work for all contracts in progress for which progress billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses.
Pre-contract costs are recognised as expenses as incurred, except that directly attributable costs are recognised as an asset when it can be reliably expected that a contract will be obtained and the contract is expected to result in future net cash inflows.
Group accounts 61 100 Babcock International Group PLC 67 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Taxation a Current income tax Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
b Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group, and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Foreign currencies a Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the local currency at the year end exchange rates.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement except when deferred in equity as part of the net investment of a foreign operation.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the balance sheets and income statements of foreign operations into Sterling are recognised as a separate component of equity on consolidation.
Results of foreign subsidiary undertakings are translated using the average exchange rate for the month of the applicable results.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at period end exchange rates.
Finance costs Finance costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Babcock International Group PLC 68 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Employee benefits a Pension obligations The Group operates a number of pension schemes.
The schemes are generally funded through payments to trusteeadministered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations.
The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
The Groups current and past service cost and imputed interest on the defined benefit schemes obligations, net of the expected return on the schemes assets, are charged to operating profit within the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in equity through the Statement of recognised income and expense so that the Groups balance sheet reflects the fair value of the schemes surpluses or deficits at the balance sheet date.
b Share-based compensation The Group operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The economic cost of awarding shares and share options to employees is recognised as an expense in the income statement equivalent to the fair value of the benefit awarded.
The fair value is determined by reference to option pricing models.
The charge is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period of the award.
The shares purchased by the Groups ESOP trusts are recognised as a deduction to equity.
c Holiday pay Paid holidays are regarded as an employee benefit and as such are charged to the income statement as the benefits are earned.
Investments The accounting for investments is decided on a case by case basis depending on whether the investment is held for resale or other strategic reasons.
Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The Group designates certain of the derivative instruments within its portfolio to be hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or unrecognised firm commitments.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
For foreign exchange contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are deferred in equity until such time as the firm commitment is recognised, at which point any deferred gain or loss is included in the assets carrying amount.
These gains or losses are then realised through the income statement as the asset is sold.
Certain derivatives do not qualify or are not designated as hedging instruments and any movement in their fair values is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which they are approved.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The key areas of estimates and judgements for the Group are contract accounting see above, the accounting for defined benefit pension schemes see note 28, impairment of goodwill see note 13 and income tax recognition.
Profit recognition on contracts is a key judgement exercised by management on a contract by contract basis.
In order to make such a judgement an estimate of contract outturn is made and for all significant contracts both local management and Group review and challenge estimates made.
Fair value adjustments on acquisitions are by nature subject to critical judgements.
The size of recent acquisitions make them significant in Group terms.
The Group has disposed of a number of businesses in recent years.
There are a number of disputes arising from these disposals, which results in a provision for settlement, the quantum of which is a judgemental issue.

Babcock International Group PLC 70 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 2.
Financial risk management Financial risk management Financial instruments, in particular, forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps, are used to manage the financial risks arising from the business activities of the Group and the financing of those activities.
Interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a mixture of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate swaps, each being reviewed on a regular basis to ensure the appropriate mix is maintained.
Gearing and liquidity are managed to external and internal benchmarks.
The Groups main exposure to foreign currency fluctuations arise through its activities in South Africa where both translational and transactional exposure exist.
It is Group policy not to cover the effects of exchange rate fluctuation on translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries into the Groups functional currency, Sterling.
All material transactional exposures arising through trading in currencies other than the operations functional currency must be eliminated by the use of forward cover contracts as soon as they are known of.
All treasury transactions are carried out only with prime rated counterparties as are investments of cash and cash equivalents.
The Groups customers are mainly from government, government backed institutions or blue chip corporations and as such credit risk is considered small.
Foreign exchange risk The foreign exchange exposure of Group entities on the net monetary position against their respective functional currencies expressed in the Groups presentation currency is insignificant with the largest exposure being less than 0.2 million 2008: Sterling to Euro 1.6 million.
Consequently, the pre tax effect on profit and equity, increase or decrease, if the rates moved up or down by an appropriate percentage volatility, assuming all other variables remained constant would in total be less than 0.1 million 2008: 0.2 million.
The reasonable shifts in exchange rates are based on historic volatility and range from 15% for Sterling to Euro to 30% for South African Rand to Euro and 30% Sterling to US Dollars.
Interest rate risk The fair values of debt, and related hedging instruments are affected by movements in interest rates.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity in cash flow of interest rate-sensitive instruments to a hypothetical parallel shift of the forward interest rate curves of 50bp 2008: 50bp, with pre tax effect from the beginning of the year.
All other variables are held constant.

Financial risk management continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk management includes maintaining sufficient cash and the availability of funding from an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group treasury maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit lines.
The table below analyses the Groups liabilities that will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contract maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

The recoverable amount for all the cashgenerating units has been measured based on a value in use calculation derived from Board approved three year budgeted cash flows and extrapolated cash flows thereafter based on an estimated growth rate of 2% effectively zero real growth allowing for inflation.
A post-tax discount rate in the range 8% to 9% was grossed up for tax and used in the pre tax value in use calculation for the cash-generating units within each segment.
The Groups weighted average cost of capital is approximately 8.6% 2008: 8.5%.
The business with the least headroom 12.8 million in terms of impairment under the above assumptions is Rail where a 9.7% WACC or a 20% reduction in third year budgeted profits could result in an impairment.

It also acquired an additional interest of 26% in the joint venture company from WS Atkins plc for a net cash consideration of 1.2 million.
The resultant shareholding is 74% but due to the sharing of control with our partners it will be accounted for as a joint venture.
On 25 January 2007 the Group acquired a 24.5% holding in International Nuclear Solutions PLC for 9.7 million, including costs.
On 4 April 2007 the Group made an offer for the balance of the shares at 63p per share and on 9 July 2007 the Group had acquired 50.9% of the share capital and therefore reclassified the investment as an investment in subsidiary.

This is disclosed separately in the Groups balance sheet, as it cannot be offset against the net overall UK deferred tax liability of 0.2 million 2008: 31.2 million.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets because it is probable that these assets will be recovered.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2009 2008 m m Deferred tax asset 23.8 17.5 Deferred tax liability 24.0 48.7 0.2 31.2 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses excluding UK capital losses and advance corporation tax of 82.4 million 2008: 61.3 million available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 33.0 million 2008: 11.0 million of such losses, which may be carried forward indefinitely.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of the remaining 49.4 million 2008: 50.3 million due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 95 million 2008: 50 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

During the year the total charge relating to employee share-based payment plans was 1.9 million 2008: 1.4 million all of which related to equity settled share-based payment transactions.
After tax, the income statement charge was 1.4 million 2008: 1.0 million.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last one to three years.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
Babcock International Group PLC 92 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 27.
During the year the Company acquired 1,749,925 ordinary shares 2008: 1,342,845 through either the Babcock Employee Share Trust or the Peterhouse Employee Share Trust together the Trusts in respect of obligations under the Babcock 1999 Executive Share Option Schemes or the Babcock 2003 L-TIP.
During the year ended 31 March 2009 2,517,578 shares 2008: 3,179,286 shares were disposed by the Trusts resulting from options exercised.
At 31 March 2009, the Trusts held between them a total of 948,095 2008: 1,715,748 ordinary shares at a total market value of 4,072,068 2008: 9,805,500 representing 0.41% 2008: 0.75% of the issued share capital at that date.
The Company elected to pay dividends to the Babcock Employee Share Trust at the rate of 0.001p per share during the year, though full dividends were paid in respect of shares held by the Peterhouse Employee Share Trust.
All the Trusts shares are under option, the subject of L-TIP share awards to employees or represent a provision for future L-TIP vesting.
The Company meets the operating expenses of the Trusts.
The Trusts enable shares in the Company to be held or purchased and made available to employees through the grant and exercise of rights or awards under the Babcock 1999 Executive Share Option Schemes and the Babcock 2003 L-TIP.
The Trusts are discretionary settlements for the benefit of employees within the Group.
The Company is excluded from benefiting under them.
They are controlled and managed outside the UK and each has a single corporate trustee which is an independent trustee services organisation.
The right to remove and appoint the trustees rests ultimately with the Company.
The trustee of the Babcock Employee Share Trust is required to waive both voting rights and dividends payable on any share in the Company in excess of 0.001p, unless otherwise directed by the Company, but the trustee of the Peterhouse Employee Share Trust does not have the power to waive dividends due on Babcock ordinary shares and therefore receives the full amount of any dividends declared.

The contribution rate for the Devonport Royal Dockyard Pension Scheme is 20.5% of pensionable pay with additional payments of 5 million per annum to meet the funding deficit.
The contribution rate for the Rosyth Royal Dockyard Pension Scheme is 16.4% and the First Engineering Scheme is 20.1%.
The cash contributions forecast for next year are: the Devonport Royal Dockyard Pension Scheme 23.8 million, the Babcock International Group Pension Scheme 4.4 million, the Rosyth Royal Dockyard Pension Scheme 7.0 million and the First Engineering Scheme 3.2 million.

The Company made a contribution of 0.1 million during the year to 31 March 2009.
The plan was frozen as of 31 January 2003 and therefore, no active members existed as at 31 March 2009.
The HMNB Clyde contract includes a contract specific defined benefit pension scheme where all funding risk is borne by the customer and hence the costs are included within the defined contribution analysis above.
