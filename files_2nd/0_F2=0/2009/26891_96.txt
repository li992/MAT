The Merchants Trust PLC Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 January 2009 21.
Financial Risk Management Policies and Procedures The Company invests in equities and other investments in accordance with its investment objective as stated on page 2.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to certain inherent risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the net return available for distribution by way of dividends.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market risk price and yield, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors determine the objectives and agree policies for managing each of these risks, as set out below.
The Investment Manager, in close co-operation with the Directors, implements the Companys risk management policies.
These policies have remained substantially unchanged during the current and preceding year.
Market Risk The Investment Manager assesses exposure to market risk when making each investment decision, and monitors the risk on the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Market risk comprises market risk price and yield, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
i Market Price Risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
A schedule of the Companys listed holdings is shown on page 11.
Falls in stock market valuations lead to changes in gearing ratios.
The Boards procedure for monitoring the gearing of the Company is set out in Note 22 on page 50.
This takes into account the Investment Managers view on the market, covenant requirements and the future prospects of the Companys performance.
Market price risk sensitivity The value of the Companys listed equities i. e. fixed asset investments, excluding unlisted equities which were exposed to market price risk as at 31 January 2009 was as follows: 2009 2008 Listed equity investments held at fair value through profit or loss 411,768,166 608,423,542 The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return and the net assets to an increase or decrease of 20% 2008: 20% in the fair values of the Companys listed equities.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of market conditions in the year.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the impact of a change to the value of the Companys listed equity investments at each balance sheet date and the consequent impact on the investment management fees for the year, with all other variables held constant.
2009 2009 2008 2008 20% Increase 20% Decrease 20% Increase 20% Decrease in fair value in fair value in fair value in fair value Revenue return Investment management fees 100,883 100,883 149,064 149,064 Capital return Net gains losses on investments at fair value 82,353,633 82,353,633 121,684,708 121,684,708 Investment management fees 187,355 187,355 276,833 276,833 Change in net return and net assets 82,065,395 82,065,395 121,258,811 121,258,811 Management of market price risk The Directors meet regularly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio in order to minimise the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
A dedicated Investment Manager has the responsibility for monitoring the existing portfolio selection in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
ii Market Yield Risk Market yield risk arises from the uncertainty about the Companys ability to maintain its income objectives due to a systemic decline in corporate dividend levels.
46 The Merchants Trust PLC Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 January 2009 Management of market yield risk The Directors regularly review the current and projected yield of the investment portfolio, and discuss with the Investment Manager the extent to which it will enable the Company to meet its investment income objective.
iii Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the risk of the movement in the value of overseas financial instruments as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates.
Management of foreign currency risk The Company invests predominantly in UK listed equities and has no significant exposure to currencies other than sterling 2008 no significant exposure.
Any income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
iv Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk of movement in the value of financial instruments as a result of fluctuations in interest rates.
Interest Rate Exposure The table below summarises the financial assets and financial liabilities whose values are directly affected by changes in interest rates.
The fixed rate interest bearing liabilities bear the following coupon and effective rates as at 31 January 2009 and 31 January 2008.
Amount Effective Maturity borrowed Coupon rate since date Rate inception First Debenture Finance PLC FDF Loan Notes and Bonds 02 01 18 25,667,599 14.75% 11.28% Fintrust Debenture PLC Fintrust Original Loan 20 11 23 30,000,000 9.25125% 9.51% Fintrust Debenture PLC Fintrust New Loan 20 11 23 12,000,000 9.25125% 6.00% 5.875% Secured Bonds 2029 20 12 29 30,000,000 5.875% 6.23% 4% Perpetual Debenture Stock n a 1,375,000 4.00% 4.00% 3.65% Cumulative Preference Stock n a 1,178,000 3.65% 3.65% 100,220,599 The effective rates are calculated in accordance with FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement as detailed in the Statement of Accounting Policies.
The details in respect of the above loans have remained unchanged since the previous accounting period.
47 The Merchants Trust PLC Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 January 2009 The weighted average effective rate of the Companys fixed interest bearing liabilities excluding the 4% Perpetual Debenture Stock and the 3.65% Cumulative Preference Stock is 8.54% 2008 8.54% and the weighted average period to maturity of these liabilities is 15.2 years 2008 16.2 years.
The above year end amounts are reasonably representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure does not change materially.
Therefore the Companys net return and net assets, are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates.

Movement in interest rates will not have a material effect on the finance costs and financial liabilities of the Company as all the borrowings of the Company are subject to fixed rates of interest.
