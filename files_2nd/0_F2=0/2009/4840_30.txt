vi Net fair value remeasurement gains and losses on revaluation of financial instruments: Items excluded from underlying finance income and expense represent the gains and losses arising from the revaluation of derivative financial instruments under methodologies stipulated by IAS 39 compared with those on an accruals basis the basis upon which all other items in the financial statements is prepared.
Also included within this amount are remeasurement losses relating to put options predominantly held by minority shareholders.
Such a treatment is a form of revaluation gain or loss created by an assumption that the derivatives will be settled before their maturity.
Such gains and losses are unrealised and in the directors view also conflict with both the commercial reasons for entering into such arrangements as well as Group Treasury policy whereby early settlement in the majority of cases would amount to speculative use of derivatives.
vii As announced on 27 February 2009, the Group has been in dispute with HMRC regarding settlement of certain intra-group trading arrangements in the years 1997 to 2005 as well as certain other matters.
The Group reached an agreement in principle with HMRC regarding the settlement which was subsequently confirmed on 4 June 2009.
The settlement amount exceeded the provision already held in the balance sheet and as a result a non-underlying income tax charge of 52.7 million has been recorded.
The key elements of the agreement are such that a small proportion of the liability is not currently payable and the remainder has been offset against the income tax receivable which the Group held on its balance sheet such that no cash payment has been made in respect of this offset.
The amount has been treated as non-underlying owing to its one-off non-recurring nature.

The settlement amount exceeded the provision already held in the balance sheet and therefore a non-underlying income tax charge of 52.7 million has been recorded in current tax.
This charge is in addition to the tax effects applied to the net non-underlying charges before tax described in note 4 and has been treated as non-underlying owing to its one-off non-recurring nature.

The Group has provided deferred tax of 0.8 million 2007 08 0.4 million in relation to temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and the income tax consequences of paying dividends.
In all other cases, the Group has determined that the undistributed profits of its subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.
The deferred tax which has not been recognised for the taxes which would be payable on the undistributed earnings of the Groups investment in subsidiaries is 27.8 million 2007 08 27.3 million.
As a result of share disposals, allowable losses have been incurred which are available for offset against certain future chargeable gains.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses as it is considered that there is insufficient evidence that chargeable gains will arise.
The deferred tax asset not recognised, measured at the standard rate of 28%, is not less than 352.0 million 2007 08 351.3 million.
Where applicable, certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset for financial reporting purposes.

As required by IFRS 3, goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews.
These reviews are carried out using the following criteria.
An amount of goodwill is attributed to each specific acquisition.
Such acquisitions are determined to be a cash generating unit CGU as determined by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined based on calculating its value in use.
The value in use is calculated by applying discounted cash flow modelling to managements own projections covering a five year period.
Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using a long term growth rate equivalent to the relevant markets Gross Domestic Product GDP.
The value in use is compared to the carrying amount in order to determine whether impairment has occurred.
The impairment charge in the current year relates to Markantalo 2007 08 predominantly UniEuro and Markantalo and arises as a result of the closure of this business which was announced on 31 March 2009.
The most significant components of goodwill relate to Elkjp Nordic AS Elkjp, UniEuro S. p. A. UniEuro and PIXmania S. A. S. PIXmania, formerly FotoVista S. A.
In addition to managements five year projections, the key assumptions used in calculating value in use as well as the carrying values are: 2009 2008 Key assumptions for 2009 Key assumptions for 2008 Growth rate Pre-tax risk Carrying Growth rate Pre-tax risk Carrying beyond adjusted value beyond adjusted value five years discount rate million five years discount rate million Elkjp 3.0% 11.0% 610.8 2.5% 11.4% 585.5 UniEuro 1.2% 12.3% 147.3 1.2% 12.7% 129.0 PIXmania 2.1% 13.2% 185.6 2.3% 13.7% 162.5 The growth rate beyond five years is based on GDP for the territories in which these businesses operate.
The discount rates applied to cash flows are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital with a risk premium reflecting the relative risks in the markets in which the businesses operate.
The five year projections, which have been approved by management, have been prepared using strategic plans which incorporate the relative performance of competitors and knowledge of the current market together with managements views on the future achievable growth in market share, impact of the Renewal and Transformation plan and profitability over the longer term.
In forming these views, management draws on past experience as a measure to forecast future performance.
Key assumptions used in determining the forecasts comprise sales, costs and margins.
Historical amounts for both the businesses under impairment review as well as from other parts of the Group are used to generate the values attributed to these assumptions.
Achievable growth in market share takes into account the anticipated success of store offerings versus competitors as well as internal and external competitor intelligence.
Sensitivities A sensitivity analysis had been performed on the base case assumptions used for assessing the goodwill.
The directors have concluded that in the case of Elkjp there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which would cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed its value in use.
In the case of UniEuro and PIXmania, it is reasonably possible that a change in key assumptions could occur over the course of the next financial period.
DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 09 87 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 9 Goodwill continued UniEuro In respect of managements five year projections, a decrease of 5% in the compound annual growth rate in pre-tax profits over this five year period would cause the current headroom of 5.6 million to erode by 2.3 million.
A decrease in the growth rate beyond five years of 0.1% and an increase in the pre-tax adjusted discount rate of 0.1% would cause the headroom to erode by 1.5 million and 2.1 million, respectively.
PIXmania In respect of managements five year projections, a 1% decrease in compound annual growth rate in pre-tax profits over this five year period would cause the current headroom of 46.7 million to erode by 7.5 million.
A decrease in the growth rate beyond five years of 0.1% and an increase in the pre-tax adjusted discount rate of 0.1% would cause the headroom to erode by 2.1 million and 3.3 million, respectively.

The principal scheme which operates in the UK includes a funded defined benefit section whose assets are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme is valued by a qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed in accordance with the actuarys advice so as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members.
Since 1 September 2002, the defined benefit section of the scheme has been closed to new entrants.
Membership of the defined contribution section is offered to eligible employees.
In the Nordic region, the Group operates two funded secured defined benefit pension schemes with assets held by a life insurance company as well as an unsecured pension arrangement.
In addition, contributions are made to a state pension scheme.
The net movement in the obligation comprises a charge to operating profit of 0.9 million 2007 08 0.8 million with the remaining movements relating to the benefits paid in the period, actuarial gains losses and currency retranslation.
In other territories, the Group also provides other post-employment benefits which are largely governed by statute, in particular in Italy and Greece.

94 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 09 Business Overview Performance Review Strategic Summary Corporate Governance Financial Statements Information for Shareholders b UK defined benefit pension scheme actuarial valuation and assumptions A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was last carried out as at 5 April 2007 using the projected unit method and has been used to determine the level of funding to the scheme.
The Groups contribution rate for the period ended 2 May 2009, agreed in consultation with the trustees actuaries, was 12.5% per annum of pensionable salaries 2007 08 12.6% with the reduction representing a change in the mix of contributions between different sections of the scheme.
The contribution rate for future periods is currently planned to remain at this level, however a recovery plan has been agreed with the trustee whereby the Company makes twice yearly contributions of 6.0 million which commenced in June 2008 and end in December 2012.
Since April 2007, the scheme has operated on a career average revalued earnings arrangement where benefits are earned for each year of pensionable service as opposed to being calculated with reference to salary near to date of retirement.
The principal actuarial assumptions as at 5 April 2007 used for determining costs and contributions were: Rate per annum Discount rate for accrued benefits pre retirement 6.6% post-retirement 5.2% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries up to April 2010 3.5% thereafter 4.5% Rate of increase to pensions Guaranteed Minimum Pension 3.0% pension in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pension 2.5-3.75% Inflation 3.0% Expected return on assets 6.5% At 5 April 2007, the market value of the schemes investments was 688 million and, based on the above assumptions, the value of the assets was sufficient to cover 92% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The value of liabilities exceeded assets by 61.0 million.
c UK defined benefit pension scheme IAS 19 The following summarises the components of net benefit expense recognised in the consolidated income statement, the funded status and amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet.
The methodologies set out in IAS 19 are different from those used by the scheme actuaries in determining funding arrangements.
i Principal assumptions adopted 2009 2008 Rates per annum Discount rate 6.7% 6.5% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries up to April 2010 3.8% 4.1% thereafter 4.3% 5.1% Rate of increase in pensions in payment deferred pensions 3.3% 3.6% Inflation 3.3% 3.6% The Group uses certain demographic assumptions when calculating scheme obligations which are those underlying the last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 5 April 2007.
In particular, post-retirement mortality has been assumed to follow the standard tables PA92 projected to calendar year 2008 in line with the medium cohort factors set out in CMI working paper 1: interim basis for adjusting the 92 series mortality projections for cohort effects, with an allowance for future mortality improvement in line with medium cohort projection factors.
Such tables represent an average expected longevity of 87 years for men and 89.9 years for women 3 May 2008 85.2 years for men and 88.3 years for women for those becoming 65 at the measurement date and an extra one year of longevity for both men and women becoming 65 in 15 years time.

Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and liabilities may have a material impact on the 2009 10 income statement and the balance sheet.
The main assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate.
The following table provides an estimate of the potential impacts of each of these variables.
Underlying profit before tax Net deficit 2009 2008 2009 2008 million million million million Positive negative effect Discount rate 0.25% increase 1.4 1.8 38.0 41.8 Inflation rate 0.25% increase 2.6 2.5 32.6 30.6 Mortality rate 1 year increase 1.3 2.2 14.5 25.8 The increase in scheme benefits provided to members on retirement is subject to an inflation cap.
e Other post-employment benefits IAS 19 The Group offers other post-employment benefits to employees in overseas locations.
At 2 May 2009 the net obligation in relation to these benefits was 12.3 million 3 May 2008 12.4 million.
The net movement in the obligation comprises a charge to operating profit of 4.7 million 3 May 2008 4.0 million with the remaining movements relating to the benefits paid in the period and currency retranslation.
22 Financial instruments a Financial risk management objectives and policies A statement of the financial risk management objectives and policies is contained in the Strategic Summary section of the Directors Report under the sub-section entitled Treasury risks and policies and forms part of these financial statements.
b Fair values of financial assets and liabilities For receivables and payables classified as financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 32, fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
These values are shown in notes 14 and 19, respectively.
The categories of financial assets and liabilities and their related accounting policy are set out in notes 1.11 and 1.15.
For those financial assets and liabilities which bear either a floating rate of interest or no interest, fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
These values are shown in note 22 d. The fair value of the Bonds is 216.1 million 3 May 2008 262.9 million.
The Bonds are carried at amortised cost, plus a fair value adjustment, as a result of the fair value hedge discussed below.
Excluded from the fair value is 8.4 million 3 May 2008 8.6 million of accrued interest which is included in trade and other payables.

The Groups interest rate swaps have a nominal value of 300 million, receive fixed interest rates of 6.125% 2007 08 6.125% and pay floating rates of LIBOR plus a margin which ranged from 3.04% to 7.13% 2007 08 6.52% to 7.37%.
Currency swaps with a nominal value of 250 million receive LIBOR plus a margin and pay EURIBOR plus a margin.
Other swaps exchanged Norwegian krone and sterling at fixed interest rates of 5.06% and 5.67% 2007 08 3.46% and 5.99%.
c Hedging activities The Group manages exposures that arise on purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies by entering predominantly into forward foreign exchange currency contracts.
It also uses swaps and options to manage its interest rate and foreign exchange translation exposure.
The Group designates financial instruments as hedges under IAS 39 as follows: Cash flow hedges At 2 May 2009 the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts in place with a notional value of 72.7 million 3 May 2008 351.5 million that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges.
These contracts are expected to cover exposures ranging from one month to one year.
The fair value of these currency derivatives, which have been deferred in equity amounts to a 0.2 million gain 2007 08 1.5 million loss.
In respect of contracts which matured during the period, gains of 27.4 million and gains of 13.4 million have been transferred out of equity into inventory and out of equity into operating profit, respectively 2007 08 gains of 11.5 million and losses of 6.4 million, respectively.
Hedge ineffectiveness of 3.0 million gain was recorded in the income statement 2007 08 nil.
Fair value hedges At 2 May 2009 and 3 May 2008 the Group had interest rate swaps in place for the 6.125% Guaranteed Bonds with a notional amount of 300 million whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of 6.125%.
Of this, 250 million 390 million notional value has been swapped into floating rate euro borrowings bearing interest based on EURIBOR and the remaining 50 million into floating rate borrowings bearing interest based on LIBOR.
The swaps are used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of the Bonds and have the same critical terms.
The fair value of interest rate swaps entered into as fair value hedges is an asset of 30.3 million 3 May 2008 a liability of 0.1 million.
A fair value loss on the interest rate swaps of 28.0 million 2007 08 loss of 5.6 million has been recognised in the income statement and offset by an equivalent fair value gain on the Bonds.
98 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 09 Business Overview Performance Review Strategic Summary Corporate Governance Financial Statements Information for Shareholders Hedge of net investments in foreign operations At 2 May 2009 the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps in place with a notional value of 374.0 million 3 May 2008 858.1 million which have been designated as a hedge of the net investments in foreign operations.
Gains and losses on the retranslation of these derivatives are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the foreign operations.
The fair value of currency derivatives entered into as net investment hedges is a 128.1 million loss 2007 08 104.9 million loss.
No hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in the income statement 2007 08 nil.
d Interest rate profile of financial assets and financial liabilities by currency The following table sets out the interest rate exposure of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group.
The financial instruments not included in the table are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
2009 Other Sterling Euro US dollar currencies Total million million million million million Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments: Floating rate 36.8 75.8 0.4 17.8 95.2 Fixed rate 82.2 22.3 1.9 106.4 119.0 98.1 0.4 15.9 201.6 Borrowings: Floating rate 303.7 269.4 4.3 577.4 Obligations under finance leases: Fixed rate 98.9 2.8 101.7 402.6 272.2 4.3 679.1 Net borrowings funds 283.6 174.1 0.4 20.2 477.5 2008 Other Sterling Euro US dollar currencies Total million million million million million Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments: Floating rate 140.8 84.3 61.3 29.2 315.6 Fixed rate 75.3 55.2 1.7 132.2 216.1 139.5 61.3 30.9 447.8 Borrowings: Floating rate 49.1 247.3 0.5 296.9 Obligations under finance leases: Fixed rate 99.3 1.5 100.8 148.4 248.8 0.5 397.7 Net funds borrowings 67.7 109.3 61.3 30.4 50.1 Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Fixed rate cash and short term investments are predominantly money market deposits as shown in note 16.
Floating rate borrowings include fixed rate bonds after taking into account the effect of interest rates swaps entered into by the Group.
Bonds with a nominal value of 50 million bear interest at rates based on LIBOR.
Bonds with a nominal value of 250 million 390 million bear interest at rates based on EURIBOR.
The latter provide a hedge against certain euro denominated fixed asset investments and to finance working capital.
The other major component of floating rate borrowings are drawings under the 400 million sterling committed facility as shown in note 17.
Amounts in respect of other currencies for cash and cash equivalents and short term investments relate to funds held within subsidiary companies, operating in the Nordic region and Central Europe.
The negative balance as at 2 May 2009 has arisen in a multi-currency pooled facility and is offset by positive euro balances.
DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 09 99 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 22 Financial instruments continued e Sensitivity analysis The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, shows the sensitivity of profit before tax and total equity to changes in specified market variables on monetary assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments as listed below.
As a consequence, the sensitivity reflects the position as at 2 May 2009 and 3 May 2008 and is not necessarily representative of actual or future outcomes.
Changes in exchange rates affect the Groups profit before tax due to changes in the value of monetary assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments.
Changes in exchange rates affect the Groups total equity due to changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and net investment hedges.
The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the Groups key currencies of US dollar and euro, with other variables held constant.
A 10% decrease would have an equal and opposite effect.
2009 2008 Effect on underlying Effect on underlying profit before tax Effect on total equity profit before tax Effect on total equity decrease increase decrease increase decrease increase decrease million million million million Change in exchange rates: US dollar 10% 0.2 3.8 0.4 14.8 Euro 10% 2.1 37.5 1.2 41.5 Changes in interest rates affect the Groups profit before tax, mainly due to the impact of floating rate borrowings, cash and derivative financial instruments.
The Groups principal floating rate interest rate exposures are based on LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The table below shows the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates uniform across all currencies, with other variables held constant.
A 1% increase in interest rates would decrease profit before tax by 7.2 million and have nil impact on equity 2007 08 a 1.8 million decrease in profit before tax and a 0.5 million increase in equity.
A 1% decrease would have an equal and opposite effect.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the balance of borrowings, investments and the derivative portfolio are all held constant for the whole year: all net investment, fair value and cash flow hedges are assumed to be highly effective: the effect of changes in interest rates on fixed rate bonds is calculated after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps.
In combination these financial instruments are floating in nature: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges arising from movements in interest rates are recorded in the income statement.
The impact of movements in exchange rates is recorded directly in equity: and changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments that are not in hedging relationships arising from movements in interest rates and exchange rates only affect the income statement to the extent that they are not offset by changes in an underlying transaction.
f Liquidity risk The table below analyses the Groups contractual undiscounted cash flows payable under financial liabilities excluding finance lease liabilities, which are shown in note 18 and derivative assets and liabilities into their maturity groupings.
The table includes both principal and interest flows.

Over the course of 2008 09, the current difficult consumer and retail environment has placed significant pressure on the Groups revenue, profits, cash flows and overall liquidity.
This, together with the cost of restructuring the Group, higher finance costs and pressures on working capital due to structural changes to the credit environment, has contributed to an increase in the Groups indebtedness.
The continued uncertainty over the economic outlook has made it necessary for the Group to take steps to improve the capital structure of the Group to sustain the business through the current economic cycle.
For these reasons, on 30 April 2009 and as described in note 35, the Group announced a Placing and Rights Issue to raise gross proceeds of 310.6 million as well as agreeing with its lending banks to amend terms of the Facility and Letter of Credit Facility Agreements.
The key elements of the revised terms of the Facility are described further in note 17.
The Placing and Rights Issue completed on 9 June 2009 and its proceeds have significantly improved the Groups liquidity position since 2 May 2009.
In conjunction with applying the Groups policies in relation to liquidity risk as referred to in note 22 a the directors believe that these amendments will provide it with significant covenant and liquidity headroom under these facilities for the foreseeable future.
Included in note 17 are details of committed facilities, which are also maintained and used if available on advantageous terms.
g Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is discussed in the Directors Report.

Details of the LTIP and PSP are given in the Remuneration Report in section b ii and for the Reward Shares in section b iii.
Movements in the number of shares held by the Trusts is shown in the table below.
The Companys aim is to hedge its obligations under the above plans by buying shares through the Trusts to meet the anticipated future liability.
The anticipated liability is regularly reassessed during the relevant performance period and additional shares are purchased when required to meet an increase in this liability.
The costs of funding and administering the Trusts are charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.

The ESOS and ESOP permit making awards with a market value on the date of grant of not more than twice the recipients salary.
Options are also granted to other employees in the UK and overseas on the basis of management grade.
Vesting of options is based upon remaining in service with the Group over a three year period subject to certain conditions for Good Leavers.
Depending on grade, vesting is also dependent on the level of growth in underlying diluted earnings per share EPS over a three year period, with the ability to exercise the options up to seven years after the vesting date.
Save As You Earn SAYE The Group offers to all of its UK and Irish employees having completed the relevant period of service, share-based savings plans whereby amounts may be contributed up to a specified limit per plan and per employee.
Three year and five year plans have been offered annually, with exercise prices set at a 20% discount to the market share price on the date of grant.
