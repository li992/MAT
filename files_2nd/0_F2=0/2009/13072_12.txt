The Committee considers the business principally from a geographical perspective, but with the Pharmaceuticals business RBP being managed separately given the significantly different nature of the business and the different risks and rewards associated with it.
The geographical segments, being Europe, NAA and Developing Markets, derive their revenue primarily from the manufacture and sale of branded products in household cleaning and health & personal care, whilst RBP derives its revenue exclusively from the sales of buprenorphine-based prescription drugs used to treat opiate dependence.
The Executive Committee assesses the performance of the operating segments based on net revenue and adjusted operating profit.
This measurement basis excludes the effects of exceptional items.
Inter-segment revenues are charged according to internally agreed pricing terms that are designed to be equivalent to an arms length basis, and have been consistently applied throughout 2008 and 2009.
Reportable Segments The segment information provided to the Executive Committee for the reportable segments for the year ended 31 December 2009 is as follows: Developing Europe NAA Markets RBP Elimination Total 2009 m m m m m m Total gross segment net revenues 3,622 2,160 1,499 588 116 7,753 Inter-segment revenues 111 5 116 Net revenues 3,511 2,160 1,494 588 7,753 Depreciation and amortisation 74 29 16 7 126 Operating profit adjusted 804 500 216 371 1,891 Exceptional items Operating profit 804 500 216 371 1,891 Net finance income 1 Profit before tax 1,892 Developing Europe NAA Markets RBP Elimination Total 2008 m m m m m m Total gross segment net revenues 3,350 1,766 1,192 341 86 6,563 Inter-segment revenues 81 5 86 Net revenues 3,269 1,766 1,187 341 6,563 Depreciation and amortisation 63 21 13 7 4 108 Operating profit adjusted 782 397 163 193 1,535 Exceptional items 30 30 Operating profit 782 367 163 193 1,505 Net finance expense 31 Profit before tax 1,474 Adjusted to exclude the impact of exceptional items.
The profits arising on inter-segment sales are insignificant.
There are no reconciling items between net revenues and operating profit shown above and those shown in the income statement.
The split of assets and liabilities by segment provided to the Executive Committee is as follows: Developing Europe NAA Markets RBP Total 2009 m m m m m Inventories 243 129 122 47 541 Trade and other receivables 477 171 244 57 949 Total segment assets 720 300 366 104 1,490 Trade and other payables 1,074 478 425 142 2,119 Developing Europe NAA Markets RBP Total 2008 m m m m m Inventories 294 148 122 35 599 Trade and other receivables 507 191 207 44 949 Total segment assets 801 339 329 79 1,548 Trade and other payables 1,153 419 363 87 2,022 34 Reckitt Benckiser 2009 2 OPERATING SEGMENTS CONTINUED The assets and liabilities are allocated based upon the operations of the segment and the physical location of the asset or liability.
There are a number of unallocated assets and liabilities that comprise corporate items that are not specifically attributable to one segment.
Reconciliation of these assets and liabilities to total assets or liabilities in the balance sheet is shown below: 2009 2008 m m Inventories for reportable segments 541 599 Unallocated: Elimination of profit on inter-company inventory 55 43 Total inventories per the balance sheet 486 556 Trade and other receivables for reportable segments 949 949 Unallocated: Corporate items 21 43 Total trade and other receivables per the balance sheet 928 906 Total inventories and trade and other receivables per the balance sheet 1,414 1,462 Other unallocated assets 7,247 7,720 Total assets per the balance sheet 8,661 9,182 Trade and other payables for reportable segments 2,119 2,022 Unallocated: Corporate items 167 167 Total trade and other payables per the balance sheet 2,286 2,189 Other unallocated liabilities 2,361 3,699 Total liabilities per the balance sheet 4,647 5,888 Unallocated assets include goodwill and intangible assets, property plant and equipment and cash and cash equivalents, while unallocated liabilities include borrowings and deferred tax liabilities.
Analysis of product groups The Group analyses its revenue by the following product groups: Fabric Care, Surface Care, Dishwashing, Home Care, Health & Personal Care, making up core business, together with Other Household, Pharmaceuticals and Food.
Net revenues 2009 2008 m m Fabric Care 1,578 1,473 Surface Care 1,290 1,112 Dishwashing 843 754 Home Care 1,036 908 Health & Personal Care 2,078 1,682 Core Business 6,825 5,929 Other Household 65 67 Household Health & Personal Care 6,890 5,996 Pharmaceuticals 588 341 Food 275 226 Total 7,753 6,563 The majority of the categories above are split across the three geographical segments being Europe, NAA and Developing Markets.
The notable exceptions to this are: Food, which is sold exclusively in NAA and Pharmaceuticals which is within its own reportable segment.
Reckitt Benckiser 2009 35 Notes to the accounts continued 2 OPERATING SEGMENTS CONTINUED The entity is domiciled in the UK.
The split of revenue from external customers and non-current assets other than financial instruments, deferred tax assets and post-employment benefit assets between the UK, the US being the single biggest country outside the Country of Domicile and that from all other countries is: All other UK US countries Total 2009 m m m m Net revenues 625 2,150 4,978 7,753 Goodwill and other intangible assets 1,079 2,816 2,195 6,090 Property, plant and equipment 137 125 377 639 Other receivables 4 4 The other receivables of 4m are included, along with the post-employment benefit asset of 22m, within the other receivables of 25m in the balance sheet.

The net revenue from external customers reported on a geographical basis above is measured in a manner consistent with that in the reportable segments.
Major customers are typically large grocery chains, mass market and multiple retailers.
The Companys customer base is diverse with no single external customer accounting for more than 10% of net revenues, and the top ten customers only accounting for between a quarter and a third of total net revenues.

c Share based remuneration All outstanding share awards as at 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008 are included in the tables below which analyse the charge for 2009 and 2008.
The Group has used the Black-Scholes pricing model to calculate the fair value of one award on the date of the grant of the award.
Options outstanding at 31 December 2009 that could have been exercised at that date were 3,152,108 2008: 6,717,487.
Notes Scope: Executive Share Awards Share Options and Restricted Shares are awarded to the Top 400 Management Group.
Other Share Awards represent SAYE Schemes offered to all staff within the relevant geographic area and a number of Senior Executive Share Ownership Policy Plan SOPP awards.
Individual tranches of these awards are not material for detailed disclosure and therefore have been aggregated in the table above.
Contractual Life: Executive Share Awards have a contractual life of ten years but vest according to EPS growth criteria over a three-year period.
Accordingly, the cost is spread over the three years of the performance period.
Other share awards have contractual lives of either three, five or seven years.
Performance criteria: Executive Share Awards are subject to performance criteria based on compound average annual growth CAAG rates in earnings per share over the performance period.
Other Share Awards are generally not subject to any criteria other than the employees continued employment.
Executive Share Awards included in the above table vest as follows: CAAG of 6%: 40% of awards vest: 7% CAAG: 60%: 8% CAAG: 80%: 9% CAAG: 100%.
The assumptions made within the valuation calculation with respect to the achievement of performance criteria are based on the Directors expectations in light of the Groups business model and relevant published targets.
Under the terms of the Plans, early exercise is not permitted and therefore the effect of early exercise is not incorporated into the calculation.
The calculation also assumes that there will be no leavers in the following year.
No material modifications have been made to the Plans in 2008 or 2009 for the purposes of the valuation.
Volatility: An estimate of future volatility is made with reference to historical volatility over a similar time period to the performance period or the contractual life as appropriate.
Historical volatility is calculated based on the annualised standard deviation of the Groups daily share price movement, being an approximation to the continuously compounded rate of return on the share.
Income statement charge: the income statement charge may not exactly equal one third of the total fair value included in the table above due to adjustments for in-year lapses or award revisions.
National Insurance contributions are payable in respect of certain share based payments transactions and are treated as cash-settled transactions.
At 31 December 2009, the carrying amount of National Insurance contributions payable was 26m 2008: 17m of which 13m 2008: 8m was in respect of vested grants.
Any additional terms of these shares are shown in the Directors Remuneration report on pages 19 to 24.
The weighted average share price for the year was 28.37 2008: 27.15.
Reckitt Benckiser 2009 39 Notes to the accounts continued 5 EMPLOYEES CONTINUED d Pension and other post-retirement commitments The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees, which are principally funded.
The Groups two most significant defined benefit pension schemes UK and US are both funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The Group also operates a number of other post-retirement schemes in certain countries.
The major scheme is in the US US retiree health care scheme, where salaried participants become eligible for retiree health care benefits after they reach a combined age and years of service rendered figure of 70, although the age must be a minimum of 55.
As at 31 December 2009 there were 2,616 2008: 2,655 eligible retirees and 1,758 2008: 1,682 current employees potentially eligible.
Pension costs for the year are as follows: 2009 2008 m m Defined contribution schemes 24 19 Defined benefit schemes net charge 28 15 Total pension costs recognised in the income statement note 3 52 34 For the UK scheme, a full independent actuarial valuation was carried out at 5 April 2007 and updated at 31 December 2009.
For the US scheme, a full independent actuarial valuation was carried out at 1 January 2009 and updated at 31 December 2009.
The projected unit valuation method was used for the UK and US scheme valuations.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries for the three major schemes as at 31 December 2009 were: 2009 2008 US US US US UK pension medical UK pension medical % % % % % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.6 4.5 3.6 4.5 Rate of increase in deferred pensions during deferment 3.6 2.6 Rate of increase in pension payments pensioners 3.6 2.8 Rate of increase in pension payments non-pensioners 3.6 2.6 Discount rate 5.7 5.6-5.7 6.0 6.5 5.7 5.7 Inflation assumption 3.6 3.0 2.6 3.0 Annual medical cost inflation 5.0-9.0 5.0-9.0 Long-term expected rate of return on: Equities 8.1 9.3 7.7 9.5 Bonds 5.1 5.7 4.7 5.7 Other 6.3 8.0 5.8 6.7 The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set in accordance with published statistics and experience in each territory.
For the UK scheme the mortality assumptions were based on the following tables: the average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at aged 60 on the balance sheet date is as follows: 2009 2008 Male 26.2 25.6 Female 28.8 28.0 The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at aged 60, 20 years after the balance sheet date is as follows: 2009 2008 Male 28.4 26.9 Female 30.8 29.1 For the US scheme the mortality assumptions were determined using the RP2000 combined table.
The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 60 on the balance sheet date is 22.6 years 2008: 22.4 years for males and 24.8 years 2008: 24.7 years for females.

Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
The Company has two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares: Executive Options and Employee Sharesave schemes.
The options only dilute earnings when they result in the issue of shares at a value below the market price of the share and when all performance criteria if applicable have been met.
As at 31 December 2009, there were 7.5m 2008: 4.7m of Executive Options not included within the dilution because the exercise price for the options was greater than the average share price for the year.
The reconciliation between net income and the weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of the diluted earnings per share is set out below: 2009 2008 Net Average Earnings Net Average Earnings income number of per share income number of per share m shares pence m shares pence Profit attributable to shareholders 1,418 712,995,914 198.9 1,120 710,569,582 157.6 Dilution for Executive Options outstanding and Executive Restricted Share Plan 14,342,618 12,491,457 Dilution for Employee Sharesave scheme options outstanding 834,338 1,047,123 On a diluted basis 1,418 728,172,870 194.7 1,120 724,108,162 154.7 Adjusted basis The reconciliation between net income and the weighted average number of shares used in the calculations of the diluted earnings per share is set out below: 2009 2008 Net Average Earnings Net Average Earnings income number of per share income number of per share m shares pence m shares pence Profit attributable to shareholders 1,418 712,995,914 198.9 1,143 710,569,582 160.9 Dilution for Executive Options outstanding and Executive Restricted Share Plan 14,342,618 12,491,457 Dilution for Employee Sharesave scheme options outstanding 834,338 1,047,123 On a diluted basis 1,418 728,172,870 194.7 1,143 724,108,162 157.8 adjusted to exclude exceptional items.

Other includes product registration, distribution rights and capitalised product development costs.
The majority of brands, all of goodwill and certain other intangibles are considered to have indefinite lives for the reasons noted in the Accounting Policies and accordingly are subject to an annual impairment review.
A number of small non-core brands are deemed to have a finite life and are amortised accordingly.

Value in use is calculated from cash flow projections based on historical operating results, short-term budgets, medium-term business plans five years and longer-term extrapolation.
The long-term extrapolations assume a growth rate of no more than the long-term inflation assumption for the relevant markets range of 1% 4% 2008: 2% 4%.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10% 2008: 12% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
A higher rate is used where appropriate to reflect specific risks associated with the relevant product group range of 10%18% 2008: 11%17%.
Key assumptions which are kept under constant review by management in the impairment review include future sales volumes, growth rates and prices, and future levels of marketing support required to sustain, grow and further innovate brands.
No reasonably possible change to a key assumption would cause any product groups recoverable amount to be less than its carrying value.

The credit risk of customers is assessed at a subsidiary and Group level, taking into account their financial positions, past experiences and other relevant factors.
Individual customer credit limits are imposed based on these factors.
As of 31 December 2009, trade receivables of 71m 2008: 51m were past due but not impaired.
The ageing analysis of trade receivables past due but not impaired is as follows: 2009 2008 m m Up to 3 months 71 51 The carrying amounts of the Groups trade and other receivables are denominated in the following currencies: 2009 2008 m m Sterling 36 20 Euro 322 352 US dollar 190 186 Other currencies 380 348 928 906 As at 31 December 2009, trade receivables of 23m 2008: 20m were considered to be impaired.
The amount of provision on 31 December 2009 was 22m 2008: 13m.
It was assessed that a portion of the receivables is expected to be recovered due to the nature and historical collection of trade receivables.
The ageing analysis of these receivables is as follows: 2009 2008 m m Up to 3 months 15 14 Over 3 months 8 6 23 20 The movement in the provision for impaired receivables consists of increases for additional provisions offset by receivables written off and unused provision released back to the income statement.
The gross movements in the provision are considered to be insignificant.
The other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
They consist of items including reclaimable turnover tax and other tax receivables, and are from a broad selection of countries within the Group.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the year end is the carrying value of each class of receivable mentioned above.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
48 Reckitt Benckiser 2009 14 AVAILABLE FOR SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS Current These investments do not meet the requirements to be classified as cash equivalents due to having maturities of greater than three months.
They are, however, highly liquid assets, consisting solely of short-term deposits.
All of these deposits are held with financial institutions with a BBB rating or above.
The effective interest rate on these short-term deposits is 4.48% 2008: 10.46% and they have an average maturity of 204 days 2008: 438 days from inception.
Non-current These investments are auction rate securities issued by US state authorities denominated in US dollars with redemption dates falling beyond 2010.
They are typically traded on a secondary market, however due to the current inactivity of this market there is uncertainty over whether they are likely to be redeemed within one year and therefore have been classified as non-current.
Although these investments are not directly guaranteed by the US Federal Government, the underlying assets are.
None of these investments are past due or impaired.
The market for auction rate securities is inactive and therefore management has adopted a discounted cash flow valuation technique to determine a fair value of the securities at 31 December 2009.
The movement in the fair value of auction rate securities is detailed below: 2009 2008 m m At 1 January 25 Acquisition fair value 35 Disposals 14 17 Fair value gains losses 8 8 Exchange adjustments 3 15 At 31 December 16 25 15 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 2009 2008 m m Cash at bank and in hand 145 213 Short-term bank deposits 206 204 Cash and cash equivalents 351 417 Due to foreign currency exchange restrictions 40m 2008: 50m of cash included in cash and cash equivalents is restricted for use by the Group.

The current element of deferred tax is considered to be within short term temporary differences and tax losses.
Certain deferred tax assets totalling 16m 2008: 47m in respect of overseas corporation tax losses and other temporary differences have not been recognised at 31 December 2009 as the likelihood of future economic benefit is not sufficiently assured.
These assets will be recognised if utilisation of the losses and other temporary differences becomes reasonably certain.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future based on the current repatriation policy of the Group.

22 RETAINED EARNINGS AND OTHER RESERVES Within all subsidiaries of the Group there were statutory, contractual or exchange control restrictions limiting the parent companys access to distributable profits of 3,026m 2008: 2,829m.
The reserves of subsidiary undertakings have generally been retained to finance their businesses.
There were 294m of Treasury shares at 1 January 2009.
131m were issued to satisfy Executive Share Options exercised.
163m of Treasury shares were carried forward at 31 December 2009.
Reserves The original merger reserve arose in 1999 following the combination of Reckitt & Colman plc and Benckiser N. V. to form Reckitt Benckiser plc.
This transaction was accounted for as a merger.
During the year ended 31 December 2007 there was a debit of 14,371m to the merger reserve as a result of the Group reconstruction which was treated as a merger under Section 425 of the Companies Act 1985.
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedge transactions that are extant at year end.
Available for sale reserve represents fair value gains and losses on the non current available for sale financial assets.
The foreign currency translation reserve contains the accumulated foreign exchange differences from the translation of the financial statements of the Groups foreign operations arising when the Groups entities are consolidated.
The reserve also contains the translation of liabilities that hedge the Groups net exposure in a foreign currency.
A 12m reclassification has been made between foreign currency translation reserve and retained earnings in 2008, relating to tax on foreign currency translation reserve previously included in retained earnings.

54 Reckitt Benckiser 2009 24 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Effective 1 January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet at fair value, this requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1.
2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 December 2009: Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m Assets: Assets as per the balance sheet: Auction rate securities 16 16 Derivative financial instruments FX forward exchange contracts 4 4 Total assets 4 16 20 Liabilities: Liabilities as per the balance sheet Derivative financial instruments FX forward exchange contracts 5 5 Total liabilities 5 5 Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include: 1 The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with the resulting value discounted back to present value.
2 Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
As the value of the level 3 instruments at 31 December 2009 is not material, no further level 3 disclosures have been made.
Reckitt Benckiser 2009 55 Notes to the accounts continued 24 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Financial risk management The Groups multi-national operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, credit risks, liquidity and interest rates.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using foreign currency financial instruments, including debt and other instruments, to fix interest rates.
The Groups financing and financial risk management activities are centralised into the Group Treasury Centre GTC to achieve benefits of scale and control.
The GTC is not a profit centre, but adds value to the business operations by managing financial exposures of the Group centrally in a manner consistent with underlying business risks.
The GTC manages only those risks and flows generated by the underlying commercial operations and speculative transactions are not undertaken.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies, guidelines and authority levels for all areas of treasury activity and individually approves significant activities.
The GTC operates under close control of the Chief Financial Officer and is subject to periodic independent reviews and audits, both internal and external.
Market risk a Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
The Groups policy is to align interest costs and operating profit of its major currencies in order to provide some protection against the translation exposure on foreign currency profits after tax.
The Group may undertake borrowings and other hedging methods in the currencies of the countries where most of its assets are located.
It is the Groups policy to monitor and only where appropriate hedge its foreign currency transaction exposure.
These transaction exposures arise mainly from foreign currency receipts and payments for goods and services and from the remittances of foreign currency dividends and loans.
The local business units enter into forward foreign exchange contracts with the GTC to manage these exposures where practical and allowed by local regulations.
The GTC matches the Group exposures, and hedges the net position where possible, using spot and forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2009 was 1,610m payable 2008: 829m payable.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entity The Group had US dollar-denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of net investment in its subsidiaries in the USA.
The carrying value of the dollar borrowings at 31 December 2009 was 104m 2008: 1,245m.
A foreign exchange gain of 78m 2008: loss of 378m on translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve.
There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from net investment in foreign entity hedges.
At 31 December 2009, if the US dollar had strengthened by 5% against sterling, with all other variables held constant, the foreign exchange loss recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve would have been 5m higher.
Cash flow hedge profile As at 31 December 2009, the Group had no material individual financial instruments classified as cash flow hedges.
The same was true as at 31 December 2008.
The Group held forward foreign exchange contracts denominated as cash flow hedges primarily in US dollars, Canadian dollars, Euros and Australian dollars.
Notional value of the payable leg resulting from these financial instruments was as follows: 2009 2008 m m Euro 79 55 Canadian dollars 39 Australian dollars 33 12 US dollar 28 70 New Zealand dollars 13 Saudi riyal 13 Other 76 21 281 158 These forward foreign exchange contracts are expected to mature evenly over the period January 2010 to January 2011 2008: January 2009 to March 2010.
The ineffective portion recognised in the income statement that arises from cash flow hedges amounts to nil 2008: nil.
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in other comprehensive income on forward exchange contracts in 2009 of 15m loss 2008: 19m gain are recognised in the income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement, which is generally within 12 months from the balance sheet date.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivative assets in the balance sheet.
56 Reckitt Benckiser 2009 24 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED In the case of cash flow hedges, these are denominated in a diverse range of currencies, where a fluctuation in one individual currency relationship with all others held constant does not have a significant effect on the income statement or shareholders equity.
A fluctuation analysis has been performed for all currencies.
The largest potential fluctuation would be in respect of forward contracts between the Canadian and US dollar, if the Canadian dollar had strengthened weakened by 5% against the US dollar, with all other variables held constant, shareholders equity would have been 2m 2008: 15%: 8m lower higher.
The remaining major monetary financial instruments liquid assets, receivables, interest and non-interest bearing liabilities are directly denominated in the functional currency or are transferred to the functional currency through the use of derivatives.
As at 31 December 2009 if all other currencies had strengthened weakened by 5% against sterling with all other variables held constant, this would have had an insignificant effect on the income statement or shareholders equity 2008: insignificant.
The gains and losses from fair value movements on financing derivatives recognised in finance income and expense were 1m gain.
b Price risk The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk.
Due to the nature of its business the Group is exposed to commodity price risk related to the production or packaging of finished goods using oil related and a diverse range of other raw materials.
This risk is, however, managed primarily through medium-term contracts with certain key suppliers and is not therefore viewed as being a material risk.
c Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The Group has both interest-bearing and non interest-bearing liabilities.
The Group manages its interest expense rate exposure using a mixture of fixed rate and floating rate debt.
The Group manages its interest income rate exposure on its gross financial assets by using a combination of fixed rate term deposits.
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a regular basis.
Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging.
Based on these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on the income statement of a defined interest rate shift.
For each simulation, the same interest rate shift is used for all currencies, calculated on a full year and pre tax basis.
The scenarios are only run for liabilities that represent the major interest-bearing positions.
Based on the simulations performed, the impact on the income statement of a 50 basis-point shift in interest rates would be a maximum increase of 2m 2008: 100 bps: 10m or decrease of 2m 2008: 100 bps: 10m, respectively for the liabilities covered.
The simulation is done on a periodic basis to verify that the maximum loss potential is within the limit given by management.
2. Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers.
The credit quality of trade and other receivables is detailed in note 13.
Financial institution counterparties are subject to approval under the Groups counterparty risk policy and such approval is limited to financial institutions with a BBB rating or above.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit defined within the counterparty risk policy, which is reassessed annually by the Board.
Derivative financial instruments are only traded with counterparties approved in accordance with the Board policy.
Derivative risk is measured using a risk weighting method.
The table below summarises the Groups major financial institution counterparties by credit rating and balances cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits at the balance sheet date.

Liquidity risk Cash flow forecasting is performed by the local business units and aggregated by the GTC.
The GTC monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
Funds over and above those required for short-term working capital purposes by the overseas businesses are generally remitted to the GTC.
The Group uses the remittances to settle obligations, repay borrowings, or, in the event of a surplus, invest in short-term instruments issued by institutions with a BBB rating or better.
Borrowing facilities The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.
The Group has bilateral credit facilities with high-quality international banks.
All of these facilities have similar or equivalent terms and conditions, and have a financial covenant, which is not expected to restrict the Groups future operations.

26 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Contingent liabilities for the Group, comprising guarantees relating to subsidiary undertakings, at 31 December 2009 amounted to 28m 2008: 41m.
The Group is involved in a number of investigations by competition authorities in Europe.
It is too early to determine the likely outcome of these matters and the Directors have made no provisions for such potential liabilities.
The Group has recently received a Statement of Objections from the Office of Fair Trading in the United Kingdom regarding alleged anti-competitive activity involving the Gaviscon brand.
In the event that the Office of Fair Trading finds against the Group it may impose a fine of up to the statutory maximum of ten percent of Group worldwide turnover.
The Board considers it appropriate to disclose a contingent liability in this regard.
The Statement of Objections is under review and the Group will present an appropriate response to the Office of Fair Trading in due course.
The Directors at this stage believe that there are substantive questions of law brought forward by the Statement of Objections, questions that have not been settled in prior competition law cases and which require thorough analysis and debate.
