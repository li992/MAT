On each of the grants awarded under the Senior Executive Share Option Schemes, the exercise of the options granted was made conditional upon the growth in the Companys basic earnings per share over a three year period.
For options granted in 1999, earnings per share growth must be greater than 2% per annum above growth in the Retail Prices index.
On the grant awarded in August 2006 the exercise of the options granted was made conditional upon the average annual growth in the Companys basic earnings per share over the three years from grant being greater than the average annual growth in the Retail Price Index over the three years.
If earnings per share growth exceeds RPI growth by 3% then half of the options will be exercisable, if earnings per share growth exceeds RPI growth by 5% then all of the options will be exercisable and if earnings per share growth exceeds RPI growth by between 3% and 5% the number of options exercisable is prorated on a straight line basis.
On the grant awarded in April 2009 the exercise of the options granted was made conditional upon the average annual growth in the Companys basic earnings per share over the three years from grant being greater than the average annual growth in the Retail Price Index over the three years.
If earnings per share growth exceeds RPI growth by 3% then half of the options will be exercisable, if earnings per share growth exceeds RPI growth by 7% then all of the options will be exercisable and if earnings per share growth exceeds RPI growth by between 3% and 7% the number of options exercisable is prorated on a straight line basis.
Options granted under the all employee SAYE scheme are not subject to performance conditions.
