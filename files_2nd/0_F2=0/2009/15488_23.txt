General information Telecity Group plc is a Company incorporated, and domiciled, in the United Kingdom and has Sterling as its presentation and functional currency.
Telecity Group plc and its subsidiaries operate in the internet infrastructure facilities and associated services industry within Europe.
The operating companies of the Group are disclosed within note 17.
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The address of its registered office is Masters House, 107 Hammersmith Road, London W14 0QH.
Summary of significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these Financial Statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented.
2.1 Basis of preparation The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with EU Endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through the income statement.
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are disclosed below.
One such significant estimate is the estimated remaining useful lives of property, plant and equipment.
In accordance with IAS 16, the Group has a policy of reviewing the residual useful lives of the data centres at least annually.
During the year, the Group performed such a review in respect of its leasehold improvements and plant and machinery, the financial effect of which is to reduce the depreciation charge for the year by 3.2m.
The separate Financial Statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006 the Act.
As permitted by the Act, the separate Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis as modified in respect of share-based payments.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements are set out below.
a New and amended standards adopted by the Group The Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRS as of 1 January 2009: IFRS 7, Financial instruments: Disclosures amendment effective 1 January 2009.
The amendment requires enhanced I disclosures about fair value measurement and liquidity risk.
In particular, the amendment requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of a fair value measurement hierarchy.
IFRS 8, Operating segments effective 1 January 2009.
The standard has resulted in certain changes to the Groups I segmental reporting as presented in note 5.
IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements revised effective 1 January 2009.
The revised standard prohibits the presentation I of items of income and expenses that is, non-owner changes in equity in the statement of changes in equity, requiring non-owner changes in equity to be presented separately from owner changes in equity in a statement of comprehensive income.
As a result the Group presents in the consolidated statement of changes in equity all owner changes in equity, whereas all non-owner changes in equity are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Comparative information has been re-presented so that it also is in conformity with the revised standard.
As the change in accounting policy only impacts presentation aspects, there is no impact on the Group or Companys Financial Statements.
IFRS 2, Share-based payment amendment effective 1 January 2009.
The amendment deals with vesting conditions I and cancellations.
It clarifies that vesting conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only.
Other features of a share-based payment are not vesting conditions.
These features would need to be included in the grant date fair value for transactions with employees and others providing similar services: they would not impact the number of awards expected to vest or valuation there of subsequent to grant date.
All cancellations, whether by the entity or by other parties, should receive the same accounting treatment.
The Group and Company has adopted IFRS 2 amendment from 1 January 2009.
The amendment does not have a material impact on the Group or Companys Financial Statements.
IFRIC 18, Transfers of assets from customers effective 1 July 2009.
The interpretation applies to the accounting for transfers I of items of property, plant and equipment by entities that receive such transfers from their customers and does not have a material impact on the Group or Companys Financial Statements.
The amendment is part of the IASBs annual improvements project published in April 2009 I and the Group and Company applied IAS 38 amendment from the date IFRS 3 revised was adopted.
The amendment clarifies guidance in measuring the fair value of an intangible asset acquired in a business combination and it permits the grouping of intangible assets as a single asset if each asset has similar useful economic lives.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.1 Basis of preparation continued b Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group The following standards and amendments to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010 or later periods, but the Group has not early adopted them: IFRIC 17, Distribution of non-cash assets to owners effective on or after 1 July 2009.
The interpretation was published I in November 2008.
This interpretation provides guidance on accounting for arrangements whereby an entity distributes non-cash assets to shareholders either as a distribution of reserves or as dividends.
IFRS 5 has also been amended to require that assets are classified as held for distribution only when they are available for distribution in their present condition and the distribution is highly probable.
The Group and Company will apply IFRIC 17 from 1 January 2010.
It is not expected to have a material impact on the Group or Companys Financial Statements.
IAS 27, Consolidated and separate financial statements revised effective from 1 July 2009.
The revised standard requires I the effects of all transactions with non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses.
The standard also specifies the accounting when control is lost.
Any remaining interest in the entity is re-measured to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
The Group will apply IAS 27 revised prospectively to transactions with non-controlling interests from 1 January 2010.
IFRS 5, Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations amendment.
The amendment is part of the IASBs I annual improvements project published in April 2009.
The amendment provides clarification that IFRS 5 specifies the disclosures required in respect of non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale or discontinued operations.
It also clarifies that the general requirement of IAS 1 still applies, particularly paragraph 15 to achieve a fair presentation and paragraph 125 sources of estimation uncertainty of IAS 1.
The Group and Company will apply IFRS 5 amendment from 1 January 2010.
IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements amendment.
The amendment is part of the IASBs annual improvements project I published in April 2009.
The amendment provides clarification that the potential settlement of a liability by the issue of equity is not relevant to its classification as current or non-current.
By amending the definition of current liability, the amendment permits a liability to be classified as non-current provided that the entity has an unconditional right to defer settlement by transfer of cash or other assets for at least 12 months after the accounting period notwithstanding the fact that the entity could be required by the counterparty to settle in shares at any time.
The Group and Company will apply IAS 1 amendment from 1 January 2010.
IFRS 2, Group cash-settled share-based payment transaction amendment effective from 1 January 2010.
In addition I to incorporating IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2, and IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions, the amendments expand on the guidance in IFRIC 11 to address the classification of group arrangements that were not covered by that interpretation.
The new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Group or Companys Financial Statements.
IFRS 9, Financial instruments effective 1 January 2013.
The standard sets out the requirements for recognising and I measuring financial assets, financial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non-financial items.
The Group is reviewing the impact of the new standard on the Financial Statements.
IFRIC 19, Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments effective 1 July 2010.
The interpretation addresses the I accounting by an entity when the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and result in the entity issuing equity instruments to a creditor of the entity to extinguish all or part of the financial liability.
The interpretation is not expected to have a material impact on the Group or Companys Financial Statements.
2.2 Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group.
Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
The acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 revised are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
The Group early adopted IFRS 3 revised which is mandatory from 1 January 2010.
As there have been no acquisitions in either the current or previous year, the impact of early adoption is limited.
Following adoption of IFRS 3 revised, the Group is not required to assess the carrying value of goodwill when previously unrecognised pre-acquisition deferred tax assets are recognised.
Since adoption the Group has recognised deferred tax assets of 18,949,000.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.3 Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than the Groups functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates ruling at that date.
These translation differences are disclosed in the income statement.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income statement for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
The balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into Sterling at the closing rates of exchange.
The results are translated at an average rate, recalculated for each month between that months closing rate and the equivalent for the preceding month.
Foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of opening net investments in foreign subsidiaries at the closing rate, including long-term inter-company loans, are taken directly to reserves.
In addition, foreign exchange differences arising from retranslation of the foreign subsidiaries results from monthly average rate to closing rate are also taken directly to the Groups cumulative translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised in the income statement in the financial year in which the operations are disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
2.4 Segment reporting A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns which are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
The Group has chosen to present its primary segmental analysis with reference to geographical location as this is best felt to describe the different risks and rates of return that the Group is subject to.
2.5 Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is recorded as an intangible asset.
Separately recognised goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
The Group allocates goodwill to each business segment in each country in which it operates.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
The main assumptions used when performing the impairment test are set out in note 15.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value-in-use calculation requires an estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
2.6 Intangible assets Intangible assets, other than goodwill, represent customer contracts acquired during business combinations.
The customer contracts are initially recognised at fair value, in the currency in which the related cash flows are expected to be denominated, and amortised over estimated useful economic lives of between 10 and 20 years.
The fair value is calculated by estimating the future cash flows expected to arise from the intangible asset and applying a suitable discount rate.
2.7 Property, plant and equipment The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises their purchase cost, together with the costs of installation and directly attributable external and internal costs, such as staff and property rentals, incurred during the construction or commissioning phase.
Depreciation is calculated from the date an asset becomes available for use, so as to write off the cost of the asset over its expected useful economic life.
The principal periods used for this purpose are: Leasehold improvements 7 20 years straight-line Plant and machinery 5 20 years straight-line Office equipment 3 5 years straight-line The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis and, if appropriate, adjusted on a prospective basis.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.7 Property, plant and equipment continued Impairment of non-financial assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether an asset may be impaired.
If any such indicator exists, the Group tests for impairment by estimating the recoverable amount.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment loss is required.
2.8 Financial assets Financial assets are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are classified as loans and receivables.
The classification is determined by management upon initial recognition, and it is based on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables comprise mainly trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held on call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
Objective evidence of impairment could include: significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty: I default or delinquency in interest or principal payments: or I it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation.
I For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis.
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Groups past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
A specific provision will also be raised for trade receivables when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments more than 90 days overdue are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
Increases to the provision are charged to the income statement.
2.9 Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of a provision account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the provision account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the provision account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the provision account are recognised in the income statement.
Derecognition of financial assets The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.
If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Shares held in the EBT over which the Group has direct or indirect control are deducted from the reserves of the Group.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.9 Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group continued Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Finance and operating leases Leasing agreements which transfer to the Group substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset are classified as a finance lease and treated as if the asset had been purchased outright.
The assets are included in property, plant and equipment and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown within obligations under finance leases.
The lease rentals are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements.
The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the interest element is charged against profit in proportion to the reducing capital element outstanding.
Leases that are not classified as finance leases are treated as operating leases.
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Benefits received by the Group as an incentive to sign the lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term, or to the first break clause, if sooner.
Effective interest rate method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Derecognition of financial liabilities The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
2.10 Derivative financial instruments Interest rate derivatives are recognised initially at fair value and subsequent to initial recognition are revalued at each reporting date.
The fair value is based on the market values of equivalent instruments at the relevant date.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivative liabilities in the balance sheet.
Amounts payable and receivable on interest rate derivatives are recognised in the period to which they relate.
Where the instrument meets the definition for hedge accounting, movements in fair value of the interest rate swap are taken to reserves.
In all other cases movements are charged or credited to the income statement.
2.11 Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
2.12 Reinstatement costs At the inception of the lease and annually thereafter, the Directors assess the cost of restoring leasehold premises to their original condition at the end of the lease and the likelihood of such costs actually being incurred.
If the likelihood of this liability arising is judged to be probable, the discounted cost of the liability is included in leasehold improvements and is depreciated over the duration of the lease.
The discount arising on the provision is amortised in future years through interest.
If the likelihood of this liability arising is judged to be possible, rather than probable, it is disclosed as a contingent liability.
When assessing the likely duration of the lease and the likelihood of this liability arising, the Directors take into account their contractual and statutory rights to renew or extend the lease terms.
2.13 Revenue Revenue represents the value of goods and services supplied to customers during the year, excluding value added tax and other sales related taxes.
Where invoices are raised in advance for contracted services, the revenue is spread over the period of the service and deferred income is recognised on the balance sheet.
Colocation revenues arise from the leasing of the Groups infrastructure assets and are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract.
Generally revenue from Value added Services is recognised when the service is provided.
When Value added Services are required before related colocation services can be provided, revenue from Value added Service contracts is bundled with the related colocation services revenues and the entire amount recognised over the course of the contracts as the services are provided.
com Telecity Group plc Annual report and accounts 2009 Financial statements 59 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.14 Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees under the terms of the Long-Term Incentive Plans.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined, using the Black Scholes or Monte Carlo models, at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest.
Non-market vesting conditions, which for the Group mainly relate to the continual employment of the employee during the vesting period, are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest.
Any market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, measured immediately before and after the modification, is also charged to the income statement over the remaining vesting period.
Where equity instruments are granted to persons other than employees, the income statement is charged with the fair value of goods and services received.
To the extent that share options are granted to employees of the Groups subsidiaries without charge, the share option charge is capitalised as part of the cost of investment in subsidiaries.
2.15 Pensions The Group operates a defined contribution Group personal pension arrangement for all employees.
Contributions are made in accordance with the scheme rules and are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
2.16 Finance income Finance income arising from bank deposits is recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis.
2.17 Finance costs Finance costs of debt are recognised in the income statement over the term of such instruments at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Finance costs which are directly attributable to the construction of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.
The commencement of capitalisation begins when both finance costs and expenditures for the asset are being incurred, and activities that are necessary to get the asset ready for use are in progress.
Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities that are necessary to get the asset ready for use are complete.
2.18 Exceptional items Exceptional items are those significant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Groups financial performance.
2.19 Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and cost risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The Group has operations in a number of European countries and therefore experiences foreign exchange risk.
I The Groups main exposure is to the Sterling Euro rate and, to a lesser extent, the Sterling Swedish Krona rate.
The individual operating entities trade predominantly in their functional currency and therefore little foreign currency risk exists at a trading entity level.
The Group faces currency exposures on the translation of the trading results and net assets of its overseas subsidiaries which it does not seek to hedge.
Significant capital projects, which are funded by the Group, are financed by arranging external borrowings in the local currency of the entity being funded.
The year end and average exchange rates used when translating the results for the year to Sterling are 1.111 and 1.120 I respectively for Euros and 11.451 and 11.868 respectively for Swedish Krona.
Had the year end and average Sterling exchange rates been 5% weaker, then the profit for the year would have increased I by 0.9m and the net assets increased by 3.2m.
Had the year end and average Sterling exchange rates been 10% weaker, then the profit for the year would have increased by 2.0m and the net assets increased by 6.7m.
The Groups borrowings incur variable interest rates based on three-month LIBOR or EURIBOR depending on I the currency of the loan.
The Directors manage the risk of fluctuating interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate.
Before an interest rate swap is entered into, the Group reviews the fixed rates available on such contracts.
At 31 December 2009, 61.1% 2008: 66.9% of the Groups borrowings were hedged under such agreements.
The main area of exposure relates to the price of electricity and its consequential impact on the Groups pricing of its I services.
The Group uses consultants to monitor price changes in electricity and negotiate fixed-price term agreements with the power supply companies.
The Group performs appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales are made.
Rigorous procedures are I applied to ensure that customers pay on a timely basis.
Due to the high number of customers there is no credit concentration risk.
The Group has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the I Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate capital reserves and banking facilities and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
At the year end, the Group is in full compliance with the covenants attached to the banking facilities and expects to remain so for the foreseeable future.
The Directors are satisfied that the current capital and financing arrangements are adequate for the Groups operations and planned capital investment.
There are no significant restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to transfer funds to the parent.
The table below analyses the Groups undiscounted financial liabilities and net-settled derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.

The Group has a strong capital base comprising its equity, including reserves, and committed senior debt I facilities.
The Group has maintained a conservative approach to gearing and seeks to manage its net debt with reference to prudent multiples of the Groups last 12 months EBITDA levels.

This requires the disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 : I inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly I that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2 : and inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
I The following table presents the Groups liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 December 2009.
The Group had no assets valued at fair value at 31 December 2009.
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total liabilities Derivative financial instruments note 21 3,962 4.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates made by management based on the best available evidence, due to events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: Property, plant and equipment depreciation estimated remaining useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually.
The carrying I values of property, plant and equipment are also reviewed for impairment where there has been a trigger event by assessing the present value of estimated future cash flows through use compared with net book value.
The calculation of estimated future cash flows and residual values is based on the Directors best estimates of future prices, output and costs and is therefore subjective.
Intangible fixed assets amortisation estimated remaining useful lives are reviewed annually.
The carrying values of intangible fixed I assets are also reviewed for impairment where there has been a trigger event by assessing the present value of estimated future cash flows through use compared with net book value.
The calculation of estimated future cash flows and residual values is based on the Directors best estimates of future income from customer contracts and is therefore subjective.
Dilapidations provisions liabilities in respect of obligations to restore premises to their original condition are estimated at the I commencement of the lease and are reviewed every six months.
The actual cost of these may be different depending upon whether the Group renews the lease.
Onerous lease provisions liabilities in respect of onerous leases are reviewed and updated, where necessary, to reflect current I conditions and intentions.
The actual cost of these may be different depending upon whether the Group is successful in assigning the lease.
Deferred taxation full provision is made for deferred taxation, as required under IAS 12, Income taxes, at the rates of tax I prevailing at the period end dates unless different future rates have been substantively enacted.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that they will be recovered, and as such are subjective.
Derivatives IAS 39 requires derivative financial instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value.
Changes in the I fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
The fair values of derivative instruments are determined using forward price curves.
Forward price curves represent the Groups estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement of a commodity at future dates.
The Group generally bases its forward price curves upon readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Groups commodity contracts do not generally extend beyond the actively traded portion of the curve.
However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate of how future prices will move and are therefore subjective.
Share-based payments the Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees under the terms of the I Long-Term Incentive Plans.
The fair value at the grant date is determined using either the Black Scholes or the Monte Carlo models, and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest.
The value of the expense is dependent upon certain key assumptions including the expected future volatility rate of the Groups share price at the date of grant.

Segmental information a Primary reporting format geographic segments The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Board of Directors the Board.
The Board reviews the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
Management has determined the operating segments based on these reports.
The Board considers the business from both a geographic and services perspective.
On a geographic basis the Board assesses the performance of the UK and Ireland, and the Rest of Europe.
The Rest of Europe includes France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands and Sweden.
Revenue is further assessed from a services perspective between colocation and value added services VAS.
The Board assess the performance of the operating segments based primarily on Key Performance Indicators KPIs which are set out below.
These KPIs have been chosen because they are considered to be the main factors underpinning the Groups performance.
The capacity of the existing facilities is a constraining factor to growth, so therefore the Group monitors both fitted out space and occupancy.
In addition, the amount of revenue generated per square metre is used to measure the income generation achieved in the available space.
Other information provided to the Board is measured in a manner consistent with that in the Financial Statements.
Certain assets and liabilities, for example cash deposits and bank borrowings, are managed on a central basis and as such have not been allocated to individual segments.
m 3,685 3,944 3,807 3,597 2,971 3,306 1 Measured as revenue for the year divided by year end occupied space.
Segment liabilities comprise trade and other payables and provisions for other liabilities and charges.
Unallocated amounts comprise items such as Group borrowings and derivative financial instruments.
Inter-segment trading is not material in either the current or previous year.

During the year, the Group has offset current tax charges through the use of deferred tax assets totalling 7,292,000 2008: 6,283,000.
Further, previously unrecognised, deferred tax assets were recorded during the year, resulting in the year end deferred tax asset of 5,374,000.
As the deferred tax asset at the end of the year is consistent with the balance recognised at 31 December 2008, there is no net charge for deferred tax in the year 2008: credit 5,374,000.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset only when they arise in the same tax jurisdiction, the amounts are expected to reverse in similar periods and the amounts would be available for offset.
The majority of the net deferred tax asset is expected to be realised within 12 months.
The analysis of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, without taking into consideration the offsetting of balances within the same tax jurisdiction, is as follows: Capital allowances Tax in excess of losses depreciation Other Total 000 000 000 000 At 1 January 2008 15,284 6,750 3,160 5,374 Utilisation of recognised tax losses 6,122 6,122 Recognition of previously unrecognised tax losses 7,369 7,369 Capital allowances in excess of depreciation 1,170 1,170 Other movements 194 117 77 At 31 December 2009 16,531 8,114 3,043 5,374 Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax losses to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
In addition to the amounts recognised above, the Group has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of approximately 10,509,000 2008: 20,830,000 which relates to several of the Groups subsidiary companies.
