FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS RISK PROFILE Market Risks The potential market risks are i currency risk, ii interest risk, and iii other price risk.
Each considered in turn below.
i Currency Risk The Company invests in global equity markets and therefore is exposed to currency risks as it affects the value of the shares in the base currency.
These currency exposures are not hedged.
Currency exposures for the Company as at 31 December 2009 are detailed in the table at the end of this note.
ii Interest Rate Risk The Company is typically fully invested in global equities but will from time to time hold interest bearing assets.
These assets are cash balances that earn interest at a floating rate and UK Treasury Bills when large amounts of cash are held.
At the year end the Companys only interest bearing investments were the Ensyn Corporation, Emergya and Turbo Power Systems but a very limited amount of income is receivable on these investments.
The Company does not have interest bearing liabilities.
iii Other Price Risk The principal price risk for the Company is the price volatility of shares that are owned by the Company.
The Company is well diversified across different sub-sectors and geographies and has a volatility level similar to global stock market indices such as the MSCI World Index to which the Company has an expected tracking error of 10%.
The historic 3-year volatility of the Company to 31 December 2009 is 22%.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS RISK PROFILE continued Overall Sensitivity The Manager has used the value at risk VAR methodology in UBS PAS a proprietary investment banking model to estimate the maximum expected loss from the portfolio held at 31 December 2009 over 1 day, 5 day, 10 day and 21 day time periods given the historical performance of the fund over the previous five years.
The data in the previous five years is analysed under discrete periods to provide 1 in 10, 1 in 20 and 1 in 100 possible outcomes.
The results of the analysis are shown below.
Expected loss as percentage at limit 1 in 10 90% 1 in 20 95% 1 in 100 99% 1 day return 1.3 2.0 3.8 5 day return 3.1 4.6 8.4 10 day return 4.4 7.1 12.6 21 day return 5.8 9.5 24.3 The above analysis has been based on the following main assumptions: The distribution of share price returns will be the same in the future as they were in the past.
The portfolio weightings will remain as they were on 31 December 2009.
The results in the above table indicate, for example, that there is a 5% or less probability of the NAV falling by 4.6% or more over a 5 day period.
Similarly, there is a 1% or less probability of the NAV falling by 3.8% or more on any given day.
Credit Risk Cash at bank at 31 December 2009 included 6,902,000 2008: 9,828,000 held at the Companys custodian, The Northern Trust Company.
The Company also held 476,000 2008: 546,000 at Lloyds TSB Bank plc.
Credit risk arising on transactions with brokers relates to transactions awaiting settlement.
Risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered to be low as trading is almost always done on a delivery versus payment basis.
There is a significant credit risk on three unquoted interest bearing investments.
Substantially all of the assets of the Company are held by The Northern Trust Company the custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed or limited.
Liquidity Risk The Fund invests in a range of global equities with different market capitalisations and liquidities and therefore needs to be conscious of liquidity risk.
The Manager monitors the liquidity risk by carrying out a Maturity Analysis of the Companys listed equities based on the 20 Day Average Liquidities of each investment and assuming one third 33.3% of the daily traded volume.
As shown in the quantitative analysis below, on 31 December 2009, 6% of the portfolio excluding unquoted investments is held in positions which may have taken more than three months to be realised.
Quantitative Disclosures As described above, the Manager has carried out a maturity analysis of the Company at 31 December 2009 and the results for different time bands are reported as follows: Percentage of portfolio that could be liquidated in one month 84% Percentage of portfolio that could be liquidated in three months 94% Percentage of portfolio that could be liquidated in one year 97% Percentage of portfolio that could liquidated in five years 100% The Company may invest up to 10% of its net assets into pre-IPO investments which are possible candidates for flotation.
At the year end the Company held investments in seven unquoted companies with an aggregate total value of 16,298,000 2008: 15,986,000 : these investments have been valued at fair value at the year end.
The Company also held an unquoted loan note in a quoted company with a valuation at year end of 600,000 2008: 600,000.
