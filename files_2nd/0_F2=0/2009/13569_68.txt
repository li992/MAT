This is as a result of a recent change in UK legislation, intended to exempt the great majority of overseas dividends from UK tax.
The 2008 comparative reflected undistributed profits of the relevant entities which, if paid up by way of dividend, would have given rise to taxable income in the UK.
No deferred tax was provided in respect of the resultant temporary differences because the timing of any reversals by way of dividend flow could be controlled and it was considered unlikely that dividends would be paid if they resulted in additional UK taxable income.
