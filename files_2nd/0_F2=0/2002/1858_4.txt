The explanation summarises the objectives and policies for holding or issuing financial instruments and similar contracts, and the strategies for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the year.
The numerical disclosures in this note deal with financial assets and liabilities as defined in Financial Reporting Standard 13 - Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures FRS 13.
For this purpose non-equity shares issued by the Company are dealt with in the disclosures in the same way as the Groups financial liabilities but separately disclosed.
Certain financial assets such as investments in subsidiary and associated companies are also excluded from the scope of these disclosures.
As permitted by FRS 13, short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures, other than the currency disclosures.
Interest rate profile After taking into account interest rate swaps and currency swaps entered into by the Group, the interest rate profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2002 was as follows: Floating Interest Fixed rate rate free Total m m m m Sterling 8.9 17.5 26.4 US Dollar 366.3 417.7 784.0 Euro 72.2 87.6 159.8 Other 42.6 42.6 Financial liabilities excluding non-equity capital 438.5 556.8 17.5 1,012.8 Non-equity capital: Cumulative preference shares 0.2 0.2 Cumulative redeemable convertible preference shares 56.1 56.1 Total financial liabilities 494.8 556.8 17.5 1,069.1 Of which: Total borrowings 589.4 Notional value of derivative financial instruments 423.4 Non-equity capital 56.3 Total financial liabilities 1,069.1 68 BBA GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2002 17 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued The profile at 31 December 2001 for comparison purposes was as follows: Floating Interest Fixed rate rate free Total m m m m Sterling 12.9 50.0 62.9 US Dollar 286.0 385.8 671.8 Euro 69.9 63.8 133.7 Other 41.3 41.3 Financial liabilities excluding non-equity capital 355.9 503.8 50.0 909.7 Non-equity capital: Cumulative preference shares 0.2 0.2 Cumulative redeemable convertible preference shares 56.1 56.1 Total financial liabilities 412.2 503.8 50.0 966.0 Of which: Total borrowings 677.1 Notional value of derivative financial instruments 232.6 Non-equity capital 56.3 Total financial liabilities 966.0 Further analysis of the interest rate profile at 31 December is as follows: 2002 2001 Fixed rate Fixed rate Weighted Weighted average average Weighted period for Weighted period for average which rate average which rate interest rate is fixed interest rate is fixed % Years % Years US Dollar 5.5 3.3 6.9 2.8 Euro 4.1 3.3 4.3 3.1 Total borrowings 5.3 3.3 6.4 2.9 Non-equity capital: Cumulative preference shares 5.0 5.0 Cumulative redeemable convertible preference shares 6.8 6.8 6.8 6.8 The interest rate on floating rate financial liabilities is linked to sterling LIBOR in the case of sterling liabilities and the relevant currency LIBOR for currency denominated liabilities.

There were no fixed rate financial assets in 2001.
Cash at bank and short-term deposits earn interest determined with reference to the relevant money market deposit rates.
Vendor notes relate to disposals made in previous years and earn interest determined with reference to the relevant LIBOR.
Currency exposures The extent to which the Groups operating entities hold monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than in their local currency has been reviewed.
Taking into account the impact of forward currency contracts and other derivative instruments, the Group had no material profit and loss exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as at 31 December 2002.
Gains and losses on hedges The Group enters into forward currency contracts to eliminate the currency exposures that arise on sales denominated in foreign currencies immediately those sales are transacted.
It also uses interest rate swaps and currency swaps to manage its interest rate profile and translation exposures.
Gains and losses on hedges are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
The table below sets out unrecognised gains and losses in respect of hedges at the beginning and end of the year: m Net losses on hedges at 1 January 2002 12.7 Net losses arising in previous years included in 2002 results 0.8 Net losses arising in previous years and not included in 2002 results 11.9 Net losses arising in 2002 and not included in 2002 results 15.9 Net losses on hedges at 31 December 2002 27.8 Of which: Net losses expected to be recognised in 2003 11.4 Net losses expected to be recognised in 2004 or after 16.4 27.8 Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows: 2002 2001 m m In one year or less 62.2 190.7 In more than one year but not more than two years 13.8 276.2 In more than two years but not more than five years 467.8 158.6 In more than five years 45.6 51.6 589.4 677.1 Borrowing facilities The Group had undrawn committed facilities at 31 December, in respect of which all conditions precedent have been met, as follows: 2002 2001 m m Expiring in one year or less 4.4 65.5 Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years 46.0 Expiring in more than two years 379.1 424.3 383.5 535.8 70 BBA GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2002 17 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Fair values Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December: 2001 2002 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value Restated Restated m m m m Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations: Short-term financial liabilities and current proportion of long-term borrowings 62.2 62.4 190.7 190.7 Long-term borrowings 527.2 528.0 486.4 487.6 Non-equity capital 56.3 67.1 56.3 92.4 Cash deposits 93.7 93.7 129.1 129.1 Vendor notes and other debtors due outside one year 16.7 16.7 33.8 33.8 Derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate and currency profile: Interest rate swaps 28.3 14.6 Currency swaps 25.3 25.3 7.6 7.6 Forward foreign currency contracts 8.9 0.5 Commodity swap 0.9 The fair value of the non-equity capital, interest rate swaps, forward foreign currency contracts and commodity swap have been determined by reference to prices available from the markets on which the instruments involved are traded.
All the other fair values shown above have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The interest rates on currency swaps are based upon short-term floating rates and therefore the difference between the book value and fair value is immaterial.

Details of pensions and other post-retirement benefits are set out in note 23.
The provision for discontinued operations has reduced significantly during the year due to the Group substantially completing the process of closing the Nonwovens plant in Lewisburg, Pennsylvannia.
This was partially offset by the creation of a provision to cover the costs of terminating the US Aircraft Sales business, which principally relates to asset write downs.
0.6m of the original provision remains to cover final closure costs with the remainder relating to costs associated with businesses disposed of in prior years.
The provision is partially offset by expected recoveries from third parties of 13.3m 2001: 13.0m, which are included within debtors due after one year in note 13.
It is expected that the majority of this expenditure will not be incurred within the next five years.

23 PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Group operates a number of plans worldwide.
The main plans, which cover the majority of employees, are of the funded defined benefit type.
The normal pension cost for the Group, including early retirement costs, was 11.2m 2001: 13.7m of which 6.8m 2001: 9.2m was in respect of foreign schemes.
The pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries, where practicable, using a variety of methods and assumptions and otherwise, in respect of certain foreign schemes, in accordance with local regulations.
The Groups main UK pension commitments are contained within a defined benefit scheme with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
Contributions to the scheme are made and pension cost is assessed using the projected unit method.
The latest actuarial valuation of the scheme was as at 31 March 2001.
The principal assumptions used in the valuation of the liabilities were an average investment return of 6.7% per annum before retirement and 5.2% after retirement, pay inflation of 3.8% after promotional increases per annum and pension increases of 2.4% per annum.
The market value of the assets of the scheme at the date of the actuarial valuation was 377.5m.
The actuarial value of the scheme assets represented 108% of the liabilities for benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings, but excluding the costs of early retirement which are dealt with on a pay as you go basis.
76 BBA GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2002 23 PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued The excess of assets over liabilities will be spread over the average remaining service lives of employees.
The Groups foreign pension schemes mainly relate to a number of funded defined benefit pension arrangements in North America.
Pension costs have been calculated by independent qualified actuaries, using assumptions appropriate to the arrangements in place.
The principal assumptions used for the main schemes in North America were that the discount rates used to determine the pension liabilities were in the range 6.5 to 7.0% per annum, and that future salary increases will be in the range 3.0 to 5.3% per annum.
The total market value of the assets for the North American defined benefit pension schemes as at 31 December 2002 was 48.9m.
The aggregate value of the schemes assets represented 66% of the liabilities for benefits that had accrued to members.
Included in the balance sheet note 18 is a provision of 3.3m 2001: 2.9m in relation to overseas pension schemes.
The Group also operates a plan in North America which principally covers healthcare and life assurance benefits for its retirees.
The costs of these other post-retirement benefits are assessed by independent qualified actuaries and accounted for on an accruals basis.
The main assumptions used to determine these costs were a discount rate of 6.75% per annum, and an allowance for the inflation in healthcare costs in the range 4 to 6% per annum.
In November 2000 the Accounting Standards Board issued FRS 17 Retirement Benefits replacing SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
FRS 17 will not become fully effective before 31 December 2005, although certain disclosures are required in the transition period, for periods ending on or after 22 June 2001.
These further disclosures are included below.
They have no effect on the companys balance sheet or profit and loss account.
In accordance with FRS 17, and subject to materiality, the latest actuarial valuations of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and healthcare plan have been reviewed and updated as at 31 December 2002.
The following weighted average financial assumptions have been adopted: United Kingdom North America Rest of World p. a.

Any liabilities are likely to be mitigated by legal defences, insurance, reserves and third party indemnities.
Additionally, the Group has previously owned businesses that manufactured asbestos containing products.
No BBA company has manufactured or sold any asbestos containing products or materials for many years.
A small number of former BBA companies have been named as defendants to asbestos related claims.
When these companies were sold, BBA retained certain obligations to indemnify the purchasers against such claims.
Notwithstanding such indemnity arrangements, the costs incurred by BBA in dealing with claims made against these former BBA companies have been immaterial to BBA.
During the period 1989 to 31 December 2002, BBAs costs of defending and disposing of all asbestos related claims, net of insurance coverage, were approximately 2m in total.
BBA maintains a portfolio of 78 BBA GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2002 24 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES continued insurance coverage in respect of such claims, including legal defence costs and liability cover.
State operated compensation programmes have also provided coverage.
On the basis of its past claims experience, BBA does not anticipate any material increase in the cost of resolving such claims.
The directors do not currently anticipate that the outcome of the proceedings and claims set out above, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
25 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS During the year a subsidiary provided services to a company controlled by a person who is a close family member of Roberto Quarta, a director of BBA Group plc.
These were provided in the ordinary course of business and on an arms length basis and amounted to 153,280 2001: 49,126.
At 31 December 2002 none of the amounts remained unpaid 2001: 55,092.
