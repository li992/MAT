The six companies were acquired from Royal & SunAlliance Insurance Group plc for an initial consideration of 239,879,000.
Under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement ISIS Treasury Limited is entitled to receive net assets of 28,232,000.
Following agreement of the Completion Accounts, a for adjustment will be made to the initial consideration to reect the agreed net asset position at completion 1 July 2002.
An estimated further consideration of 3,737,000 is outstanding on the acquisition as the net assets per the Completion Accounts were greater than 28,232,000.
An initial cash payment of 235,688,000 was paid to the Royal & SunAlliance Insurance Group plc reecting the initial consideration of 239,879,000 less 4,191,000, being an estimate of the net inter-company balance due to the WAM Holdings Limited group by the Royal & SunAlliance Insurance Group plc.
The final settlement will be paid following agreement of the Completion Accounts.
Expenses of 5,500,000 were incurred in connection with the acquisition.
The purchase of the three trading companies was all part of the same transaction with Royal & SunAlliance Insurance Group plc.
As a result the fair value table has been produced for the entirety of the arrangement as this most accurately reects the nature of the transaction.
The provisional goodwill arising on the acquisition has been capitalised and is being amortised over 10 and 20 years, in accordance with its estimated useful life.
Note 11 details the amount of goodwill amortised over each period.

Investments contd The analysis of the transaction is as follows: Adjustments Provisional Book value Accounting fair value to before policy Fair value the group at acquisition alignment adjustments acquisition 000 000 000 000 Net assets of subsidiaries acquired can be summarised as follows: Tangible xed assets 1,382 787 595 Stock of units and shares 430 430 Cash & bank 30,371 30,371 Debtors 17,582 535 17,047 Deferred tax asset 1,421 1,421 Creditors 17,797 2,376 20,173 Estimated Net Assets of acquired companies 31,968 1,421 3,698 29,691 Goodwill arising on acquisition note 11 219,425 249,116 Discharged by: Cash payment 235,688 Settlement of inter-company balances 4,191 Initial consideration 239,879 Estimated further consideration 3,737 Estimated expenses of acquisition of which 1,038,000 is accrued 5,500 249,116 Subject to agreement of the Completion Accounts.
The directors consider the fair values of the Net Assets to be provisional until the RSA Investments Completion Accounts review process has been completed.
In the meantime the adjustments reect the directors best estimates of fair value adjustments to the Net Assets of the acquired companies.
The following specic adjustments have been made to reect the fair value of assets acquired on acquisition: a The book value of tangible xed assets has been reduced to reect the directors assessment of the realisable value of information technology assets at the date of take-on.
b Debtors have been reduced to their estimated realisable value, to reect that doubt exists as to the recoverability of certain balances.
c The deferred tax asset had been recognised to align the accounting policy FRS 19: Deferred Tax of the subsidiaries acquired to the policy already adopted by the ISIS group.
d The increase in creditors reects obligations of the acquired entities which are considered to exist as at 1 July 2002, but which were not reected in the Completion Accounts.
ISIS ASSET MANAGEMENT plc REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 89 Notes to the financial statements 13.
Investments contd Since the date of acquisition, exceptional costs of 19,169,000 see note 6 have been incurred in reorganising, restructuring and integrating the business.
The directors consider the exceptional costs, which relate to a fundamental reorganisation of the business, are non-operating in nature.
Two loan facilities have been put in place to fund the acquisition: i A loan of 180,000,000 from Friends Provident Life and Pensions Limited.
Interest on the loan is payable every 1 six months at the 4 year SWAP Rate plus 0.575% per annum.
The loan is due to be repaid in full on 2 1 November 2006. ii A revolving credit facility of 50,000,000 with Friends Provident plc.
The loan may be drawn down in tranches of 5,000,000.
Interest on the loan is payable quarterly at 3 month LIBOR plus 0.6% per annum.
The daily undrawn and uncancelled amount of the facility has a commitment fee payable at the rate of 0.3% per annum.
The facility will terminate on 30 May 2007, or earlier if notice of termination is given by ISIS Treasury Limited and the outstanding element of the loan is reduced to nil.
The full 180,000,000 xed rate loan plus 20,000,000 of the 50,000,000 revolving credit facility were utilised, along with existing cash resources, to fund the initial consideration of 239,879,000.

Pension commitments Since 1 January 1996 ISIS has operated a dened contribution scheme which all new employees are eligible to join and to which current employees may elect to transfer.
This scheme provides greater certainty in relation to future costs to the company and also offers employees competitive rates of contribution.
The company continues to operate a dened benets scheme The ISIS Asset Management plc Pension Fund, formerly The Ivory & Sime plc Retirement and Death Benets Plan in the UK which provides benets based on final pensionable salary.
This scheme was closed to new entrants from 31 December 1995.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the company but are managed by the company.
The contributions are determined by an independent qualied actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the attained age method since the scheme is now closed to new members.
The most recent triennial valuation was at 31 March 2002.
The full actuarial valuation carried out at 31 March 2002 was updated to 31 December 2002 by a qualied independent actuary for the purposes of FRS17: Retirement Benets.
On 31 December 2001 the ISIS group employees who were members of the Friends Provident Staff Pension Scheme FPPS transferred to the ISIS Asset Management plc Pension Fund.
From 1 January 2002 these employees were treated as dened benefit members in accordance with FRS17: Dened Benets.
Prior to the transfer, certain ISIS group employees, who had been employed by Friends Provident prior to becoming an ISIS employee, were members of a funded dened benets scheme operated by Friends Provident plc.
The scheme assets were held separately from those of Friends Provident plc in an independently administered fund.
The obligation and commitment of ISIS in respect of this scheme were similar to that of a dened contribution scheme.
This scheme has been treated as a multi-employer scheme in accordance with FRS17: Dened Benets until 31 December 2001 because ISIS had no contractual right to a share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the FPPS prior to the date of transfer.
The RSA Investments employees who joined ISIS were offered the opportunity to join the ISIS Group Personal Pension Plan or establish their own personal pension arrangements.
The groups obligation is to pay dened contributions in respect of these employees, with effect from 1 July 2002.
All their existing arrangements with the Royal & SunAlliance Insurance group ceased at 30 June 2002 and their accrued benets remain the obligation of the Royal & SunAlliance Insurance groups pension schemes, unless individuals elect in respect of transfer the value of accrued benets to their new pension arrangements.

Pension commitments contd The company made no contributions to the ISIS Asset Management plc Pension Fund for the year ended 31 December 2002 2001 nil.
The company, having received advice from the Scheme Actuary, has agreed to recommence contributions with effect from 1 January 2003 to the pension fund at a rate of 25% of eligible earnings.
As the ISIS Asset Management plc Pension Fund is a closed scheme, under the projected unit method the current service cost will tend to increase as a percentage of pensionable salaries as the average age of members increases.

Treasury management and financial instruments ISIS, as a fund management group, requires to have sufficient regulatory capital to meet the capital adequacy requirement of its regulators.
ISIS, therefore, adopts a low-risk approach to treasury management and financial instruments, endeavouring to ensure that its regulatory capital is managed and preserved appropriately and other financial exposures, to the extent they exist, are managed or hedged where appropriate.
Group treasury operations are managed by the Finance function within parameters dened by the board.
The regulatory capital and treasury position of the group is regularly reported to the board.
The policy is designed to manage risk and recognises that treasury management operations are specically not treated as a profit centre.
The key aspects of this policy and its implementation are detailed below:.
The Board Reserved List prohibits the establishment of borrowing facilities without the prior approval of the board..
Placing of funds on deposit will be short term maximum term 90 days to ensure such balances are eligible for inclusion as regulatory capital..
Deposits may only be placed with counterparties approved by the ISIS Credit Committee and the board set the appropriate limit of exposure to any one counterparty..
The Board Reserved List prohibits the use of derivatives including futures, options and forward contracts, in respect of own funds, without prior board approval.. Foreign currency exposure is managed to reduce the risk and impact of movement in exchange rates.
The directors gave careful consideration to the appropriate funding structure for nancing the RSA Investments acquisition.
The board deemed it appropriate to fund a significant portion of the purchase price by a xed-rate term loan 180 million thereby ensuring no downside exposure existed from any increases in interest rates.
In addition to existing cash resources, the board elected to enter into a oating-rate revolving credit facility to fund the remaining element of the purchase consideration.
The latter facility was selected to allow sufficient exibility and debt capacity during the integration period.
As a result of the new loan and credit facility being utilised the group requires to charge the on-going interest costs of servicing this debt to its profit & loss account in each financial year.
The board considered that no other changes were required to the treasury policy as a result of the RSA Investments acquisition.

Limited Partnerships The group operated six Private Equity Limited Partnerships during the year.
The group manages these investments and is a general partner in these Partnerships.
The Partnerships are deemed to be subsidiaries of the general partner by virtue of control: however, the directors do not consider it appropriate to consolidate the results of the Limited Partnerships in the accounts of ISIS Asset Management plc group as the groups rights are held in a duciary capacity.
This treatment does not comply with FRS 2: Accounting for Subsidiary Undertakings or the Companies Act 1985.
The directors believe that the substance of the general partners capacity makes it appropriate to invoke this true and fair override.
Had these partnerships been consolidated the effect on the consolidated balance sheet would have been as follows: 31 December 31 December 2002 2001 000 000 Investments 4 3 Net Assets 51,300 60,492 Minority Interest 51,296 60,489 At 31 December 2002 the ISIS group owed the Limited Partnerships 218,000 2001 164,000.
At 31 December 2002 the Limited Partnerships owed the ISIS group 700,000 2001 Nil.
