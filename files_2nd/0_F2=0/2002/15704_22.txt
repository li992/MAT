Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31 December 2002 1.
Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modied by the revaluation of certain assets, and are in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The following principal accounting policies have been applied: Changes to accounting policies The Group has adopted the provisions of FRS 17 Accounting for Retirement Benets and FRS 19 Accounting for Deferred Tax in full during the year and has made the required disclosure in notes 8 and 29 respectively.
2001 comparatives have also been restated for these accounting policy changes as set out in note 23.
There have been no other changes to the accounting policies of the Group in the year.
Consolidation The consolidated accounts incorporate the accounts of Tibbett & Britten Group plc and all subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December 2002.
Associated undertakings are accounted for by the equity method and joint ventures by the gross equity method.
The results of subsidiary, joint venture and associated undertakings are included for their respective periods of ownership by the Group.
Goodwill Goodwill, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration for purchase of subsidiary undertakings over the fair value of net assets acquired and other purchased goodwill, is capitalised in the year of acquisition.
It is amortised through the profit and loss account over the directors estimate of its useful life, which is between five and 20 years.
As permitted by FRS 10, goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998 has not been reinstated to intangible xed assets from reserves.
Turnover Turnover represents the net invoiced value of goods and services sold outside the Group exclusive of value added and sales taxes.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual values, of all tangible xed assets, except freehold land, over their expected useful lives.
Certain xed assets are depreciated in line with the residual values provided under contractual arrangements with customers.
Depreciation is generally calculated on a straight line basis on the original cost or valuation of the assets at the following rates: 2 1 Freehold buildings 2%-6 3% pa Motor vehicles 6%-33 3% pa 1 Leasehold land and buildings over the length of the lease Plant and ttings 7%-33 3% pa Investments Fixed asset investments are held at cost unless, in the opinion of the directors, there has been an impairment, in which case an appropriate adjustment is made.
Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Foreign currency Assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The effect of variances in exchange rates between the beginning and the end of the financial year on the net investment in subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates is dealt with through reserves.
The results of overseas subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates are translated into sterling using average exchange rates for the financial year and variances compared with exchange rates at the balance sheet date are dealt with through reserves.
All other monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Resulting exchange gains and losses are taken to the profit and loss account.
Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when xed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the financial statements.
Neither is deferred tax recognised when xed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future has been entered into by the subsidiary or associate.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Leased assets Plant, equipment and vehicles which are leased, but provide the Group with substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, are capitalised at the original cost of the lease and depreciated over their expected useful lives.
Lease payments are split between capital and interest using the actuarial method.
Interest payments are charged to the profit and loss account and capital payments reduce the amounts payable to the lessor.
Payments in respect of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account in the period to which they relate.
Revaluation of properties and xed asset investments The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of FRS 15 Tangible Fixed Assets and retained the book amounts of certain freehold properties which were revalued prior to the implementation of that standard.
The properties were last revalued at 31 December 1995 and the valuations have not subsequently been updated.
Contract accounting Costs and revenues relating to contracts with customers are matched on an accruals basis over the contract lives.
Pension costs For dened benefit schemes the amounts charged to operating profit are the current service costs and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments.
They are included as part of staff costs.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account if the benets have vested.
If the benets have not vested immediately, the costs are recognised over the period until vesting occurs.
The interest cost and the expected return on assets are shown as a net amount of other finance costs or credits adjacent to interest.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Dened benefit schemes are funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the Group, in separate trustee administered funds.
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit method and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the scheme liabilities.
The actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date.
The resulting dened benefit asset or liability, net of related deferred tax is presented separately after other net assets on the face of the balance sheet.

Accounting policies continued For dened contribution schemes the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benets is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Financial instruments In relation to the disclosures made in note 19, short term debtors and creditors are not treated as financial assets or liabilities.
The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments.
Employee share schemes The cost of awards to employees under the Long Term Incentive Plan is recognised over the periods to which the employees performance relates.
No cost is recognised in respect of SAYE schemes that are offered on similar terms to all, or substantially, all employees.
Contingencies In the normal course of business the Group enters into litigation and dispute resolution proceedings in contracts.
The Group legal department control the appointment of external legal advisers to assess risks, advise and act on the Groups behalf.
This advice forms the basis of any provisions and disclosures made in the accounts.

The Groups overseas tax rates are generally higher than those in the UK.
No provision has been made for deferred taxation on gains recognised on the revaluation of properties as there is currently no intention to sell those properties.
The amount of deferred tax that has not been provided on revalued xed assets is 4.0m 2001 4.0m.
The Group provides for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that they will reverse in the future.
Some of the Groups overseas operations have generated tax losses in the past, the future utilisation of which is uncertain.
The Group has therefore not recognised a deferred tax asset of 2.3m 2001 2.4m in respect of tax losses of overseas companies.

These, together with the financial instruments listed above, create a hedge which reduces the Groups exposure to movements in interest rates.

The Group is principally exposed to North American currencies and the Euro.
The Group has hedged between 30% and 60% of expected earnings for 2003 by selling forward such currencies the value of these forward contracts at 31 December 2002 was 0.2m.
