Accounting policies continued Stocks Stocks are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value, after making due provision against obsolete and slow-moving items.
In the case of manufactured goods the term cost includes ingredients, production wages and production overheads.
Current asset investments Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost or market value.
Foreign currencies Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date, or at the contracted rate as appropriate.
The assets and liabilities of overseas operations are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The results of overseas operations have been translated at the average rate prevailing during the year.
Exchange differences arising on consolidation are taken directly to reserves.
Other exchange differences are dealt with as part of operating profits.
Group turnover Turnover represents the net invoiced value of goods and services delivered to customers excluding value added tax.
Pensions The group has established separately funded pension schemes for the benefit of permanent staff, which vary with employment conditions in the countries concerned.
Net pension costs are charged to income over the expected average remaining service lives of employees.
Any differences between the charge for pensions and total contributions are included within pension provisions or debtors as appropriate.
Research and development Expenditure in respect of research and development is written off against profits in the period in which it is incurred.
Leases All material leases entered into by the group are operating leases, whereby substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset remain with the lessor.
Rental payments are charged against profits on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Financial instruments Forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options are used to hedge forecast transactional cash ows and accordingly, any gains or losses on these contracts are recognised in the profit and loss account when the underlying transaction is settled.
Derivative commodity contracts are used to hedge committed purchases or sales of commodities and accordingly, any gains or losses on these contracts are recognised in the profit and loss account in the same accounting period as the underlying purchase or sale.
Gains or losses arising on hedging instruments which are cancelled due to the termination of the underlying exposure are taken to the profit and loss account immediately.
Deferred tax The group has adopted FRS 19 Deferred Taxation, whereby provision for deferred tax is made on all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be sufficient future taxable profits.
Deferred tax is not discounted.
Adoption of FRS 19 has the effect of increasing the underlying tax charge on profits by 11 million for the year ended 14 September 2002 2001 12 million.
It also increases the profit on disposal of businesses in the year ended 15 September 2001 by 12 million.
Shareholders funds at 15 September 2001 have been reduced by 91 million.
A prior year adjustment has been made and comparative figures have been restated.
