Signed on behalf of the Board on 14 May 2003: Sir Martin Sorrell P W G Richardson Group chief executive Group finance director As provided by Section 230, Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account for the Company has not been presented.
Included within the consolidated profit and loss account for the financial year is a loss of 932.3 million 2001: profit of 7.7 million, 2000: profit of 932.0 million in respect of the Company.
This includes dividend income received from subsidiaries of 54.0 million 2001: 0.1 million, 2000: 923.0 million and an impairment charge of 940.6 million 2001: Nil, 2000: Nil.
The impairment charge arose as a result of the transfer of a number of non-operating, holding companies within the Group.
The impairment charge arising as a result of this internal reorganisation has been offset against the Companys non-distributable reserves.
These non-distributable reserves arose from dividends in 2000 901.7 million and 2002 38.9 million from the investments which have been impaired.
This has no impact on the Companys distributable reserves.
