Post-retirement liabilities Defined benefit schemes United Kingdom The principal pension plan operated for UK employees is the IMI Pension Fund, a defined benefit plan set up under trust so that the Funds assets are held separately from those of the Company.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the Fund for funding purposes was as at 31 March 2002.
This valuation revealed that, under the methods and assumptions adopted, the Funds assets were 106% of the accrued liabilities, allowing for projected future salary increases in the case of members in service.
The surplus revealed by this valuation is being used to abate the Companys cash contribution to the level of employee contributions subject to annual review.
The pension cost charged to the profit and loss account is calculated by an independent actuary in such a way as to spread the cost of pensions over the average remaining service life of employees in membership.
The pension costs are based on the most recent actuarial review which was completed with an effective date of 31 March 2002.
63 IMI plc Annual Report 2002 Notes relating to the financial statements 24.
Post-retirement liabilities continued The actuarial method used to calculate the pension cost was the projected unit method.
The most significant assumptions adopted were the real i. e. relative to the assumed rate of price inflation long-term rate of investment return at 3.9% pa and that this would exceed the increase in earnings by 2.4% pa and the increase in pensions by 3.9% pa.
Under the method and assumptions adopted, the value placed on the Funds assets was 90% of the market value and 106% of the value placed on the accrued liabilities.
The market value of the assets as at 31 March 2002 was 915m.
Overseas A number of local pension plans are operated for overseas employees.
Some of these plans are funded in a similar way to the UK Fund but others are book reserve arrangements where the liability is shown on the balance sheet.
In total the overseas defined benefit plans had liabilities valued at approximately 49m of which 29m was in this type of book reserve arrangement.
In the remaining funds assets of approximately 20m are currently held against liabilities of 20m.
The net benefit to the profit and loss account from amortising surpluses less deficits is shown in note 1.
Defined contribution schemes: In addition to the above defined benefit schemes, the Group operates several defined contribution schemes throughout the world.
In the year to 31 December 2002 the total number of employer contributions to these schemes was 6m.
FRS 17 disclosure The Group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with SSAP24: Pension costs'.
Under FRS 17: 'Retirement benefits' the following transitional disclosures are required: The valuations used for FRS 17 disclosures have been based upon the most recent actuarial valuations updated by the scheme actuaries to take account of the requirements of FRS 17.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the main UK scheme was as at 31 March 2002.
Schemes have been aggregated below and weighted averages applied.
The major financial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities at 31 December under FRS 17 are: 2002 2001 UK Overseas UK Overseas %%% % Rate of increase in salaries 4.0 4.4 4.2 4.1 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.3 1.4 2.5 0.6 Discount rate 5.6 6.2 5.8 6.7 Inflation assumption 2.3 2.9 2.5 2.6 The assets in the schemes and the expected long term rates of return at 31 December were: 2002 2001 UK Overseas UK Overseas Rate of return % % % % Equities 8.2 8.0 7.8 8.7 Bonds 4.9 6.0 5.0 6.8 Property 7.2 - 7.8 - Other 4.0 5.5 4.0 - 7.0 7.2 6.8 8.2 64 IMI plc Annual Report 2002 Notes relating to the financial statements 2002 2001 UK Overseas Total UK Overseas Total Value m m m m m m Equities 484 14 498 580 24 604 Bonds 235 5 240 274 7 281 Property 23 - 23 22 - 22 Other 28 3 31 37 - 37 Total market value of assets 770 22 792 913 31 944 Present value of funded scheme liabilities 868 35 903 862 30 892 Deficit surplus on funded schemes 98 13 111 51 1 52 Present value of unfunded scheme liabilities - 34 34 - 27 27 Deficit surplus in all schemes 98 47 145 51 26 25 Related deferred tax asset liability 48 13 Net pension liability asset 97 12 Of the overseas unfunded liabilities of 21m 34m offset by associated deferred tax asset of 13m, 18m 29m less deferred tax of 11m is already recognised within the Group balance sheet on a SSAP24 basis, together with a pension prepayment of 5m see notes 15 and 19.
Full implementation of FRS 17 at 31 December 2002 would therefore have resulted in the recognition of a further liability of 84m as analysed below.
If FRS 17 had been adopted in the financial statements, the Group's net assets and profit and loss reserve at 31 December would have been as follows: 2002 2001 m m Net assets Net assets per Group balance sheet 531 493 Add back unfunded pension liability net of deferred tax SSAP24 basis 18 24 Deduct pension prepayment 5 8 FRS 17 net pension liability asset 97 12 Net assets as adjusted 447 521 Reserves Profit and loss reserve per Group balance sheet 303 268 Add back unfunded pension liability net of deferred tax SSAP24 basis 18 24 Deduct pension prepayment 5 8 FRS 17 net pension liability asset 97 12 Profit and loss reserve as adjusted 219 296 65 IMI plc Annual Report 2002 Notes relating to the financial statements 24.
