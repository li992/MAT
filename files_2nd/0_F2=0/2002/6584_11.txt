The unaudited pro forma comparative figures for the continuing GKN Group which appear on pages 40 to 45 have been prepared as if the Industrial Servicesbusinesses which were demerged from the former GKN Group in August 2001 had been demerged on 1 January 2001 and exclude the costs of the transaction itself.
They are based on the audited consolidated accounts of the GKN Group for the year ended 31 December 2001 from which the results of the Industrial Services businesses have been eliminated.
The pro forma dividend for 2001 is based on 11.0p per share as noted in last years annual report.
Comparative figures have been restated to reflect the first time adoption of FRS 19 Deferred Tax.
The standard requires deferred tax liabilities or assets to be recognised in respect of transactions and events which have occurred by the balance sheet date.
At the end of 2001 the net deferred tax liability was 52 million in subsidiaries, an increase of 50 million over the previous basis.
Within joint ventures, the share of the deferred tax liability has increased by 13 million and goodwill arising on the formation of AgustaWestland in 2001 has reduced by 3 million.
Consequently, shareholders equity at the end of 2001 was reduced by 66 million.
The impact on the profit and loss account was an increase in the tax charge of 3 million in 2002 and 4 million in 2001.
2 Exceptional items 2002 2001 m m a Operating exceptional items Asset impairments 14 70 Redundancy costs 15 23 Other 8 9 37 102 Following the substantial downturn in civil aviation markets and uncertainties surrounding North American vehicle production levels, which were apparent in the second half of 2001, the Group took steps to reduce capacity in a number of aerospace and automotive plants.
A reassessment was also made of the carrying value of certain aerospace assets.
This resulted in a charge to operating profit of 102 million in 2001 with a further 37 million in 2002 in respect of actions which had not been announced by 31 December 2001 and could not, therefore, be accrued in the 2001 accounts.
The cash outflow from these and earlier actions was 52 million in 2002 and 27 million in 2001.

45 GKN plc 2002 3 Earnings per share Earnings per share for 2002 are based on earnings of the year of 100 million 2001 38 million and calculated on the weighted average number of 729.2 million shares in issue and ranking for dividend 2001 720.1 million shares.
Diluted earnings per share, which takes into account options over GKN plc shares, is calculated on the weighted average number of 734.6 million 2001 727.6 million shares.
Earnings per share before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, which the Directors consider gives a useful additional indication of underlying performance, is calculated on the earnings of the year adjusted as follows: Earnings Earnings per share Restated Restated note1 note1 2002 2001 2002 2001 m m p p Earnings of the year 100 38 13.7 5.3 Included in operating profit: Goodwill amortisation 48 43 6.5 6.0 Exceptional items 37 102 5.1 14.2 Non-operating exceptional items 2 7 0.3 1.0 Taxation attributable to exceptional items 3 3 0.4 0.5 Earnings before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items 184 173 25.2 24.0 46 GKN plc 2002 CONSOLIDATED PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2002 Continuing operations Restated note 1 Acquisitions Other Total Total in year companies 2002 2001 Notes m m m m Sales Subsidiaries 2 31 3,274 3,305 3,432 Share of joint ventures 1,051 1,051 1,463 Share of associates 43 53 96 57 2 74 4,378 4,452 4,952 Operating profit Subsidiaries: Before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items 4 192 196 203 Goodwill amortisation 42 42 40 Exceptional items 4 37 37 106 Totalsubsidiaries 3 4 113 117 57 Share of joint ventures: Before goodwill amortisation 116 116 180 Goodwill amortisation 6 6 9 Totalshare of joint ventures 110 110 171 Share of associates 123 3 Total operating profit 5 225 230 231 Exceptional items Profits less losses on sale or closure of businesses: Subsidiaries 4 2 2 1 Share of associates 4 5 Demerger costs 4 20 Profit before interest and taxation 5 223 228 215 Net interest payable: Subsidiaries 5 47 59 Share of joint ventures and associates 5 1 21 Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 180 135 Taxation 6 77 110 Profit on ordinary activities after taxation 103 25 Minority interests equity 3 5 Earnings of the year 100 20 Dividends 7 83 108 Transfer to from reserves 17 88 Earnings per share p 8 13.7 2.8 Diluted earnings per share p 8 13.6 2.7 Results before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items Operating profit m 315 386 Profit before tax m 267 306 Earnings per share p 8 25.2 28.9 47 GKN plc 2002 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT 31 DECEMBER 2002 Restated note 1 2002 2001 Notes m m Fixed assets Intangible assets goodwill 10 470 525 Tangible assets 11 1,374 1,399 1,844 1,924 Investments Joint ventures: Share of gross assets 1,198 1,070 Share of gross liabilities 972 874 226 196 Associates 39 9 Other investments 17 21 12 282 226 Totalfixed assets 2,126 2,150 Current assets Stocks 13 488 503 Debtors 14 561 556 Cash at bank and in hand 15 105 167 1,154 1,226 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Short-term borrowings 16 43 295 Creditors 17 772 730 Taxation payable 18 182 190 Dividend payable 56 53 1,053 1,268 Net current assets liabilities 101 42 Totalassets less current liabilities 2,227 2,108 Creditors: amounts falling due beyond one year Term loans and obligations under finance leases 19 894 754 Provisions for liabilities and charges 22 373 362 Net assets 960 992 Capital and reserves Called up share capital 23 366 364 Share premium account 24 13 3 Revaluation reserve 24 45 45 Other reserves 24 81 84 Profit and loss account 24 607 642 Equity interest 950 970 Minority interest equity 10 22 960 992 The accounts were approved by the Board of Directors on 28 February 2003 and were signed by: Sir David Lees, Kevin Smith, Nigel Stein, Directors 48 GKN plc 2002 STATEMENT OF TOTAL RECOGNISED GAINS AND LOSSES FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2002 2002 2001 m m Earnings of the year Subsidiaries 26 83 Share of joint ventures 71 97 Share of associates 3 6 100 20 Currency variations 43 21 Other reserve movements 4 3 Totalrecognised gains and losses of the year 53 4 Prior year adjustment note 1 66 Totalgains and losses recognised since last annual report 13 4 Earnings of the year on an historical cost basis are not materially different from those reported above.

51 GKN plc 2002 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS 1 Accounting policies Basis of accounting These accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings, and comply with UK applicable accounting standards.
The Directors have conducted a review of the Groups accounting policies and have confirmed that they are the most appropriate for the purposes of giving a true and fair view of the Groups results and that there have been no changes from last year.
One new standard, FRS 19 Deferred Tax, was applied in the period.
Within joint ventures, the share of the deferred taxliability has increased by 13 million and goodwill arising on the formation of AgustaWestland in 2001 has reduced by 3 million.
The impact on the profit and loss account was an increase in the tax charge of 3 million in 2002 and 15 million in 2001.
Comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
Basisofconsolidation The group accounts consolidate the accounts for the year to 31 December 2002 of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss accountfrom the date of acquisition or to the date of disposal.
In the case of acquisitions during the year the acquisition method of accounting is used.
Where material, profits or losses are analysed as discontinued operations where businesses are sold or closed by the date on which the accounts are approved.
Where businesses are treated as sold or closed in the current year, the prior years analyses are restated to reflect those businesses as discontinued.
Foreign currencies The results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated to sterling at average exchange rates.
Where practicable, transactions involving foreign currencies are protected by forward contracts.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the appropriate forward contract rate or, if not covered, at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Differences on revenue transactions are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
The exchange rates used for the currencies most important to the Groups operations are: 1 euro 1 US$ 2002 average 1.59 1.50 2001 average 1.61 1.44 2002 year-end 1.53 1.61 2001 year-end 1.64 1.45 Financial instruments The Groups accounting policy for derivatives is to recognise in the group profit and loss account gains and losses on hedges of revenues or operating payments only as they crystallise.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risks and hedge a proportion of its investment in overseas subsidiaries and investments denominated in foreign currencies, where such hedging can be carried out on an economically acceptable basis.
Such financial instruments are treated as hedges against the underlying assets or liabilities, with matching accounting treatments and cash flows.
All gains or losses are taken to the statement of total recognised gains and losses until the instrument and the underlying hedged investment are sold, when the profit or loss arising is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Interest differentials resulting from the use of financial instruments to hedge these exposures are dealt with in the group profit and loss account.
Any instruments no longer designated as hedges are restated at market value and any gains or losses are taken directly to the profit and loss account.
The book values of short-term debtors and creditors are the same as their fair values and have been excluded from the financial instrument disclosures other than those on currency exposures.
Sales Sales shown in the profit and loss account exclude value added taxes and, except in the case of long-term contracts in the AgustaWestland joint venture, represent the invoiced value of goods and services charged to external customers.
Invoices are raised when goods are despatched to the customer unless other terms have been specifically agreed.
On long-term contracts in AgustaWestland, sales are based on the estimated sales value of work done at the achievement of predetermined milestones.
52 GKN plc 2002 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 1 Accounting policies continued Research and development costs Except as noted below, revenue expenditure on research and development is written off as incurred.
On major aerospace contracts that demonstrablyhave a life of more than ten years, net non-recurring initial costs consisting of design, development and tooling are categorised as stocks and are amortised over a maximum period of ten years from the start of serial production.
On other contracts, design and development costs are written off as incurred and tooling over three years.
Reorganisation costs Costs of reorganisation and redundancy, which are not part of a fundamental restructuring, are charged against operating profit in the period when the announcement is made.
Intangible assets goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions completed prior to 31 December 1997 has been eliminated against reserves.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions after that date is capitalised as a fixed asset and amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life up to a maximum of 20 years.
Where an acquired business is sold and goodwill has been previously deducted from reserves, the goodwill is taken into account in calculating the profit or loss on sale.
Tangible fixed assets Cost Tangible fixed assets are valued at cost or valuation less accumulated depreciation.
Cost comprises the purchase price plus costs directly incurred in bringing the asset into use but excludes interest.
Where freehold and long leasehold properties were carried at a valuation at 23 March 2000, the date of implementation of FRS 15, these values have been retained as book values in accordance with the transitional arrangements of that standard.
Where assets are in the course of construction at the balance sheet date they are classified as capital work in progress.
Transfers are made to other asset categories when they are available for use.
Depreciation Depreciation is not provided on freehold land or assets in the course of construction.
In the case of buildings, computers and contract specific plant, depreciation is provided on valuation or original cost.
For all other categories of asset, depreciation is provided on the written down value at the beginning of the financial year.
Depreciation is applied to specific classes of asset so as to reduce them to their residual values over their estimated useful lives.
The range of main rates of depreciation used are: Straight Reducing line balance %% Freehold buildings 2 General plant, machinery, fixtures, fittings and equipment 10 to 20 10 to 35 1 Computers and major software 20 to 33 3 Commercial vehicles and cars 40 to 45 Leasehold properties are amortised by equal annual instalments over the period of the lease or 50 years, whichever is the shorter.
Leased assets Where fixed assets are financed by leasing arrangements which give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased and the capital element of the leasing commitment is shown as obligations under finance leases.
The rentals payable are apportioned between interest, which is charged to the profit and loss account, and capital which reduces the outstanding obligation.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred over the lease term.
Joint ventures and associated companies Joint ventures, although not subsidiaries, are those businesses in which the Group has a long-term interest and is able to share control with its partners under a contractual arrangement.
Associates are those businesses in which the Group has a long-term interest and is able to exercise significant influence through its representation on the Board of Directors.
Joint ventures and associates are accounted for in accordance with FRS 9 whereby the profit and loss account includes, at the appropriate line, the Groups share of their sales, operating profit, exceptional items, interest and taxation.
They are stated in the balance sheet at the Groups share of their equity.
Where the size criteria of FRS 9 are met additional information is given by way of note to the accounts.
53 GKN plc 2002 Stocks Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, due allowance being made for obsolete or slow-moving items.
Cost includes the relevant proportion of works overheads assuming normal levels of activity.
Taxation Following the introduction of FRS 19 provision is made for deferred tax in so far as a liability or asset arises as a result of transactions that have occurred by the balance sheet date and give rise to an obligation to pay more tax in future, or a right to pay less tax in future.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that it may be regarded as recoverable.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised are not discounted.
No provision is made for any additional taxation which might arise on remittance of retained profits of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates except where distribution of such profits is planned.
Pensions and post-retirement benefits The Groups pension arrangements comprise various defined benefit and defined contribution schemes throughout the world.
In the UK and in certain overseas companies pension arrangements are made through externally funded defined benefit schemes, the contributions to which are based on the advice of independent actuaries or in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
In other overseas companies funds are retained within the business to provide for retirement obligations.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account is calculated, in accordance with SSAP 24, by independent actuaries as being the expected cost of providing pensions on a systematic and rational basis over the period during which the Group expects to derive benefit from the employees services.

A reassessment was also made of the carrying value of certain aerospace assets: and ii in 2001, the demerger of the Industrial Services businesses, which, together with the formation of the AgustaWestland joint venture at the beginning of the year, resulted in a number of investments not appropriate to the engineering activities of the Group being written off and a reduction in the level of central overheads.
These actions resulted in a charge to operating profit of 106 million in 2001 and a further 37 million in 2002 in respect of actions which had not been announced by 31 December 2001 and could not, therefore, be accrued.

20 Analysis of financial liabilities The disclosures made in notes 20 and 21 should be read in conjunction with the discussion of the Groups objectives, policies and strategies with regard to financial instruments in the Financial Review on pages 36 to 39.
Short-term debtors and creditors arising directly from the Groups operations are excluded from the following disclosures other than those on currency exposures.
After taking into account the various interest rate and forward foreign exchange contracts entered into by the Group, the effective currency and interest rate exposure of the Groups borrowings were as follows: Fixed rate borrowings Weighted Weighted average time Floating rate Fixed rate Total average for which rate borrowings borrowings borrowings interest rate is fixed m m m % Years At 31 December 2002 Sterling 22 702 724 7.0 12.9 US dollar 43 1 44 5.1 9.4 Euro 68 1 69 0.3 7.7 Other 101 1 102 3.5 234 705 939 6.9 12.9 At 31 December 2001 Sterling 644 330 974 7.1 16.7 US dollar 11 1 12 5.2 10.3 Euro 21 1 22 0.2 6.3 Other 43 1 44 1.3 4.2 719 333 1,052 7.1 16.6 The interest rates on floating rate borrowings are determined by reference to applicable LIBORs.
63 GKN plc 2002 The maturity of the Groups borrowings at 31 December 2002 was as follows: 2002 2001 m m Bank loans, overdrafts and other borrowings repayable as follows: Within one year 43 295 One to two years 10 329 Two to five years 149 86 After five years 718 330 920 1,040 Finance leases repayable as follows: Within one year 2 3 One to two years 1 3 Two to five years 3 3 After five years 13 3 19 12 Total borrowings 939 1,052 At 31 December 2002 the Group had the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities: 2002 2001 m m Expiring within one year 57 137 Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years 137 Expiring in more than two years 560 215 617 489 21 Financial instruments a Financial assets Bank and cash Short-term loans balances and deposits 2002 2001 2002 2001 m m m m Sterling 17 20 19 US dollar 30 62 Euro 16 38 3 Other 23 24 13 7 69 141 36 26 The bank and cash balances comprise 26 million 2001 67 million in respect of short-term balances earning interest and 43 million 2001 74 million in respect of balances which are non-interest earning.
The weighted average interest rate at year-end on the interest earning cash balances, which was all floating and set by reference to relevant LIBORs, was 3.5% 2001 2.2%.
Surplus cash is deposited for short-term periods typically with a maturity of less than three months.
The weighted average interest rate on the deposit account balances is 3.2% 2001 3.1%.
b Currency exposures As explained in the Financial Review on page 38, the Groups objective in managing the translational currency exposures arising from its overseas investments is to ensure that changes in the sterling equivalent of assets and liabilities caused by currency movements do not have a material impact on the sterling value of shareholders equity.
At 31 December 2002, there were 656 million of indirect borrowings created through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge such exposures denominated in euro 36% and US dollars 64% mirrored by indirectly created sterling deposits.
Net gains and losses arising from these translational currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Interest differentials resulting from the use of financial instruments to hedge those exposures are dealt with through the group profit and loss account.
After taking into account the effects of forward foreign exchange contracts, at 31 December 2002 there were no material currency exposures that give rise to gains or losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
64 GKN plc 2002 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 21 Financial instruments continued c Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The comparison of fair and book values of all the Groups financialassets and liabilities at 31 December 2002 is set out below: 2002 2001 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations Bank and cash balances 69 69 141 141 Short-term loans and deposits 36 36 26 26 Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term borrowings 43 43 295 295 Long-term borrowings 877 901 745 741 Finance leases 19 19 12 12 Financial instruments held to manage interest rate and currency exposures Interest rate swaps and similar instruments 2 4 1 Forward foreign exchange contracts 5 5 Financial instruments held to hedge currency exposures on expected future trading transactions Forward foreign exchange contracts 17 At 31 December 834 851 889 894 In addition to the above, the Group has a loan to joint ventures and associates, shown within investments, with a book value of 15 million and fair value of 17 million.
The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating fair values for financial instruments: Short-term borrowings, cash and deposits approximate to book value due to their short maturities.
Long-term borrowings: Bank and other loans carrying fixed rates of interest the repayments which the Group is committed to make have been discounted at the relevant interest rates applicable at 31 December 2002.
Bonds quoted closing market value.
Interest rate instruments discounted cash flow analysis based on interest rates derived from market yield curves.
Forward exchange contracts and currency swaps marked-to-market.
d Hedges As explained in the Financial Review on page 38, the Groups policy is to hedge the exposures summarised below.
Translational currency exposures are hedged where the costs and results of such hedging are economically acceptable.
Interest rate risk using interest rate swaps, swaptions and forward rate agreements.
Transactional and translational currency exposures using forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps.
Gains or losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains or losses on instruments used for hedging both transactional and translational currency exposures and the movements therein, are as follows: Total net Gains Losses gains losses m m m Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 31 December 2001 40 49 9 Gains and losses from previous years recognised in 2002 24 22 2 Gains and losses arising before 1 January 2002 that were not recognised in 2002 16 27 11 Gains and losses arising in 2002 that were not recognised in that year 23 5 18 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 31 December 2002 39 32 7 Expected to be recognised in 2003 28 18 10 Expected to be recognised after 2003 11 14 3 39 32 7 Of the net gains and losses from previous years recognised in 2002, a profit of 5 million was recognised in reserves and matched with offsetting movements on translational foreign exchange variances.
The remainder was recognised in the profit and loss account.
Similarly, of the net unrecognised gains and losses on hedges shown at 31 December 2002, a profit of 5 million will be dealt with through reserves and matched with offsetting movements on translational foreign exchange variances.
The balance will be accounted for in the profit and loss account together with the profits arising on the ultimate realisation of the underlying hedged transactions.

No provision has been made for deferred taxation in relation to gains recognised on revaluing assets to their market value or on the sale of assets where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into the cost of replacement assets.
Such tax would only become payable if assets were sold without it being possible to roll over any resultant gains.
The total amount unprovided for is 9 million 2001 7 million.
It is not anticipated that any such tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
No provision has been made for deferred taxation which might arise on the remittance of retained profits of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates except where the distribution of such profits is planned.
Post-retirement Post-retirement includes provisions relating to pension benefits of 175 million 2001 159 million and provisions for other post-retirement benefits of 55 million 2001 54 million.
Other Other provisions comprise mainly legal and other claims, environmental and warranty provisions, the timing of which is inherently uncertain.
They are established based on historical information or professional assessment.

26 Post-retirement benefits The Groups pension arrangements comprise various defined benefit and defined contribution schemes throughout the world.
In the UK, pension arrangements are made through externally funded defined benefit schemes.
Independent actuarial valuations of the three main schemes were last carried out as at April 2000 using the projected unit method.
The market value related basis assumed a yield pre-retirement of 6.5% per annum, which exceeded the annual rate of increases in pensionable salaries by 2.5% GKN Group Pension Scheme and the Westland Staff Pension Scheme and 2% Executive and Senior Staff Pension Scheme with a yield post-retirement of 5.0% per annum, which exceeded pension increases by 2.5%.
The aggregate market value of the assets at the valuation date was 2,046 million and the aggregate funding level on an ongoing basis was 101%.
With effect from 1 July 2002, a new pension scheme was established for the joint venture company AgustaWestland, with current AgustaWestland employees transferring to the new scheme.
Remaining members of the Westland Staff Pension Scheme and the GKN Executive and Senior Staff Pension Scheme, including pensioners and deferred pensioners are being transferred into the GKN Group Pension Scheme.
Assets to the value of 237 million at 1 July 2002 were agreed to be transferred to the new AgustaWestland Scheme, the amount eventually transferred being indexed to the payment date.
The remaining assets and liabilities of the GKN UK schemes were estimated to be 1,454 million and 1,820 million respectively as at 1 July 2002, based on market conditions at that date.

The Group operates a number of retirement plans which provide certain employees with post-retirement healthcare benefits.
