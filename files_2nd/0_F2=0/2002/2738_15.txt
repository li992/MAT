CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 44 Notes to the Accounts For the year ended 31 December 2002 1 Accounting Policies a Accounting convention Cairn prepares its accounts under the historical cost convention.
b Accounting standards Cairn prepares its accounts in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
"Cairns accounts fall within the scope of the Statement of Recommended Practice ""SORP"" issued by the Oil Industry Accounting Committee, ""Accounting for Oil and Gas Exploration, Development, Production and Decommissioning Activities"" and have been prepared in accordance with the provisions thereof."
c Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the results of Cairn Energy Bangladesh PLC and its subsidiary undertakings to 31 December.
The consolidated profit and loss account and cash flow statement include the results and cash flows of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year, using the acquisition method of accounting.
The consolidated profit and loss account and cash flow statement include the results and cash flows of subsidiary undertakings, either fully or partially disposed of during the year, up to the date of disposal.
Cairn allocates the purchase consideration of any acquisition to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair values at the date of acquisition.
In accordance with FRS 10, goodwill arising on acquisitions since 1 January 1998 is capitalised, classified as an asset and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life, subject to review for impairment in periods where events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill previously eliminated against reserves at 31 December 1997 has not been reinstated on implementation of FRS 10.
No Company profit and loss account is presented, as provided by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. d Turnover Turnover in 2002 represents Cairns share of oil, gas and condensate production and tariff income, recognised on a direct entitlement basis.
e Fixed assets Cairn follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas assets.
Under this method, all expenditure incurred in connection with and directly attributable to the acquisition, exploration, appraisal and development of oil and gas assets is capitalised in two geographical cost pools: South Asia and North Sea.
This includes interest payable and exchange differences incurred on borrowings directly attributable to development projects.
The capitalisation of expenditure under each phase of the project ends on completion of that phase.
Acquisition, exploration and appraisal expenditure is capitalised as exploration assets within the balance sheet.
Exploration assets expenditure is transferred to development producing assets when the commercial reserves attributable to the underlying asset have been established.
Further expenditure on fixed assets in the production phase is capitalised where future economic benefit is enhanced.
Net proceeds from any disposal of oil and gas assets are credited against the previously capitalised costs.
CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 45 Notes to the Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2002 f Depletion, impairment and depreciation Depletion Cairn depletes expenditure on oil and gas production and development on a unit of production basis, based on proved and probable reserves.
Impairment Exploration assets are reviewed regularly for indications of impairment and costs are written off where circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable.
In such circumstances if the exploration asset has a corresponding development producing cost pool, then the exploration costs are transferred to that cost pool and are written off on a unit of production basis through the depletion charge.
Where there is no such development producing cost pool, the exploration costs are charged immediately to the profit and loss account.
Impairment reviews on development producing oil and gas assets are carried out from a geographical pool perspective, in accordance with FRS 11.
Each year, the net book value of the pool is compared with the associated discounted future cash flows.
If the net book value is higher, then the difference is written off to the profit and loss account as impairment.
Where there has been a charge for impairment in an earlier year, that charge can be reversed in a later period to the extent that the discounted cash flows for that period are higher than the net book value at the time.
Depreciation Fixed assets, other than oil and gas assets, are depreciated over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Annual Rate % Depreciation Method Tenants improvements 10 - 20 straight line Vehicles, fixtures and equipment 25 - 50 straight line g Decommissioning At the end of the producing life of a field, costs are incurred in removing and decommissioning production facilities.
Cairn recognises the full discounted cost of decommissioning as an asset and liability when the obligation to rectify environmental damage arises.
The decommissioning asset is included within fixed assets with the cost of the related installation.
The liability is included within provisions.
Revisions to the estimated costs of decommissioning which alter the level of the provisions required are also reflected in adjustments to the decommissioning asset.
"The amortisation of the asset, calculated on a unit of production basis based on proved and probable reserves, is shown as the ""decommissioning charge"" in the profit and loss account, and the unwinding of discount is included within ""other finance costs - unwinding of discount""."
h Foreign currencies In the accounts of individual Group companies, Cairn translates foreign currency transactions into local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are taken to the profit and loss account except for those incurred on borrowings in respect of development projects, which are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
Cairn maintains the accounts of all overseas subsidiary undertakings and branches in US$, with the exception of certain Dutch companies which are recorded in Euros previously NLG.
Cairn translates overseas subsidiary accounts using the closing rate method, whereby assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and profit and loss items are translated into sterling at average rates for the year.
Cairn takes exchange differences arising on the translation of net assets and associated long term borrowings of overseas subsidiary undertakings and branches directly to reserves.
CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 46 Rates of exchange to 1 were as follows: 31 December Average 31 December 2002 2002 2001 US$ 1.604 1.503 1.455 1.531 1.591 1.635 i Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay less or to receive more tax, with the following exceptions: provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation and similar fair value adjustments of fixed assets, and gains on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold: provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable: deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
j Pension scheme During the year, Cairn operated defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and India.
The assets of the schemes were held separately from those of Cairn and its subsidiaries.
The pension cost charge represents contributions payable in the year in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
As required under Indian legislation, the Group also operates a defined benefit scheme for certain Indian employees.
Contributions are assessed annually for any surplus deficit in funding based on the annual actuarial valuation.
The scheme is funded to the required level at least annually.
On the grounds of materiality, contributions have been charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Pension charges are detailed in note 5. k Leasing commitments Cairn charges rental payable under operating leases to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
l Share schemes The costs of awards to employees, in the form of shares or the rights to shares, under the LTIP are recognised over the period to which the employees performance relates.
The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the shares at the date of the award or at the date of purchase, where purchases have been made by the Cairn Energy PLC Employees Share Trust, and on a reasonable expectation of the extent to which the performance criteria will be met.
CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 47 Notes to the Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2002 2 Change in Accounting Policy FRS 19 became mandatory for all UK companies with accounting periods ending on or after 23 January 2002.
FRS 19 requires that provision is made for deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in a tax computation.
The provision required under FRS 19 replaces the liability method of accounting for deferred tax previously permitted under SSAP 15 whereby deferred tax was only recognised to the extent that timing differences were expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
Prior period disclosures have been adjusted to reflect this change in accounting policy.
The result is a debit of 9.465m to retained profit and loss reserves.
Current year profit has decreased by 5.3m 2001: 3.860m as a result of implementing FRS 19.

CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 48 Turnover arises from oil, gas and condensate sales and tariff income.
Turnover by destination does not differ materially from turnover by origin.
The exceptional item within turnover 4.3m relates to a provision in respect of the share of petroleum allocated to the GOI in relation to the Ravva joint venture.
For further details see note 4 d. The other exceptional items within operating profit relate to the write-back down of oil and gas assets.
Refer to note 4 c for further details.
Interest receivable, interest payable and foreign exchange differences cannot be allocated specifically to the above geographic areas.
Oil and gas assets are analysed in notes 12 and 13.
The directors consider that the segmentation of other net operating assets into geographic areas is not practicable.
4 Operating Profit a Operating profit is stated after charging: 2002 2001 000 000 Depreciation 1,153 1,281 Operating lease costs - land and buildings 462 455 - other 1,694 629 Auditors remuneration in respect of audit work - UK 69 61 - overseas 90 84 Auditors remuneration in respect of taxation work - UK 28 59 - overseas 63 126 Auditors remuneration in respect of project work - UK 204 136 - overseas 13 46 Auditors remuneration in respect of other work - UK 23 7 - overseas 22 Other advisors fees in respect of taxation work - overseas 135 105 b Reconciliation of operating profit to operating cash flows 2002 2001 000 000 Operating profit 45,677 51,384 Depletion and depreciation 25,368 21,985 Decommissioning charge 917 225 Amortisation provision against investments including LTIP 1,678 1,948 Exceptional write-back of oil and gas assets 1,146 Debtors movement 4,527 10,029 Creditors movement 1,939 910 Other provisions 4,693 1,128 Gain on sale of other fixed assets 12 5 Foreign exchange differences 2,490 407 Net cash inflow from operating activities 72,097 64,883 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 49 Notes to the Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2002 4 Operating Profit continued c Exceptional write-back of oil and gas assets Notes 2002 2001 000 000 Exploration assets 12 787 Development producing assets 13 1,933 1,146 d Other exceptional items In the 2001 Annual Report & Accounts, Cairn disclosed a contingent liability in respect of the Ravva PSC.
The joint ventures calculation of the amount of profit petroleum allocated to the GOI had been challenged and a demand notice issued to the Ravva joint venture for additional profit petroleum payments for prior years.
In August 2002, arbitration proceedings commenced with the GOI to settle this dispute and a provision has been made in these accounts based on a best estimate of the additional profit petroleum payments which might fall due.
This provision of $6.9m 4.3m is disclosed as an exceptional adjustment against turnover, as any additional profit petroleum payment would impact on Cairns entitlement to revenue from the Ravva field.
The related deferred tax credit of $2.9m 1.8m is also disclosed as an exceptional item.

CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 52 b Factors affecting tax charge for year The tax charged for the year is lower than the weighted average rate for the year.
The difference is explained below: 2002 2001 Notes 000 000 Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 43,804 52,026 Tax at weighted average rate of corporation tax of 36.51% 2001: 36.0% 15,992 18,729 Effects of: Permanent differences 621 963 Capital allowances for period in excess of depreciation 2,194 1,583 Other timing differences 903 2,029 Losses arising in the year not relievable against current tax 9 c 1,479 3,515 Utilisation of tax losses 1,724 20,052 Payment of Minimum Alternate Tax 9 c 10,618 Total current tax charge 4,459 3,601 c Factors that may affect future corporate tax charges The Group has now used all brought-forward UK tax losses, which have significantly reduced UK tax payments in previous years.
At 31 December 2002, Cairn had losses of approximately 8.2m 2001: 16m available for offset against future trading profits chargeable to Netherlands Corporate Income Tax but there are restrictions on the use of these losses.
Tax losses incurred in one jurisdiction cannot usually be offset against profits arising in another jurisdiction.
Where losses arising in the year are not relievable against current tax, deferred tax assets have not been recognised.
Cairn operates in countries where the tax rate is different to the UK corporation tax rate, e. g. India 42%.
In India, Minimum Alternate Tax MAT is payable instead of Corporate Income Tax CIT where MAT on accounting profits results in a higher liability than CIT on taxable profits.
Based on current expenditure plans, the Group anticipates that tax allowances will continue to exceed the accounting depletion charge each year.
However the timing of related tax relief is uncertain.
10 Profit Attributable to Members of the Holding Company The profit dealt with in the accounts of Cairn Energy Bangladesh PLC is 4,862,000 2001: profit 11,092,000 restated.

20 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing financial risks.
Cairns strategy is to finance its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
Equity finance, project finance and other alternatives are reviewed by the Board, when appropriate, to fund substantial acquisitions or oil and gas development projects.
Cairns principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, investments, cash and short term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Cairns operations.
Cairn has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 13 for short term debtors and creditors.
They have, therefore, with the exception of the foreign currency risk disclosure, been excluded from the numerical disclosures.
Cairns treasury function is responsible for managing investment and funding requirements including banking and cash flow monitoring.
It must also recognise and manage interest and foreign exchange exposure whilst ensuring that Cairn has adequate liquidity at all times in order to meet its cash requirements.
CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 60 Cairn may from time to time, with the approval of the Board, opt to use derivative financial instruments to minimise its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and movements in oil and gas prices.
It is however, and has been throughout the period under review, Cairns policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from Cairns financial instruments are foreign currency risk, commodity price risk and liquidity risk.
The current policy for managing these risks is detailed below: Liquidity interest rate risk $150m multicurrency revolving credit facilities are in place at 31 December 2002 to cover any short to medium term cash requirements.
These are committed, unsecured, bilateral facilities provided by three lenders.
Short medium term borrowing and short term deposits are currently at floating money market interest rates.
Board approval is required for all new borrowing facilities over 5m.
Short term deposits held at 31 December 2002 2.9m are included within the floating rate financial assets.
Commodity price risk There are implicit product price hedges in place through the pricing mechanisms applicable to Sangu gas under the Sangu GSPA and Lakshmi gas under the Lakshmi GSCs.
The requirement for hedging instruments is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
No hedging contracts have been entered into during the year.
No outstanding hedging was in place at the start of the year or at the year end.
Foreign currency risk Although the Group reports in sterling, a large proportion of its business is conducted in US$ with the majority of Cairn revenues being received in US$.
Cairn manages this, and other exposures that arise from receipt of revenues in foreign currencies, by matching receipts and payments in the same currency and actively managing the residual net position.
In order to minimise Cairns exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, currency assets are matched with currency liabilities by borrowing or entering into foreign exchange contracts in the applicable currency if deemed appropriate.
The $150m facilities are multicurrency committed facilities, which allow drawdowns in US$, sterling or any other currency that is freely convertible and transferable into US$.
Exchange rates are monitored in conjunction with forecast currency requirements.
Currency exposures are shown in the table on page 64.
No forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into during the year.
There were no outstanding foreign exchange contracts at the start of the year or at the end of the year.

Should the views of the GOI prevail on aspects in addition to these elements thought by management to be likely, the joint venture members could be required to make significant additional payments, as the GOIs share of petroleum for prior years could increase up to a maximum take of 60% per annum.

It is not possible at this stage to estimate what the impact might be and correspondingly no adjustments have been made.
