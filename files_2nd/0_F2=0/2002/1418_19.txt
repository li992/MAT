Pension costs The group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24 and the disclosures given in a are those required by that standard.
FRS 17 Retirement Benets was issued in November 2000 but will not be mandatory for the group until the year ended 13 September 2003.
Prior to this, phased transitional disclosures are required and are set out in b. a Associated British Foods pension schemes The group operates pension schemes, the majority of which are of the dened benefit type.
The pension cost charge for the year was 12 million 2001 13 million.
The two main UK schemes provide benets based on final pensionable earnings.
The pension costs in the UK are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualied actuaries using the projected unit method.
Pension costs continued The last actuarial valuations of the British Sugar Pension Scheme and the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme were carried out as at 1 October 2001 and 5 April 1999 respectively.
Both valuations used a market related approach under which the actuarial values of the assets were taken as their market value at the valuation date.
For the British Sugar Pension Scheme, it was assumed that the investment return would exceed price ination by 3.25% per annum.
For the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme, the investment return assumption prior to retirement exceeded the price ination assumption by 2.5% per annum and post retirement by 2% per annum.
In both valuations salary increases were assumed to exceed price ination by 2% per annum.
At the valuation dates the total market value of the two major schemes assets was 1,859 million and the value of these assets for actuarial valuation purposes represented 126% of the benets that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The SSAP 24 charge in respect of the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme in the year ended 14 September 2002 is based on the last formal actuarial valuation undertaken in April 1999.
Since then the market value of investments has deteriorated.
A new valuation was undertaken as at April 2002, but has yet to be nalised.
The draft report indicates that the scheme remains in surplus and there would have been no change to the SSAP 24 charge were this valuation to have been adopted for the preparation of these accounts.
However, in light of the changes in market conditions since April 2002, an informal valuation was conducted as at September 2002 by the schemes actuaries.
Although the informal September valuation revealed a further reduction in the surplus there still remains a modest surplus.
If current market conditions prevail, the company will recommence some level of contribution to the main UK scheme.
The group also operates pension schemes in Australia and New Zealand, the US and the Republic of Ireland.
The charge for the year is based on recommendations by qualied local actuaries.
b FRS 17 Retirement Benets For the purposes of FRS 17 disclosures, the most recent actuarial valuations referred to above have been updated to 14 September 2002 by an independent qualied actuary.
The financial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under FRS 17 are: 2002 2001 UK Overseas UK Overseas %% %% Rate of general increase in salaries 4.25 4.25 4.50 4.50 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.25 2.25 2.50 2.50 Rate of increase of deferred pensions 2.25 2.25 2.50 2.50 Discount rate of scheme liabilities 5.50 5.50 6.00 6.00 Ination 2.25 2.25 2.50 2.50 On 30 September 2002 the groups principal UK dened benefit schemes were closed to new members.
As a result, these schemes have an ageing population.
In accordance with FRS 17, the valuation of the schemes liabilities has been determined using the projected unit method.
In these circumstances the use of this method can lead to the contribution rate implicit in the current service cost increasing in future years.

Adjusted earnings per ordinary share, which exclude the impact of profits less losses on the disposal of xed assets, exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and the associated tax credit, is shown to provide clarity to the underlying performance of the group.
The diluted earnings per share calculation takes into account the dilutive effect of share options.
