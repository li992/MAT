These differences relate principally to the following items, and the effect of each of the adjustments to net earnings and shareholders funds that would be required under US GAAP is set out above.
It has come to the Groups attention that the US Securities and Exchange Commission the SEC have recently taken a position on certain accounting issues unique to the mining industry.
The issue that is likely to affect the Group most significantly, if the position taken by the SEC is applied, relates to the commodity prices used for the determination of reserves for accounting purposes.
The Groups financial statements are based on reserve estimates calculated in accordance with the JORC Code, whereas the SEC have recently been pressing for the use of historical average commodity prices when determining reserves.
It may be necessary for the Group to revise the US GAAP information presented in this section of the Annual report and financial statements for the relevant 2002 Form 20-F filings once it has obtained clarification of the SECs position on these matters.
130 Rio Tinto 2002 Annual report and financial statements SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FOR UNITED STATES INVESTORS RECONCILIATION WITH US GAAP CONTINUED Goodwill For 1997 and prior years, UK GAAP permitted the write off of purchased goodwill on acquisition, directly against reserves.
For acquisitions in 1998 and subsequent years, goodwill is capitalised and amortised over its expected useful life under UK GAAP.
Under US GAAP, goodwill is capitalised and, until 2001, was amortised by charges against income over the period during which it was expected to be of benefit, subject to a maximum of 40 years.
Goodwill previously written off directly to reserves in the UK GAAP financial statements was therefore reinstated and amortised, under US GAAP.
From 1 January 2002, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortised under US GAAP but are reviewed annually for impairment under FAS 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Goodwill amortisation of US$90 million charged against UK GAAP earnings for 2002 is added back in the US GAAP reconciliation.
No impairment write downs were required on the initial introduction of FAS 142.
Implementation of FAS 141 Business Combinations resulted in the reclassification of US$340 million from goodwill to finite lived intangible assets.
Exchange differences taken to earnings under US GAAP The Group finances its operations primarily in US dollars and a significant proportion of the Groups US dollar debt is located in its Australian operations.
Under UK GAAP, this debt is dealt with in the context of the currency status of the Group as a whole and exchange differences reported by the Australian operations are adjusted through reserves.
US GAAP permits such exchange gains and losses to be taken to reserves only to the extent that the US dollar debt hedges US dollar assets in the Australian Group.
Exchange gains of US$240 million pre tax 2001: losses of US$216 million, US$177 million net of tax and minorities 2001: US$148 million net of tax and minorities, on US dollar debt that do not qualify for hedge accounting under US GAAP have therefore been recorded in US GAAP earnings.
Mark to market of derivative contracts The Group is party to derivative contracts in respect of some of its future transactions in order to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates against the US dollar.
Under UK GAAP, these contracts are accounted for as hedges: gains and losses are deferred and subsequently recognised when the hedged transaction occurs.
However, certain of the Groups derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, principally because the hedge is not located in the entity with the exposure.
Unrealised pre tax gains of US$157 million 2001: losses of US$48 million US$111 million after tax and minorities 2001: US$26 million after tax and minorities, on such derivatives have therefore been taken to US GAAP earnings.
Asset write downs Following the implementation of FRS 11 in 1998, impairment of fixed assets under UK GAAP is recognised and measured by reference to the discounted cash flows expected to be generated by an income generating unit.
Under US GAAP, impairment is recognised only when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the income generating unit.
Where an asset is found to be impaired under US GAAP, the amount of such impairment is generally similar under US GAAP to that computed under UK GAAP, except where the US GAAP carrying value includes additional goodwill.
The asset write downs in 2002, under US GAAP, include amounts recognised in 2001 under UK GAAP and also an adjustment for goodwill.
The 2002 US GAAP impairment write down was US$1,067 million pre tax US$1,060 million net of tax and minorities.
This is US$89 million pre tax US$297 million net of tax and minorities above the charge of US$978 million pre tax US$763 million net of tax and minorities included under UK GAAP.
Pensions post retirement benefits Under UK GAAP, post retirement benefits are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24.
The expected costs under defined benefit arrangements are spread over the service lives of employees entitled to those benefits.
Variations from the regular cost are spread on a straight line basis over the expected average remaining service lives of relevant current employees.
Under US GAAP, the annual pension cost comprises the estimated cost of benefits accruing in the period adjusted for the amortisation of the surplus arising when FAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, was adopted.
The charge is further adjusted to reflect the cost of benefit improvements and any surpluses deficits that emerge as a result of variances from actuarial assumptions.
For US purposes, only those surpluses deficits outside a ten per cent fluctuation corridor are spread.
The reduction in shareholders funds at 31 December 2002 and 2001 also includes the effect of the US GAAP requirement to make immediate provision for pension fund deficits through other comprehensive income.
The provision reflects the reduction in equity values over the past two years.
Exploration and evaluation Under UK GAAP, expenditure on a project can be carried forward after it has reached a stage where there is a high degree of confidence in its viability.
US GAAP does not allow expenditure to be carried forward unless the viability of the project is supported by a final feasibility study.
In addition, under UK GAAP, provisions made against exploration and evaluation in prior years can be reversed when the project proceeds to development to the extent that the relevant costs are recoverable.
US GAAP does not allow such provisions to be reversed.
Share option plans Under UK GAAP, no cost is accrued where the option scheme applies to all relevant employees and the intention is to satisfy the share options by the issuance of new shares.
Prior to 2002, under US GAAP the Group accounted for share option plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations.
In 2002, the Group adopted the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which is considered by the SEC to be a preferable accounting method for share based employee compensation.
As permitted by FAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, all prior periods presented have been restated to reflect the compensation cost that would have been recognised had the recognition provisions of FAS 123 been applied to all awards granted to employees after 1 January 1995.
An adjustment is therefore required to reflect the increased cost of the schemes under US GAAP compared to UK GAAP.
Fair value is determined using an option pricing model.
Higher cost of sales resulting from acquisition accounting Under UK GAAP, the inventories of acquired companies are valued at the lower of replacement cost and net realisable value.
Under US GAAP, such inventories are recognised at the time of acquisition on the basis of expected net sales proceeds.
Earnings for 2001 were lower under US GAAP as a result of the higher cost of sales relating to inventories that were held at the date of acquisition.
There is no effect on 2002 earnings.
Rio Tinto 2002 Annual report and financial statements 131 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FOR UNITED STATES INVESTORS Supplementary information for United States investors continued RECONCILIATION WITH US GAAP CONTINUED Proposed dividends Under UK GAAP, ordinary dividends are recognised in the financial year in respect of which they are paid.
Under US GAAP, such dividends are not recognised until they are formally declared by the board of directors or approved by the shareholders.
Other Other adjustments to earnings include amounts related to differences between UK and US accounting principles in respect of depreciation of mining assets, revenue recognition, start up and close down and restoration costs see below.
Depreciation of mining assets Under UK GAAP, mining assets are fully depreciated over their economic lives or the remaining life of the mine if shorter.
In some cases, mineral resources that do not yet have the status of reserves are taken into account in determining depreciation charges, where there is a high degree of confidence that they will be mined economically.
For US GAAP, only proven and probable reserves are taken into account in the calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortisation charges.
As a result, adjustments have been made in 2002 to depreciation included in Other that reduced US GAAP pre tax earnings by US$10 million 2001: US$6 million.
Revenue recognition Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
101 SAB 101 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements has the result that, in some cases, sales recorded as revenue under UK GAAP are deferred and are not recognised as revenue under US GAAP until a future accounting period.
Occasionally, sales of goods recorded as revenue for UK GAAP purposes may be kept in store by Rio Tinto at the request of the buyer.
Under US GAAP, such transactions cannot be recognised as revenue unless the goods are physically segregated from the suppliers other inventory and certain additional criteria are met.
Also, under UK GAAP, certain sales contracts are recognised as revenue when the goods are delivered to the ship for export to the customer: but do not qualify for recognition under US GAAP until they have reached the destination specified by the customer in the sales contract and title has passed.
In 2002, such timing differences resulted in an adjustment, included in Other, that increased US GAAP pre tax earnings by US$4 million 2001: US$5 million increase.
Provisions Additional provisions were recognised for UK GAAP purposes on implementation of FRS 12 in 1999.
There was no corresponding change in US accounting standards.
The additional provisions are therefore reversed in the calculation of shareholders funds under US GAAP.
Start up costs Under US GAAP, Statement of Position 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start up Activities, requires that the costs of start up activities are expensed as incurred.
Under UK GAAP, some of these start up costs qualify for capitalisation and are amortised over the economic lives of the relevant assets.
Taxation Rio Tinto has implemented FRS 19, the new UK accounting standard on deferred tax.
This has resulted in a prior year adjustment under UK GAAP, which reduced shareholders funds at 1 January 2001 by US$133 million.
Of this amount, US$46 million results from the requirement under FRS 19 to provide in full for deferred taxation on most timing differences.
These additional provisions were already recognised under US GAAP.
The remaining US$87 million of the prior year adjustment relates to features of FRS 19 that give rise to new variations from US GAAP.
Accordingly, this element of the prior year adjustment has been reversed in arriving at US GAAP shareholders funds.
These variations, which also affect the determination of earnings under US GAAP, relate principally to the following: a Under FRS 19, provision for taxes arising on remittances of earnings can only be made if the dividends have been accrued or if there is a binding agreement for the distribution of the earnings.
Under US GAAP, provision must be made for tax arising on expected future remittances of past earnings.
b Under FRS 19, tax benefits associated with goodwill charged directly to reserves in 1997 and previous years, must be accumulated in the deferred tax provision.
This means that the tax benefits are not included in earnings until the related goodwill is charged through the profit and loss account on disposal or closure.
For US GAAP, no provision is required for such deferred tax because the goodwill that gave rise to these tax benefits was capitalised and gives rise to amortisation charges against profit.
Deferred tax on acquisitions Under UK GAAP, deferred tax is not provided in respect of upward fair value adjustments to tangible fixed assets and inventories made on acquisitions.
Under US GAAP, deferred tax must be provided on all fair value adjustments to non monetary assets recorded on acquisition with a consequential increase in the amount allocated to mining properties or goodwill as appropriate.
Consolidated statement of cash flows The consolidated statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with FRS 1 revised presents substantially the same information as that required under US GAAP.
Under US GAAP, however, there are certain differences from UK GAAP with regard to the classification of items within the cash flow statement and with regard to the definition of cash and cash equivalents.
Under US GAAP, tax paid and interest would form part of operating cash flow.
Under UK GAAP, cash for the purposes of the cash flow statement is defined as cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand with any qualifying financial institution, less bank borrowings from any qualifying financial institution repayable on demand.
Deposits are repayable on demand if they can be withdrawn at any time without notice and without penalty or if a maturity or period of notice of not more than 24 hours or one working day has been agreed.
Under US GAAP, cash equivalents comprise cash balances and current asset investments with an original maturity of less than three months and exclude bank borrowings repayable on demand.
Unrealised holding gains and losses UK GAAP permits current asset investments to be valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Under US GAAP, FAS 115 requires that unrealised holding gains and losses on investments classified as available for sale are excluded from earnings and reported instead within a separate component of shareholders funds until realised.
132 Rio Tinto 2002 Annual report and financial statements SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FOR UNITED STATES INVESTORS RECONCILIATION WITH US GAAP CONTINUED New US accounting standards In July 2001, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FAS 143, Accounting for Obligations Associated with the Retirement of Long-Lived Assets.
FAS 143 will be effective for the financial year ending 31 December 2003.
The standard requires that the obligation for close down and restoration costs is capitalised at the time of recognition.
The asset is subsequently amortised over its useful life and the discount on the liability is unwound.
In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
The statement requires companies to recognise costs associated with certain exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan.
FAS 146 will be applied by the Group prospectively to applicable exit or disposal activities initiated after 31 December 2002.
The adoption of FAS 143 and FAS 146 is not expected to have a material effect on the reported financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Rio Tinto Group.
New UK Accounting Standards Mandatory implementation of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits has been delayed until 2005 but additional disclosures are required for 2001 and 2002 which are included in note 41 to the financial statements.
POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS Information in respect of the net periodic benefit cost and related obligation determined in accordance with FAS 87, 106 and 132 is given below.
Benefits under the major pension schemes are principally determined by years of service and employee remuneration.
Pension scheme funding policy is based on annual contributions at a rate that is intended to fund benefits as a level percentage of pay over the working lifetime of the schemes participants.
The assets of the UK scheme are invested primarily in UK and overseas equities and UK fixed interest stocks.
The assets of the Australian schemes are invested primarily in Australian and overseas equities and fixed interest stocks.
The assets of the most significant pension schemes outside the UK and Australia are invested primarily in common stocks, corporate and treasury bonds, real estate or real estate investment funds, under the direction of investment managers.
Other post retirement benefits are provided to employees who meet the eligibility requirements, and their beneficiaries and dependants, through unfunded self insurance arrangements.
The majority of these plans are for employees in the US.
The plans are non contributory, although some contain an element of cost sharing such as deductibles and co-insurance.
Assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit cost and the year end benefit obligation for the major pension schemes varied between the limits shown below.
The average rate for each assumption has been weighted by benefit obligation.
The assumptions used to determine the year end benefit obligation are also used to calculate the following years cost.
2002 cost Year end benefit obligation Discount rate 6.5% to 12.0% Average: 7.0% 5.8% to 12.0% Average: 6.7% Long term rate of return on plan assets 6.5% to 12.0% Average: 7.3% 6.5% to 12.0% Average: 7.2% Increase in compensation levels 4.0% to 11.0% Average: 5.0% 3.3% to 11.0% Average: 4.8% The actuarial calculations in respect of the UK plans assume a rate of increase of pensions in payment of 2.5 per cent per annum.
The actuarial calculations in respect of Australian plans assume a rate of increase of pensions in payment of 2.5 per cent per annum.
These assumptions are consistent with the expected rates of return and salary increase assumptions in the respective valuations.
Appropriate assumptions were made for plans in other countries.
The weighted average discount rates used in determining the benefit obligation for the major post retirement benefit plans other than pension schemes were 7.5 per cent and 6.5 per cent as of 30 September 2001, and 30 September 2002, respectively.
A healthcare cost trend rate of 8.5 per cent, decreasing to 5.0 per cent by the year 2009, was used for 2002 costs.

b During 2002, accrued losses of US$40 million relating to derivatives that were not designated as hedges under FAS 133 were realised on maturity of the contracts.
c The fair value of net derivative liabilities designated as cash flow hedges under FAS 133 reduced by US$90 million during 2002 resulting in a closing debit balance related to cash flow hedging activities of US$60 million in OCI.
These cash flow hedges hedge the Groups exposure to the US dollar in relation to future trading transactions.
The Group expects to reclassify US$18 million of this amount as reductions in earnings over the next twelve months as these contracts and the transactions which they hedge mature.
As at 31 December 2002, the Group had US$102 million of cash flow hedge derivative liabilities and US$42 million of cash flow hedge derivative assets.
The cash flow hedges extend to 2010. d Certain of the Groups derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133, principally because the hedge is not located in the entity with the exposure.
The fair value of these net derivative liabilities reduced by US$117 million during 2002.
As at 31 December 2002, the Group had US$102 million of assets relating to derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133, and US$96 million of liabilities.

MINING AND TECHNICAL DEFINITIONS Alumina Aluminium oxide.
It is extracted from bauxite in a chemical refining process and is subsequently the principal raw material in the electro-chemical process by which aluminium is produced.
Anode and cathode copper At the final stage of the smelting of copper concentrates, the copper is cast into specially shaped slabs called anodes for subsequent refining to produce refined cathode copper.
Bauxite Mainly hydrated aluminium oxides AL O.
Principal ore of alumina, the raw material from which 2 3 2 aluminium is made.
Beneficiated bauxite Bauxite ore that has been treated to remove waste material to improve its physical or chemical characteristics.
Block caving An underground mining method.
It involves undercutting the ore body to induce ore fracture and collapse by gravity.
The broken ore is recovered through draw points below.
Borates A generic term for mineral compounds which contain boron and oxygen.
Cathode copper Refined copper produced by electrolytic refining of impure copper or by electrowinning.
Classification Separating crushed and ground ore into portions of different size particles.
Concentrate The product of a physical concentration process, such as flotation or gravity concentration, which involves separating ore minerals from unwanted waste rock.
Concentrates require subsequent processing such as smelting or leaching to break down or dissolve the ore minerals and obtain the desired elements, usually metals.
Cutoff grade The lowest grade of mineralised material considered economic to process.
It is used in the calculation of the quantity of ore present in a given deposit.
Dor A precious metal alloy which is produced by smelting.
Dor is an intermediate product which is subsequently refined to produce pure gold and silver.
DWT Dead weight tons is the combined weight in long tons 2,240 pounds weight of cargo, fuel and fresh water that a ship can carry.
Flotation A method of separating finely ground minerals using a froth created in water by specific reagents.
In the flotation process certain mineral particles are induced to float by becoming attached to bubbles of froth whereas others, usually unwanted, sink.
Grade The proportion of metal or mineral present in ore, or any other host material, expressed in this document as per cent, grammes per tonne or ounces per tonne.
Headgrade The average grade of ore delivered to the mill.
Ilmenite Mineral composed of iron, titanium and oxygen.
Metallurgical coal Also referred to as coking coal.
By virtue of its carbonisation properties, it is used in the manufacture of coke, which is used in the steel making process.
Mineral resource Material of intrinsic economic interest occurring in such form and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.
Ore A rock from which a metal s or mineral s can be economically extracted.
Ore milled The quantity of ore processed.
Rio Tinto 2002 Annual report and financial statements 141 DEFINITIONS Definitions continued Ore hoisted The quantity of ore which is removed from an underground mine for processing.
Ore reserve That part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.
Pressure oxidation A method of treating sulphide ores.
In the case of refractory gold ores, the object is to oxidise the sulphides to sulphates and hence liberate the gold for subsequent cyanide leaching.
The technique involves reaction of the ore with sulphuric acid under pressure in the presence of oxygen gas.
Probable ore reserves Reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proved reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced.
The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proved reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.
Proved ore reserves Reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes: grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established.
Rock mined The quantity of ore and waste rock excavated from the mine.
In this document, the term is only applied to surface mining operations.
Rutile A mineral composed of titanium and oxygen TiO.
2 Steam coal Also referred to as steaming coal, thermal coal or energy coal.
It is used as a fuel source in electrical power generation, cement manufacture and various industrial applications.
Stripping ratio The tonnes of waste material which must be removed to allow the mining of one tonne of ore. Solvent extraction and Processes for extracting metal from an ore and producing pure metal.
First the metal is leached electrowinning or SX-EW into solution: the resulting solution is then purified in the solvent extraction process: the solution is then treated in an electro-chemical process electrowinning to recover cathode copper.
Tailings The rock wastes which are rejected from a concentrating process after the recoverable valuable minerals have been extracted.
Titanium dioxide feedstock A feedstock rich in titanium dioxide produced, in Rio Tintos case, by smelting ores containing titanium minerals.
4 Notes Ore reserve estimates in this document have been adjusted for mining losses and dilution during extraction.
Metal grades have not been adjusted for mill recoveries, but mill recoveries are presented in the table of reserves and are taken into consideration in the calculation of Rio Tintos share of recoverable metal.
Unless stated to the contrary, reserves of industrial minerals and coal are stated in terms of recoverable quantities of saleable material, after processing or beneficiation losses.
Reserve and resource terminology used in this document complies in general with the requirements of the Australian Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange.
