At present, it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
The groups planned level of capital investment is expected to remain at similar levels.
Therefore, it expects to be able to claim capital allowances in excess of depreciation in future years, at a similar level to the current year.
The taxation charge is based on profit before tax for the year of the UK standard rate.
There is no tax charge on profits on disposal of properties due to claims for rollover relief for which no deferred taxation provision has been made, or a tax credit in respect of the amortisation of goodwill.

The adjustment to the number of shares is: 2002 2001 No.
Premium element of share options based on average mid-market share price for the year 1,657,989 927,106 c Adjusted earnings per ordinary share Adjusted earnings per ordinary share are calculated based upon earnings before amortisation of goodwill and profit on the sale of properties and are presented in addition to the basic earnings per share calculated in accordance with FRS 3 and FRS 14 since, in the opinion of the directors, this presents a better like-for-like comparison of the earnings of the group between the relevant periods.
Basic earnings per share may be reconciled to adjusted earnings per share before amortisation of goodwill and profit on the sale of properties as follows: 2002 2001 Restated Adjusted earnings per ordinary share 91.6p 75.5p Amortisation of goodwill 10.8 p 9.4 p Profit on sale of properties 1.1p 1.2p Basic earnings per ordinary share 81.9p 67.3p 53 TRA V IS PERKINS PLC 10.
