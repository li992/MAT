Environmental and Social Policy 30: Environmental and Social Policy Management System While the board is ultimately responsible for the groups policy and procedures, a chain of responsibility exists in relation to the management of health and safety, starting with each and every employee who is required to fulfil their legal duty to take reasonable care of their own health and safety.
Line managers, supported by the Fire & Life Safety Manager or one of the various safety advisers are obliged to ensure that supervision is exercised, training given and information disseminated.
The Fire and Life Safety Department provides overall advice, guidance, instruction and information on all health and safety matters including the maintenance of the groups health and safety manual and the establishment of detailed procedures and systems which are subject to on-going review and auditing.
In relation to the groups construction activities, for the year ended 30 June 2002 the operations safety record including contractor employees showed a rate of 0.78 accidents per 100,000 person-hours, compared to the industry average of 1.2 per 100,000 person-hours.
