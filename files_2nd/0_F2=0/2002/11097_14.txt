Turnover represents the invoiced amount of goods sold and services stated net of value added tax.
No allocation of net assets has been made between Next Retail and Next Directory as the common use of assets by the two business sectors means that this is not appropriate.
The analysis of turnover and operating profit by geographical origin is not significantly different from the analysis by destination disclosed above.
Prior year turnover, operating profit and net assets of the Clydesdale discontinued business sector all relate to the United Kingdom in respect of the analysis by geographical destination.

The defined benefit section is a funded arrangement which provides benefits based on final pensionable earnings which are salaries, overtime and annual performance bonuses and was closed to new members on 30 September 2000.
The defined contribution section is for all members who joined on or after 1 October 2000 and benefits are based on each individual members personal account which is invested in an independently administered fund.
The scheme has equal pension rights with respect to members of either sex.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs The Group continues to report its pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section was undertaken by an independent professionally qualified actuary as at 31 March 2001 using the projected unit method.
The valuation has been subject to an updated estimate to the Groups year end date of 26 January 2002.
The principal financial assumptions which have the most significant effect on the computation of the pension costs are those related to the rate of return on the investments and the rates of increase in earnings and pensions.
These assumptions have been derived from market yields applying at the valuation date.
In particular, the investment return used relating to pre-retirement liabilities was two and three quarters percentage points per annum in excess of the assumed rate of increase in earnings and the investment return used relating to post-retirement liabilities was three percentage points per annum in excess of the assumed rate of pension increases.
Demographic assumptions have also been taken into account, in particular the general trend in mortality experience.
forty NEXT PLC NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 37 Pension commitments continued At 31 March 2001, the market value of the assets was 199m representing 107% of the liability for benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The actuarial surplus has been spread in level annual amounts over the average remaining service lives of the active membership.
Following the updated estimate to 26 January 2002, a surplus of 1.7m 2001: 4.7m has been recognised in the year and has been offset against the regular pension cost amounting to 10.4m 2001: 10.5m, resulting in a charge of 8.7m 2001: 5.8m against profits in the year.
From 1 April 2001 the Group increased employer contributions to the scheme to 10% and will increase them further to 12.3% with effect from 1 April 2002 until the next actuarial valuation.
Employer contributions of 7.4m 2001: 3.2m were made in the year including contributions of 0.3m 2001: 0.1m in respect of the defined contribution section.
The pension costs for the Group will continue to be set at a level that takes account of the past service funding position of the scheme.
Full pension costs of the Group amounted to 10.0m 2001: 6.7m including the estimated cost of meeting unfunded unapproved pension liabilities relating to scheme members whose benefits would otherwise be restricted by the Inland Revenue salary cap.
There is a pension accrual in the balance sheet of 20.1m 2001: 18.0m.
