NOTES forming part of the financial statements 1 Accounting policies i Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the historical cost convention, modied to include the revaluation of certain xed asset investments.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the groups financial statements.
ii Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 March 2002.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
A joint venture is an undertaking in which the group has a long-term interest and over which it exercises joint control.
The groups share of profits less losses of joint ventures is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest in their net assets, other than goodwill, is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
Under section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
iii Turnover Turnover represents the sales value of work done including revenue from technical and consultancy services.
Turnover is stated excluding VAT.
iv Goodwill Purchased goodwill arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions before 1 April 1998, when Financial Reporting Standard 10: Goodwill and Intangible Assets was adopted, was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition.
Goodwill previously eliminated against reserves has not been reinstated on implementation of FRS10.
Positive goodwill arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions after 1 April 1998 is capitalised, classied as an asset on the balance sheet and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life up to a presumed maximum of twenty years.
It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition and in other subsequent periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If a subsidiary undertaking or business is subsequently sold or closed, any goodwill arising on acquisition that was written off directly to reserves or that has not been amortised through the profit and loss account is taken into account in determining the profit or loss on sale or closure.
v Fixed assets and depreciation Depreciation is provided on tangible xed assets, other than freehold land and assets in course of construction, at rates calculated to write off the cost less residual value of each asset on a straight line basis over the expected useful life as follows: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 50 years Leasehold land and short leasehold buildings unexpired period of lease Computers 3 years Ofce furniture and equipment 5 years Motor vehicles 4 years Plant and machinery 5 to 10 years Heavy equipment 20 to 33 years Interest costs relating to specic project nancing are capitalised up to the date of completion of the project.
vi Fixed asset investments: Own shares Investment in own shares represents shares in Vosper Thornycroft Holdings plc held by: a The Vosper Thornycroft Employees Share Ownership Trust which is a discretionary trust for the benefit of executives and directors holding shares to satisfy the groups liabilities to executives and directors for the long term incentive plan.
Dividends on these shares have been waived during the period that they are within the trust except for those relating to shares held as Retained Shares under the terms of the trust which are paid to the beneciaries on a timely basis.
The net cost to the group of these shares apart from the Retained Shares is charged to the profit and loss account over the period to which they relate.
b The Vosper Thornycroft Holdings plc Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust which is a discretionary trust for the benefit of employees holding from time to time shares to satisfy the groups liabilities under its Savings related Share Option Scheme and Sharesave Scheme 1998.
The dividends on these shares are waived during the period they are within the trust.
The shares were initially purchased with a loan from the group which has been progressively repaid as options are exercised.
vii Stocks Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
For work in progress and nished goods, cost is taken as production cost which includes an appropriate proportion of attributable overheads.
28 Vosper Thornycroft Holdings plc viii Long term contracts The amount of profit attributable to the stage of completion of a long term contract is recognised when the outcome of the contract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty.
Turnover for such contracts is stated at cost appropriate to their stage of completion plus attributable profits, less amounts recognised in previous years.
Provision is made for any losses as soon as they are foreseen.
Contracts work in progress is stated at costs incurred, less those transferred to the profit and loss account, after deducting foreseeable losses and payments on account not matched with turnover.
Amounts recoverable on contracts are included in debtors and represent turnover recognised in excess of payments on account.
ix Pension costs The group operates a number of contributory pension schemes, both dened benefit and money purchase, and accounts for pension costs in accordance with the requirements of SSAP24.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the group.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the service lives of pensionable employees.
The group has adopted the transitional disclosure requirements of FRS17.
x Research and development Expenditure on research is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on development work is charged to the specic contract to which it relates and is carried in work in progress.
xi Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS19.
xii Leased assets Assets held under finance leases giving rights approximating to ownership are included in xed assets.
The capital element of future lease obligations is shown in creditors.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
xiii Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or contract rate as appropriate.
Exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account.
Overseas subsidiaries have been translated at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences have been taken directly to reserves.
xiv Financial instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to uctuations in foreign exchange rates.
Immediately a contractual requirement is known the group enters into a forward contract to eliminate any exposure that may arise on future transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Contract profits or losses taken to the profit and loss account are assessed using these forward contact rates.
Changes in the fair value of these instruments have no affect on the profit and loss account and are therefore not recognised in the financial statements.
xv Accounting for PFI contracts The group considers the accounting treatment of PFI assets on a contract by contract basis and determines whether the risks and rewards associated with the assets are retained or passed to the purchaser.
If the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the group the assets are allocated to xed assets, otherwise they are allocated to debtors in accordance with the relevant accounting standards.
Support Services includes all activities connected with facilities management, training and education.
Shipbuilding includes all activities in respect of designing and or building ships and the equipping and or supporting of company designed warships.
Marine Products activities include the design and supply of electronic control systems, steering gear, stabilisers, bow thrusters, water jets, ride control equipment and the manufacture of engineering products.
Support Services and Marine Products activities are not dependent on the group winning major ship orders.

The transitional disclosures in b below are required under the new accounting standard Financial Reporting Standard 17 Accounting for Retirement Benets.
a SSAP24 Disclosure The group operates three funded dened benefit schemes and several money purchase schemes.
The majority of employees are members of one of these arrangements.
The group participates in the Shipbuilding Industries Pension Scheme SIPS.
This scheme is administered by independent trustees and the funds are separate from the groups finance.
The scheme is of the dened benets type and actuarial valuations are undertaken every three years.
The rates at which the group contributes to the scheme have been determined in accordance with the advice of independent qualied actuaries.
The latest valuation of the scheme, of which most employees are members, was at 1 April 2001 using the attained age method.
The principal assumption in this valuation was that investment returns would be 2% higher than the rate of annual pay increases.
The market value of the assets was 182 million, and the actual value of the assets was sufficient to cover 120% of the benets accruing to members after allowing for expected future pay increases.
The surplus revealed by the actuarial valuation will be spread over the expected remaining service lives of scheme members currently employed by the group.
The superannuation arrangements of the LAWDCs pension scheme, is a centralised dened benefit scheme for certain employees, with the assets held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The scheme is subject to triennial valuation by professionally qualied and independent actuaries.
The last formal valuation was carried out at 31 March 2000, using the projected unit credit method in which the actuarial liability makes allowance for projected earnings.
The market value of the schemes assets was 6,522,000, and the actuarial value of those assets represented 87% of the liability for benets after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Company contributions have been increased to 12.5% per annum for the period from 1 April 2001 to remove this deficit.
The group also operates a dened benefit pension scheme for the subsidiary undertaking, Merlin Communications Group Limited.
The last formal valuation was carried out at 31 July 2000, using the projected unit credit method in which the actuarial liability makes allowance for projected earnings.
The market value of the schemes assets was 6,700,000, and the actuarial value of those assets represented 97% of the liability for benets after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.

b FRS17 Disclosure The latest scheme valuations have been updated by the actuaries on an FRS17 basis as at 31 March 2002.
The major assumptions used in these valuations were: Group Scheme: SIPS LAWDCs Merlin Latest valuation date 1 April 2001 31 March 2000 31 July 2000 Rate of increase in salaries 4.25% 3.75% 4.25% Rate of increase in pension payments 2.75% or 3.00% 2.75% 2.75% or 3.00% Discount rate 6.25% 6.25% 6.25% Ination assumption 2.75% 2.75% 2.75% Long term return on equities 8.0% 7.5% 8.0% Long term return on xed interest gilts 5.0% 5.0% 5.0% The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The fair value of the scheme assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant changes before they are realised, and the present value of the scheme liabilities, which are derived from cash ow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, were: Value at 31 March 2002 SIPS LAWDCs Merlin Total 000 000 000 000 Equities 167,988 7,051 7,342 182,381 Fixed interest gilts 18,665 783 816 20,264 Market value of assets 186,653 7,834 8,158 202,645 Value of liabilities 179,619 9,708 9,961 199,288 Surplus deficit 7,034 1,874 1,803 3,357 Related deferred tax liability asset 2,110 562 541 1,007 Net pension asset liability 4,924 1,312 1,262 2,350 The amount of this net pension asset would be included in the groups profit and loss reserve.
