ICAP plc Annual Report 2002 34 Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Principal accounting policies a Basis of preparation The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
The Group has adopted the provisions of FRS 18 Accounting policies and FRS 19 Deferred tax, neither of which resulted in any significant impact upon the reported results of the Group.
The Group has also adopted the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 Retirement benefits which require additional disclosure only.
b Basis of consolidation The Groups consolidated Financial Statements comprise the Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
Details of the Groups principal subsidiaries are given on pages 60 and 61.
Unless stated otherwise, business combinations are accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting whereby the Groups results include the results of acquired or disposed businesses from the effective date of acquisition or disposal.
In the Groups consolidated Financial Statements, joint ventures and associates are accounted for under the equity method whereby the Groups profit and loss account includes its share of their profits and losses and the Groups balance sheet includes its share of their net assets.
c Goodwill Goodwill arises upon the acquisition of subsidiary and associated undertakings and joint ventures and represents the cost of the acquisition in excess of the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets acquired.
Fair values are determined based upon an assessment of the value of the individual assets and liabilities acquired, including reference to market prices where relevant.
For acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998, goodwill was written off directly to reserves.
The transitional arrangements of FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets allow this goodwill to remain eliminated.
Goodwill not previously recognised in the profit and loss account is taken into account when calculating the profit or loss on the subsequent disposal or termination of acquired businesses.
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 1998, goodwill is capitalised and amortised to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over its useful economic life.
The useful economic life of the goodwill is determined at the time of the acquisition by considering the nature of the business acquired, the economic environment in which it operates and the period of time over which the Group expects to derive value from the purchase of the business, and is typically not more than ten years.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings is shown within intangible fixed assets.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint ventures and associates is included within their carrying value.
d Turnover Turnover comprises commission and brokerage income derived from broking services supplied to third parties and fees for the provision of financial information.
For agency trades and the sale of information, turnover is stated net of rebates and discounts, value added tax and other sales taxes.
To represent the substance of matched principal services provided by the Group, where it acts as principal for the simultaneous purchase and sale of securities to third parties, commission income represents the differential between the consideration received on the sale of the security and its purchase.
e Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less provision for any impairment in their values and are depreciated on a straight line basis over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Short leasehold property Period of lease Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 5 years Motor vehicles 3 4 years Software development costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over 3 years.
The Group selects its depreciation rates carefully and reviews them to take account of any changes in circumstances.
These rates are determined upon consideration of factors such as the expected rate of technological development and anticipated usage levels.
Depreciation is charged against assets from the date at which the Group begins to derive economic benefit from the asset.
ICAP plc Annual Report 2002 35 When a leasehold property becomes surplus to the Groups foreseeable business requirements, provision is made on a discounted basis for the expected future net cost of the property.
f Leased assets Assets held under finance leases are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and the corresponding capital element of the future lease rentals is included within creditors.
The interest element of the lease rentals payable during the year is charged to the profit and loss account.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
g Fixed asset investments i Subsidiary undertakings An undertaking is regarded as a subsidiary undertaking if the Group has control over its operating and financial policies.
In the Companys Financial Statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at historical cost less provision for any impairment in their values.
ii Joint ventures and associates An undertaking is regarded as a joint venture if the Group has joint control over its operating and financial policies and an associate if the Group holds a participating interest and has significant influence, but not control, over its operating and financial policies.
Significant influence will generally exist where the Group holds more than 20% and less than 50% of the shareholders voting rights.
iii Other investments Other fixed asset investments are stated at historical cost less provision for any impairment in their values.
h Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill Fixed assets and goodwill are subject to an impairment review if there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the fixed asset or goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
The impairment review comprises a comparison of the net book value of the fixed asset or goodwill with its recoverable amount the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
Net realisable value represents the amount at which the asset could be sold.
Value in use is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows obtainable as a result of the assets continued use, including those resulting from its ultimate disposal, at a market based discount rate on a pre-tax basis.
The carrying value of fixed assets and goodwill are written down by the amount of any impairment and this loss is recognised in the profit and loss account in the year in which it occurs.
i Matched principal business Certain Group companies are involved as principal in the purchase and simultaneous commitment to sell securities between third parties.
Such trades are complete only when both sides of the deal are settled, and so the Group is exposed to risk in the event that one side of the transaction remains unmatched.
Substantially all the transactions settle within a short period of time and the settlement risk is considered to be minimal.
In order to reflect the substance of these transactions, the amounts due to and payable by counterparties in respect of matched principal business expected to settle in the normal course of trading are offset and the net amount is included in trade debtors.
For information purposes, the gross amounts are disclosed in note 16.
Outstanding transactions which have gone beyond settlement date initially unsettled transactions and where neither side of the transaction has settled are shown gross and are included in trade debtors and trade creditors in notes 16 and 18.
Transactions where one side has settled but the other remains outstanding unmatched transactions are also shown as the gross amount on the balance sheet in either trade debtors or trade creditors with the corresponding amount included as a cash movement.
j Stock lending transactions Certain Group companies are involved in collateralised stock lending transactions as an intermediary between counterparties.
Although the legal form of such transactions is that the securities broker acts as principal on both sides of the transaction, the substance of the transaction is that the Group companies involved act as intermediaries and assume minimal risk.
Accordingly, the deposits paid and received for securities borrowed and loaned have been offset and only the net amount is included in debtors and creditors.
For information purposes, the gross amounts are disclosed in notes 16 and 18. k Current asset investments Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The net realisable value for the traded investments is based upon readily ascertainable market prices.
ICAP plc Annual Report 2002 36 Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Principal accounting policies continued l Pension costs Defined contribution pension costs charged to the profit and loss account represent employers contributions payable in respect of the year.
Defined benefit pension costs are charged to the profit and loss account on a systematic basis over the service lives of the eligible employees in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
Certain assumptions and estimates are made in order to value the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and these are disclosed in note 28. m Employee share ownership trusts Investments in own shares held in connection with the Groups employee share schemes are treated as assets of the sponsoring company until such time as they vest unconditionally in the participating employees.
Any excess of the cost of the shares to the trust over the exercise price of the options granted over them is amortised to the profit and loss account over the period of service in respect of which the participating employees are awarded the options.
n Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised as an asset or a liability if transactions have occurred at the balance sheet date that give rise to a right to pay less taxation in the future or an obligation to pay more taxation in the future.
An asset is not recognised to the extent that the transfer of economic benefits in the future is uncertain.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities which are recognised are not discounted.
No provision is made in respect of any further taxation liability that would arise on the distribution of retained earnings of overseas subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates.
o Foreign currencies At entity level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the date the transaction is recorded.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
On consolidation, the results of overseas businesses are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the year and their assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translating the net assets and liabilities of overseas businesses and, to the extent permitted by SSAP 20 Foreign currency translation, exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings taken out to hedge investments in overseas businesses are taken directly to reserves.
In the cash flow statement, cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the year.
p Financial instruments Foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign exchange exposures both on assets and liabilities recognised in the Financial Statements and forecast receipts and payments denominated in foreign currencies.
Gains and losses on foreign currency contracts are offset against the exchange differences arising on the hedged assets and liabilities.
Where a contract is a hedge against future transactions, gains and losses on the contract are deferred until the transaction is recognised in the Financial Statements.
Receipts and payments on interest rate instruments are recognised on an accruals basis over the term of the instrument as an adjustment to interest receivable or payable on the hedged assets or liabilities.
Underlying principal amounts and unrecognised gains and losses of financial instruments used for hedging purposes outstanding at 31 March 2002 are disclosed in note 22 to the Financial Statements.
q Debt provisioning Provisions are made for specific debts when it is considered that the credit-worthiness of the debtor has deteriorated such that the recovery of all or part of a debt is in serious doubt.
A general provision is made in respect of potential losses which are judged to be present in debtor balances at the balance sheet date, but which will not be identified as such until some time in the future.
The level of provision is based upon the previous experience of such losses in the Group and is reviewed on a periodic basis.
The accuracy of the provision is periodically assessed against any actual losses that have arisen.
All provisions are recorded within operating expenses in the profit and loss account.
There is no material difference between the Groups turnover by origin and its turnover by destination.

28 Defined benefit pension schemes As explained in note 1 a, the Group has adopted FRS 17 Retirement benefits during the year.
The transitional arrangements of this standard provide for disclosures to be phased in over a two-year period.
This year the Group is required to provide only balance sheet disclosures which show the amount of the asset or liability that would have been recognised in the balance sheet if the standard had been fully implemented.
The disclosures required by FRS 17 in the transitional period are set out below.
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the US and Germany.
In the case of the schemes operating in Germany, any future obligations which the Group may incur in respect of benefits accrued to members in respect of past service are insured with local insurance companies.
The schemes in Germany are not significant in the context of the Group.
The US scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 July 1996 and no benefits have accrued to the members of the scheme in respect of their service after that date.
For the purposes of determining the Groups pension cost, the scheme is valued on an annual basis by qualified independent actuaries.
The most recent valuation was as at 1 January 2001 with an update review as at 31 March 2002 and used the projected unit method.
The actuarial assessment was based on the following principal assumptions: 2002 % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries nil Rate of increase in pensions in payment nil Discount rate 7.25 Inflation assumption 3.50 ICAP plc Annual Report 2002 56 Notes to the Financial Statements 28 Defined benefit pension schemes continued The assets and liabilities of the scheme and the expected rate of return were: Long-term rate of return expected Value as at 31 March 31 March 2002 2002 %m Equities 9.00 1.5 Bonds 7.25 4.4 Other 6.00 0.1 Total market value of assets 7.65 6.0 Present value of scheme liabilities 6.9 Deficit in the scheme 0.9 Related deferred tax asset 0.3 Net pension liability 0.6 The effects of the FRS 17 pension liability on the net assets and reserves of the Group are set out below: Year ended 31 March 2002 Net assets m Net assets 196.4 Pension liability under FRS 17 0.6 Net assets including net pension liability under FRS 17 195.8 Reserves m Profit and loss reserve 92.0 Pension reserve under FRS 17 0.6 Profit and loss reserve including net pension reserve under FRS 17 91.4 29 Contingent assets and liabilities a Group At 31 March 2002, the Group had received and recognised 2.8m $4.0m of material damage insurance cover in respect of tangible fixed assets destroyed in the World Trade Center, and 9.1m $13.0m of business interruption insurance proceeds.
The remainder of the material damage insurance proceeds will be recognised once replacement of the assets has taken place and insurance proceeds have been received.
It is estimated that total receipts from the material damage and business interruption policies will be in the region of 35.1m $50.0m.
From time to time the Group is engaged in litigation on employee related and other matters.
It is not possible to quantify the extent of such liabilities but they are not expected to have a material, adverse effect on the Groups results or net assets.
b Company The Company has provided letters of support to certain of its subsidiary undertakings that confirm its intention to provide additional funds to those undertakings where necessary to enable them to meet their liabilities as and when they fall due.
It is not expected that any claims under these letters of support will have a material adverse effect on the Companys results or net assets.
