Derivatives and other financial instruments a Financial instruments and risk management The Groups core business is to provide its customers with financial products appropriate to their needs, from mortgages and savings accounts to long-term investment products and insurance products.
The Group uses wholesale financial instruments to invest in liquid assets and to raise funds from wholesale money markets in support of its retail savings and mortgage operations.
These instruments also allow it to manage the risks arising from these business activities.
specified ct to The Group has a well established formal structure for managing risks which includes formal risk policies, risk limits, reporting structures, mandates and control procedures.
The Groups approach to risk management and control is set out within the Financial Review on pages 22 and 23.
The Board delegates the management of all aspects of market and liquidity risk to the Asset and Liability Management Committee ALCO.
ding Financial instruments used by the Group for risk management purposes include off-balance sheet or derivative instruments.
Such instruments are 2001 only used to limit the extent to which the Group will be affected by changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
As part of its responsibilities, hares ALCO approves the use of specified off-balance sheet instruments within approved limits and business activities.

Derivatives and other financial instruments continued 31.
Deriv a Financial instruments and risk management continued b Inter The Group does not undertake transactions for trading or speculative purposes and consequently all off-balance sheet financial instruments are classified as hedging contracts.
The principal off-balance sheet instruments used by the Group in managing its balance sheet risk exposures are interest rate swaps, interest rate options, cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.
These are used to protect the Group from exposures arising principally from fixed and capped rate mortgage lending, fixed rate savings products, deposit funding and investment activities.
The duration of off-balance sheet contracts is generally short to medium-term and their maturity profile reflects the nature of exposures arising from underlying business activities.
At the year-end the Group had no material exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations or changes in foreign currency interest rates.

Retirement benefits a Pension schemes 81.9 The Company operates two funded defined benefit staff pension schemes, administered by trustees, both of which are closed schemes.
The funds 96.7 are independent from those of the Company.
The normal pension age of employees in the schemes is 60 years.
Pension costs in the principal 78.6 scheme are assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary using the projected unit method and the second, smaller scheme, uses the aggregate method.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the schemes was at 30 June 2000.
The aggregate actuarial value of the schemes assets was sufficient to cover 110% of the aggregate benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
24.8 The aggregate market value of the schemes assets at 30 June 2000 was 343.3m.
76.5 The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
The rate of return on investments has been assumed to exceed the rate of salary increases by 2.0% 01.3 per annum and present and future pensions by 2.0% per annum.
88.7 The pension charge takes account of the surpluses disclosed, which are amortised over a period of 15 years, being the estimated average 90.0 remaining service lives of pension scheme members.
The Group also operates two further schemes, one defined contribution and one defined benefit which are not material.
The total pension cost for the Group was 10.7m 2001: 11.9m and included 0.2m 2001: 0.1m in respect of pensions to former Directors which was charged to other administrative expenses.
Because of the rapid decline in world stock markets during the year, we reviewed our liabilities within the principal scheme in advance of our triennial valuation, due in June 2003.
This review revealed a deficit within the fund and, whilst pension funding is essentially a long-term consideration, 2.9 we considered it prudent to transfer an additional 50m to our pension fund.
30.1 33.0 b Other post-retirement benefits 35.3 The Company provides concessionary rate mortgages and health care benefits to some of its pensioners.
The cost of health care benefits is 68.3 recognised in accordance with the stated accounting policy.
The cost of concessionary rate mortgages is not significant and is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account as it is incurred.

Interest rates used for transfer pricing have been determined to retain the interest rate risk within Treasury.
Costs have been assigned to each segment based on resources consumed.
Transfer pricing in respect of mortgage origination by the Distribution segment has been determined on the basis of market rates for such activity.
2001 b Exceptionals have not been allocated across business segments since they are the consequence of Group-level decisions.
m c For the purposes of segmental information net assets have been allocated to Lending, Savings and Distribution on the basis of the regulatory capital framework.
The segments are not allocated capital during the normal course of business, therefore segmental profits do not relate to these net assets.
d The Group operates entirely within the retail financial services sector and accordingly no segmental analysis of turnover has been presented.
Please refer to the Financial Review for more information on segmental performance.
