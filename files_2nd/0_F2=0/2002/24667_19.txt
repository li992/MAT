Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting Policies a Basis of accounting The accounts have been prepared on the historical cost basis of accounting, modified to include the revaluation of investments.
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
b Valuation of fixed asset investments Listed investments in Great Britain are valued according to the prices issued by the London Stock Exchange, being the closing mid-market prices for all investments other than FTSE 100 constituents and FTSE 100 reserve list constituents, for which the last traded prices are used.
Overseas listed investments and investments which are quoted but are unlisted are valued at their closing or middle market prices as issued by various sources.
Unquoted investments are valued by the directors taking into account the information available on the investee companies and funds held by the Company.
c Capital gains and losses Realised and unrealised capital gains and losses on fixed asset investments, together with exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in the non-distributable reserves.
d Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are credited to the revenue account on an ex-dividend basis.
Bank deposit interest is accounted for on an accruals basis.
e Administrative expenses and finance costs Administrative expenses, including the management fee, and finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses which are incidental to the purchase or sale of an investment are included in the cost or deducted from the proceeds of the sale of the investment.
On the basis of the Boards expected long-term split of returns in the form of capital gains and income of 75% and 25% respectively, the Company charges 75% of its finance costs and management fee to the extent that it relates to the maintenance or enhancement of the valuation of investments to capital.
f Deferred taxation Following the introduction of FRS 19, deferred taxation is provided using the liability method on all timing differences, calculated at the rate at which it is anticipated the timing differences will reverse.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only when, on the basis of available evidence, it is more likely than not that there will be taxable profits in the future against which the deferred tax asset can be offset.
g Foreign currency Transactions denominated in overseas currencies during the year are translated into sterling at the appropriate daily exchange rates.
The values of investments and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at that date.
Differences arising from translation at these rates of exchange are dealt with in non-distributable reserves.
h Financial instruments The Company has not utilised any derivative instruments in the year under review.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under Financial Reporting Standard 13, Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures FRS 13 and excluded short-term debtors and creditors from disclosures under financial instruments see note 15 on page 30.

26 Notes to the Accounts continued 7 Directors emoluments The directors emoluments stated in note 6 are those actually paid by the Company.
However, one director is paid by Henderson Global Investors Holdings plc and its subsidiaries Henderson for the provision of services to Henderson Electric and General Investment Trust plc.
It is necessary to state the amount which he receives from Henderson and which relates to the management of the Company even though the Company does not pay these emoluments and is not directly involved in their determination.
The Company has been informed that emoluments paid by Henderson to the director for services to the Company during the year including performance related bonus were 30,000 2001: 55,000.
This amount, together with the amounts payable directly by the Company to the other directors, is included in the analysis below: 2002 2001 000 000 Directors fees paid by the Company to directors 24 26 Directors fees paid by the Company to third parties 54 45 cccc Total directors fees paid by the Company 78 71 mmmm Salary and other benefits paid by Henderson 22 22 Performance related bonus paid by Henderson 8 33 Pension contributions paid by Henderson 2 2 The pension contributions represent those contributions paid by Henderson on behalf of the Henderson employee to a defined benefit non-contributory pension scheme.

The differences are explained below: 2002 2001 000 000 Net revenue on ordinary activities before taxation 4,776 5,043 mmmm Corporation tax at 30% 2001: 30% 1,433 1,513 Franked dividend receipts not chargeable to corporation tax 914 825 Stock dividends 3 15 Excess expenses 14 92 Expenses charged to capital 79 56 Income taxable in different periods 6 21 Overseas withholding tax 155 230 Overseas withholding tax deductible as an expense 58 74 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 34 31 cccc Taxation on net revenue on ordinary activities 560 733 mmmm c Provision for deferred taxation There was no provision for deferred tax made for either this year or the previous year.
The Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 268,000 2001: 281,000 arising as a result of excess management expenses and excess business charges.
These expenses would only be utilised if the Company were to generate sufficient taxable profits in the future.
It is considered too uncertain that the Company will generate such profits and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
10 Return per ordinary share Revenue return per ordinary share is based on the earnings attributable to the ordinary shares of 4,216,000 2001: 4,310,000 and on the weighted average number of 92,423,374 2001: 91,384,939 ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Capital return per ordinary share is based on the net capital losses of 79,651,000 2001: 97,783,000 and on the weighted average number of 92,423,374 2001: 91,384,939 ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The debenture stock is secured by a floating charge over all the Companys assets.
15 Derivatives and other financial instruments a Management of Risk The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares held within the portfolio.
Debenture stocks issued to finance its investing activities.
Foreign currency term loans used as a cost effective method of financing its investing activities.
Cash and short-term debtors and creditors which arise from its investing activities.
The debenture stocks and foreign currency loans both carry fixed rates of interest.
The risks arising from these financial instruments are due to fluctuations in both market prices and foreign currency exchange rates.
The Boards policy for managing these risks is summarised below: Market price risk An investment trust is exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in the market prices of the investments held in its portfolio.
It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular country or sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets together with stock selection covering small, medium and large companies are other factors which act to reduce market price risk.
The Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board which meets regularly to consider investment strategy.
29 Notes to the Accounts continued 15 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Foreign currency risk The Companys total return and balance sheet can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
It is the Boards policy to minimise this risk.
However, from time to time the Company will hold foreign currency cash balances as well as foreign currency balances due to and receivable from brokers.
These assets and liabilities arise from the Companys investing activities.
The exposure is short term and therefore not considered to be material.
The Company has drawn down foreign currency loans denominated in Japanese yen.
The details of these loans are set out in notes 13 and 14 on page 29.
In order to limit the foreign currency risk, it is the Boards policy that the sum total of these loans should not exceed the total of the Japanese portfolio.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
The maturity of the Companys existing borrowings are set out in part c to this note.
b Risk profile of financial assets and financial liabilities Currency exposure A significant portion of the Companys financial assets are denominated in currencies other than sterling with the effect that the balance sheet and total return can be significantly affected by currency movements.
