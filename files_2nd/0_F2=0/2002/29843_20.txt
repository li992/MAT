Accordingly, the disclosure requirements are set out below: Directors The remuneration of the directors is set out in note 5 to the accounts.
There were no contracts subsisting during or at the end of the year in which a director of the Company is or was interested and which are or were significant in relation to the Companys business.
There were no other material transactions during the year with the directors of the Company.
22 RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Companys investing activities undertaken in pursuit of its investment objective as set out on page 1 involve certain inherent risks.
The main risk arising from the Companys financial instruments is market price risk which includes interest rate risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks as summarised below.
These policies have remained substantially unchanged during the current and preceding periods.
Temple Bar Investment Trust 34 Notes to the accounts continued 22 RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Market price risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Board meets on seven scheduled occasions in each year and at each meeting it receives sufficient financial and statistical information to enable it to monitor adequately the investment performance and status of the business.
In addition, financial information is circulated to the directors on a monthly basis.
The Board has also established a series of investment parameters, which are reviewed annually, designed to limit the risk inherent in managing a portfolio of investments.
The Company does not hedge risk.
The Companys borrowings have the effect of increasing the risk faced by shareholders.
This gearing effect is such that, for example, for a 10% movement in the valuation of the Companys investments, the net assets attributable to shareholders would move by approximately 12%.
Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through retained profits including realised and unrealised capital profits, and additional financing is obtained through the two debenture stocks in issue, on which interest is paid at a fixed rate.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of cash balances and short term bank deposits.
Financial assets The majority of the Companys financial assets are equity shares and other investments which neither pay interest nor have a maturity date with the exception of the Companys fixed interest holdings in corporate and treasury bonds totalling 23,869,000 representing 8.6% of net assets of 278,066,000 2001: 23,290,000: 6.5%.
Of these, the weighted average running yield as at 31 December 2002 was 6.2% 2001: 7.8% and the weighted average remaining life was six years 2001: five years.
The Companys cash balances of 14,923,000 2001: 19,532,000 earn interest calculated by reference to LIBOR.
All of the Companys assets are denominated in Sterling.
Financial liabilities All of the Companys financial liabilities of 74,703,000 2001: 73,970,000 are denominated in Sterling, have no interest rate, and are repayable within one year except for the 9& 8% debenture stock and the 5.5% debenture stock which are repayable in 2017 and 2021 respectively, and pay interest at fixed rates.
The weighted average period until maturity of the debenture stocks is 17 years 2001: 18 years and the weighted average interest rate payable is 7.2% 2001: 7.2% per annum.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities All of the financial assets and liabilities of the Company are held at fair value except for the debenture stocks whose fair values, based on the market prices for the respective stocks on 31 December 2002, were as follows: Fair Fair Book value market value Difference market value Difference 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2002 2002 2001 2001 000 000 000 000 000 9& 8% debenture stock 2017 25,000 33,687 8,687 32,922 7,922 5.5% debenture stock 2021 38,000 35,144 2,856 33,774 4,226 63,000 68,831 5,831 66,696 3,696 Temple Bar Investment Trust 35
