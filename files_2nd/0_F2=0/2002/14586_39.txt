Brel & Kjrs noise analysis systems enable both aircraft manufacturers and airport owners to meet stringent international regulations and directives on noise emissions.
A touch of glass Despite an increase in the number of metal cans and plastic bottles, billions of products are still sold in glass containers, primarily due to the advantages of its transparency, high quality image and ease of recycling.
The latest regulations restricting the use of inks containing heavy metals and rising energy costs have led manufacturers to find better solutions for glass decorating.
Fusion UVs curing lamps have found new applications with non-toxic UV inks which allow bright colours to be achieved at temperatures much lower than those required to cure traditional inks.
