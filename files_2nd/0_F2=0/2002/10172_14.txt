Turnover and income recognition Turnover, which excludes value added tax VAT, constitutes the value of services undertaken by the Group as its principal activities, which are recruitment consultancy and other ancillary services.
These consist of: Turnover from temporary placements, which represents amounts billed for the services of temporary staff including the salary cost of these staff.
This is recognised when the service has been provided: Turnover from permanent placements, which is based on a percentage of the candidates remuneration package, and is derived from both retained assignments income recognised on completion of defined stages of work and non-retained assignments income recognised at the date an offer is accepted by a candidate, and where a start date has been determined.
The latter includes turnover anticipated, but not invoiced, at the balance sheet date, which is correspondingly accrued on the balance sheet within Prepayments and accrued income.
A general provision is made against accrued income for possible cancellations of placements prior to, or shortly after, the commencement of employment: and Turnover from amounts billed to clients for expenses incurred on their behalf principally advertisements and is recognised when the expense is incurred.
Cost of sales Cost of sales consist of the salary cost of temporary staff and costs incurred on behalf of clients, principally advertising costs.

It is referred to by management as revenue.
Goodwill Since 31 December 1997, goodwill arising on acquisitions representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the separable net assets acquired has been capitalised and classified as an asset at cost on the balance sheet and amortised over its estimated useful economic life of 20 years.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 31 December 1997 has been written off against reserves and will be charged or credited in the profit and loss account on subsequent disposal of the business to which it related.

Accounting policies continued Foreign exchange Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates the transactions were made.
Exchange differences on these items are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at rates ruling at that date.
Translation differences are dealt with in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Accounts of overseas operations are translated using the closing rate method.
Profits, losses and cash flows of overseas operations are translated at the average exchange rate applicable to the period, whereas assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the rates ruling at the period end.
Unrealised gains and losses arising on these transactions are dealt with in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life at the following rates: Leasehold improvements 10% per annum or period of lease if shorter Furniture, fixtures and equipment 10% - 20% per annum Motor vehicles 25% per annum Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Taxation The charge for taxation is provided at rates of corporation tax ruling during the accounting period.
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on unremitted earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Pension costs The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The pension costs charged to the profit and loss account represent the contributions payable by the Group to the funds during each period.
Leased assets Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.

Taxation on profits on ordinary activities continued c Factors affecting future taxation charges Provision has not been made for taxation on unremitted earnings of Group companies overseas as the earnings are continually reinvested and, accordingly, no taxation is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
Unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas taxes and UK taxation after allowing for double taxation relief if they were to be distributed as dividends.
In the overseas jurisdictions where the Group currently operates, tax rates are generally higher than those in the UK.
Certain of the Group's overseas operations have current and prior year tax losses, the future utilisation of which is uncertain.
Accordingly the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 2,812,000 in respect of tax losses of overseas companies.
These tax losses are available to offset future taxable profits in the respective jurisdictions.

Called up share capital continued Share options At 31 December 2002 the following options had been granted and remained outstanding in respect of the Companys ordinary shares of 1p under the Michael Page International plc Executive Share Option Scheme.
Note 1 Pre flotation options On flotation, options over 33,750,000 9% ordinary shares were granted to the Executive Directors and employees.
As at 31 December 2002, options over 29,276,764 8% ordinary shares remain outstanding.
These options are subject to the following performance conditions: a 55.6% of an individuals option entitlement will normally only be exercisable to the extent that Earnings Per Share EPS targets have been satisfied over a period of 3 to 10 years.
None of these options will vest unless EPS has grown in line with the UK Retail Prices Index RPI plus an average of 5% per annum.
At that point 33.3% of this portion of the options vest.
If EPS growth is higher than this level, vesting increases on a sliding scale basis until 100% of this portion of the options vest where EPS growth matches RPI plus an average of 10% per annum: b 44.4% of an individuals option entitlement will normally only be exercisable to the extent that share price growth targets have been satisfied over a period of at least 3 years.
None of these options will vest unless the Companys share price has achieved 50% growth after 3 years and not later than five years.
Vesting then increases progressively for further share price growth until full vesting occurs where there is 200% growth after 3 years and not later than 5 years.
These hurdles rise from the fifth anniversary of the date of grant at compound rates of growth of 8.45% and 24.57% respectively.
Note 2 Other options In addition to the pre flotation options, further options may be granted over a maximum of 10% of the issued share capital.
On 14 March 2002, options over 7,500,000 ordinary shares were granted in two tranches to the Executive Directors and 203 employees at an exercise price of 186p.
The first tranche of options is exercisable, under normal circumstances, between 3 and 10 years from the date of grant.
The second tranche is exercisable, under normal circumstances, between 4 and 10 years from the date of grant.
These options were granted subject to a performance condition requiring that an option may only be exercised, in normal circumstances, if there has been an increase in base earnings per share as defined of at least 3% per annum above the growth in the retail price index.
The 2001 earnings per share of 10.6p is the base for the first tranche of options.
The 2002 earnings per share of 5.8p is the base for the second tranche of options.
All future grants of options under this scheme will be subject to similar EPS performance conditions which is considered the best measure of the Groups performance and is designed to provide a direct link between the rewards for executives and the returns to shareholders, whilst at the same time ensuring that senior executives can measure the results of their efforts through the Companys share price.
