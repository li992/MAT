Net earnings under the generally accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom UK GAAP, are stated after exceptional charges of US$879 million relating to asset write downs and environmental remediation.
In 2001, there was an exceptional charge for asset write downs of US$583 million.
Under the generally accepted accounting principles in Australia Australian GAAP, these items total US$898 million 2001: US$583 million.

These differences relate principally to the following items, and the effect of each of the adjustments to net earnings and shareholders funds that would be required under Australian GAAP is set out above.
Goodwill For 1997 and prior years, UK GAAP permitted the write off of purchased goodwill on acquisitions directly against reserves.
Under Australian GAAP, goodwill is capitalised and amortised by charges against income over the period during which it is expected to be of benefit, subject to a maximum of 20 years.
Goodwill previously written off directly to reserves in the UK GAAP financial statements has been reinstated and amortised for the purpose of the reconciliation statements.
For acquisitions in 1998 and subsequent years, goodwill is capitalised under UK GAAP, in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 10 FRS 10.
Adjustments are required for Australian GAAP purposes where such capitalised goodwill is amortised over periods exceeding 20 years in the UK GAAP accounts.
Taxation Rio Tinto has implemented FRS 19, the new UK accounting standard on deferred tax.
This has resulted in a prior year adjustment under UK GAAP, which reduced shareholders funds at 1 January 2001 by US$133 million.
Of this amount, US$46 million results from the requirement under FRS 19 to provide in full for deferred taxation on most timing differences.
These additional provisions were already recognised under Australian GAAP.
The remaining US$87 million of the prior year adjustment relates to features of FRS 19 that give rise to new variations from Australian GAAP.
Accordingly, this element of the prior year adjustment has been reversed in arriving at Australian GAAP shareholders funds.
These variations, which also affect the determination of earnings under Australian GAAP, relate principally to the following: a Under FRS 19, provision for the taxes arising on remittances of earnings can only be made if the dividends have been accrued or if there is a binding agreement for the distribution of the earnings.
Under Australian GAAP, provision must be made for tax arising on expected future remittances of past earnings.
b Under FRS 19, tax benefits associated with goodwill charged directly to reserves, in 1997 and previous years, must be accumulated in the deferred tax provision.
This means that the tax benefits are not included in earnings until the related goodwill is charged through the profit and loss account on disposal or closure.
For Australian GAAP, no provision is required for such deferred tax because the goodwill that gave rise to these tax benefits was capitalised and gives rise to amortisation charges against profit.
Asset write downs Under Australian GAAP, asset write downs are US$19 million higher because the relevant carrying values include goodwill that was eliminated directly against reserves in the year of acquisition for UK GAAP purposes.

Rio Tinto 2002 Annual report and financial statements 77 STATEMENT OF TOTAL RECOGNISED GAINS AND LOSSES Outline of dual listed companies structure and basis of financial statements The Rio Tinto Group These are the financial statements of the Rio Tinto Group the Group, formed through the merger of economic interests merger of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited, and presented by both Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited as their consolidated accounts in accordance with both UK and Australian legislation and regulations.
Merger terms On 21 December 1995, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited, which are listed respectively on stock exchanges in the UK and Australia, entered into a dual listed companies DLC merger.
This was effected by contractual arrangements between the Companies and amendments to Rio Tinto plcs Memorandum and Articles of Association and Rio Tinto Limiteds constitution.
As a result, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited and their respective groups operate together as a single economic enterprise, with neither assuming a dominant role.
In particular, the arrangements: confer upon the shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited a common economic interest in both groups: provide for common boards of directors and a unified management structure: provide for equalised dividends and capital distributions: and provide for the shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited to take key decisions, including the election of directors, through an electoral procedure in which the public shareholders of the two Companies effectively vote on a joint basis.
The merger involved no change in the legal ownership of any assets of Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited, nor any change in the ownership of any existing shares or securities of Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited, nor the issue of any shares, securities or payment by way of consideration, save for the issue by each Company of one special voting share to a trustee company which provides the joint electoral procedure for public shareholders.
During 2002, each of the parent Companies issued a DLC Dividend Share to facilitate the efficient management of funds within the DLC structure.
Accounting standards The financial statements have been drawn up in accordance with UK accounting standards.
The merger of economic interests is accounted for as a merger under FRS 6.
Australian Corporations Act The financial statements are drawn up in accordance with an order, under section 340 of the Australian Corporations Act 2001, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on 9 April 2001.
The main provisions of the order are that the financial statements are: to be made out in accordance with UK requirements applicable to consolidated accounts: to be expressed both in UK and Australian currencies: and to include a reconciliation from UK GAAP to Australian GAAP see page 76.
United Kingdom Companies Act In order to present a true and fair view of the Rio Tinto Group, in accordance with FRS 6, the principles of merger accounting have been adopted.
This represents a departure from the provision of the UK Companies Act 1985 which sets out the conditions for merger accounting based on the assumption that a merger is effected through the issue of equity shares.
The main consequence of adopting merger rather than acquisition accounting is that the balance sheet of the merged Group includes the assets and liabilities of Rio Tinto Limited at their carrying values prior to the merger, subject to adjustments to achieve uniformity of accounting policies, rather than at their fair values at the date of the merger.
In the particular circumstances of the merger, the effect of applying acquisition accounting cannot reasonably be quantified.
In order that the financial statements should present a true and fair view, it is necessary to differ from the presentational requirements of the UK Companies Act 1985 by including amounts attributable to both Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited public shareholders in the capital and reserves shown in the balance sheet and in the profit for the financial year.
The UK Companies Act 1985 would require presentation of the capital and reserves and profit for the year attributable to Rio Tinto Limited public shareholders set out in note 25 as a minority interest in the financial statements of the Rio Tinto Group.
This presentation would not give a true and fair view of the effect of the Sharing Agreement under which the position of all public shareholders is as nearly as possible the same as if they held shares in a single company.
78 Rio Tinto 2002 Annual report and financial statements OUTLINE OF DUAL LISTED COMPANIES STRUCTURE Notes to the 2002 financial statements 1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of preparation FRS 19 Deferred Tax has been adopted in 2002.
Prior to the adoption of FRS 19, Rio Tinto provided for deferred tax where, in the opinion of the directors, it was probable that a timing difference would reverse within the foreseeable future.
Under FRS 19, full provision is made for deferred taxation on all timing differences that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date, except in limited circumstances.
The main exceptions are as follows: Tax payable on the future remittance of the past earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures is provided only to the extent that dividends have been accrued or there is a binding agreement to distribute such past earnings where previously the Group recognised such deferred tax to the extent that it was probable that a liability would crystallise.
Deferred tax is not recognised on revaluations of non monetary assets arising on acquisitions unless there is a binding agreement to sell the asset and the gain or loss expected to arise from the disposal has been recognised where previously the Group recognised deferred tax in respect of such adjustments.
FRS 19 requires that provisions for deferred tax are made in respect of tax benefits related to goodwill that was charged directly to reserves on acquisitions made prior to 1998.
Such provisions are released when the related goodwill is charged through the profit and loss account on disposal or closure.
Under the previous accounting policy, such tax benefits were taken up in the profit and loss account in the year in which they were received.
The balance sheet at 31 December 2001 has been restated following the implementation of FRS 19, which has reduced shareholders funds by US$133 million.
The restatement also included an increase in deferred tax provisions of US$57 million, an increase in the investment in associates of US$10 million and a reduction of US$86 million in property, plant and equipment.
The application of FRS 19 did not impact significantly on net earnings for either 2002 or 2001.
Accordingly, prior year earnings have not been restated.
The Groups accounting policies comply with applicable UK accounting standards and, except for the implementation of FRS 19 as described above, are consistent with last year.
As explained in the section headed Outline of dual listed companies structure and basis of financial statements, the accounting policies depart from the requirements of the UK Companies Act in order to provide a true and fair view of the merger between Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited.
b Basis of consolidation The financial statements consist of the consolidation of the accounts of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited and their respective subsidiary undertakings subsidiaries.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis, with no revaluations of fixed assets.
The Groups shares of the assets, liabilities, earnings and reserves of associated undertakings associates and joint ventures are included in the Group financial statements using the equity and gross equity accounting methods respectively.
The Group consolidates its own share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenditure of joint arrangements that are not entities.
c Turnover Turnover comprises sales to third parties at invoiced amounts, with most sales being priced ex works, free on board fob or cost, insurance and freight cif.
A large proportion of Group production is sold under medium to long term contracts and is included in sales when deliveries are made.
Gross turnover shown in the profit and loss account includes the Groups share of the turnover of joint ventures and associates.
By product revenues are included in turnover.
d Currency translation Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of transaction or, where foreign currency forward contracts have been arranged, at contractual rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at year end exchange rates, or at a contractual rate if applicable.
On consolidation, profit and loss account items are translated into US dollars at average rates of exchange.
Balance sheet items are translated into US dollars at year end exchange rates.
Certain non US resident companies, whose functional currency is the US dollar, account in that currency.
The Group finances its operations primarily in US dollars and a significant proportion of the Groups US dollar debt is located in subsidiaries having functional currencies other than the US dollar.
Exchange gains and losses relating to US dollar debt impact on the profit and loss accounts of such subsidiaries.
However, such exchange gains and losses are excluded from the Groups profit and loss account on consolidation, with a corresponding adjustment to reserves.
This means that financing in US dollars impacts in a consistent manner on the Groups consolidated accounts irrespective of the functional currency of the particular subsidiary where the debt is located.
Exchange differences on the translation of the net operating assets of companies with functional currencies other than the US dollar, less offsetting exchange differences on net debt in currencies other than the US dollar financing those net assets, are dealt with through reserves.
All other exchange differences are charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise, except as set out below in note o relating to derivative contracts.
For presentation purposes, Group profit and loss account and cash flow items are translated from US dollars into Australian dollars and sterling using average exchange rates.
Balance sheet items are translated at year end exchange rates.
e Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill and intangible assets arising on acquisitions after 31 December 1997 are capitalised in accordance with FRS 10.
These assets are amortised over their useful economic lives, which may exceed 20 years.
Amortisation is charged on a straight line or units of production basis as appropriate.
In 1997 and previous years, goodwill was eliminated against reserves in the year of acquisition as a matter of accounting policy.
Such goodwill was not reinstated on implementation of FRS 10: but on sale or closure of a business, any related goodwill eliminated against reserves is charged in the profit and loss account.
f Exploration and evaluation During the initial stage of a project, full provision is made for the costs thereof by charge against profits for the year.
Expenditure on a project after it has reached a stage at which there is a high degree of confidence in its viability is carried forward and transferred to tangible fixed assets if the project proceeds.
If a project does not prove viable, all irrecoverable costs associated with the project are written off.
If an undeveloped project is sold, any gain or loss is included in operating profit, such transactions being a normal part of the Groups activities.
Where expenditure is carried forward in respect of a project which may not proceed to commercial development for some time, provision is made against the possibility of non Rio Tinto 2002 Annual report and financial statements 79 NOTES TO THE 2002 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the 2002 financial statements continued development by charge against profits over a period of up to seven years.
When it is decided to proceed with development, any provisions made in previous years are reversed to the extent that the relevant costs are recoverable.
g Tangible fixed assets The cost of a tangible fixed asset comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use.
Costs associated with a start-up period are capitalised where the asset is available for use but incapable of operating at normal levels without a commissioning period.
Net interest before tax payable on borrowings related to construction or development projects is capitalised until the point when substantially all the activities that are necessary to make the asset ready for use are complete.
h Mining properties and leases Once a mining project has been established as commercially viable, expenditure other than that on buildings, plant and equipment is capitalised under mining properties and leases together with any amount transferred from exploration and evaluation.
Such expenditure is amortised against profits, applying the same principles as for other tangible fixed assets.
In open pit mining operations, it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste materials to access mineral deposits.
The costs of removing waste materials are referred to as stripping costs.
During the development of a mine, before production commences, such costs are capitalised as part of the investment in construction of the mine.
Removal of waste materials continues during the production stage of the mine.
The Group defers such production stage stripping costs where this is the most appropriate basis for matching revenue and costs and the effect is material.
The deferral of, and subsequent charges for, these stripping costs are based on the life of mine stripping ratio.
This ratio is calculated by dividing the estimated total volume of production stage stripping by the estimated future ore production over the life of the operation.
The ratio is then applied to the quantity of ore mined in the period to determine the current period production cost charged against earnings.
i Depreciation and carrying values of fixed assets Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is calculated on a straight line or units of production basis, as appropriate.
Assets are fully depreciated over their economic lives, or over the remaining life of the mine if shorter.
Depreciation rates for the principal assets of the Group vary from 2.5 per cent to ten per cent per annum.
Tangible and intangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
In addition, goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first complete financial year after the relevant acquisition and, where the goodwill is being amortised over a period exceeding 20 years, annually thereafter.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant income generating unit, or disposal value if higher.
The discount rate applied is based upon the Groups weighted average cost of capital with appropriate adjustment for the risks associated with the relevant unit.
Estimates of future net cash flows are based on ore reserves and mineral resources for which there is a high degree of confidence of economic extraction.
j Determination of ore reserves Rio Tinto estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by Competent Persons as defined in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves of September 1999 the JORC code.
Reserves, and for certain mines resources, determined in this way are used in the calculation of depreciation, amortisation, impairment and close down and restoration costs.
k Provisions for close down and restoration and for environmental clean up costs Both for close down and restoration and for environmental clean up costs, provision is made in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs, based on the net present value of estimated future costs.
The amortisation or unwinding of the discount applied in establishing the net present value of provisions is charged to the profit and loss account in each accounting period.
The amortisation of the discount is shown as a financing cost rather than as an operating cost.
For close down and restoration costs, which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas, movements in provisions other than the amortisation of the discount, such as those resulting from changes in the cost estimates, lives of operations or discount rates, are capitalised and depreciated over future production.
l Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost for raw materials and stores is purchase price and for partly processed and saleable products is generally the cost of production, including the appropriate proportion of depreciation and overheads.
Inventories are valued on a first in, first out FIFO basis.
m Deferred tax Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all timing differences that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date, except in limited circumstances.
The main exceptions are as follows: Tax payable on the future remittance of the past earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures is provided only to the extent that dividends have been accrued or there is a binding agreement to distribute such past earnings.
Deferred tax is not recognised on revaluations of non monetary assets arising on acquisitions unless there is a binding agreement to sell the asset and the gain or loss expected to arise from the disposal has been recognised.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Provisions for deferred tax are made in respect of tax benefits related to goodwill that was charged directly to reserves on acquisitions made prior to 1998.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted to their present value.
n Post retirement benefits In accordance with SSAP 24, the expected costs of post retirement benefits under defined benefit arrangements are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the costs over the service lives of employees entitled to those benefits.
Variations from the regular cost are spread on a straight line basis over the expected average remaining service lives of relevant current employees.
Costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
80 Rio Tinto 2002 Annual report and financial statements NOTES TO THE 2002 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED o Financial instruments The Groups policy with regard to Treasury management and financial instruments is set out in the Financial review.
When the Group enters into derivative contracts these transactions are designed to reduce exposures related to assets and liabilities, firm commitments or anticipated transactions, and are therefore accounted for as hedges.
Amounts receivable and payable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as an adjustment to net interest over the life of the contract.
Gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts and currency swaps relating to financial assets and liabilities are matched against the losses or gains on the hedged items, either in the profit and loss account or through reserves as appropriate.
Gains and losses on financial instruments relating to firm commitments or anticipated transactions for revenue items are deferred and recognised when the hedged transaction occurs.
Gains and losses on financial instruments relating to firm commitments or anticipated transactions for capital expenditure are capitalised and depreciated in line with the underlying asset.
The cash flows from these contracts are classified in a manner consistent with the underlying nature of the related transaction.
Including exceptional charges, the total charge for depreciation and amortisation for 2002 was US$1,893 million 2001: US$1,630 million, provisions were US$174 million 2001: US$100 million and other external costs were US$1,166 million 2001: US$906 million.
b Information on auditors remuneration is included in note 37.

The emergence of a charge this year, compared to a credit in 2001, reflects the reduced value of pension fund assets associated with falling stock markets and a reduction in the expected return on pension fund equity investments compared with that applied previously.
b UITF Abstract 17 requires the intrinsic value of share options to be recognised as a cost.
However, the Groups SAYE schemes are exempt from this requirement.
None of the Groups other share option schemes involve granting new options at a discount to market value.
Rio Tinto 2002 Annual report and financial statements 81 NOTES TO THE 2002 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the 2002 financial statements continued 4 EXCEPTIONAL CHARGES The exceptional charges analysed at the foot of the profit and loss account are added back in arriving at adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share.
In 2002, the exceptional charges total US$1,094 million gross of which US$1,078 million related to subsidiaries and US$16 million to joint ventures 2001: US$715 million gross all of which related to subsidiaries.
After tax and outside interests the exceptional charges for 2002 were US$879 million 2001: US$583 million.
The exceptional charges of US$879 million recognised in 2002, comprise provisions of US$763 million for the impairment of asset carrying values and a charge of US$116 million relating to environmental remediation works at Kennecott Utah Copper KUC.
Of the impairment charge, US$480 million relates to KUC and US$235 million relates to the Iron Ore Company of Canada IOC.
In 2001, exceptional asset write downs of US$583 million after tax included US$531 million relating to KUC, which produces both copper and gold.
The remainder related to gold producing assets.
Most of the impairment provisions have been calculated so as to ensure that the carrying value of the relevant asssets are the same as the present value of the expected future cash flows relating to those assets.
The discount rates used in calculating the present value of expected future cash flows were derived from the Groups weighted average cost of capital, with appropriate risk adjustments, and are consistent with 2001.
When adjusted to include inflation and grossed up at the Groups average tax rate for 2002, before exceptional items, the discount rate applied to the relevant income generating units was equivalent to ten per cent, except for gold production for which a rate equivalent to seven per cent was used.
The impairment provision against IOC aligns the carrying value with the value negotiated between shareholders during 2002 as part of a financial restructuring exercise.

The current provision is expected to be utilised over the next 15 to 20 years.
b The provision for other employee entitlements includes pension entitlements of US$44 million and a provision for long service leave, based on the relevant entitlements in certain Group operations.
Some US$79 million is expected to be utilised within the next year.
c The Groups policy on close down and restoration costs is shown in note 1k.
Close down and restoration costs are a normal consequence of mining, and the majority of close down and restoration expenditure is incurred at the end of a mines life.
Remaining lives of mines range from two to over 50 years with an average, weighted by closure provision, of around 25 years.
Although the ultimate cost to be incurred is uncertain, subsidiary companies have estimated their respective costs based on feasibility and engineering studies using current restoration standards and techniques.
Provisions of US$1,662 million for close down and restoration costs and other environmental obligations include estimates of the effect of future inflation and have been discounted to their present value at six per cent per annum, being an estimate of the risk free pre tax cost of borrowing.
Excluding the effects of future inflation, and before discounting, this is equivalent to some US$2.7 billion.
d Some US$106 million of environmental clean up expenditure is expected to take place within the next five years.
The remainder includes amounts for the operation and maintenance of remediation facilities in later years.
The provision for environmental expenditure includes the issue described in e below.
e In 1995, Kennecott Utah Copper KUC agreed with the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA and the State of Utah to complete certain source control projects and perform specific environmental studies regarding contamination of ground water in the vicinity of the Bingham Canyon mine.
A remedial investigation and feasibility study on the South Zone ground water contamination completed in March 1998 identified a range of alternative measures to address this issue.
Additional studies were conducted to refine the workable alternatives.
A final remedial design document was completed before the end of 2002.
It is anticipated that formal agreement with the State of Utah Natural Resource Damage Trustee, the State of Utah and the Jordan Valley Water Conservancy District will be completed in early 2003.
KUC will also be entering into a judicial consent decree with the EPA in 2003, for the remedial action on the ground water, including the acidic portion of the contamination.
Financial provisions for the estimated clean up costs for this ground water contamination have been increased by US$116 million in 2002 to reflect the terms of the final remedial design document.
f Other provisions deal with a variety of issues and include US$60 million relating to the remaining provision for the mark to market valuation of the hedge books held by companies acquired in 2000 and 2001, which will be utilised over the next nine years see note 28, and US$42 million relating to payments received from employees for accommodation at some sites which are refundable in certain circumstances.

b As a consequence of acquisitions during 2000, the Group holds a number of interest rate swaps to receive US$ floating rates and pay US$ fixed rates which have been included in the total of fixed rate debt shown above.
Similarly, as a consequence of acquisitions in 2000, the Group acquired interest rate option contracts which give it the right to pay fixed interest rates and receive floating interest rates.
As at 31 December 2002, these options had a principal of US$25 million 2001: US$180 million and a US$nil 2001: US$nil fair value.

d After taking into account all interest rate swaps, the Groups fixed rate debt totals US$685 million and has a weighted average interest rate of 6.6 per cent and a weighted average time to maturity of three years 2001: US$822 million with a weighted average interest rate of 7.0 per cent and a weighted average time to maturity of four years.
e Interest rates on the great majority of the Groups floating rate financial liabilities and assets will have been reset within six months.
The interest rates applicable to the Groups US dollar denominated floating rate financial liabilities and assets did not differ materially at the year end from the three month US dollar LIBOR rate of 1.4 per cent.
f The above table does not include the remaining US$60 million 2001: US$80 million net provision for the mark to market valuation of the hedge books held by companies acquired in 2000 and 2001 and other financial assets of US$122 million 2001: US$343 million all of which are non interest bearing.
Further details of the instruments included within the acquisition provision for mark to market valuation of the hedge books held by companies acquired are shown in section A above and section C below.
g These non interest bearing financial liabilities have been presented in the financial statements on a discounted basis, using a discount rate of 3.8 per cent.

There are other financial assets totalling US$122 million of which US$86 million have no fixed maturity and US$36 million which has a maturity greater than one year.
In accordance with FRS 4, all commercial paper is classified as short term borrowings though the US$1,749 million outstanding at 31 December 2002 is all backed by medium term facilities 2001: commercial paper of US$2,889 million of which US$1,900 million was backed by medium term facilities.
Further details of available facilities are given on page 112.
Rio Tinto 2002 Annual report and financial statements 111 NOTES TO THE 2002 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the 2002 financial statements continued 28 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED As at 31 December 2002, a total of US$1,833 million is outstanding under the US$2 billion European Medium Term Notes facility, of which US$674 million is repayable within one year.
A US$500 million five year bond was issued in 2001 from a possible US$1 billion which the Group is able to issue under the SEC shelf registration filed in that year, subject to market conditions and terms.
At 31 December 2002, the Group had unutilised standby credit facilities totalling US$2.8 billion.

Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
In other cases, fair values have been calculated using quotations from independent financial institutions, or by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing market rates.
The fair value of cash, short term borrowings and loans to joint ventures and associates approximates to the carrying value, as a result of their short maturity or because they carry floating rates of interest.

No material loss to the Group is expected to result from these claims.
In 2002, the Australian Tax Office issued assessments of approximately A$500 million which amount includes penalties and interest in relation to certain transactions undertaken by the Australian group in a prior year.
These assessments would equate with US$283 million or 176 million at year end exchange rates.
The Group has lodged objections to the assessments but these have not yet been determined.
This dispute may result in litigation but, based on Counsels opinion, the directors believe that the assessments are not sustainable under the Australian law prevailing at the time of the transactions.
Accordingly, the directors believe that no material loss will arise.
In accordance with Australian tax law and practice, payment of all or part of the disputed tax assessments may be required pending resolution of the dispute.
Any such payments will be subject to recovery with interest if, as is believed, the Group is successful in challenging the assessments.
Employee numbers for joint arrangements, joint ventures and associates are proportional to the Groups equity interest.
Average employee numbers include a part year effect for companies acquired during the year.
b Part time employees are included on a full time equivalent basis.
Temporary employees are included in employee numbers.
c People employed by contractors are not included.

Revaluation adjustments to other tangible fixed assets were based on depreciated replacement cost or, where appropriate, the assets recoverable amount.
The fair values attributed to the mining properties and joint ventures of the Australian coal operations of the Peabody Group, acquired in 2001, in the balance sheet reported at 31 December 2001 were provisional.
These fair values have been updated during 2002 to take account of updated estimates of the future cash flows for the businesses acquired, based on a closer examination of the potential of these businesses at the date of acquisition, a further analysis of tax and other liabilities and the proceeds of the disposals referred to below.
This has resulted in an increase in the fair values ascribed to the retained joint ventures of US$55 million, an increase in current tax liabilities of US$46 million, an increase in tangible fixed assets of US$15 million, an increase in provisions of US$12 million and a decrease in assets held for resale see below of US$12 million.
Disposals Total disposal proceeds for the sale of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates were US$233 million.
The Group disposed of the Moura joint venture and Ravensworth and Narama thermal coal complex which were acquired with the Australian coal operations of the Peabody Group in 2001.
This disposal had no earnings effect as the fair values ascribed to these assets on acquisition were adjusted during 2002 to reflect the sale proceeds.
This involved a decrease in the fair value ascribed to assets held for resale of US$12 million.
The accrued pension entitlement for the highest paid director was 656,000 A$1,812,528, 2001: 579,000 A$1,642,452.

Access to the mine site has not been possible and an accurate assessment of the condition of the assets cannot be determined.
Considerable funding would be required to recommence operations to the level which applied at the time of the mines closure in 1989 and these funding requirements cannot be forecast accurately.
The directors do not have access to reliable, verifiable or objective information on BCL and the directors have therefore decided to exclude BCL information from the financial statements.
BCL reported a net profit of US$2 million for the financial year 2001: profit of US$3 million.
This is based upon actual transactions for the financial year.
The aggregate amount of capital and reserves reported by BCL as at 31 December 2002 was US$76 million 2001: US$79 million.
The Group owns 214,887,966 shares in BCL, representing 53.6 per cent of the issued share capital.
The investment of US$195 million was fully provided against in 1991.
At 31 December 2002, the market value of the shareholding in BCL was US$16 million.
41 POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS a Description of schemes The Group operates a number of pension plans around the world.
Whilst some of these plans are defined contribution, the majority are of the defined benefit type, with assets held in separate trustee administered funds, which are reviewed by independent qualified actuaries.
A triennial actuarial valuation of the Groups UK plan was made at 31 March 2000 using the projected unit method.
The main financial assumptions used for the independent actuarial review as at 31 December 2002 were: rate of return on investments 6.5 per cent 2001: 7.0 per cent, rate of earnings growth 4.8 per cent 2001: 5.0 per cent plus promotional salary scale, rate of pension increase 2.3 per cent 2001: 2.5 per cent.
Assets were measured at market value, smoothed over a one year period 2001: smoothed market value.
Based on an average of market prices for the four quarters to 31 December 2002, the value of the assets in the UK pension plans was sufficient to cover 129 per cent 2001: 154 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected increases in earnings.
The smoothed market value of the assets was US$1,358 million 2001: US$1,417 million.
In Australia, whilst Group companies sponsor or subscribe to a number of pension plans, the Rio Tinto Staff Superannuation Fund is the only significant plan.
This plan principally contains defined contribution liabilities but also has defined benefit liabilities.
Independent actuarial valuations are made annually using the projected unit method.
The main financial assumptions used for the valuation as at 30 September 2002 were: rate of return on investments after tax 6.5 per cent 2001: 6.5 per cent, rate of earnings growth 4.0 per cent 2001: 4.0 per cent plus promotional salary scale, rate of pension increase 2.5 per cent 2001: 2.5 per cent.
Assets were measured at smoothed market value 2001: smoothed market value.
Based on an average of the market prices for the four quarters to 31 December 2002, the value of the assets in the Australian pension plans was sufficient to cover 103 per cent 2001: 115 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected increases in earnings.
The smoothed market value of the assets was US$600 million 2001: US$586 million.
A number of defined benefit pension plans are sponsored by the US entities, typically with separate provision for salaried and hourly paid staff.
The main financial assumptions used for the valuation as at 30 September 2002 were: rate of return on investments 6.7 per cent 2001: 7.5 per cent, rate of earnings growth, where appropriate, 3.25 per cent 2001: 3.5 per cent.
Based on an average of the market prices for the four quarters to 31 December 2002, the value of the assets in the US plans was sufficient to cover 81 per cent 2001: 103 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected increases in earnings.
Within the total there were plans which had deficits of US$136 million 2001: US$67 million.
The smoothed market value of the assets was US$551 million 2001: US$613 million.
Contributions will be paid, if necessary, to ensure that the plans meet statutory US funding levels.
A number of defined benefit pension plans are sponsored by entities in Canada.
The main financial assumptions used for the valuation as at 30 September 2002 were: rate of return on investments 6.5 per cent 2001: 7.75 per cent, rate of earnings growth, where appropriate, 3.7 per cent 2001: 5.0 per cent.
Based on an average of the market prices for the four quarters to 31 December 2002, the value of the assets in the Canadian plans was sufficient to cover 82 per cent 2001: 105 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected increases in earnings.
Within the total there were plans which had deficits of US$134 million 2001: US$27 million.
The smoothed market value of the assets was US$538 million 2001: US$557 million.
Additional contributions will be paid in 2003 to meet a funding shortfall in one Canadian plan.
The main defined benefit plans outside the UK, Australia and North America were assessed at various dates during 2001 and 2002.
The total market value of the assets at the assessment dates was US$202 million 2001: US$224 million.
The actuarial value of the total assets of these plans was sufficient to cover 141 per cent 2001: 137 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected increases in earnings.
The expected average remaining service life in the major plans ranges from ten to 20 years with an overall average of 12 years.
The main pension plans providing purely defined contribution benefits held assets, equal to their liabilities, of US$101 million as at 31 December 2002.
The Groups contributions to these plans are charged against profits.
The Group uses asset values smoothed over a one year period in arriving at its pension costs under SSAP 24.
Pension costs for 2003 are expected to be higher than in 2002 as a result of changes in stock market values.
Certain subsidiaries of the Group, mainly in the US, provide health and life insurance benefits to retired employees and in some cases their beneficiaries and covered dependants.
Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain age and service criteria.
On 30 September 2002, the unfunded accumulated post retirement benefits obligation and annual cost of accrual of benefits were determined by independent actuaries using the projected unit method.
In the US, the main financial assumptions were: discount rate 6.5 per cent at 30 September 2001: 7.5 per cent, Medical Trend Rate 8.0 per cent reducing to 5.0 per cent by the year 2009 at 30 September 2001 initially 8.5 per cent reducing to 5.0 per cent by the year 2009, claims cost based on individual company experience.
The assumptions were consistent with those adopted for determining pension costs.
At 30 September 2002, the unfunded accumulated post retirement benefits obligation excluding associates and joint ventures was US$437 million at 30 September 2001: US$362 million.
Rio Tinto 2002 Annual report and financial statements 121 NOTES TO THE 2002 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the 2002 financial statements continued 41 POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED b FRS 17 Transitional disclosures for 2002 Mandatory implementation of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, which deals with accounting for post retirement benefits, has been delayed until the year ending 31 December 2005 but additional disclosures are required for the current year, which are shown below.
The standard requires pension deficits, and surpluses to the extent that they are considered recoverable, to be recognised in full.
Annual service cost and net financial income on the assets and liabilities of the schemes are recognised through earnings.
Other fluctuations in the value of the surpluses deficits are recognised in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses STRGL.

Since these schemes are unfunded, contributions for future years will be equal to benefit payments and therefore cannot be pre determined.
122 Rio Tinto 2002 Annual report and financial statements NOTES TO THE 2002 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 41 POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED In relation to pensions, it is expected that there will be no regular employer or employee contributions to the UK plan in the period before the next full valuation.
There are no pre-agreed rates outside the UK, Canada and Australia for periods beyond 2003.
Cash contributions to the main Australian plan recommenced in December 2002 at rates set by the actuary to the plan and are primarily to defined contribution arrangements.
In the US, contributions are agreed annually in nominal terms.
Contribution rates for the Canadian schemes vary between the plans from zero to 6.5 per cent, although additional contributions will be paid in 2003 to meet a funding shortfall in one plan.
The most recent full valuation of the UK schemes was at 31 March 2000.
The most recent full valuation of the Australian schemes was at 30 September 2002.
For both the US and Canadian schemes, the most recent full valuation was at 1 January 2002.
