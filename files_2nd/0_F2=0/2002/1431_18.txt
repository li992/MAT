Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of operational land, investment properties, land at ports held for development and investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings.
Basis of consolidated financial statements The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company, its subsidiary undertakings and its share of the results of associated undertakings.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired are included from the date of acquisition.
The results of discontinued operations are included up to the date of disposal.
New financial reporting standards Financial Reporting Standard FRS 19 Deferred Tax became effective for accounting periods ending on or after 23 January 2002 and has been adopted in the preparation of these financial statements.
The effects of adopting FRS 19 are set out in note 34 and comparative results have been restated throughout these financial statements to reflect the adoption of FRS 19.
The group continues to account for pensions in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
The group is continuing to apply the transitional disclosure requirements see note 5 of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
Turnover and profit recognition Turnover comprises the amounts receivable in respect of ports and transport services provided to third parties, income from investment properties and sales of property developments, excluding related sales taxes.
Turnover and profit, in relation to the provision of ports and transport services and income from investment property, is recognised when the provision of the service is complete.
Turnover and profits or losses arising on the sale of sites or completed developments are recognised when contracts for sale have been exchanged and when all material conditions have been satisfied.
Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments utilised by the group comprise interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
All such instruments are used for hedging purposes to manage the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure of the group in line with the groups risk management policies which are set out in the operating and financial review on page 29.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the contract.
Exchange gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are recognised on maturity of the underlying transaction.
Profits or losses arising on the early termination of interest rate swap transactions and forward foreign exchange contracts are recognised when the agreement is terminated or transferred to a third party.
Goodwill Purchased goodwill arising on consolidation, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, is capitalised in the year in which it arises and is amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful economic life.
The estimated useful economic life is calculated having due regard to the period over which the group expects to derive economic benefit from the assets.
For acquisitions made since 1 January 1998, the estimated useful economic life does not exceed 20 years.
Prior to 1 January 1998, as a result of accounting policies in force at that time, purchased goodwill arising on consolidation was written-off against reserves in the year of acquisition.
Tangible operating assets Operational land, pre-1 January 1999, is held at the 31 December 1998 valuation with subsequent additions being valued at cost and transfers from tangible property assets being made at the carrying value of the last balance sheet date.
All other tangible operating assets are carried at cost adjusted for subsequent additions and disposals.
Finance costs directly attributable to the construction of certain major additions to fixed assets are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis with reference to the expected useful lives of the various types of asset.
These lives range up to a maximum of 50 years for capital dredging costs, dock structures, roads, quays and buildings: up to 30 years for floating craft: and between two and 30 years for plant and equipment.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Significant capital investment grants are credited to the profit and loss account over the useful lives of the assets concerned.
The balance of such grants not yet transferred to the profit and loss account is included as deferred income.
Any transfers of tangible operating assets to investment properties are reflected net of any unamortised capital investment grants.
Tangible property assets Investment properties and land held for development are stated at open market value.
In accordance with SSAP 19 Accounting for Investment Properties, revaluations are conducted annually with any surpluses or deficits being transferred to the revaluation reserve.
No provision is made for depreciation of freehold properties or for amortisation of leasehold properties held on leases having more than 20 years unexpired.
This departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985, which requires all properties to be depreciated, is, in the opinion of the directors, necessary for the financial statements to show a true and fair view in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
34 Associated British Ports Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2002 1 Accounting policies continued Tangible property assets continued The depreciation or amortisation which would, had the provisions of the Act been followed, have reduced profit for the year is only one of the factors reflected in the annual valuation and the amount attributable to this factor cannot reasonably be separately identified or quantified.
Transfers of property from fixed assets to current assets property developments and land held for sale are made at the higher of market value on the date of transfer or the carrying value at the last balance sheet.
This departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985, which requires transfer at the lower of cost and net realisable value, is, in the opinion of the directors, necessary for the financial statements to show a true and fair view in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
Had the provisions of the Act been followed, the net assets of the group would be artificially reduced on transfer, whereas in reality, such a reduction has not occurred: and the profit on disposal calculated by reference to a lower carrying value, would give rise to an artificially high profit.
Transfers of property from property developments to fixed assets are made at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value as at the date of transfer.
Leased assets At the inception of finance leases, the capital cost of the asset is included in the financial statements both as a tangible operating asset and as an obligation to pay future rentals.
Amounts payable in respect of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Property developments and land held for sale Property developments and land held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or transfer value if transferred from tangible operating assets or tangible property assets and net realisable value.
Retirement benefits The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes.
The majority of the scheme members are in funded schemes with the assets being held in separate trustee-administered funds.
In accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs, the expected cost of pensions in respect of the groups defined benefit pension schemes is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the service lives of employees in the schemes.
Past service surpluses and other variations from the regular cost are spread over the expected remaining service lives of current employees in the schemes.
The pension cost is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
Provision is maintained for unfunded retirement benefit arrangements less attributable taxation on a full provision basis.
Interest at the rate recommended by the actuaries is credited to the provision and charged to the profit and loss account.
Payments are charged to the provision.
The group also contributes to a number of defined contribution pension schemes.
These costs are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which contributions become payable.
The group has included the transitional disclosures required under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits in note 5b.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Other than for timing differences arising due to capital losses, and property revaluation gains, deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the groups taxable profit and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax computations in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
The group does not provide for timing differences arising from capital losses, as the future utilisation of these losses cannot be assessed with reasonable certainty.
No deferred tax is provided in relation to property revaluation gains, as the group expects any crystallised gains to be offset by brought-forward losses.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
The groups deferred tax provision is measured on an undiscounted basis.
Foreign currencies Transactions of UK companies denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at that date.
Where matching forward foreign exchange contracts have been entered into, the rate specified in the relevant contract is used.
These translation differences are recognised in the profit and loss account.
The profit and loss accounts of foreign subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at average rates for the year: the balance sheets are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All exchange differences arising on consolidation are taken directly to reserves.
All other translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account, with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against group equity investments in foreign enterprises which are taken directly to reserves together with the exchange difference on the net investment in these enterprises.

3 Exceptional items Towards the end of 2002, the group undertook a review of its cost base which resulted in a 5.5 million restructuring charge.
This has been recorded as an exceptional item within administrative expenses.

The group entered into a conditional sale agreement on 29 July 2002 with subsidiaries of Macquarie Global Infrastructure Funds, the sale being conditional upon obtaining consents from the relevant airport and regulatory authorities.
All of these consents, together with the cash proceeds of 32.0 million US$50.0 million, were received by 13 December 2002.
In addition, an exceptional charge of 0.4 million arose on the closure of Southern Emergency Vehicles, a small vehicle-modification business located in the USA.

5 Retirement benefits The group continues to account for pensions in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs and the disclosures given in a are those required by that standard.
The group is continuing to apply the transitional disclosure requirements of Financial Reporting Standard FRS 17 Retirement Benefits see b below.
a SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs The group participates in a number of pension schemes, principally in the UK.
The major scheme is a funded defined benefits scheme The Associated British Ports Group Pension Scheme ABPGPS.
The defined benefits section of this scheme was closed to new members with effect from 1 April 2002.
New members joining ABPGPS from 1 April 2002 are offered membership of a defined contributions section which at 31 December 2002 constituted less than 0.1% of the total asset value.
The assets of the groups pension schemes are held in trust funds independent of its finances.
For ABPGPS, the pension costs under SSAP 24 have been assessed in accordance with the advice of a firm of actuaries, Mercer Human Resource Consulting.
The most recent valuation of ABPGPS, the groups largest funded defined benefit scheme, was undertaken as at 31 December 2000.
The market value of the assets of the scheme at the valuation date was 484.4 million.
The value of the assets represented 137 per cent of the benefits which had accrued to members after allowing for future expected increases in earnings and certain benefit improvements.
The regular cost has been assessed on the basis of the projected unit method.
The assets of the scheme have been taken into account at their market value.
Consistent with this, the liabilities were valued using financial assumptions derived from yields on index-linked and fixedinterest government securities.
In particular, it was assumed that pensions would increase by 2.5 per cent per annum the implied rate of inflation, salaries would increase by 4.0 per cent per annum and investments would yield 5.0 per cent per annum 4.5 per cent per annum post-retirement on accrued liabilities.
In deriving the pension costs under SSAP 24, the surplus in the scheme is being spread over the future working lives of existing members.

b FRS 17 Transitional disclosures The pension costs reported in 5a above have been calculated in accordance with SSAP 24.
Under the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, the group is disclosing the following information that would have been reported had the group calculated its pension costs for the year ended 31 December 2002 and valued its scheme assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2002 in accordance with FRS 17. i The latest formal revaluation of the scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2000.
The valuation of the liabilities detailed below has been derived by projecting forward the position as at 31 December 2000 and has been performed by an independent actuary, Mercer Human Resource Consulting.
FRS 17 gives the present value of pension liabilities by discounting pension commitments including an allowance for salary growth, using a AA corporate bond yield.

59 Notes to the financial statements 34 Financial Reporting Standard 19 Deferred Tax FRS 19 restatement The group adopted FRS 19, which sets out the revised accounting guidance on deferred tax, in its 2002 interim financial statements.
Prior to FRS 19, the group had complied with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 15 Deferred Tax SSAP 15 which required provision for deferred tax to be made using the liability method to the extent that the net deferred tax assets or liabilities recognised were likely to crystallise in the foreseeable future.
Given the groups ongoing capital expenditure programme, under SSAP 15 the group was not required to recognise any deferred tax liability in respect of the timing differences between the groups industrial building and capital allowances and the groups depreciation expense as the groups industrial building and capital allowances are expected to continue at levels in excess of the groups depreciation expense for the foreseeable future.
Under FRS 19, except for brought-forward capital losses and property revaluation gains, the group has made a full provision for deferred tax in respect of timing differences and recognised in full the future tax impact of past transactions without taking into account the beneficial tax impact of the groups planned future capital expenditure programme as permitted under SSAP 15.
The group has not recorded a deferred tax asset with respect to unrelieved capital losses as the recoverability of these cannot be assessed with reasonable certainty.
The adoption of FRS 19 has increased the groups reported underlying effective tax rate from 24.8 per cent to 28.0 per cent and reduced the groups underlying earnings per share by 1.4 pence from 31.8 pence to 30.4 pence.
In addition, net assets as at 31 December 2002 have been reduced by 59.0 million from 1,068.3 million to 1,009.3 million.
None of this has had any impact on cash flows.
Comparative figures for 2001 have been restated to reflect the effects of FRS 19 as follows: Reported Adjustment Restated Year ended 31 December 2001 m m m Group profit and loss account Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 129.5 129.5 Taxation on profit on ordinary activities 32.3 4.2 36.5 Profit on ordinary activities after taxation attributable to shareholders 97.2 4.2 93.0 Dividends 45.4 45.4 Retained profit for the group and its associates 51.8 4.2 47.6 Earnings per share underlying 29.4p 1.3p 28.1p Group balance sheet Investments interest in associated undertakings 52.4 4.4 48.0 Provisions for liabilities and charges deferred taxation 28.9 50.1 79.0 Equity shareholders funds profit and loss account 181.7 54.5 127.2 60 Associated British Ports Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2002
