Tax information Reclaiming income tax on dividends For dividends paid on or after 6 April 1999, the tax credit available to individual share owners resident in the UK is reduced to one-ninth of the dividend, and tax credits are no longer repayable to UK holders with no tax liability.
Also with effect from 6 April 1999, individuals whose income is within the lower or basic tax rate bands are liable to tax at 10% on the dividend income and the tax credit will continue to satisfy their income tax liability on UK dividends.
The higher rate of tax on dividend income was also reduced to 32.5% from 6 April 1999, which is intended to leave higher rate taxpayers with the same amount of after tax income as they would have received prior to the changes.
Capital gains tax The market value of an ordinary share at 31 March 1982 was 39p.
Since that date rights issues have occurred in September 1986, August 1987 and April 1993.
For capital gains tax purposes the acquisition cost of ordinary shares is adjusted to take account of such rights issues.
Since any adjustments will depend on individual circumstances, share owners are advised to consult their professional advisors.
