This tax is payable in addition to mainstream UK corporation tax which is charged at a rate of 30% on UK taxable profits.
However, none of the Groups upstream operations had a current liability to SCT in the year to December 2002 owing to the availability of capital allowances.
As a consequence of the introduction of SCT, the deferred tax liability at 31st December 2002 relating to UK upstream operations has been calculated with reference to a tax rate of 40% as this is the aggregate rate that is expected to be in force when the timing differences reverse.
Overseas tax includes a charge of 2.0 million in respect of Cte dIvoire taxation arising in respect of the Espoir field.
No deferred tax has been provided on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, as the Group has no plans to remit these to the UK in the foreseeable future.
The difference between the total current tax shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax to the profit before tax is as shown in the following table.
TULLOW OIL PLC annual report and accounts 2002 51 2002 2001 000 000 Group Profit on Ordinary Activities before Tax 22,459 16,012 Tax on Group Profit on Ordinary Activities at Standard UK Corporation Tax Rate of 30% 2001 - 30% 6,737 4,804 Effects of: Expenses not deductible for Tax Purposes 530 39 Tax Depreciation in Excess of Accounting Depreciation 863 2,125 Current PRT 3,282 422 Allowable Deduction for Current PRT 978 133 Adjustments relating to Prior Years 216 - Higher Charge for Overseas Tax 947 716 Utilisation of losses not previously recognised - 662 Other Items - 113 Group Current Tax Charge for the Year 9,871 2,948 The Group earns its profits primarily in the UK.
Therefore the tax rate applied to profit on ordinary activities in preparing the above reconciliation is the standard rate of UK corporation tax, which was also the rate which the profits were subject to in the year.
In the period 17th April to 31st December 2002, the profits of the Group subject to SCT were nil due to the availability of capital allowances.
The reconciliation above has therefore been made with reference to the prevailing mainstream UK corporation tax rate of 30%.
Earnings per Ordinary Share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit for the year after taxation of 12,795,601 2001 - 9,309,789 and 359,324,277 2001 356,284,421 ordinary shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue for the year.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the profit for the year after taxation as for basic earnings per share.
The number of shares outstanding is, however, adjusted to show the potential dilution if employee and other share options are converted into ordinary shares.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares is increased by 4,881,762 2001 6,954,952 in respect of the share option scheme, resulting in a diluted weighted average number of shares of 364,206,039 2001 363,239,373.

The deferred cost of exploration represents the cost of licence acquisition, seismic and appraisal activity that is capitalised pending determination of commercial success through drilling, farmout or other joint venture arrangements.

These costs have been carried by the Group for in excess of the three-year determination period recommended in the SORP.
The Directors consider the treatment appropriate because exploration and appraisal activities are ongoing and the determination process is not yet complete.

Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance from overnight to three months at rates determined by US$ LIBOR, Sterling LIBOR or EURIBOR.
At 31st December 2001 there were committed funds under a credit facility of up to a maximum total commitment of 125 million, negotiated to fund the acquisition of the UK SNS interests.
From 31st December 2002 the total commitments reduce semi-annually, with maximum total commitments being 105 million at 31st December 2002.
The maximum debt availability under the credit facility is also determined semi-annually by reference to the net present value of the assets, using various technical and economic assumptions, as well as certain other financial tests.
At 31st December 2002 the maximum debt availability was 80.6 million.
TULLOW OIL PLC annual report and accounts 2002 59 This credit facility incurs a commitment fee for undrawn balances of 50 basis points and interest on outstanding debt at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 110 basis points to 140 basis points depending on utilisation.
The outstanding debt is repayable in variable amounts determined semi-annually over the period to 31st December 2005, or such other time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier.
There is a requirement under the facility to hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure to LIBOR.
In the above table 14m of the gross debt under the credit facility has been shown as fixed rate debt and is hedged through the application of interest rate swaps which have the effect of fixing the interest rate exposure to LIBOR to a weighted average of 5.5% at 31 December 2002.
A further 20.5m, shown as gross variable rate debt in the table above, is hedged through the application of interest rate caps and collars, which have the effect of limiting the interest rate exposure to LIBOR to not more than weighted average of 7.2% at 31st December 2002.
The swaps, caps and collars extend over the life of the loan at varying notional principal amounts.
The interest rate swaps, caps and collars do not give rise to material differences between book and fair values.
In addition at 31st December 2002 there was a fully drawn borrowing facility of US$15 million to fund development costs in Cte dIvoire.
This loan is repayable in instalments by 31st December 2006.

iii Fair Values of Commodity Hedges The Group uses natural gas hedging instruments to manage exposure to volatility in commodity prices.
The fair value is the amount that could be exchanged in an arms length transaction.
Market values have been used to determine fair value and have been obtained from an independent third party.
The fair value of natural gas hedging instruments is not considered to be materially different from the book values.
