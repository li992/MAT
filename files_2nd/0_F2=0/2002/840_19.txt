The company and certain subsidiaries have given counter indemnities in respect of performance bonds issued, on behalf of group companies, in the normal course of business.
AMEC has an 11 per cent interest in the Cross Israel Highway concession and has provided support on a joint and several basis for letters of credit that the project has procured from external banks.
These principally relate to performance guarantees and amounted to 41.8 million as at 31 December 2002.
AMECs future obligations may therefore exceed its proportionate share of this sum in the event any of the other partners fail, a situation which is not currently envisaged.
The borrowings of joint ventures, consolidated on a gross equity basis, are generally without recourse to AMEC other than for normal performance obligations which are usually given on a several basis.
AMEC has provided guarantees in respect of committed bank facilities granted to certain property joint ventures.
The borrowings drawn against these facilities amounted to 34.0 million at 31 December 2002, and the current debt service ratios for these joint ventures are all within the agreed levels.
AMEC has a commitment to invest 52.5 million in joint venture projects and further details are provided in note 27.
It has also provided guarantees on certain projects to invest further amounts of up to 10 million if the projects do not perform satisfactorily.
No future adverse events, however, are currently envisaged.
In addition, AMEC has provided joint and several guarantees on certain projects for its partners investment commitments of up to 27 million.
The failure of its joint venture partners, however, is not currently envisaged.
AMEC takes internal and external legal advice in considering known legal claims and actions made by or against the company.
Consequently it carefully assesses the likelihood of the success of a claim or action.
AMEC makes an appropriate provision for those legal actions or claims for and against the company on the basis of the likely outcome, but makes no provision for those which are unlikely to succeed.
During 1994 and 1995, AMEC Construction Management Inc. ACMI a subsidiary of AMEC entered into various contracts with the United States General Services Administration GSA for the construction of courthouses in Missouri and California and for the refurbishment and seismic upgrade of a U. S. Customs House in California.
The total value of these contracts at point of signing was in the order of US$290 million.
Due inter alia, to unforeseen site conditions, client delays and numerous design and scope changes, ACMI suffered significant cost overruns and submitted substantial recovery claims.
In June 1999, GSA terminated the right of ACMI to complete one contract, which at that stage was 85 per cent complete.
ACMI contested the termination and sued the GSA for recovery of all claims.
The United States Department of Justice then filed a counterclaim alleging false claims on the GSA contracts and sought to argue that, as a result, ACMI had forfeited its rights to recovery of all claims.
ACMI, upon legal advice, pleaded guilty in December 2000 and November 2001 to two GSA non-compliance offences and paid a total of US$1.2 million in settlement.
AMEC also agreed to introduce additional ethical processes and procedures, both for the North American workforce and for those staff employed by AMEC, whose responsibilities caused them to have regular business contact with AMEC North America and thus, the US Government.
On 20 August 2002, ACMI and AMEC, a party to the North American bonding arrangements, were notified, as a consequence of the ACMI noncompliance offences, that they had been debarred from seeking contracts with the US Government with retrospective effect for a 12 month period from 20 February 2002.
The debarment did not include AMEC Earth and Environmental Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of AMEC, which continues to carry out significant levels of activity with US Government agencies and it also did not impact existing projects.
AMEC ceased to be debarred on 20 February 2003 and is now able to bid for all US government contracts.
AMEC hopes that an amicable settlement of all the outstanding issues with the GSA can be secured but there is, at this time, no certainty that such an outcome will be achieved.
AMEC plc ANNUAL REPORT 2002 73 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 30 PENSION ARRANGEMENTS The group operates a number of pension schemes for United Kingdom and overseas employees.
All United Kingdom members are in defined benefit schemes, and the majority of overseas employees are in defined contribution schemes.
a SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs Contributions by employees and employers are paid in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries and held separately from the assets of the group, in trustee administered funds.
The total pension cost for the group was 16.9 million 2001 20.2 million and there is a prepayment of pension costs as at 31 December 2002 of 59.0 million 2001 50.7 million included within debtors : amounts falling due after one year.
The projected unit valuation method has been used to assess liabilities and future funding rates for the three major schemes which cover approximately 90 per cent of United Kingdom members.
The latest actuarial valuations of these schemes were undertaken as at 31 December 2001 and 1 April 2002.
These showed that the market value of the assets was 1,058.6 million, with the actuarial value of assets being sufficient to cover 114 per cent of the accrued benefits.
The principal assumptions were based upon future investment returns of 5.50 to 6.30 per cent, future pensionable salary increases of 3.70 to 4.75 per cent, future pension increases of 2.50 to 2.70 per cent and valuation rates of interest of 5.50 to 5.60 per cent.
b FRS 17 Retirement benefits The valuations used for FRS 17 disclosures have been based on the most recent valuations of the three major schemes as at 31 December 2001 and 1 April 2002, and updated by the schemes actuaries for the requirement to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 December 2002.
The assets of the schemes are stated at their market value as at 31 December 2001 and 31 December 2002.
The financial assumptions used to calculate the schemes liabilities under FRS 17, on a projected unit valuation method, are as follows: 2002 2001 Per cent Per cent Rate of discount 5.5 6.0 Rate of inflation 2.3 2.4 Rate of increase in salaries 3.3 3.4 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.3 2.4 The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The market value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short-term, and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain were as follows: Long-term rate of Long-term rate of return expected as at Value as at return expected as at Value as at 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2002 2002 2001 2001 Per cent million Per cent million Equities 7.5 459.9 7.5 548.0 Bonds 5.5 380.1 5.5 366.0 Property 6.5 75.9 6.5 81.0 Cash 4.5 25.2 4.5 35.0 Total market value of assets 941.1 1,030.0 Present value of schemes liabilities 825.7 726.0 Surplus in the schemes 115.4 304.0 Related deferred tax liability 34.6 91.2 Net pension asset arising under FRS 17 80.8 212.8 2002 Group The movement in the surplus during the year is as follows: million Surplus in the schemes as at 1 January 2002 304.0 Current service cost 23.2 Contributions paid 15.5 Net return on assets 23.1 Actuarial losses 204.0 Surplus in the schemes as at 31 December 2002 115.4 74 AMEC plc ANNUAL REPORT 2002 30 PENSION ARRANGEMENTS continued If FRS 17 had been fully adopted in these accounts the pension costs charged would have been as follows: 2002 Group i Analysis of other pension costs charged in arriving at group operating profit: million Current service cost 23.2 2002 Group ii Analysis of amounts included in net interest payable: million Expected return on pension scheme assets 63.7 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 40.6 23.1 2002 Group iii Analysis of amounts included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses: million Actual return less expected return on assets 150.7 Experience gains and losses on liabilities 4.6 Changes in assumptions 48.7 204.0 If FRS 17 had been fully adopted in these accounts the net assets and profit and loss account reserve would have been as follows: 2002 Group i Net assets million Net assets per consolidated balance sheet 253.6 SSAP 24 prepayment net of deferred tax 41.3 Net assets excluding SSAP 24 prepayment 212.3 Net pension asset arising under FRS 17 80.8 Net assets including net pension asset arising under FRS 17 293.1 2002 Group ii Profit and loss account reserve: million Profit and loss account reserve per consolidated balance sheet 8.6 SSAP 24 prepayment net of deferred tax 41.3 Profit and loss account reserve excluding SSAP 24 prepayment 49.9 Net pension asset arising under FRS 17 80.8 Profit and loss account reserve including net pension asset arising under FRS 17 30.9 31 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS During the year there were a number of transactions with joint ventures, associates and joint arrangements, all of which arose in the normal course of business.
