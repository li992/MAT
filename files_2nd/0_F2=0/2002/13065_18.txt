c Share-based remuneration The following unaudited disclosure is provided voluntarily in accordance with the proposals of FRED 31, Share Based Payment, to show the charge to the Groups profit and loss account in respect of share options if the proposals were adopted in these financial statements.
For completeness, the cost in respect of restricted shares, which has been charged to the profit and loss account in 2002, is also shown under separate heading below.
In the period between 7 November 2002 the issue date of the exposure draft and the year end, the Company made grants under one sharebased payment arrangement, which is described below.
Share Options 1999 Share Option Plan On 22 November 2002 the Company granted 6,914,000 options in total to approximately 400 employees at senior management level under the terms of the 1999 Share Option Plan.
None were forfeited or exercisable at 31 December 2002.
The exercise price of the options was xed at the date of grant at 11.186, and both the options and restricted shares have a contractual life of ten years.
The options and restricted shares were granted conditional upon the employees remaining in the Groups employment for three years from the date of grant.
The extent of vesting depends on the earnings per share growth of the Group over the period 2003 to 2005.
For compound EPS growth over that period of 6%, 7%, 8% and 9%, the percentage of options vesting is 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% respectively.
The fair value of the options was measured at grant date using the Black-Scholes model.
An adjustment factor of 0.86 was applied to take account of any outcome of the performance criteria of less than 100% and lapse of options over the performance period.
The model inputs were: the share price at grant date of 10.96: exercise price of 11.186 calculated with reference to the closing prices on the five trading days preceding the grant : expected volatility of 27% based on the historical volatility over the 24 months to December 2002 : expected dividend yield of 2.24% based on three year historical data : expected life of five years: and a risk-free interest rate of 4.5%.
The contractual life of the options is ten years, but the Company expects that, once vested, five years is a more reasonable expected life.
The risk-free interest rate is equal to the yield on UK government bonds available at grant date with a remaining term of five years.
The resulting fair value of one option is 2.60 before the adjustment factor or 2.236 after adjustment.
Pro forma profit and loss account disclosures The total fair value of options granted under the 2002 grant is 15m.
This amount would be spread evenly over the three years from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2005, being the performance period.
m Fair value options granted: 2002 grant which would be charged in 2003 5 Restricted Shares 1999 Restricted Share Plan The Company has issued a number of tranches of restricted shares to date.
These are treated as share options with a nil strike price for accounting purposes.
Accordingly, under UITF 17, the intrinsic value at grant date is charged to the profit and loss account over the performance period.
The total charge to the profit and loss account in 2002 in respect of previous restricted share grants was 15m.
On 22 November 2002, the Company granted 2,223,500 restricted shares in total to approximately 400 employees at senior management level under the terms of the 1999 Restricted Share Plan.
The fair value of the restricted shares is taken as the intrinsic value at the grant date, being 10.96.
The cost of this award, 24m, will be charged to the profit and loss account in accordance with UITF 17 over the performance period 2003 to 2005, equivalent to an annual charge of 8m in those three years.
48 Reckitt Benckiser Annual Report 2002 4Employees continued d Pension schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes around the world which are principally of the funded type.
The Groups two most significant dened benefit schemes are both funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.

Provisions include nil 2001 14m in respect of the above US schemes and 42m 2001 37m in respect of other schemes.
Surpluses and deficits are spread over the average remaining service lives of the current employees.
e Post-retirement benets other than pensions Certain retired employees and dependants in the UK and the US are eligible to receive medical and prescription benets paid for by the Group and provision for this is included in provisions for liabilities and charges.
In the UK, the Group pays the annual subscriptions to a private health plan for certain senior personnel and their dependants after retirement.
There will be no further additions to the number of current employees eligible for post-retirement health benets.
The amounts involved in the UK scheme are not material.
In the major US scheme, salaried participants become eligible for retiree health care benets after they reach a combined age and years of service rendered after age 40 gure of 70, although the age must be a minimum of 55.
The cost of this scheme is accrued over the full service life of the employees.

The Group operates a number of pension schemes around the world which are principally of the funded type.
For the UK scheme, a full actuarial valuation was carried out at 5 April 2001 and updated at 31 December 2002.
For the US scheme, a full actuarial valuation was carried out at 1 January 2002 and updated at 31 December 2002.
The projected unit valuation method was used for the UK and US scheme valuations.

8 Earnings per share The reconciliation between profit for the year and the weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of the diluted earnings per share is set out below: # 2002 2001 profit for Average Earnings profit for Average Earnings the year number of per share the year number of per share m shares pence m shares pence profit attributable to shareholders 408 704,352,704 58.0 332 700,389,601 47.4 Dilution for Executive options outstanding 11,788,985 9,235,337 Dilution for Employee Sharesave Scheme options outstanding 1,459,933 1,133,304 Dilution for convertible capital bonds outstanding 13 38,929,275 13 38,964,597 On a diluted basis 421 756,530,897 55.7 345 749,722,839 46.0 After the appropriate tax adjustment, the profit adjustment represents the coupon on convertible capital bonds.
The earnings per share impact reects the effect of that profit and the assumption of the issue of shares on conversion of bonds.
Prior to the exchange described on page 40, five times the number of Reckitt Benckiser Holdings BV A shares have been included in the calculations of the weighted average number of shares, in order to present the effect of the Shareholders Agreement, under the terms of which the position of the holder of the Reckitt Benckiser Holdings BV A shares was in substance the same as if it had held five new Reckitt Benckiser plc ordinary shares for every Reckitt Benckiser Holdings BV A share held.

In July 2002, holders of bonds amounting in value to 244,043 2001 125,514 exercised their right of conversion into 49,168 2001 25,225 ordinary shares of Reckitt Benckiser plc, giving a cumulative 7,885,496 of bonds which have now been converted into shares.
The terms of the issue, adjusted for the 1994 rights issue, allow the holders to convert the bonds into Reckitt Benckiser ordinary shares on 31 July in each of the years 1993 to 2004 at the exchange price of 496p per share equivalent to 20.161 Reckitt Benckiser ordinary shares per 100 bonds of 1 each.
Bondholders will also have the right at maturity to convert their bonds into Reckitt Benckiser ordinary shares on similar terms as apply on each annual conversion opportunity.
Insofar as these rights are not exercised and if no other action is taken, the bonds outstanding at maturity currently 31 March 2005 will be converted into preference shares in Reckitt & Colman Capital Finance Limited and such preference shares will immediately be redeemed at 100p per bond.
Reckitt Benckiser plc may make arrangements for some or all of the ordinary shares which would otherwise arise on any conversion at maturity to be placed or purchased and for bondholders to receive out of the proceeds the same amount of cash as they would have received on a redemption of the underlying preference shares on the basis that Reckitt Benckiser plc shall bear any shortfall, but may retain any excess, in the actual proceeds of such placing or sale as compared to such redemption amount.
The trustee of the issue may also at maturity require all then outstanding bonds to be converted into Reckitt Benckiser ordinary shares and sold on behalf of bondholders if it is satisfied or advised that bondholders are likely to receive a greater cash amount on maturity as a result.
In accordance with the terms of the issue, Reckitt & Colman Capital Finance Limited may elect to give bondholders the option to extend the life of their bonds.
In addition, and if it so chooses, Reckitt & Colman Capital Finance Limited may, at the same time, make arrangements for the purchase by a third party of some or all of those bonds in respect of which such option is not exercised by bondholders on the basis that relevant bondholders would receive the same amount of cash as they would have done on redemption, with the issuer bearing any shortfall but retaining any excess.
Save in certain circumstances, Reckitt Benckiser plc also has the right to exchange all outstanding bonds for Reckitt Benckiser plc redeemable preference shares with similar terms as to redemption and conversion into Reckitt Benckiser plc ordinary shares as the bonds.

The special voting share had the right to exercise 68,275,000 votes at the General Meetings of the Company.
This right ceased when JAB exchanged its Reckitt Benckiser Holdings BV A Shares for Reckitt Benckiser plc ordinary shares in December 2002.
The 5% cumulative preference shares of 1 each, which are irredeemable and were issued at par, rank in priority to the ordinary shares both as to dividend and to capital.
On a winding up or repayment of capital, these shares are repayable at par on the average market value for a period prior to that event if higher.
These shares have no further rights to participate in the reserves of the Company and the non-equity capital does not carry any right to vote at any general meeting of the Company unless either: a the dividend is six months in arrears: or b there is a resolution to wind up the Company or to reduce its capital: or c there is a resolution to alter the rights of the preference shareholders.

Accordingly, 63,000,000 shares and 5,275,000 shares were admitted to the ofcial list on 27 December 2002 and 31 December 2002 respectively.
In order for the consolidated accounts to show a true and fair view prior to this exchange, the amounts attributable to the Reckitt Benckiser Holdings BV A shareholder have been included in the capital and reserves section of the consolidated balance sheet.
As a result the A shares were included in the consolidated balance sheet as if they had already been exchanged for Reckitt Benckiser plc ordinary shares, at a ratio of five Reckitt Benckiser plc shares for every A share.
