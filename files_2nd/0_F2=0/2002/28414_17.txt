Notes on the Financial Statements 1.
Nature of Operations Prudential plc the Company together with its subsidiaries collectively, the Group or Prudential is an international financial services group with its principal operations in the United Kingdom, the United States and Asia.
During 2002, the Group operated in the UK through its subsidiaries, primarily The Prudential Assurance Company Limited PAC, Prudential Annuities Limited, Prudential Retirement Income Limited, Scottish Amicable Life plc SAL, M&G Group plc, and Egg plc.
In December 2002 the business of SAL was transferred to PAC under a court-approved arrangement.
In the US the Groups principal subsidiary is Jackson National Life Insurance Company.
Long-term business products written in the UK and Asia are principally with-profits deposit administration, other conventional and unitised with-profits policies and non-participating pension annuities in the course of payment.
Long-term business also includes linked business written in the UK, Asia and Europe.
The principal products written by Jackson National Life in the US are interest sensitive deferred annuities and whole-life policies, variable annuities, guaranteed investment contracts, equity linked indexed deferred annuities and term life insurance.
Basis of Preparation The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the provisions of Section 255A of, and Schedule 9A to, the Companies Act 1985 which cover the disclosures applicable to insurance companies and groups.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP, including Financial Reporting Standards FRS and Statements of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP and also in accordance with the Statement of Recommended Practice, Accounting for Insurance Business, issued in December 1998 by the Association of British Insurers the ABI SORP.
The ABI SORP is currently under review and an Exposure Draft of the Revised SORP was issued for public consultation in November 2002.
In preparing these financial statements the Company has not applied any of the changes proposed in the Exposure Draft.
The results of US operations and certain Asian operations are prepared on the basis of US GAAP, adjusted where necessary to comply with UK GAAP.
FRS 17, Retirement benefits was issued in November 2000.
This standard specifies how costs of providing retirement benefits, in particular for defined benefit schemes, should be recognised and disclosed in the financial statements.
Under FRS 17 none of the requirements need be recognised in the primary financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2002 and 2001.
However, for 2002 disclosure is required in respect of the impact of FRS 17 on the opening and closing balance sheet positions, profit and loss account, and statement of total recognised gains and losses to illustrate the effect if the standard had been recognised in these primary financial statements.
The Company has adopted the standard in this respect and details are disclosed in note 19.
FRS 19, Deferred tax was issued in December 2000.
This standard requires deferred tax to be recognised on most types of timing differences, in particular for gains and losses on assets that are continuously revalued to fair value where changes in fair value are recognised in the profit and loss account.
The standard is required to be implemented for financial statements relating to accounting periods ending on or after 23 January 2002.
However, early adoption was encouraged by the standard.
The Company adopted the standard in its financial statements for 2001.
Accordingly, the 2002 financial statements, including comparative figures for 2001, have been prepared in accordance with FRS 19.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group include the assets, liabilities and results of the Company and subsidiary undertakings in which Prudential has a controlling interest, using accounts drawn up to 31 December 2002.
The results of subsidiaries are included in the financial statements from the date acquired to the effective date of disposal.
All intercompany transactions are eliminated on consolidation except for investment management fees charged by M&G and the Groups US and Asia fund management operations to long-term business funds.
The consolidated profit and loss account comprises a general business technical account property and casualty insurance business : a long-term business technical account life insurance, pension, disability and sickness insurance and annuity business : and a non-technical account.
For the year ended 31 December 2002 all transactions recorded in the general business technical account relate to discontinued operations.
The insurance operations are presented by category of income and expenditure in each respective technical account.
The balances profits on insurance activities for the year from the general and long-term business technical accounts are then included in the non-technical account and combined with the Groups non-insurance businesses principally banking and fund management to determine the consolidated profit for the financial year.
In accordance with FRS 1, Cash flow statements, the statement of cash flows reflects only the cash flows of general business, the Groups other non-insurance businesses included in the non-technical account, and amounts transferred to shareholders funds from the Groups long-term businesses.
The balance sheet of the Company is prepared in accordance with Section 226 of, and Schedule 4 to, the Companies Act 1985, which apply to companies generally.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 from presenting its own profit and loss account.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2002 55 Notes on the Financial Statements continued 3.
Significant Accounting Policies Long-term business The results are prepared in accordance with the modified statutory basis of reporting as set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice issued by the Association of British Insurers in December 1998.
Premiums and claims Premium and annuity considerations for conventional with-profits policies and other protection-type life insurance policies are recognised when due.
Premium and annuity considerations for linked policies, unitised with-profits policies and other investmenttype policies are recognised when received or, in the case of unitised or unit linked policies, when units are issued.
Premiums exclude any taxes or duties assessed based on premiums.
Policy fees are charged to the linked, unitised with-profits and other investment-type policyholders account balances for mortality, asset management and policy administration.
These fees are recognised as revenue when charged against the policyholders account balances.
Claims paid include maturities, annuities, surrenders and deaths.
Maturity claims are recorded on the policy maturity date.
Annuity claims are recorded when the annuity becomes due for payment.
Surrenders are recorded when paid, and death claims are recorded when notified.
Deferred acquisition costs Costs of acquiring new business, principally commissions, marketing and advertising costs and certain other costs associated with policy issuance and underwriting that are not reimbursed by policy charges are specifically identified and capitalised as deferred acquisition costs DAC, which are included as an asset in the balance sheet.
The DAC asset is amortised against margins in future revenues on the related insurance policies, to the extent that the amounts are recoverable out of the margins.
Recoverability of the unamortised DAC asset is assessed at the time of policy issue, and reviewed if profit margins have declined.
For with-profits business, the amortisation of the DAC asset is taken into account in determining the transfer from or to the fund for future appropriations.
Movements on the DAC asset and amortisation for with-profits business have no direct impact on the profit attributable to shareholders.
For the business of Jackson National Life the determination of the expected emergence of margins, against which the amortisation profile of the DAC asset is established, is dependent on certain key assumptions.
For single premium deferred annuity business, the key assumption is the expected long-term spread between the earned rate and the rate credited to policyholders.
For variable annuity business, the key assumption is the expected long-term level of equity market returns which, for 2002, was 8.4% per annum implemented using a mean reversion methodology.
These returns affect the level of future expected profits through their effects on fee income and the required level of provision for guaranteed minimum death benefit claims.
Long-term business provision Prudentials long-term business written in the UK comprises predominantly life insurance policies under which the policyholders are entitled to participate in the profits of the long-term business supporting these policies.
This business is also written in parts of Asia.
Such policies are called with-profits policies.
Prudential maintains with-profits funds within the Groups long-term business funds which segregate the assets and liabilities and accumulate the profit and loss activity related to that with-profits business.
The amounts accumulated in these with-profits funds are available to provide for future policyholder benefit provisions and for bonuses to be distributed to with-profits policyholders.
The bonuses, both annual and final, reflect the right of the with-profits policyholders to participate in the financial performance of the with-profits funds.
Shareholders profits with respect to bonuses declared on withprofits business correspond to the shareholders share of the cost of bonuses as declared by the Board of directors.
The shareholders share currently represents one-ninth of the cost of bonuses declared for with-profits policies.
Annual bonuses are declared and credited each year to all with-profits policies.
The annual bonuses increase policy benefits and, once credited, become guaranteed.
Annual bonuses are charged to the profit and loss account as a change in the long-term business provision in the year declared.
Final bonuses are declared each year and accrued for policies scheduled to mature and death benefits expected to be paid during the next financial year.
Final bonuses are not guaranteed and are only paid on policies that result from claims through the death of the policyholder or maturity of the policy within the period of declaration or by concession on surrender.
No policyholder benefit provisions are recorded for future annual or final bonus declarations.
The future policyholder benefit provisions on conventional with-profits and other protection-type policies are calculated using the net premium method.
The net premium is calculated such that it would be sufficient at the outset of the policy to provide only for the discounted value of the original guaranteed death and maturity benefits.
The provision is then calculated by subtracting the present value of future net premiums from the present value of future benefits including vested bonuses using a prudent discount rate.
The assumptions to which the estimation of the long-term business provision is particularly sensitive are the interest rate used to discount the provision and the assumed future mortality experience of policyholders.
The net premium reserves are calculated 56 Prudential plc Annual Report 2002 3.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Long-term business provision continued using assumptions for interest, mortality, morbidity and expense, but without assumptions for withdrawals.
These assumptions are determined as prudent best estimates at the date of valuation.
Interest rates used in establishing policyholder benefit provisions for conventional with-profits policies in the consolidated financial statements range from 3.0% to 5.0%.
The interest rates used in establishing policyholder benefit provisions for pension annuities in the course of payment are adjusted each year and range from 2.4% to 5.4%.
Mortality rates used in establishing policyholder benefit provisions are based on published mortality tables adjusted to reflect actual experience.
For accumulating with-profits business of The Prudential Assurance Company Limited, the provision has been taken as the lower of: the accumulated fund or the value at the bid price of the notional number of units allocated to policyholders, in both cases excluding final bonus, and the surrender or transfer value which, having regard to policyholders reasonable expectations, would be payable at the valuation date, or, if greater, the value of the guaranteed liabilities excluding final bonus calculated on a gross premium bonus reserve method.
For the purpose of calculating the liability using the bonus reserve method, the assumed interest rates range from 3.2% to 5.0%, while future reversionary bonuses are assumed to fall from current levels to zero at 1.5% per year.
Additional details for PAC are given in the statutory accounts of that company.
The future policyholder benefit provisions for Jackson National Lifes conventional protection-type policies are determined using the net level premium method, with an allowance for surrenders and claims expenses.
Rates of interest used in establishing the policyholder benefit provisions range from 6.0% to 8.4%.
Mortality assumptions range from 50% to 90% of the 1975-1980 Basic Select and Ultimate tables, depending on underwriting classification and policy duration.
For investment-type products sold by Jackson National Life, the policyholder benefit provision included within technical provisions in the consolidated balance sheet is the policyholder account balance.
Segregated accounts are established for policyholder business for which policyholder benefits are wholly or partly determined by reference to specific investments or to an investment-related index.
The assets and liabilities of this linked business are reported as summary totals in the consolidated balance sheet.
The future policyholder benefit provisions for Asian businesses are determined in accordance with methods prescribed by local GAAP.
In regions where local GAAP is not well established, US GAAP is used as the most appropriate proxy to local GAAP.
The valuation of policyholder benefit provisions may differ from that determined on a UK modified statutory basis.
Fund for future appropriations The fund for future appropriations FFA represents the excess of assets over policyholder liabilities for the Groups with-profits funds.
The annual excess shortfall of income over expenditure of the with-profits funds, after declaration and attribution of the cost of bonuses to policyholders and shareholders, is transferred to from the FFA each year through a charge credit to the profit and loss account.
The balance retained in the FFA represents cumulative retained earnings arising on the with-profits business that has not been allocated to policyholders or shareholders.
The balance retained in the FFA is determined after full provision for deferred tax on unrealised appreciation on investments.
The FFA in respect of the Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund is wholly attributable, but not yet allocated, to policyholders of that fund.
Details are shown in note 8.
Overseas subsidiaries Results of overseas subsidiaries are determined initially using local GAAP bases of accounting with subsequent adjustments where necessary to comply with the Groups accounting policies.
In the case of Jackson National Life, US GAAP results are adjusted to comply with UK GAAP in respect of the valuation basis for fixed income securities and certain financial derivative instruments.
Further details are shown in note 11.
General insurance General insurance business is accounted for on an annual accounting basis.
Revenue recognition Premiums are recognised when risks are assumed.
The proportion of premiums written relating to periods of risk beyond any year-end is recorded as an unearned premium provision and subsequently recognised in earnings proportional to the period of the risk.
Premiums are presented gross of commission and exclude any taxes or duties assessed based on premium.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2002 57 Notes on the Financial Statements continued 3.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Deferred acquisition costs Direct and indirect costs associated with the writing of new general insurance policies are deferred and amortised in a manner consistent with the method used for premium recognition described above.
Claims Claims incurred include settlement and handling costs of paid and outstanding claims arising from events occurring in the year and adjustments to prior years claims provisions.
Outstanding claims include claims incurred up to, but not paid, at the end of the accounting period, whether or not reported.
An unexpired risks provision is established for any excess of expected claims and deferred acquisition costs over unearned premiums and investment returns.
The assessment of expected claims involves consideration of claims experience up to the end of the accounting period.
No specific provision is made for major events occurring after this date.
Investment returns Investment returns comprise investment income, realised gains and losses and changes in unrealised gains and losses, except for changes in unrealised gains and losses on debt securities held by Jackson National Life.
Subject to provisions for permanent diminutions in value, debt securities held by Jackson National Life are carried at amortised cost.
Investment returns in respect of long-term business, including that on assets matching solvency capital, are included in the longterm business technical account.
Other investment returns are included in the non-technical account.
Investment returns on assets covering general business liabilities are allocated from the non-technical account to the general business technical account.
For 2001 the allocated return for, now discontinued, UK personal lines business reflected longer-term returns on assets covering general business liabilities and related solvency capital.
Investment returns are also allocated between the long-term business technical account and the non-technical account for the difference between the actual investment rate of return of the long-term business technical account and the longer-term rate of return on the assets backing shareholder financed long-term business primarily Jackson National Life and certain Asian operations.
Further details are provided in note 4.
Reinsurance In the normal course of business, the Group seeks to reduce loss exposure arising primarily from catastrophes or other significant adverse events by reinsuring certain levels of risk in various areas of exposure with other insurance companies or reinsurers.
An asset or liability is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet representing premiums due to or payments due from reinsurers, and the share of losses recoverable from reinsurers.
Certain reinsurance contracts include significant financing elements.
For these contracts the financing liability is recorded as a deposit due to the reinsurer.
An asset representing the present value of future margins on the ceded business from which the financing will be repaid is also recognised on the consolidated balance sheet to the extent the reinsurer has assumed the risk that such margins will emerge.
Tax The Groups UK subsidiaries each file separate tax returns.
Jackson National Life and other foreign subsidiaries, where permitted, file consolidated income tax returns.
In accordance with UK tax legislation, where one domestic UK company is a 75% owned subsidiary of another UK company or both are 75% owned subsidiaries of a common parent, the companies are considered to be within the same UK tax group.
For companies within the same tax group, trading profits and losses arising in the same accounting period may be offset for purposes of determining current and deferred taxes.
Current tax expense is charged or credited to operations based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable operations for the current year.
To the extent that losses of an individual UK company are not offset in any one year they can be carried back for one year or carried forward indefinitely to be offset against profits arising from the same company.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in accordance with the provisions of FRS 19, issued in December 2000.
The Company has chosen not to apply the option available under FRS 19 of recognising such assets and liabilities on a discounted basis to reflect the time value of money.
Except as set out in FRS 19, deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax on changes in the fair value of investments is recognised in the profit and loss account.
The deferred tax liability in respect of revaluation of investments is recognised in shareholders funds and the fund for future appropriations.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Tax continued The tax charge for long-term business included in the long-term business technical account includes tax expense on with-profits funds attributable to both the policyholders and the shareholders.
Different tax rules apply under UK law depending upon whether the business is life insurance or pension business.
Tax on the life insurance business is based on investment returns less expenses attributable to that business.
Tax on the pension business is based on the shareholders profits or losses attributable to that business.
The shareholders portion of the long-term business is taxed at the shareholders rate with the remaining portion taxed at rates applicable to the policyholders.
The balance of the long-term business technical account is net of the total tax attributable to the long-term business.
In order to present the profit on long-term insurance activities in the non-technical account on a pre-tax basis, a tax credit attributable to the shareholders portion of the tax provision for long-term business, calculated at the effective tax rate where appropriate on a longterm basis of the underlying business, is added.
This shareholder tax add-back is then included in the tax expense on the profit on ordinary activities within the non-technical account.
Further details are provided in note 16.
Stock-based compensation The Group offers share award and option plans for certain key employees and a Save As You Earn plan SAYE plan for all UK and certain overseas employees.
The arrangements for distribution to employees of shares held in trust relating to share award plans and for entitlement to dividends depend upon the particular terms of each plan.
Shares held in trust relating to these plans are conditionally gifted to employees.
Compensation costs for non-SAYE plans are recorded over the periods during which share awards or options are earned.
Compensation costs are based on the quoted market prices of the shares at the grant date less any amounts paid or payable by employees in respect of the awards.
In addition, shares are issued to a qualifying share ownership trust with the excess of the market price subscribed at the date of transfer by the trust over nominal value recorded by the Company in its share premium account.
This amount includes the difference between the market price at the date of transfer to the trust and amounts payable by employees and is charged directly to the profit and loss account reserve within shareholders funds.
Pension costs These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of SSAP 24, Pension costs.
Disclosures of the movements in the financial position of the Companys defined benefit schemes, applying the methodology prescribed by FRS 17, are shown in note 19.
Contributions to the Groups defined benefit plans are calculated and expensed on a basis that spreads the costs over the service lives of participants.
Contributions in respect of defined contribution plans are accrued by the Group when incurred.
Land and buildings Investments in tenant and Group occupied leasehold and freehold directly owned properties are carried at estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value included in investment returns.
Properties are valued annually either by the Groups qualified surveyors or professional external valuers using The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS guidelines.
The RICS guidelines apply separate assumptions to the value of the land, buildings, and tenancy associated with each property.
Each property is externally valued at least once every three years.
The cost of additions and renovations is capitalised and considered when estimating fair value.
In accordance with SSAP 19, Investment properties, no depreciation is provided on investment properties other than Group occupied as management consider that these properties are held for investment purposes.
Investments in participating interests A participating interest is a beneficial equity investment where the Group exercises influence over the investees operating and financial policies.
A participating interest where the Group exercises significant influence over the investee, generally through ownership of 20% or more of the entitys voting rights, is considered to be an investment in associate.
The Groups investments in associates are recorded at the Groups share of net assets.
The carrying value of investments in associates is adjusted each year for the Groups share of the entities profit or loss.
The Groups investments in joint ventures are also recorded at the Groups share of net assets.
Other participating interests, where significant influence is not exercised, are carried as investments on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2002 59 Notes on the Financial Statements continued 3.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Other financial investments Other financial investments include equity securities: debt and other fixed income securities: mortgage and other loans: loans to policyholders and deposits with credit institutions.
Equity securities and debt and other fixed income securities Equity securities are carried at fair value.
Debt and other fixed income securities are carried at fair value, except for those held by Jackson National Life, which, subject to provision for permanent diminutions in value, are carried at amortised cost.
Fair value is based on quoted market prices for listed securities, and on quotations provided by external fund managers, brokers, independent pricing services or values as determined by management for unlisted securities.
Changes in fair value are recognised in investment returns during the year of the change.
Debt and other fixed income securities held by Jackson National Life are carried at amortised cost as permitted by paragraph 24 of Schedule 9A to the Companies Act 1985.
The amortised cost basis of valuation is appropriate under the provisions of the ABI SORP for Jackson National Lifes redeemable fixed income securities as they are held as part of a portfolio of such securities intended to be held to maturity.
Further details of the valuation basis for fixed income securities of Jackson National Life are explained in note 11.
Mortgage and other loans Loans collateralised by mortgages and other unsecured loans are carried at unpaid principal balances, net of unamortised discounts and premiums and an allowance for loan losses, except for loans held by UK insurance operations which are carried at fair value.
The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to absorb losses inherent in the mortgage loan portfolio.
Loans to policyholders Loans to policyholders are carried at unpaid principal balances and are fully collateralised by the cash value of policies.
Deposits with credit institutions Deposits with credit institutions comprise items, the withdrawal of which are subject to time constraints, and are carried at fair value.
Changes in fair value are included in investment returns for the year.
Shares in subsidiary undertakings Shares in subsidiary undertakings in the balance sheet of the Company are shown at the lower of cost and estimated realisable value.
Derivatives Derivative financial instruments are used to reduce or manage investment, interest rate and currency exposures, to facilitate efficient portfolio management and for investment purposes.
The Groups policy is that amounts at risk through derivative transactions are covered by cash or by corresponding assets.
Derivative financial instruments are used to facilitate efficient portfolio management and for investment purposes.
With the exception of derivatives held by Jackson National Life, these instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in investment returns.
For Jackson National Life, the accounting for derivative financial instruments is explained in note 11.
As part of the efficient portfolio management of the Life Fund of The Prudential Assurance Company Limited, the fund may, from time to time, invest in cash settled forward contracts over Prudential plc shares.
This is in order to avoid a mismatch of the Life Funds investment portfolio with the investment benchmarks set for its equity based investment funds.
The contracts will form part of the long term investments of the Life Fund.
These contracts are subject to a number of limitations for legal and regulatory reasons.
Securities lending The Group is party to various securities lending agreements under which securities are loaned to third parties on a short-term basis.
The loaned securities are not removed from the Groups consolidated balance sheet, rather, they are retained within the appropriate investment classification.
Managements policy is that collateral in excess of 100% of the fair value of securities loaned is required from all securities borrowers and typically consists of cash, debt securities, equity securities or letters of credit.
In cases where the Group takes possession of the collateral under its securities lending programme, the collateral is included in other financial investments in the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding liability being recorded to recognise the obligation to return such collateral.
To further minimise credit risk, the financial condition of counterparties is monitored on a regular basis.
Linked business funds Certain long-term business policies are linked to specific portfolios of assets or to an investment-related index.
Such policies provide benefits to policyholders which are wholly or partly determined by reference to the value of or income from specific investments or by reference to fluctuations in the value of an index of investments.
The assets supporting the linked policies are maintained in segregated accounts in conformity with applicable laws and regulations.
The segregated assets are reported at fair value within assets held to cover linked liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
The technical provisions for linked liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet are determined based on the fair value of the underlying assets supporting the policies.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Tangible assets Tangible assets, principally computer equipment, software development expenditure, and furniture and fixtures, are capitalised and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, generally three to ten years.
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the life of the lease.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at their fair value.
Banking business assets and liabilities Banking business assets consist primarily of certificates of deposit and short-term deposits with credit institutions carried at fair value and mortgage loans carried at recoverable amount, being outstanding principal balances, net of allowances for loan losses.
Loan provisions are recorded for the overall loan portfolio to cover bad debts which have not been separately identified but which are known from experience to be present in the portfolio.
For loans in default specific loan provisions are recorded.
General provisions are raised in respect of losses, which although not specifically identified, are known from experience to be present in any such portfolios.
The level of general provision is determined by the application of a number of basis points to the aspects of the portfolio which are not currently identified as delinquent but which experience suggests contains lending which will ultimately lead to losses.
The number of basis points applied to the portfolios are regularly assessed against recent experience and adjusted if appropriate.
Changes in loan provisions during the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account.
Liabilities relating to the Groups banking business consist primarily of customer short-term or demand deposits, including interest accrued on the deposits.
Further details of UK banking business assets and liabilities are contained in note 10. Business acquisitions Business acquisitions are accounted for by applying the purchase method of accounting, which adjusts the net assets of the acquired company to fair value at the date of purchase.
The difference between the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company and the fair value of the consideration given represents goodwill.
Revenues and expenses of acquired entities are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition in the year acquired.
Gross premiums of the entities are separately presented in the consolidated profit and loss account.
Effective 1 January 1998, goodwill arising from acquisitions is reflected as an asset on the consolidated balance sheet and is amortised through the consolidated profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, not exceeding 20 years.
Prior to 1 January 1998, goodwill relating to acquisitions was charged directly to shareholders funds.
As permitted under the transitional arrangements of FRS 10, Goodwill and intangible assets, amounts previously charged to shareholders funds have not been reinstated as assets.
Upon disposal of a business acquired prior to 1 January 1998 to which goodwill relates, the original goodwill balance is charged to the consolidated profit and loss account in determining the gain or loss on the sale.
For life insurance company acquisitions, the adjusted net assets include an identifiable intangible asset recorded for the present value of in force business which represents the profits that are expected to emerge from the acquired insurance business.
The present value of in force business is calculated using best estimate actuarial assumptions for interest, mortality, persistency and expenses and is amortised over the anticipated lives of the related contracts in the portfolio.
Shareholders dividends Shareholders dividends are accrued in the period to which they relate regardless of when they are declared.
Where scrip dividends are issued, the value of such shares, measured as the amount of the cash dividend alternative, is credited to reserves and is transferred from the share premium account.
Share premium Share premium represents the difference between the proceeds received on issue of shares, net of issue costs, and the nominal value of the shares issued.
Foreign currency translation The profit and loss accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated at average exchange rates for the year.
Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates.
Foreign currency borrowings that have been used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in overseas subsidiaries, are translated at year-end exchange rates.
The impact of these currency translations is recorded as a component of shareholders funds within the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Assets and liabilities denominated in other than functional currencies are converted at closing exchange rates at the balance sheet date with the related foreign currency exchange gains or losses reflected in the profit and loss account for the year.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2002 61 Notes on the Financial Statements continued 4.
Supplemental Earnings Information The Group uses operating profit based on long-term investment returns before amortisation of goodwill and before tax as a supplemental measure of its results.
For the purposes of measuring operating profit, investment returns on shareholder financed business are based on expected long-term rates of return.
The expected long-term rates of return are intended to reflect historical real rates of return and, where appropriate, current inflation expectations adjusted for consensus economic and investment forecasts.
For 2002, the significant operations that require adjustment for the difference between actual and longer-term investment returns are Jackson National Life and certain businesses of Prudential Asia.
For the Groups continuing operations with investment portfolios that are both attributable to shareholders and subject to short-term volatility, and the personal lines general business that was sold in January 2002, a comparison of actual and longer-term gains is as follows: 1993 to 1993 to 1993 to 2002 2002 2001 2001 2000 m m m m m Actual gains attributable to shareholders: Jackson National Life 523 342 181 394 213 Other operations 425 66 359 71 430 98 276 178 465 643 Longer-term gains credited to operating results: Jackson National Life 112 84 196 26 222 Other operations 268 8 260 28 232 380 76 456 2 454 Excess of actual gains over longer-term gains 478 200 278 467 189 For the purposes of determining the longer-term investment returns of Jackson National Life for 2002 and 2001, realised gains and losses arising on debt securities including losses arising on the recognition of permanent diminutions in value have been averaged over five years for inclusion in operating profit.
For equity-related investments of Jackson National Life for 2002 and 2001, a long-term rate of return of 7.75% has been assumed and this rate has been applied to the monthly average carrying value of such investments after excluding the estimated effect of short-term market movements.
In years prior to 2001, longer-term investment returns for Jackson National Life included within UK basis operating profit were estimated as the aggregate of investment income and averaged realised gains and losses for both debt securities and other types of security.
Comparatives for the aggregate longer-term gains credited to operating results for the years 1993 to 2000 in the table shown above have not been restated for the refinement in policy, as the effect is not material.
For 2002, the other principal component of actual gains attributable to shareholders is revaluation gains of fixed income securities of certain Asian operations.
For 2001 and earlier years the principal other component that required calculation of the expected long-term rate of return was UK equity securities that were held as portfolio investments backing UK general business liabilities and related solvency capital.
This business was disposed of in January 2002.
For these investments the long-term rate of return applied in 2001 was 7.5%.
The long-term dividend yield was assumed to be 2.6%.
In addition to the adjustments made for investment returns, as described above, operating profit excludes gains on business disposals and similar items.
In accordance with FRS 3, the presentation of additional supplementary earnings per share information is permitted provided the earnings basis used is applied consistently over time and is reconciled to consolidated profit for the financial year.
In determining operating profit, the Group has used the expected long-term investment return and excluded exceptional items as management believe that such presentation better reflects the Groups underlying performance on a statutory basis of measurement.
Supplemental Earnings Information continued The Groups supplemental measure of its results and reconciliation of operating profit based on long-term investment returns before amortisation of goodwill to profit on ordinary activities, including the related basic earnings per share amounts, are as follows: Before Basic tax Tax Minority earnings note 7 note 16 interests Net per share m m m m Pence 2002 Operating profit based on long-term investment returns before amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items 432 122 4 314 15.8p Amortisation of goodwill 98 98 4.9 p Short-term fluctuations in investment returns: Jackson National Life 258 100 158 8.0 p Other principally Asia 53 9 5 49 2.5p Profit on sale of UK general business operations 355 13 342 17.2p Profit on ordinary activities 484 44 9 449 22.6p 2001 Operating profit based on long-term investment returns before amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items 622 174 12 460 23.3p Amortisation of goodwill 95 95 4.8 p Short-term fluctuations in investment returns: Jackson National Life 368 129 239 12.1 p Other principally UK general business 112 30 13 69 3.5 p Merger break fee, net of related expenses 338 6 332 16.8p Profit on ordinary activities 385 21 25 389 19.7p The adjustment from post-tax longer-term investment returns to post-tax actual investment returns includes investment return that is attributable to external equity investors in two investment funds managed by PPM America.
These two funds are consolidated as quasi-subsidiaries but, except to the extent of Prudential Group participation in the funds, they have no net impact on pre-tax or post-tax operating profit.
Total profit, before and after tax, incorporating the adjustment from longer-term to actual investment returns, includes losses of 5m 13m attributable to the minority interests in these funds.

During 2001 the Company announced the restructuring of the direct sales force and customer service channels of its UK Insurance Operations.
Additional restructuring was undertaken in 2002 to further reduce operating costs.
The total cost of this restructuring, including amounts borne by the main with-profits fund, was 38m 200m of which 14m 48m was attributable to shareholders on the modified statutory basis of reporting.

Segmental Information Net Assets A segmental analysis of the fund for future appropriations and the technical provisions net of reinsurance is set out below which, although liabilities, provides a more useful indication of the assets supporting the business: 2002 2001 Fund for future appropriations and net technical provisions m m Fund for future appropriations: Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund of Prudential Assurance Company PAC closed to new business and wholly attributable but not allocated to policyholders 437 1,814 Other Group companies principally the with-profits fund of PAC 7,226 11,388 7,663 13,202 Technical provisions net of reinsurance 114,994 116,213 Total 122,657 129,415 Comprising: UK Operations 92,377 98,832 Jackson National Life 24,074 25,055 Prudential Asia 5,557 4,894 Prudential Europe 649 634 122,657 129,415 The Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund SAIF is a separate sub-fund within the PAC long-term business fund.
This sub-fund contains all the with-profits business and all other pension business that was transferred from the Scottish Amicable Life Assurance Society to PAC in 1997.
No new business is written in the sub-fund.
The SAIF sub-fund is managed to ensure that all the invested assets of SAIF are distributed to SAIF policyholders over the lifetime of the SAIF policies.
With the exception of certain amounts in respect of unitised with-profits life business, all future earnings arising in SAIF are retained for existing SAIF with-profits policyholders.
Any excess deficiency of revenue over expense within SAIF during a period is offset by a transfer to from the SAIF fund for future appropriations.
Shareholders have no interest in the profits of SAIF, although they are entitled to the investment management fees paid on this business.
Should the assets of SAIF be inadequate to meet the guaranteed benefit obligations to the policyholders of SAIF, the PAC long-term fund would be liable to cover any such deficiency.
With the exception of certain guaranteed annuity products as described in note 32, SAIF with-profits policies do not guarantee minimum rates of return to policyholders.

Jackson National Life Additional Detail on Basis of Presentation of Results The results of US operations, mainly Jackson National Life, are consolidated into the Group accounts based on US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles US GAAP.
However, certain adjustments are made in the Groups consolidated financial statements to the US GAAP results as reported in Jackson National Lifes own financial statements to comply with UK GAAP, with the Groups accounting policies, and to reflect appropriately the Jackson National Life segmental result, as set out below: Other US GAAP adjustments Reverse adjusted to comply FAS 133 for minority with and interests and Presentation UK GAAP Segmental result for FAS 115 reversal of of and Group UK Modified Statutory effects Minority FAS 133 and investment accounting Basis GAAP purposes notes i interests FAS 115 returns policies note vi Jackson National Life result reconciliation of US GAAP and ii note iii effects note iv note v 2002 US GAAP basis result to UK GAAP result US$m US$m US$m US$m US$m US$m US$m m Profit and loss account Operating profit 275 8 283 77 3 209 139 Realised investment gains losses, net of related change to amortisation of acquisition costs including, for US GAAP, the change in the fair value of hedging instruments note ii 722 285 21 416 416 Short-term fluctuations in investment returns 386 386 258 Amortisation of goodwill 6 6 4 Profit before tax before minority interests 447 293 21 133 47 3 183 123 Minority interests note iii 21 21 Profit before tax after minority interests 426 293 0 133 47 3 183 123 Tax charge credit: on operating profit 96 3 99 27 72 48 on realised investment gains and losses and minority interests 245 100 145 145 on short-term fluctuations in investment returns 135 135 90 Total tax charge 149 103 46 17 63 42 Net income 277 190 87 30 3 120 81 Movements in shareholders funds Net income as shown above 277 190 87 30 3 120 Capital contributions 614 614 30 644 Net movement in other comprehensive income 462 492 30 30 0 Dividends paid to intermediate holding company 142 142 142 Total movement in year 657 302 355 0 27 382 Shareholders funds at beginning of year 3,093 349 3,442 3,442 Shareholders funds at end of year 3,750 47 3,797 27 3,824 2,374 i The valuation basis of debt securities reversal of FAS 115 effects Under US GAAP debt securities classified as available for sale under Financial Accounting Standard FAS 115 are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with movements on unrealised appreciation accounted for directly within shareholders reserves as Other Comprehensive Income.
By contrast, consistent with the ABI SORP, for Group reporting purposes, all fixed income securities are carried at amortised cost subject to provision for permanent diminution in value.
This accounting treatment is appropriate as the securities are held as part of a portfolio of such securities intended to be held to maturity.
Movements in unrealised appreciation arising from changes in the fair value of these securities do not feature as a part of the Groups UK GAAP accounting.
ii The valuation basis of hedging derivative instruments reversal of FAS 133 effects Under FAS 133, all derivative instruments are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair values, and changes in such fair values are recognised immediately in earnings unless specific hedging criteria are met.
Jackson National Life uses derivatives primarily interest rate swaps to hedge certain risks in conjunction with its asset liability management programme.
However, Jackson National Life has elected not to incur the costs of restructuring its derivative contracts, segregating investment portfolios and adding the systems and personnel required to qualify for much stricter hedge accounting treatment.
Net earnings for Jackson National Life on a US GAAP basis reflect increased volatility owing to fair value fluctuations on its derivative instruments, particularly for interest rate swaps that are regularly used to manage risks associated with movements in interest rates.
However, the largely offsetting change in the fair value of hedged investments will remain as an adjustment taken directly to shareholders funds under US GAAP, as described in note i.
This position can be contrasted with the position under UK GAAP where hedge accounting for relevant derivative instruments is still appropriate.
Accordingly, gains and losses recognised under FAS 133 are eliminated in order to comply with UK GAAP.
Jackson National Life Additional Detail on Basis of Presentation of Results continued iii Minority interests The UK GAAP results are determined after adjustment for minority interests.
For UK reporting purposes the segmental result of Jackson National Life reflects its proportionate interests in the results of two investment funds that are consolidated as quasi subsidiaries.
iv Presentation of investment returns within the UK basis performance statements Profit loss on ordinary activities before tax With the exception of the elimination of FAS 133 effects, as explained in note ii, and revaluation gains on certain equity-based securities that are recorded within other comprehensive income under US GAAP, the total profit loss under UK GAAP is the same as under US GAAP.
Operating profit Under US GAAP, the convention is to refer to operating income as income before realised gains and losses and related amortisation of acquisition costs.
Under UK GAAP, consistent with FRS 3 and the ABI SORP, operating profit is determined after inclusion of longer-term investment returns i. e. investment income and estimated longer-term capital gains.
Details of the method for determining longer-term returns for Jackson National Life are explained in note 4. v Other adjustments These comprise: a adjustment for the amortisation of goodwill under UK GAAP.
Amortisation is normally no longer required under US GAAP following the implementation of FAS 142: b inclusion of capital injected into a fellow US subsidiary of Jackson National Life.

Actuarial valuation and funding The Group operates a number of pension schemes around the world.
The largest scheme is the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS.
On the FRS 17 basis of valuation described below, 91% of the liabilities of Group defined benefit schemes are accounted for within PSPS.
This Scheme has assets held in separate trustee administered funds and was last subject to full actuarial valuation as at 5 April 2002 by P N Thornton, a qualified actuary and a partner in the firm of Watson Wyatt Partners.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted were investment return 6.6% per annum, pensionable earnings growth 4.5% per annum, increases to pensions in payment 2.5% per annum and dividend growth 3.5% per annum.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2002 73 Notes on the Financial Statements continued 19.
Information on Staff and Pension Costs continued On an actuarial basis consistent with the methodology applied for the valuation at 5 April 2002, the position is not believed to be significantly different at 31 December 2002.
The market value of Scheme assets as at that date was 4,034m and the actuarial value of the assets was sufficient to cover 110% of the benefits that had accrued to members, allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
As a result of the actuarial valuation, the employers contribution rate has continued at the minimum prescribed under the Scheme rules, which is 12.5% of salaries.
The employers contribution is required to be paid as a minimum in future years irrespective of the excess of assets in the Scheme and, under the current Scheme rules, access to the surplus through refunds from the Scheme is not available.
Accordingly the surplus is not recognised as an asset in the Groups financial statements and the pension cost charge has been determined on an accrued payable basis without regard to the spreading of the surplus in the fund that would normally be appropriate under the requirements of SSAP 24.
The Group also operates two smaller defined benefit schemes for UK employees in respect of Scottish Amicable and M&G activities, whose aggregate pension costs on a SSAP 24 basis are materially the same as the funding cost.
For all three schemes the projected unit method was used for the most recent full actuarial valuations.
FRS 17 basis disclosure i Basis of valuation and scheme assets and liabilities Using external actuarial advice provided by Watson Wyatt Partners for the valuation of PSPS, and by Aon Limited for the M&G scheme, and internal advice for the Scottish Amicable scheme, the most recent full valuations have been updated to 31 December 2002 applying the principles prescribed by FRS 17.
The key assumptions adopted for this valuation, and the FRS 17 basis valuation at 31 December 2001, were: 31 Dec 2002 31 Dec 2001 Price inflation 2.25% 2.50% Rate of increase in salaries 4.25% 4.50% Rate of increase of present and future pensions 2.25% 2.50% Rate used to discount scheme liabilities 5.50% 5.75% The assets in the schemes and the expected rates of return were: 31 Dec 2002 31 Dec 2001 Long-term Long-term expected expected Assets rate of Assets rate of m return m return Equities 2,501 8.00% 3,321 7.25% Bonds 473 5.00% 402 5.50% Properties 536 7.75% 536 7.00% Other assets 60 4.00% 103 4.00% Total value of assets 3,570 7.50% 4,362 7.00% The long-term expected rates of return have been determined after applying due consideration to the requirements of paragraph 54 of FRS 17, in particular, taking account of the values of the assets and equity market levels at the balance sheet dates.
The present value of the liabilities of the three schemes at 31 December 2002 was 4,117m 31 December 2001 3,777m.
The resulting scheme deficit arising from the excess of liabilities over assets at 31 December 2002 comprised 426m attributable to the PAC with-profit fund and 121m attributable to shareholder operations.
At 31 December 2001, the resulting scheme surplus arising from the excess of assets over liabilities comprised 441m attributable to the PAC with-profit fund and 144m attributable to shareholder operations.
The movement in the difference between scheme assets and liabilities for the year ended 31 December 2002 comprises: m Current service cost 65 Contributions 34 Other finance income 88 Actuarial losses 1,189 Net reduction 1,132 74 Prudential plc Annual Report 2002 19.

The advances are secured by mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities.
viii Under the terms of the Groups arrangements with its main United Kingdom banker, the bank has a right of set off between credit balances other than those of long-term funds and all overdrawn balances of those Group undertakings with similar arrangements.
Contingencies and Related Obligations Consistent with FRS 12, Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets, appropriate provision has been made in the financial statements where Prudential has an obligation arising from the events or activities described below but not for contingent liabilities.
Litigation Jackson National Life has been named in civil proceedings, which appear to be substantially similar to other class action litigation brought against many life insurers, alleging misconduct in the sale of insurance products.
At this time, it is not possible to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss, if any, that could result from an unfavourable outcome in such actions.
In addition, Jackson National Life is a defendant in individual actions that involve similar issues.
Several cases, including one which was on appeal to the Supreme Court in the State of Mississippi, were settled in January 2002 for a sum of 7m.
Prudential and its subsidiaries are involved in other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
Whilst the outcome of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the ultimate outcome of such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Prudentials financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Contingencies and Related Obligations continued Pension Mis-selling Review In 1988, the UK government introduced new pensions legislation intended to encourage more individuals to make their own arrangements for their pensions.
During the period from April 1988 to June 1994, many individuals were advised by insurance companies, Independent Financial Advisers and other intermediaries to not join, to transfer from or to opt out of their occupational pension schemes in favour of private pension products introduced under UK Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
The UK insurance regulator previously the Personal Investment Authority, now the Financial Services Authority, FSA subsequently determined that many individuals were incorrectly advised and would have been better off not purchasing the private pension products sold to them.
Industry participants are responsible for compensating the persons to whom private pensions were mis-sold.
As a result, the UK regulator required that all UK life insurance companies review their potential cases of pension mis-selling and pay compensation to policyholders where necessary and, as a consequence, record a provision for the estimated costs.
The Group has met the requirement of the FSA to issue offers to all Phase 1 priority cases and Phase 2 non-priority cases by 30 June 2002.
Provisions in respect of the costs associated with the review have been included in the change in the long-term technical provision in Prudentials profit and loss account.
Within the long-term technical provisions, the transfer from the FFA has been determined accordingly.
The following is a summary of the changes in the pension mis-selling liability, including internal and external legal and administrative costs, for the years ended 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2002 2001 m m Balance at start of the year 1,065 1,475 Changes to actuarial assumptions and method of calculation 50 89 Discount unwind 53 89 Redress to policyholders 292 273 Payments of administrative costs 46 137 Balance at end of the year 730 1,065 Every three months the FSA updates the actuarial assumptions to be used in calculating the provision, including interest rates and mortality assumptions.
The pension mis-selling liability represents the discounted value of future expected payments, including benefit payments and all internal and external legal and administrative costs of adjudicating, processing and settling those claims.
To the extent that amounts have not been paid, the provision increases each year reflecting the shorter period of discount.
Management believes that, based on current information, the pension mis-selling provision, together with future investment return on the assets backing the provision, will be adequate to cover the costs of pension mis-selling as well as the costs and expenses of Prudentials pension review unit established to identify and settle such cases.
Such provision presents the best estimate of probable costs and expenses.
However, there can be no assurance that the current provision level will not need to be increased.
The calculation of the pension mis-selling provision is dependent upon a number of assumptions and requirements provided by the FSA.
The costs associated with the pension mis-selling review have been met from Prudential Assurances inherited estate.
Given the strength of Prudential Assurances with-profits fund, management believes that charging the costs to the inherited estate will not have an adverse effect on the level of bonuses paid to policyholders or on their reasonable expectations.
In the unlikely event of this proving not to be the case, an appropriate contribution to the with-profits fund would be made from the shareholders funds.
In view of the uncertainty, it is not practicable to estimate the level of any potential contribution.
Free Standing Additional Voluntary Contribution Business Review In February 2000, the UK regulator ordered a review of Free Standing Additional Voluntary Contribution FSAVC business, which constitutes sales of personal pensions to members of company pension schemes.
Individuals who have purchased these pensions instead of the Additional Voluntary Contributions AVC scheme connected to their companys pension scheme may have been in a better financial position investing their money, and any matching contributions from their employers, in their companys AVC scheme.
The UK regulators review is to ensure that any employees disadvantaged due to not being properly informed of the benefits foregone from not investing in their AVC scheme are compensated.
The review requires companies to identify relevant investors and contact them with an offer to review their individual case.
Prudential met an interim deadline set by the FSA of 90% of cases completed by 30 June 2002 and also the deadline for 100% completion by 31 December 2002.
As a result of the review, Prudential held a provision of 3m at 31 December 2002.
Mortgage Endowment Products Review The Groups main exposure to mortgage endowment products is through Scottish Amicable.
The FSA issued a report in March 2001 raising concerns regarding Scottish Amicables conduct of sales of these products by its tied agents and in March 2003 it fined Scottish Amicable 750,000 in respect of cases where advisers did not place appropriate emphasis on identifying whether a customer was prepared to take the risk that their mortgage might not be repaid at the end of the term.
A provision of 25m was made in 2001 in the shareholders fund for cases that may require redress, which the directors are satisfied continues to be adequate.
Scottish Amicable withdrew from the mortgage endowment product market in April 2001 and disbanded its network of tied agents in October 2001.
Contingencies and Related Obligations continued Guaranteed Annuities In common with several other insurance companies, Prudential Assurance used to sell guaranteed annuity products in the UK and held a provision of 46m at 31 December 2002 within the main with-profits fund to honour guarantees on these products.
The Groups main exposure to guaranteed annuities in the UK is through the Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund SAIF and a provision of 744m was held in SAIF at 31 December 2002 to honour the guarantees.
SAIF is a separate sub-fund of the Prudential Assurance long-term business fund.
Accordingly, this provision has no impact on shareholders.
Guarantees and Commitments Guarantee funds in both the UK and US provide for payments to be made to policyholders on behalf of insolvent life insurance companies.
These guarantee funds are financed by payments assessed on solvent insurance companies based on location, volume, and types of business.
Prudential estimated its reserve for future guarantee fund assessments for Jackson National Life to be 25m at 31 December 2002.
Similar assessments for the UK businesses were not significant.
Management believes the reserves are adequate for all anticipated payments for known insolvencies.
Jackson National Life has commitments for future payments related to equity index call options totalling 21m, which are accounted for on a deferred basis and therefore were off-balance sheet at 31 December 2002.
These commitments were entered into in the normal course of business to hedge obligations associated with the issuance of equity index-linked immediate and deferred annuities.
The commitments are due over the next five years.
Jackson National Life has unfunded commitments related to its investments in limited partnerships totalling 300m at 31 December 2002.
These commitments were entered into in the ordinary course of business and management does not expect a material adverse impact on the operations to arise from them.
Prudential has provided, from time to time, certain guarantees and commitments to third parties.
These arrangements include commitments and guarantees to fund the purchase or development of land and buildings and other commitments related to investments in land and buildings.
At 31 December 2002, the aggregate amount of commitments and guarantees in respect of land and buildings was approximately 27m.
Prudential has provided, from time to time, other guarantees and commitments to third parties entered into in the normal course of business but management does not consider that the amounts involved are significant.
Other Matters Prudential Assurances inherited estate The inherited estate is the assets of the main with-profits fund within the long-term fund of Prudential Assurance, less non-participating liabilities, the policyholder asset shares aggregated across with-profits policies and any additional amounts expected at the valuation date to be paid to in force policyholders in the future in respect of smoothing costs and guarantees.
The inherited estate is thus the assets in the main with-profits fund in excess of what Prudential Assurance expects to pay to policyholders.
Prudential believes that it would be beneficial if there were to be greater clarity as to the status of the inherited estate.
With that in mind, it has been considering the principles that would apply to any re-attribution of the inherited estate to either policyholders or shareholders.
Discussions have been held with the Financial Services Authority to this end.
Prudential has not considered or discussed any actual distribution as its current expectation is that, for the foreseeable future, the entire inherited estate will need to be retained within the long-term fund to provide working capital.
However, in the light of current market conditions, the amount and timing of any re-attribution of the estate remains very uncertain.
Support of long-term business funds from shareholders funds As a proprietary insurance company, Prudential is liable to meet its obligations to policyholders even if the assets of the long-term funds are insufficient to do so.
The assets, represented by the Fund for Future Appropriations, in excess of amounts expected to be paid for future terminal bonuses and related shareholder transfers excess assets in the long-term funds could be materially depleted over time, by, for example, a significant or sustained equity market downturn, significant fundamental strategic change costs, or material increases in the pension mis-selling provision.
In the unlikely circumstance that the depletion of the excess assets within the long-term fund was such that Prudentials ability to satisfy policyholders reasonable expectations was adversely affected, it might become necessary to restrict the annual distribution to shareholders or to contribute shareholders funds to the long-term funds to provide financial support.
Should the assets of SAIF be inadequate to meet the guaranteed benefit obligations to the policyholders of SAIF, the Prudential Assurance long-term fund would be liable to cover any such deficiency.
At 31 December 2002, the excess of SAIF assets over guaranteed benefits was 437m.
Due to the quality and diversity of the assets in SAIF, the aforementioned amount of the excess of assets over guaranteed benefits and the ability of Prudential to revise guaranteed benefits in case of an asset shortfall, Prudential believes that the probability of either the Prudential Assurance long-term fund or Prudential shareholders funds having to contribute to SAIF is very remote.
