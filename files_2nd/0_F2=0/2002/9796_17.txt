"Notes to the Financial Statements 1Accounting policies The following paragraphs summarise the main accounting policies of the Group, which have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups Financial Statements, except for the implementation of FRS 19 ""Deferred Tax""."
aFinancial statements convention The Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, modified by the revaluation of certain properties, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
There is no material difference between historical cost profits and those reported in the profit and loss account.
"In respect of FRS17 ""Retirement Benefits"" the Group is following the transitional arrangements under which additional disclosure on retirement benefits is required in the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2002 as set out in Note 32."
"The Group has adopted FRS19 ""Deferred Tax"" during the current period and therefore the comparatives have been restated because it has a material impact on the Groups financial position."
The changes have been dealt with as a prior year adjustment as set out in Note 23.
The impact of these changes on the profit for the period ended 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001 is to increase the tax charge by 978,000 and 1,503,000 respectively.
The impact of these changes on the balance sheet at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001 is to reduce shareholders funds by 19,852,000 and 18,843,000 respectively.
bBasis of consolidation The Group Financial Statements include the Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December 2002.
All Financial Statements are prepared on a uniform basis throughout the Group.
The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted, unless otherwise stated.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Under section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
"cGoodwill Purchased goodwill arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions before 1 January 1998, when FRS10 ""Goodwill and Intangible Assets"" was adopted, was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition."
When a subsequent disposal occurs any related goodwill previously written off to reserves is written back through the profit and loss account as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Purchased goodwill representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given and associated costs over the fair value of the separable net assets acquired arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions since 1 January 1998 is capitalised.
Positive goodwill is amortised to nil by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful economic life, normally 20 years.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a business acquired since 1 January 1998, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging crediting the unamortised amount of any related goodwill negative goodwill.
dInvestments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment where appropriate.
The Directors consider annually whether a provision against the value of investments on an individual basis is required.
Such provisions are charged in the profit and loss account in the year.
eForeign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or, if hedged forward, at the rate of exchange under the related forward currency contract, and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
40 Marshalls plc Annual Report 2002 1Accounting policies continued fTurnover Turnover represents the invoiced value of sales to customers outside the Group, less returns, allowances and value added tax.
Turnover is recognised in the Financial Statements upon despatch of the goods.
gDevelopment expenditure Development expenditure is accounted for in accordance with SSAP 13 Accounting for Research and Development and is written off in the period in which it arises.
hPension costs Defined benefit scheme Contributions to the Groups defined benefit pension scheme are charged to the profit and loss account on a basis which spreads the cost over employees working lives with the Group.
The regular pension costs are attributed to individual years using the discounted income projected unit method.
Variations in pension costs, which are identified as a result of actuarial valuations, are amortised over the average remaining service lives of employees.
Defined contribution scheme Contributions to the Groups defined contribution scheme are determined as a percentage of employees earnings and are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
iStocks Stocks of raw materials, bought in components and goods for resale are valued at the lower of invoice cost and net realisable value.
Finished goods and manufactured components are valued at the lower of works cost and net realisable value.
Works cost consists of direct materials, labour and factory and administrative overheads applicable to the stage of production.
jTangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at either cost or professional valuation less depreciation.
"On adoption of FRS15 ""Tangible Fixed Assets"", the Group followed the transitional provisions to retain the book value of land and buildings which were revalued in 1989 but not to adopt a policy of revaluation in the future."
Depreciation is provided on all fixed assets, other than freehold and long leasehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life.
The rates are as follows: Freehold and long leasehold buildings - 2.5% to 5% per annum Quarries - 5% to 15% per annum Short leasehold property - over the period of the lease Fixed plant and equipment - 5% to 25% per annum Mobile plant and vehicles - 14% to 30% per annum Assets under construction are not depreciated until they are ready for use.
kCash and liquid resources Cash, for the purpose of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts payable on demand.
Liquid resources are current asset investments which are disposable without curtailing or disrupting the business and are either readily convertible into known amounts of cash at or close to their carrying values or traded in an active market.
Liquid resources comprise term deposits of less than one year.
M Marshalls plc Annual Repor arshalls plc Annual Report t 2001 2002 41 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1Accounting policies continued lLeased assets Elements of plant and machinery are subject to finance leases giving rights approximating to ownership.
Such assets are treated as though they had been purchased outright and are included in tangible fixed assets at a value equal to the total capital payments to be made during the term of the lease.
The total amount of the capital payments outstanding is included in creditors.
The amount included in tangible fixed assets is written off over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the term of the lease.
The rental cost of all operating leases is charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lives of the leases.
"mDeferred taxation Full provision is made for deferred taxation resulting from timing differences, other than those specifically excluded by FRS19 ""Deferred Tax"", between profits computed for taxation purposes and profits stated in the Financial Statements to the extent that there is an obligation to pay more tax in the future as a result of those timing differences."
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit attributable to ordinary shares and potentially ordinary dilutive shares of 33,504,000 2001: 28,534,000 by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year of 167,130,230 2001: 166,804,445, plus potentially dilutive shares of 247,797 2001: 45,244 which totals 167,378,027 2001: 166,849,689.
An adjusted basic earnings per share has been prepared in order to show the underlying performance of the business.
The adjusted basic earnings per share is adjusted for goodwill amortisation, gain on disposals of property, the gain on disposal and termination of business and the associated taxation.
The comparative adjusted basic earnings per share has been restated to ensure comparability with the current year.
In the year ended 31 December 2002, reorganisation costs of 2.0 million have not been disclosed as exceptional and consequently the adjusted basic earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2001, as disclosed above, makes no adjustment for operating exceptional items.

The Groups freehold and leasehold industrial property in the UK was revalued in March 1989 on the basis of open market value for existing use.
No provision has been made for taxation which may be payable in the event of these properties being sold at their revalued amounts on the grounds that it is the Groups intention to retain them for operational purposes.

Finance leases are controlled, managed and approved centrally to ensure that financed assets will generate the required returns.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and exchange rate risk.
The Board reviews and agrees the policies for managing each of these risks and they have remained unchanged since 2001.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to review regularly the terms of its available short term borrowing facilities and to assess individually and manage each long term borrowing commitment accordingly.
Liquidity risk Cash resources are largely generated through operations.
Short term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities.
Currency risk Exposure to currency risk primarily arises from incurring transactional foreign currency expenses.
The Groups policy is to cover all significant foreign currency commitments by using forward foreign currency contracts.
"Financial assets and liabilities The Group has taken advantage of the exemptions given under FRS13 ""Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments"" in excluding short term debtors and creditors from its disclosures."
Other than cash at bank and short term debtors the Group has no other financial assets.

Following the last opportunity to convert the outstanding shares they have now become cumulative redeemable preference shares which will be redeemed on 1 October 2003 at 1 per share.
54 Marshalls plc Annual Report 2002 21 Share capital continued 10% Cumulative Preference Shares On 22 May 2002, shareholder approval was received for the cancellation of the 10% Cumulative Preference Shares and an amount was repaid to shareholders of 224p per share.
The sum of 224p per share was determined by the Board after taking into account the value of comparable fixed interest instruments.
This sum was higher than the amount per share to which holders of 10% Cumulative Preference Shares were strictly entitled on a return of capital under the Companys Articles of Association which provided broadly, for payment of the greater of the nominal value of 1 and a sum based on the average of middle market quotations for the six months preceding the relevant date.
In addition, each 10% Cumulative Preference Shareholder received the fixed dividend accrued and unpaid on those shares to and including the date of repayment.
The cost to the Company of the cancellation and repayment, before expenses, was 2,274,000 and was funded from the Companys existing bank facilities.
The excess of the amount repaid to the 10% Cumulative Preference Shareholders over the nominal value of the 10% Cumulative Preference Shares was paid out of a reserve created by reducing the Companys share premium account by 1,259,000.
Both the cancellation of the 10% Cumulative Preference Shares and the reduction of share premium account were subject to the approval of the Ordinary Shareholders and the 10% Cumulative Preference Shareholders, the sanction of the 10% Cumulative Preference Shareholders at a Class Meeting and the confirmation of the Court.
The Capital Reduction did not become effective until Court Approval was received on 14 June 2002.

56 Marshalls plc Annual Report 2002 22 Reserves continued On 14 June 2002 a transfer of 1,259,000 was made in Marshalls plc between the share premium account and a special reserve created to write off the excess over nominal value of the amount repaid to the 10% Cumulative Preference Shareholders Note 21.
The prior year adjustment is reported in Note 23.
"23 Prior year adjustment The prior year adjustment reflects the adoption of FRS19 ""Deferred Tax"" with effect from 1 January 2002."
The previous policy of the Company was to provide for taxation on the timing differences between profits computed for taxation purposes and profits per the Financial Statements only to the extent that such taxation was likely to be payable in the foreseeable future.
FRS19 requires that full provision be made for deferred taxation.
This change in accounting policy results in a prior year adjustment, reducing shareholders funds at 1 January 2001 by 17,340,000 and by 18,843,000 at 1 January 2002.
In addition, the taxation charges for years ended 31 December 2001 and 31 December 2002 have been increased by 1,503,000 and 978,000 due to the change in accounting policy.

These sums relate to the Groups cap on self insurance in relation to the 12 months ended 21 October 2002 and the period ended 31 October 2003 respectively.
32 Pension scheme The Group operates the Marshalls Pension and Life Assurance Scheme which has both a defined benefit and a defined contribution section.
The assets of the scheme are held in separately managed funds which are independent of the Groups finances.
SSAP24 A funded defined benefit scheme covering certain employees is operated by Trustees as a self-administered independent fund using external investment managers.
The Scheme is valued by an independent Actuary and an actuarial valuation was carried out as at 6 April 2001 using the discounted income projected unit method.
The main actuarial assumptions used for accounting purposes were investment returns exceeding salary growth by 2.5% per annum and pension increases of 3.0% per annum for pre 6 April 1997 benefits and at 4.5% per annum for post 6 April 1997.
The valuation showed that the market value of the Schemes assets at 6 April 2001 was 118.5 million.
The actuarial value of the assets was 94.6 million which covered the accrued liabilities by 109% on an ongoing basis.
The Actuary recommended that the surplus be eliminated by reducing the company contributions over the balance of the members working lifetimes.
Following this actuarial valuation, employer contributions have been at the rate of 6.75% of pensionable pay.
This includes the age-related national insurance rebates payable by the Contributions Agency.
During the year, active members on average contributed 5.65% of pensionable salaries.
The defined benefit scheme charge for the year was 1,718,000 2001: 1,793,000.
Certain other employees are members of a company defined contribution scheme which invests funds in which the contributions for each individual member are separately identifiable and the benefits calculated accordingly.
The total of the defined contributions schemes and insured schemes costs charged for the year was 268,000 2001: 202,000.
"Marshalls plc Annual Report 2002 59 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 32 Pension scheme continued FRS17 Whilst the Company continues to account for pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24 ""Accounting for Pension Costs"" under FRS17 ""Retirement benefits"" the transitional disclosures set out below are required."
The most recent actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme has been updated by an independent, qualified Actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS17 in order to assess the liabilities of the Scheme at 31 December 2002.
Main assumptions for FRS17 purposes: 31 December 2002 31 December 2001 Discount rate 5.50% 6.00% Rate of increase in salaries 3.50% 4.00% Rate of increase in pensions payment 3.10% 3.10% Inflation rate 2.25% 2.50% The assumptions used by the Actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions.
The fair value of the defined benefit Schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the Schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, were: Long-term rate of Value at Long-term rate of Value at return expected at 31 December 2002 return expected at 31 December 2001 31 December 2002 000 31 December 2001 000 Equities 6.50% 67,921 6.75% 85,175 Bonds 4.50% 27,340 4.75% 26,228 Other 4.50% 1,077 4.75% 1,951 96,338 113,354 The following amounts at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001 were measured in accordance with the requirements of FRS17: 2002 2001 000 000 Total market value of assets 96,338 113,354 Present value of Scheme liabilities 142,270 129,073 Deficit in the Scheme 45,932 15,719 Related deferred tax asset 13,780 4,716 Net pension liability 32,152 11,003 60 Marshalls plc Annual Report 2002 32 Pension scheme continued If the above amounts had been recognised in the Financial Statements the Groups net assets and profit and loss reserve at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001 would be as follows: 2002 2001 000 000 As restated Net assets excluding pension liability 202,746 186,712 Net pension liability 32,152 11,003 Net assets including pension liability 170,594 175,709 Profit and loss reserve excluding pension liability 123,495 105,278 Net pension liability 32,152 11,003 Profit and loss reserve including pension liability 91,343 94,275 The method of calculating the net pension asset or liability under FRS17 is likely to lead to volatility in the amounts to be included in the Groups balance sheet and the profit and loss account financing charge when this Financial Reporting Standard is fully adopted.
The Scheme assets, the majority of which are equities, are potentially subject to significant market movements.
During the year ended 31 December 2002, the FTSE All Share Index fluctuated between 30% higher and 12% lower than its value at the balance sheet date.
The Schemes liabilities are measured by reference to long-term AA corporate bond yields that can again move significantly and according to market conditions.
The yield on the AA corporate bond index used was in the range 5.5% to 6.0% in the year 2002.
"The following amounts would have been recognised in the performance statements in the year ended 31 December 2002 under the requirements of FRS17: 000 Operating profit: Current service cost 3,853 Gain on curtailment relating to disposal and termination of business 541 Total operating charge 3,312 Other finance income net : Expected return on pension scheme assets 7,049 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 7,763 Net return 714 Consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses ""STRGL"" : Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 22,825 Experience gains and losses arising on the Scheme liabilities 2,666 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the Scheme liabilities 8,031 Actuarial loss recognised in STRGL 28,190 Marshalls plc Annual Report 2002 61 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 32 Pension scheme continued A reconciliation of the movement in the deficit during the year is set out below: 000 Deficit in the Scheme at 1 January 2002 15,719 Movement in year: Current service cost 3,853 Contributions 2,003 Other finance income net 714 Actuarial loss 28,190 Gain on curtailment relating to disposal and termination of business 541 Deficit in the Scheme at 31 December 2002 45,932 Details of experience gains and losses for the year ended 31 December 2002 were: 000 Difference between the expected and actual return on the Scheme assets 22,825 Percentage of the Scheme assets 24% Experience gains and losses on the Scheme liabilities 2,666 Percentage of the present value of the Scheme liabilities 2% Total amount recognised in the STRGL 28,190 Percentage of the present value of the Scheme liabilities 20% 33 Subsidiary undertakings The principal wholly owned subsidiary undertakings of Marshalls plc at 31 December 2002 are set out below."
