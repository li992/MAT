Redemptions Redemption levels in the year were lower than last year and towards the lower end of the range we have experienced over the long term.
Asset Management typically expects redemptions to average between 15%20% in any one financial year.
This is based on historical experience and it should be noted there is little correlation between redemptions and fund performance.
Redemptions are a function of a number of factors including geographical diversity.
Furthermore, early redemption charges and the long-term nature of the funds encourage investors to maintain the long-term view.
