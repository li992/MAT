33 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared according to the historical cost convention, and in accordance with accounting standards applicable in the United Kingdom.
The accounting policies applied in preparing the financial statements are consistent with those adopted and disclosed in the Groups statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2001, except for the implementation of Financial Reporting Standard FRS 19 Deferred Tax, as set out below.
With effect from 1 January 2002, the Group adopted FRS 19 Deferred Tax.
Under FRS 19 deferred taxation is provided in full on all timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, subject to the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
The change in accounting policy has been accounted for by means of a prior year adjustment, and the previously published figures at 31 December 2001 have been restated as follows: 31 December US$ million 2001 Profit and loss account Decrease in operating profit 2 Increase in tax on profit on ordinary activities 145 Decrease in equity minority interests 56 Decrease in profit for the financial year 91 Decrease in headline earnings 89 Balance sheet Increase in goodwill 32 Decrease in investments in joint ventures 18 Decrease in investments in associates 4 Increase in debtors 18 Increase in deferred tax provision 933 Decrease in equity minority interests 335 Decrease in shareholders funds 570 The impact of adoption of FRS 19 was to increase the tax charge by US$229 million, and decrease headline earnings by US$166 million, for the year ended 31 December 2002.
Shareholders funds, as previously reported at 1 January 2001, decreased by US$717 million, due to the adoption of FRS 19.
The Group continues to account under the transitional arrangements for FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
When the International Accounting Standards Board has clarified the approach it will adopt in revising IAS 19 Employee Benefits and the extent to which FRS 17 may change as a result, the board will decide when to adopt the standard in full.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries.
Acquisitions and goodwill arising thereon Where an investment in a subsidiary, joint venture or an associate is made, any difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the attributable net assets is recognised as goodwill.
Goodwill is amortised over its estimated useful life up to a maximum of 20 years.
Goodwill in respect of subsidiaries is included within intangible xed assets.
Goodwill relating to joint ventures and associates is included within the carrying value of the joint venture or associate.
The unamortised balance is reviewed on a regular basis and, if an impairment in value has occurred, it is written off in the period in which the circumstances are identified.
Joint ventures A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds a long term interest and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other venturers under a contractual arrangement.
The Groups share of the results of joint ventures is accounted for using the gross equity method of accounting.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2002 34 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Associates The equity method of accounting is used for investments over which the Group exercises significant influence and normally owns between 20% and 50% of the voting equity.
Results of associates are equity accounted from their most recent audited financial statements or unaudited interim statements.
Any losses of associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements until the investment in, and loans to, such associates are written down to a nominal amount.
Thereafter, losses are accounted for only insofar as the Group is committed to providing financial support to such associates.
The carrying values of investments in associates represent the cost of each investment including unamortised goodwill, the share of post-acquisition retained earnings and any other movements in reserves.
The carrying value of associates is reviewed on a regular basis and if an impairment in value has occurred, it is written off in the period in which those circumstances are identified.
When an investment is held in an associate which in turn holds an investment in the Group as its associate, the carrying value is adjusted for the impact of the progressive additions to equity accounted income arising from the effect of the crossholding.
Joint arrangements The Group has contractual arrangements with other participants to engage in joint activities that do not create an entity carrying on a trade of its own.
The Group includes its share of the assets, liabilities and cash flows in such joint arrangements, measured in accordance with the terms of each arrangement, which is usually pro rata to the Groups interest in the joint arrangement.
Other financial assets Investments, other than investments in joint ventures and associates, are included at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Tangible fixed assets Mining properties and leases include the cost of acquiring and developing mining properties, mineral rights and investments in and loans to companies holding mineral rights.
Mining properties are depreciated using the unit-of-production method based on proven and probable reserves.
Depreciation is charged on new mining ventures from the date when the mining property is capable of commercial production.
When there is little likelihood of a mineral right being exploited, or the value of the exploitable mineral right has diminished below cost, a write-down is charged against profits.
Interest on borrowings relating to the nancing of major capital projects under construction is charged during the construction phase as part of the cost of the project.
Where funds have been borrowed specically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred.
Where the funds used to finance a project form part of the Groups general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to general borrowings of the Group during the period.
Land and properties in the course of construction are not depreciated.
Buildings, plant and equipment are depreciated at varying rates, on the straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Estimated useful lives normally vary up to 20 years for items of plant and equipment and up to a maximum of 50 years for buildings.
If there is an event to indicate that the recoverable amount of any of the above assets is less than the carrying value, a provision is made for the impairment in value.
Research and exploration expenditure Research and exploration expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
When a decision is taken that a mining property becomes viable for commercial production, all further pre-production expenditure is capitalised.
Capitalisation of pre-production expenditure ceases when the mining property is capable of commercial production.
Stocks Stocks and work-in-progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The production cost of stocks includes an appropriate proportion of depreciation and overheads.
Cost is determined on the following bases: raw materials and consumables are valued at cost on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis: metal, coal and coke stocks are valued at average cost: and finished products are valued at raw material cost, labour cost and a proportion of manufacturing overhead expenses.
Current asset investments Current asset investments consist mainly of bank term deposits and xed and floating rate debt securities.
Debt securities that are intended to be held to maturity are recorded on the amortised cost basis.
Debt securities that are not intended to be held to maturity are recorded at the lower of cost and market value.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2002 35 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Pensions and post-retirement benefits The expected costs of providing post-retirement benets under dened benefit arrangements are charged against profits to spread the expected costs on a straight-line basis over the service lives of employees entitled to those benets.
Costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualied actuaries using the projected unit method.
Experience adjustments and prior service costs resulting from plan amendments are amortised over the expected average remaining service lives of relevant current employees.
The difference between pension cost and funding is treated as a provision or prepayment.
Restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs An obligation to incur restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing production of a mine or quarry.
Costs arising from the installation of plant and other site preparation work, discounted to its net present value, are provided for and capitalised at the start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises.
These costs are charged against profits over the life of the operation, through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the discount on the provision.
Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage which is created on an ongoing basis during production are provided for at their net present values and charged against profits as extraction progresses.
Revenue recognition Turnover represents the net invoice value of goods and services provided to third parties after deducting sales and value added taxes.
Dividends are recognised from the last day of registration in respect of the dividend declared.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided in full on all timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, subject to the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
Leases Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account in equal annual amounts over the lease term.
Foreign currency translation The profit and loss account of foreign subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates as well as the cash flow statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated at weighted average rates of exchange, other than material exceptional items which are translated at the rate on the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences on the translation of the net assets of subsidiaries less offsetting exchange differences on foreign currency loans nancing these assets, are dealt with as a movement of reserves and in the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses.
All other exchange gains or losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions translated at the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or the translation of monetary assets and liabilities at year end exchange rates, are recorded in the profit and loss account.
Hedging transactions In order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks, the Group enters into forward, option and swap contracts.
Gains and losses on these contracts are recognised in the period to which the gains and losses of the underlying transactions relate.
Net income or expense associated with interest rate swap agreements is recognised on the accrual basis over the life of the swap agreements as a component of interest.
Where commodity option contracts hedge anticipated future production or purchases, the Group amortises the option premiums paid over the life of the option and recognises any realised gains and losses on exercise in the period in which the hedged production is sold or commodity purchases are made.
Employee share awards The estimated cost of awards made by the Group is charged to profit over the performance period, as appropriate.
Where shares are held by an employee benefit trust the carrying value of these shares is included within other fixed asset investments, less amounts charged to profit relating to those shares.
The estimated cost of awards is the market value of shares awarded or the intrinsic value of the awards being the difference between the exercise price of the award and the market price at the date of grant adjusted to reflect performance conditions where applicable.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption given in Urgent Issue Task Force Abstract 17 Employee Share Schemes, in respect of Save As You Earn schemes.
Reporting currency As permitted by UK company law, the Group reports in US dollars, the currency in which most of its business is conducted.
2 Net operating assets consist of tangible and intangible assets excluding investments in joint ventures and associates, stocks and operating debtors less non-interest bearing current liabilities.
See note 35 for the reconciliation of net operating assets to net assets.

Details of the deferred tax provision are given in note 23.
In addition to the amounts provided in deferred tax, unrecognised assets exist in respect of taxable losses.
No asset has been recognised in respect of these losses as it is not regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to offset these losses.
Any utilisation of these losses in the future may lead to a reduction in effective tax rates.
No deferred tax has been provided in respect of accumulated reserves of overseas subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures as no dividends have been declared.
Overseas earnings are not remitted to the UK in such a way as to incur a UK tax charge.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The average number of shares in issue excludes the shares held by the employee benefit trust.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the assumption of conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The only category of dilutive potential ordinary shares is shares issuable under employee share schemes granted where the exercise price is less than the average price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
A three-for-one bonus share issue was approved at the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 4 May 2001 and 1,222,983,732 ordinary shares of 50 US cents each were allotted to shareholders on the register at that date.
On 11 June 2001, 163,212,568 ordinary shares 40,803,142 pre-bonus shares and 122,409,426 bonus shares arising from the Groups interest in fide Beers were cancelled.
The impact on earnings per share has been included on a prospective basis.
Basic and dilutive earnings per share are also shown based on headline earnings, which the directors believe to be a useful additional measure of the Groups performance.
Headline earnings per share is calculated in accordance with the definition issued by the Institute of Investment Management and Research now Society of Investment Professionals, in Statement of Investment Practice No.

Anglo American plc Annual Report 2002 49 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 22 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Treasury and risk management A discussion of the objectives, policies and strategies of Group Treasury and Risk Management is given in the financial review on page 8.
Summary of the use of derivative instruments by the Group The Group utilises derivative and equity instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
The use of derivative instruments can give rise to credit and market risk.
The Group controls credit risk by entering into derivative contracts only with counterparties who are rated A1 P1, A or better by external rating agencies, or who have received specific internal corporate credit approval.
The use of derivative instruments is subject to limits and the positions are regularly monitored and reported on to senior management.
Market risk is the possibility that future changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices may make a derivative instrument more or less valuable.
Since the Group utilises derivative instruments for risk management, market risk relating to derivative instruments will principally be offset by changes in the valuation of the underlying assets, liabilities or transactions being hedged.
Foreign exchange risk The Group uses forward exchange contracts, currency swaps and option contracts to limit the effects of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
The Group also uses these instruments to hedge future transactions and cash flows.
As at 31 December 2002 the net amount of unrecognised hedging losses on all foreign exchange risk-related instruments, which had been deferred to a period in respect of which an exposure has been hedged, was US$25 million 2001: US$17 million.
Any ultimate gain or loss resulting from these contracts will be recognised when the instruments expire.
Interest rate risk The Group uses interest rate swap and option contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on a portion of its existing debt and short term investments.
The effect of these derivatives is reflected, as appropriate, in interest expense or interest income.
As at 31 December 2002 the net amount of unrecognised hedging gains on all interest rate risk related instruments, which had been deferred to a period in respect of which an exposure has been hedged, was US$4 million 2001: US$8 million.
Commodity price risk The Group uses forward, spot deferred and option contracts to hedge the price risk of certain commodities that it produces, including gold and copper, and in respect of heating oil purchases.
Gains or losses resulting from these activities are recognised concurrently with gains and losses associated with underlying transactions.
The majority of the deferred gains or losses are unrecognised and the ultimate amount of gains or losses to be realised will depend on commodity price movements until the end of the hedged contracts concerned.
The net forward position of AngloGold was 10.28 million ounces priced forward at 31 December 2002, covering periods up to December 2012, with a marked to market value of negative US$447 million at 31 December 2002.
The value was based on a gold price of US$346 oz, exchange rates of US$ ZAR8.53 and US$ AU$1.79 and the prevailing market interest rates and volatilities at the time.
As at 29 January 2003, the marked to market value of the hedge book was a negative US$591 million, based on a gold price of US$363 oz, exchange rates of US$ ZAR8.6 and US$ AU$1.70 and the prevailing market interest rates and volatilities at the time.
Other companies undertake gold hedging which is not material to the Group.
Concentration of credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of current asset investments, debtors and derivative financial instruments.
Given the geographical and business diversity of the Groups debtors, the concentration of credit risk is limited.
In respect of current asset investments and derivative financial instruments, procedures and policies are in place to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty.
The maximum credit risk exposure is limited to fair value see note 22 b below.
Numerical disclosures The disclosure of financial assets and financial liabilities which follows excludes debtors and other current liabilities, as permitted under FRS 13, Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures.

AngloGold North America has US$59 million of reclamation bonds with various federal and governmental agencies, to cover potential environmental obligations.
These obligations are guaranteed by AngloGold Limited.
There are a number of legal or potential claims against the Group, the outcome of which cannot at present be foreseen.
Provision is made for all liabilities which are expected to materialise.
In addition to the amounts relating to Group companies above, under Chilean law, payment of customs duties associated with capital assets can be deferred for up to seven years.
As at 31 December 2002, Collahuasi has potential deferred customs duties of US$40 million.
32 OPERATING LEASES At 31 December 2002, the Group was committed to making the following payments during the next year in respect of operating leases: 2002 2001 Land and Land and US$ million buildings Other buildings Other Expiring within: One year 19 15 14 14 Two to five years 38 41 43 33 After five years 37 11 44 16 94 67 101 63 33 RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans for the majority of its employees.
It also operates postretirement medical arrangements in southern Africa and North America.
The policy for accounting for pensions and post-retirement benefits is included in note 1.
The assets of the defined contribution plans are held separately in independently administered funds.
The charge in respect of these plans is calculated on the basis of contributions payable by the Group in the financial year.
The post-retirement medical arrangements provide health benefits to retired employees and certain dependants.
Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain criteria.
The majority of these plans are unfunded.
The majority of the defined benefit pension plans are funded.
The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group, in independently administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or local practice throughout the world.
The unfunded pension plans are principally in Europe and South America.
The retirement benefit charge for the year is as follows: US$ million 2002 2001 Defined contribution pension plans 99 85 Defined benefit pension plans 55 52 Post-retirement medical plans 17 22 The above defined benefit pension plan cost is comprised of a regular cost of US$47 million and a variation cost of US$8 million.
The Group adopts a straight-line method of amortising unrecognised amounts over the future working lifetimes of employees.
Defined contribution The pension cost represents the actual contributions payable by the Group to the various plans.
At 31 December 2002, there were no material outstanding prepaid contributions, and so no prepayment or accrual has been disclosed in the balance sheet in relation to these plans.
Post-retirement medical plans The accumulated benefit obligation and the annual cost of accrual of benefits are assessed by independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
The accumulated benefit obligation calculated as at 31 December 2002 is US$392 million 2001: US$317 million.
The provision recorded on the balance sheet as at 31 December 2002 amounts to US$363 million 2001: US$264 million.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2002 62 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 33 RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued Defined benefit pension plans Qualified actuaries carried out full valuations over the past three years using the projected unit method.
The actuaries have updated the valuations to 31 December 2002.
The actuary to the majority of the South African pension plans is an employee of the Group, but the actuaries to the other plans are independent of the Group.
At 31 December 2002 the estimated market value of the assets of the funded pension plans was US$2,109 million 2001: US$1,997 million and the market value of the assets was sufficient to cover 89% 2001: 100% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected increases in future earnings and pensions.
In particular, the funding levels of the UK funded pension plans have fallen in the past year as a result of falling asset values.
Companies within the Group are paying contributions as required in accordance with local actuarial advice.
The benefit obligation in respect of the unfunded plans at 31 December 2002 was US$125 million 2001: US$70 million.
To the extent that there is a difference between pension costs and contributions paid, a prepayment or provision arises.
The accumulated difference provided in the balance sheet at 31 December 2002 gives rise to a prepayment of US$168 million 2001: US$155 million and a provision of US$180 million 2001: US$116 million.
Actuarial assumptions The principal assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and pension costs under SSAP 24 are detailed below shown as weighted averages : 2002 2001 Southern The Southern The Africa Americas Europe Africa Americas Europe %%% % % % Average discount rate for plan liabilities 11.5 7.2 5.6 11.6 7.2 5.9 Average rate of inflation 7.4 3.0 2.3 6.8 3.1 2.4 Average rate of increase in salaries 8.5 4.8 3.1 8.2 4.8 3.8 Average rate of increase of pensions in payment 7.3 3.8 2.6 6.5 4.4 2.6 Average long term rate of return on plan assets 11.9 8.2 6.9 11.5 7.9 6.3 Expected average increase in healthcare costs 9.8 6.1 N A 9.9 6.0 N A FRS 17 background In November 2000 the Accounting Standards Board issued FRS 17 Retirement Benefits replacing SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
The full implementation of FRS 17 has been deferred and will now be fully effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005, though certain disclosures are required in the transition period, for periods ending on or after 22 June 2001.
These further disclosures are included below.
Under SSAP 24, the projected unit method was one of the acceptable valuation methods.
Per FRS 17, it is the only acceptable method of valuation.
The pension plans have been valued historically using the projected unit method and so there is no change to the method of valuation of the defined benefit plans.
FRS 17 balance sheet disclosure Under FRS 17, the assumption for the average discount rate for plan liabilities is based on AA corporate bonds of a suitable duration and currency.
The discount rate and other actuarial assumptions are generally the same as for SSAP 24 and are given above.
The market value of the assets in the plans and the long term expected rate of return on the pension plans as at 31 December 2002 are detailed below.
Southern Africa The Americas Europe Total Rate of Fair value Rate of Fair value Rate of Fair value Fair value At 31 December 2002 return % US$ million return % US$ million return % US$ million US$ million Equity 12.9 729 8.9 69 7.8 572 1,370 Bonds 9.7 214 8.1 77 5.3 292 583 Other 9.6 119 3.3 9 6.0 28 156 1,062 155 892 2,109 Present value of pension plan liabilities 1,068 261 1,162 2,491 Deficit in the pension plans 6 106 270 382 Deferred tax 23281 115 Net pension liability 4 74 189 267 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2002 63 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 33 RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued Southern Africa The Americas Europe Total Rate of Fair value Rate of Fair value Rate of Fair value Fair value At 31 December 2001 return % US$ million return % US$ million return % US$ million US$ million Equity 12.6 583 8.0 77 7.1 735 1,395 Bonds 8.7 182 7.6 80 4.9 239 501 Other 8.0 72 3.2 5 6.1 24 101 837 162 998 1,997 Present value of pension plan liabilities 812 211 1,034 2,057 Surplus deficit in the pension plans 25 49 36 60 Surplus restriction 25 25 Deferred tax 15 10 25 Net pension liability 34 26 60 The surplus restriction arises where pension surpluses are not expected to give rise to future contribution reductions or refunds because of the extent of the surplus or because of local restrictions over the use of the surplus.
In particular, the Group is reviewing the impact on the useable surpluses in its South African plans as a consequence of legislation passed in 2001 in South Africa.
The liabilities shown above in respect of South Africa have been increased where applicable based on actuaries estimates of complying with this new legislation.
The net pension liability comprises US$6 million in respect of plans in surplus 2001: US$62 million and US$273 million in respect of plans in deficit 2001: US$122 million.
The net post-retirement medical plan liability arises as follows: 2002 2001 Southern The Southern The US$ million Africa Americas Total Africa Americas Total Present value of post-retirement medical plan liabilities 359 33 392 286 31 317 Deferred tax 108 10 118 86 9 95 Net post-retirement medical plan liability 251 23 274 200 22 222 The Groups provision of anti-retroviral therapy to HIV positive staff has not significantly impacted the post-retirement medical plan liability.
FRS 17 profit and loss account disclosure Had the company adopted FRS 17 early, amounts included in the consolidated profit and loss account for 2002 in respect of defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical plans would have been as follows: PostPension retirement US$ million plans medical plans Total Analysis of the amount charged to operating profit Current service cost 47 6 53 Past service costs 2 2 Curtailments and settlements 12 12 Total operating charge credit 49 8 41 Analysis of the amount charged to other finance income costs Expected return on plan assets 179 179 Interest cost on plan liabilities 182 37 219 Net charge to other finance income 337 40 Total charge to profit and loss account 52 29 81 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2002 64 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 33 RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued FRS 17 Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses STRGL disclosure Amounts included in the consolidated STRGL for 2002 in respect of defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical plans would have been stated as follows: PostPension retirement US$ million plans medical plans Total Difference between actual and expected return on plan assets 370 370 Experience gains arising on plan liabilities 168 29 197 Effects of changes in assumptions underlying the plan liabilities 37 4 33 Total actuarial losses gains recognised in the STRGL 239 33 206 The difference of US$370 million between actual and expected return on plan assets is 18% of the plan assets at 31 December 2002.
The experience gains and losses of US$197 million arising on the plan liabilities represent 7% of the present value of the plan liabilities at 31 December 2002.
The total actuarial loss of US$206 million represents 7% of the present value of the plan liabilities at 31 December 2002.
FRS 17 liability disclosure The movement during 2002 in the FRS 17 pension and post-retirement liability before allowance for deferred tax shown above can be analysed as follows: PostPension retirement US$ million plans medical plans Total As at 1 January 2002 85 317 402 Current service cost 47 6 53 Contributions 51 24 75 Acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries 35 35 Past service costs and effects of settlements and curtailments 2 14 12 Net finance costs 3 37 40 Actuarial losses gains 239 33 206 Currency movements 22 103 125 As at 31 December 2002 382 392 774 Had the company adopted FRS 17 early, the consolidated profit and loss reserve would have been restated as follows: US$ million 2002 2001 Profit and loss reserve at 31 December in the financial statements 12,958 9,567 Less: FRS 17 Retirement benefit reserve 541 282 Add: SSAP 24 balances: 262 157 Prepayment see note 18 168 155 Pension provision see note 23 180 116 Post-retirement medical provision see note 23 363 264 less: attributable deferred tax 113 68 Profit and loss reserve as adjusted 12,679 9,442 The above table does not include a restatement of the charges for pension and post-retirement medical plans in the current year profit and loss account that would arise from the adoption of FRS 17.
The 2001 profit and loss reserve shown above is restated for the impact of FRS 19 see note 1.
Potential volatility of FRS 17 The method for calculating the net pension asset under FRS 17 is likely to lead to volatility in the amount to be included in the balance sheet.
Pension plan liabilities are measured by reference to long term AA bond yields that can move substantially and rapidly according to market conditions.
The plans assets, which principally comprise equities, are also subject to large market swings.

See note 38 below, regarding the disposal of Anglo Americans interest in Anaconda in 2003.
5 All equity interests shown are ordinary shares.
In addition, as at 31 December 2002 Anglo American held: a 9.6% shareholding in Kumba Resources Limited Kumba, which it accounted for as a cost-accounted investment: an option to acquire a further 10.5% of Kumba through its proposed acquisition of Stimela Mining Limited, which was the subject of an application to competition authorities.
This option was implemented in February 2003 see note 38 below : and the right to acquire a further 10.0% of Kumba from Deutsche Securities, subject to Anglo American securing such competition and regulatory approvals as it in its sole discretion determines are required.
Kumba is incorporated in South Africa and is involved in the iron ore extraction industry.
38 EVENTS OCCURRING AFTER END OF YEAR In January 2003 Anglo American announced that it had signed a Pre-Bid Agreement with a wholly-owned subsidiary of MatlinPatterson Global Opportunities Partners LP MatlinPatterson, which subsequently launched a takeover offer for Anaconda.
Anglo American has now disposed of its entire rights entitlement and all of its shareholding in Anaconda for a total consideration of approximately US$17 million.
In January 2003 Anglo Coal German Creek Pty Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Anglo American, agreed to purchase a 70% interest in the Girrah coal deposit in Central Queensland from Wesfarmers Curragh Pty Limited for a cash consideration of US$33 million.
The transaction is subject to the approval of the transfer of the mine development lease and approval by the Environmental Protection Agency EPA.
This is expected to be finalised in the first quarter of 2003.
In February 2003 Anglo American successfully renegotiated its bank borrowings in respect of Lisheen 59% effective interest.
Under the agreement, Anglo American will own 100% of the bank debt and it will also acquire full security over the operation.
In February 2003 Anglo American implemented its option to acquire a further 10.5% of Kumba through Stimela Mining Limited.
As a result, Anglo Americans shareholding in Kumba increased to 20.1% with a further 10.0% awaiting competition and regulatory approvals see note 37 above.
