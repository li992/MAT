The Company has complied with these provisions for the entire reporting period except to the extent specified below.
The Board The Board of Directors held seven full board meetings and two meetings of the independent directors in 2002.
The Board retains full and effective control over the Group and monitors executive management.
It is responsible for overall Group strategy, acquisition and divestment policy, approval of major capital expenditure projects, corporate overhead costs and consideration of significant nancing matters.
No one individual has unfettered powers of decision.
The Chairmans role is non-executive and during 2002 the Chief Executive was supported by two experienced executive directors responsible for operations, development, production, finance and investor relations.
The Board has a further nine non-executive directors with wide experience in commerce, as can be seen from their career histories in this report.
In compliance with the Combined Code, Mr J R W Orange, who is Chairman of each of the Audit and Remuneration Committees, is identied as the Companys senior independent non-executive director.
Matters reserved for Board decision are clearly laid down, including the appointment of the Company Secretary who is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures and rules are applied.
Formal procedures are in place to enable individual Board members to take independent advice where appropriate.
Details of the executive directors service contracts are laid out on page 22.
Re-election of directors In accordance with the Companys Memorandum and Articles of Association one third of directors retire each year, with their re-appointment being subject to the approval of shareholders.
This requires directors to submit themselves for re-election at least every three years, in addition any director of the age of 70 or over who would not otherwise be required to retire, must retire by rotation.
The non-executive directors bring independent judgement to bear on issues of strategy, performance and resources including key appointments and standards of conduct.
Non-executive directors comprise over one half of the Board.
Of these, Sir David John, Messrs S J Dobbie, R V Emerson, I Gray and J R W Orange are considered to be wholly independent.
Whilst the other non-executive directors, as a result of receiving consultancy fees from the Company or their relationship to a shareholder, might be considered not strictly to fall within this denition, the Board considers that this is outweighed by the range of experience and contribution they make to the Company.
Selection of suitable nonexecutive directors is a matter for Board approval following recommendations made by the Nomination Committee.
Board committees The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Remuneration Committee and a Nomination Committee, each of which has formal terms of reference approved by the Board.
An objective and professional relationship is maintained with the auditors, Ernst & Young LLP.
The Audit Committee, comprising only the non-executive directors, meets three times a year for a detailed review of the Groups accounts and its internal controls.
Its members are Mr J R W Orange Chairman, Messrs M A K Alizai, J B Collins II, S J Dobbie, R V Emerson, I Gray, Sir David John and Dato Mohamad Idris Mansor.
The Remuneration Committee normally meets at least three times a year and determines the remuneration of the executive directors and senior employees.
Its members are Mr J R W Orange Chairman, Messrs S J Dobbie, R V Emerson, I Gray and Sir David John.
Full details of the directors remuneration are shown in the Remuneration Report on pages 21 to 27.
The Nomination Committee has been established to consider the composition of the Board in relation to the appointment of new directors.
Its members are Sir David John Chairman, Messrs C J A Jamieson and J R W Orange.
The make up of members of the Audit Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration Committee is in compliance with the Combined Code recommendation.
Internal control The directors are responsible for establishing, maintaining and reviewing the Groups system of internal control.
Internal control systems in any group are designed to meet the particular needs of that group and the risks to which it is exposed, and by their nature can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The key procedures which the directors have established with aview to providing effective internal control are as follows: Management of Business Risks an ongoing process, in accordance with the Turnbull guidance, has been established for identifying, evaluating and managing risks faced by the Group.
This is based on each business unit and corporate function producing a risk matrix which identies the key business risks, the probability of those risks occurring, their impact if they do occur and the actions being taken to manage those risks to the desired level.
17 The directors receive assurance directly from the business units and functional management through the completion of annual declarations conrming compliance with the Groups policies and procedures and risk management processes.
Premier has adopted a consistent framework model for application across the Group and an annual report is produced on compliance with that model and with the group risk management process.
The report is presented to the Audit Committee.
Monitoring A comprehensive control manual is in force which regulates a wide range of day to day activities both in the UK and overseas ofces including environmental controls, health and safety regulations and political risks.
The application of internal control procedures is reviewed during visits to the overseas ofces by head ofce staff.
Audits are carried out by partners in joint ventures from time to time.
A process of business control reviews has been developed and implemented across the Group.
This process is designed to provide assurance to the Board that the Company is embedding effective risk management into its operations.
The report of each review is presented to the Audit Committee.
During 2002 the key business risks identied were formally discussed by the Group Executive Committee on a semi-annual basis.
This process will continue during 2003.
The Board will receive regular reports on any major problems that have occurred and how the risks have changed over the period under review.
Management Structure The Board has overall responsibility for the Group and there is a formal schedule of matters specically reserved for decision by the Board.
Each executive director has been given responsibility for specic aspects of the Groups affairs.
The executive directors together with key senior executives constitute the Executive Committee which normally meets weekly.
Corporate Accounting Responsibility levels are communicated throughout the Group as part of corporate accounting and an authorisation manual which sets out, inter alia, authorisation levels, segregation of duties and other control procedures.
Quality and Integrity of Personnel The integrity and competence of personnel is ensured through high recruitment standards and subsequent training courses.
Budgetary Process There is a comprehensive budgeting system with an annual budget approved by the Board covering capital expenditure, cash ow, the profit and loss account and balance sheet.
Monthly results are reported against budget, and revised forecasts for the year are prepared regularly.
Investment Appraisal The Group has clearly dened procedures for capital expenditure.
These include authority levels, commitment records and reporting, annual budget and detailed appraisal and review procedures.
The authority of the directors is required for key treasury matters including changes to equity and loan nancing, interest rate and foreign currency policy including hedging, oil price hedging, cheque signatories and opening of bank accounts.
Comprehensive due diligence work is carried out if a business or an asset is to be acquired.
During 2002, the Board reviewed the Groups system of internal control and is satisfied that all the controls in place are adequate to provide reasonable assurance against any material misstatement or loss.
The review is conducted on a regular basis and changes are made to internal control systems to capture any new risks or exposures arising as a result of changes to the business or the business environment.
Going concern After making enquiries and in the light of the Groups loan facilities, the Group budget for 2003 and the medium-term plans, the directors have reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future.
The going concern basis for the accounts has therefore continued to be adopted.
Communication with shareholders Communication with shareholders is given significant attention.
Extensive information about the Groups activities is provided in the Annual Report & Accounts and the Interim Report which are sent to shareholders.
The Company has also produced a separate corporate brochure in 2002 and 2003 highlighting Premiers capabilities and business principles, both documents are available to all shareholders.
There is regular dialogue with institutional investors, and enquiries from individuals on matters relating to their shareholding and the business of the Group are welcomed and are dealt with in a timely manner.
All shareholders are encouraged to attend the Annual General Meeting to discuss the progress of the Group.
The Company also maintains a website www.
com which provides detailed information on the Groups activities.

Share capital The Companys Authorised Share Capital is split between Ordinary and Non-Voting Convertible Shares as detailed below: 94,702,182.40 divided into 1,894,043,648 Ordinary Shares of 5 pence each: and 1,810,712.60 divided into 36,214,252 Non-Voting Convertible Shares of 5 pence each.
There were 4,462,510 Ordinary Shares issued under the Companys Share Option Schemes during the year.

The authority given to the directors to allot shares at the 2002 Annual General Meeting was granted for a period of five years.
The 2002 authority may be used, when applicable, for shareholders who wish to take their dividend in shares rather than in cash and for employees who exercise share options.
It may also be used for the acquisition of assets by the Company should appropriate commercial opportunities arise, although at the present time the directors do not have any plans for such issue it is important for your Board to have this exibility.
The number of shares remaining under this authority is 245,149,999 12,257,499.95 in nominal value being 15.40 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company at the date of approval of the accounts.

20 Report of the directors continued Health, Safety, Environment and Security It is the stated policy of the Company to ensure that the impact of its activities on the health and safety of its employees will be reduced to a level that is as low as reasonably practicable, to maintain the security of its personnel and assets and to strive to achieve excellence in environmental standards.
The Company will ensure that its operations meet statutory requirements and that they are carried out with minimal environmental impact.
Over and above its legal responsibilities, the Company commits to protect the health, safety and welfare of all its employees and of all personnel affected by and involved in its activities.
This is in the Companys Health, Safety, Environment and Security HSES management system, which is applied and communicated throughout the Companys operations.
The HSES management system comprises a hierarchical structure of policies, standards, guidelines and procedures to ensure that corporate policies are cascaded throughout the Companys worldwide activities, that sufficient resources are made available within the organisation to achieve effective implementation and that performance is monitored and regularly reviewed.
Charitable contributions During the year the Company made charitable contributions amounting to 19,465 2001: 28,850.
Auditors A resolution to reappoint Ernst & Young LLP as auditors will be put to the Annual General Meeting.
By order of the Board Stephen Huddle Company Secretary 24 March 2003 21 Remuneration report Compliance Throughout 2002 the Company complied with Schedule A of the Combined Code regarding best practice on the design of performance related remuneration.
The Company has given full consideration to the provisions regarding matters to be included in the Remuneration Report set out in Schedule B to the Combined Code.
This remuneration report is being put to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting for an advisory vote.
The remuneration, including pensions and compensation payments, of all executive directors is determined by the Remuneration Committee and ratied by the Board.
The Committee is composed entirely of non-executive directors, Mr J R W Orange, who chairs the Committee and is the Companys senior independent director, Messrs R V Emerson, S J Dobbie, I Gray with effect from 3 December 2002 and Sir David John.
None of the executive directors of the Company are involved in determining their own remuneration.
The Committee consults with the Chief Executive and takes independent advice from Inbucon-Meis, a leading rm of remuneration consultants, which is appointed as an advisor to the Remuneration Committee in respect of executive remuneration and share schemes.
No other person or company materially assisted the Committee during the year.
Remuneration approach The Companys remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages which ensure that directors and senior management are fairly and responsibly rewarded for their contributions.
The main components of executive directors remuneration are basic salary, an annual performance related bonus scheme with a deferred element, benets, longer-term incentives and pension provision.
The remuneration package therefore contains a suitable balance of direct performance related remuneration, which links both the short-term financial performance of the Group and the long-term shareholder return with the executives total remuneration.
The remuneration package is weighted so that the majority of reward may potentially come from the performance related elements of the package.
The Committee endorses the principle of mitigation of damages on early termination of a service contract.
It is the Committees current intention to continue with the above remuneration approach for 2003 and subsequent years although the Committee will keep the matter under review.
The Committees current intention with regard to share options is that they will continue to be part of the executive remuneration and incentivisation package using the existing performance measures.
The Equity Asset Incentive Scheme, which was introduced with shareholders approval in May 2001, will expire at the end of 2003.
The Committee will then consider what type of arrangement is appropriate to replace this scheme and will seek shareholders approval for any new arrangement.
The Companys Articles of Association provide that the remuneration paid to non-executive directors is to be determined by the Board within the limits set by the shareholders.
Performance chart The chart below shows the Companys total shareholder return over the last five financial years compared with the equivalent information in respect of the Oil & Gas Exploration and Production sector, which the Committee considers to be the closest equity market index.
Although the Company underperformed the index in the first three years, it has been ahead of this peer group over the last two years.
Total Shareholder Return Monitoring: Premier vs FTSE Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Premier FTSE Oil & Gas Exploration & Production 100% 80% 60% 40% 20% 0% -20% -40% -60% -80% 1998 1999 2001 2002 2000 Total Shareholder Return 22 Remuneration report continued Contracts of service Details of the contracts of employment for the executive directors are as follows: Director Date of contract Unexpired term Notice period Provision for payment upon early termination C J A Jamieson 15.09.83 24 months None specified J A van der Welle 01.04.99 24 months None specified R T Liddell 04.06.00 12 months None specified Contract terminated on 31 January 2003.
The Committee has previously agreed that the 24 month notice period for Messrs C J A Jamieson and J A van der Welle will not be renegotiated.
However, any executive director appointed in the future will be subject to a notice period not exceeding one year.
The Committee has considered what compensation commitments, including pension contributions, the executive directors contracts would entail in the event of early termination other than for non-performance.
In certain circumstances, the executive directors may receive compensation upon early termination of a contract.
This could amount to two years remuneration for Messrs C J A Jamieson and J A van der Welle, based on basic salary, bonus, benets in kind and pension rights during the notice period.
Mr R T Liddell had a contract of employment with a notice period of termination of 12 months.
Mr Liddells contract was terminated on 31 January 2003 as a result of the restructuring of the Company which was announced in September 2002.
The Company agreed a total termination payment with Mr Liddell of 496,320.80.
Of this amount 141,746 related to his pension entitlement, 285,775 related to his twelve month notice period entitlement plus a redundancy payment equal to one months salary for each year of completed service and 50,000 related to his entitlement to a performance related bonus.
Non-executive directors do not currently have contracts with a xed-term duration.
The Company intends to review this position by the end of the next financial year.
Remuneration structure The remuneration package for the executive directors comprises base salary, benets, bonus, pension, entitlement to participate in the Companys all employee share schemes and long-term executive share schemes.
Base salary Base salary is reviewed each year against other comparable companies in the oil sector and general market data on the basis of companies in similar industries and those of a similar size.
The object is to ensure that the base salary, when taken together with the rest of the package, provides a competitive but performance driven remuneration package.
The base salaries of the executive directors are currently positioned between the median and the upper quartile.
While salary is reviewed by reference to market conditions, the performance of the Company and the performance of the individual, the Committee would not regard this element of remuneration as directly performance related.
Audited numbers 23 Annual bonus scheme The annual bonus, which is non pensionable, consists of a cash payment of up to 50 per cent of salary immediately providing certain performance conditions are met and a deferred annual bonus of up to 50 per cent of salary for the same performance conditions.
Payment of the deferred part of the bonus is payable in shares and deferred for three years.
The deferred element of the bonus is contingent upon the beneciaries remaining in employment for the three years from the date of the award, but is not dependent on any further performance related measures.
The performance measure for the annual bonus scheme for 2002 was a combination of financial and non-financial measures.
The financial measure upon which up to 50 per cent of the maximum bonus was dependent, was based upon actual cash ow against a target which was set before the start of the year by the Remuneration Committee.
The non-financial measures were the achievement of progress toward the strategic intent of the business as set and determined by the Remuneration Committee upon which up to 40 per cent of the maximum bonus was dependent and second, health, safety and environmental targets upon which up to 10 per cent of the maximum bonus was dependent.
The annual bonus scheme for the 2003 financial year has the same structure and maximum award level.
The performance measures are financial and non financial with 60 per cent being based upon achievement of key targets in exploration and portfolio management, 30 per cent based upon actual cashow against a target and 10 per cent based upon health, safety and environmental targets.
Benets The executive directors receive the benefit of a car fully expensed by the Company together with petrol cost and medical insurance.
Messrs Marican and Chaloner, who both resigned during the year 2002, also waived their fees of 25,000 per annum.
3,600 of Mr van der Welles remuneration relates to a salary supplement as part of his pension arrangements.
Mr R J Lascelles retired from the Company on 16 May 2001.
Mr M A K Alizai was paid US$116,600 2001: US$116,600 for advisory services undertaken for the Group outside the UK.
Mr R V Emerson joined the Company on 12 March 2001.
Benets in kind represent car and fuel benets and medical insurance.

Mr Liddells award relating to 2002 will be paid entirely in cash under the terms of his termination agreement.
Market price of total shares released as at 1 February 2003 was 107,328.
Pension Schemes Mr C J A Jamieson is a member of the Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benets Plan the Scheme.
The Scheme is a funded Inland Revenue approved final salary scheme which provides a pension of up to two-thirds salary at the normal pension age of 60.
Benets are actuarially reduced on early retirement before age 60 and pensions in payment increase in line with the lower of ination or 5 per cent per annum.
The Company has agreed to provide Messrs R T Liddell and J A van der Welle with a pension substantially as if they were contributing members of the Scheme, not subject to the earnings cap.
For life insurance purposes, Messrs R T Liddell and J A van der Welle are members of the Scheme.
The accrued pension entitlement of these directors are as follows: a b c d Increase from Accrued Transfer value in Accrued Transfer value in d to b less pension at respect of a as at pension at respect of c as at contributions paid by 31 December 2002 31 December 2002 31 December 2001 31 December 2001 director during 2002 000 000 000 000 000 C J A Jamieson 172.9 2,577.3 152.5 2,294.0 265.9 R T Liddell 8.6 98.9 4.9 62.9 24.9 J A van der Welle 13.3 93.2 9.3 85.9 3.8 Notes: 1 The amounts of accrued pension under a and c represent the deferred pension entitlements of the director as at the stated dates.
2 The transfer values under b and d have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the guidance note GN11: Retirement benefit Schemes Transfer Values issued by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries.
3 The values stated in respect of Messrs R T Liddell and J A van der Welle correspond with the target level of their final salary pension provision: in practice, the pension benets for these directors are established through individual money purchase arrangements.
The following payments were paid to former directors of the Company in respect of unfunded pension liabilities: 2002 Unfunded 2001 Unfunded Pension Liabilities Pension Liabilities J A Heath 26,772 26,586 R J Lascelles 25,109 15,737 R C Shaw 82,388 81,815 Payments made May December.
Members of the Scheme have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benets are included in the above table.
Share Option Schemes audited The Company believes that share ownership by executive directors and senior executives strengthens the link between their personal interests and those of shareholders.
The Company currently operates three share option schemes.
The Scheme of Arrangement has affected two of these schemes.
In addition, and because of the effect of the Scheme of Arrangement, the Company has adopted two new share option schemes to replace the Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 and the Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1999.
25 Executive Share Option Scheme 1985 Share options awarded under this scheme can be exercised at the holders discretion between three and ten years after being awarded.
After ten years the options expire.
No grant of options under this scheme has taken place since 1994.
The Scheme of Arrangement has not affected this scheme because all outstanding options are already exercisable.
Mr C J A Jamieson held four options under this scheme during the financial year.
These are listed in the table below under directors interests in share options.
These options have become exercisable without the need to fulll a performance requirement.
This is because the scheme was introduced and approved by shareholders at a time when performance criteria were not required by shareholders.
Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 Options granted under the 1995 scheme are normally exercisable not less than three years after their date of grant and will lapse unless previously exercised on their tenth anniversary.
Options cannot be exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved.
For options granted prior to 2000, the performance requirement was that the share price plus the value of dividends paid must, measured at the end of any consecutive three year period, have grown at a rate equal to or greater than the Oil Exploration and Production Index over the same period.
These options are exercisable now and until six months after the Court approves the Scheme of Arrangement or the option holder may roll over the option into options over shares of the new company.
Options granted during and after 2000 are dependent upon growth in the Companys earnings per share of at least 3 per cent per annum compound above the retail price index over a three-year period.
The Committee believes that this is a challenging performance measure that in the long-term should reect a good shareholder return.
The options may be exercised within six months of the Court approving the Scheme of Arrangement or the options may be rolled over into options over shares of the new company.
Where the option holder elects to rollover his options the performance criteria will continue to apply.
Messrs C J A Jamieson, R T Liddell and J A van der Welle held options under this scheme during the financial year.
The companies in the group consisted of Cairn Energy plc, Dana Petroleum plc, Paladin Resources plc, Premier Oil plc, Soco International plc, Tullow Oil plc and Venture Production plc.
26 Remuneration report continued The market price of the Companys shares at 31 December 2002 was 29p 31 December 2001: 16.75p and the range during 2002 was 16.75p 29p.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1999 Under this scheme, approved by shareholders on 18 May 1999, employees including executive directors with six months or more continuous service are invited, within a period of 42 days of the announcement of the annual and interim results, to join the scheme.
Employees may save between 5 and 250 per month, through payroll deduction for a period of three or five years, after which time they can acquire shares at a discount of up to 20 per cent of the market value set at the time of invitation.
Mr C J A Jamieson, 1st invitation 1999 : Mr Jamieson contracted to save 250 per month over a three year period, which on full term entitled him to exercise options over 64,583 shares.
These options were granted on 21 July 1999 at a discount of 20 per cent of the market value set at the time of the invitation to apply for options and were exercised on 20 September 2002.
The mid-market value of an ordinary share on the date of exercise was 24.5p.
Mr J A van der Welle, 2nd invitation 2000 : Mr van der Welle contracted to save 250 per month over a three year period, which if he saves for the full term will entitle him to exercise options over 86,495 shares.
These options were granted on 24 April 2000 at a discount of 20 per cent of the market value set at the time of invitation to apply for the options.
Each option is exercisable at 11.2p and can be exercised following the Court approving the Scheme of Arrangement or between l June 2003 and 31 December 2003 if the options are rolled over.
Mr R T Liddell, 4th invitation 2002 : Mr Liddell contracted to save 250 per month over a three year period, which if he had saved for the full term would have entitled him to exercise options over 52,197 shares.
These options were granted on 23 April 2002 at a discount of 20 per cent of the market value set at the time of invitation to apply for the options.
Each option is exercisable at 18.2p and following Mr Liddells redundancy can be exercised during the period 1 February and 31 July 2003.
Gains made on all directors share options Mr C J A Jamieson exercised an option in accordance with the Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1999 as follows: Number of shares Date of exercise Exercise price Market value Gain on exercise Total gain 64,583 29.09.02 15p 24.5p 9.5p per share 6,135 No other director exercised options in 2002 2001: Nil for all directors.
Premier Oil plc Executive Equity and Asset Incentive Scheme The Executive Equity and Asset Incentive Scheme is a one-off scheme in which the executive directors, as well as some 30 other executives participate.
The scheme is designed to reward an improvement in the asset value of the business and the market value of the Company over athree year period.
The scheme therefore has two bonus pools, each pool being dependent upon one of the following two performance measures.
The equity bonus pool is created by comparing the market value calculated by reference to the average share price for the three months prior to the start of the period 16 May 2001 with the market value similarly calculated three years later.
The asset bonus pool is based upon the increase in the appraised net asset value of the business over a three year period, from the start of 2001 to the end of 2003.
In either case there is no bonus pool unless there has been an increase in the relevant performance measure of at least 12 per cent compound per annum over a three year period.
When a growth of 12 per cent compound per annum has been achieved then a bonus pool is created which is equal to 1 per cent of the increase in that measure.
When the growth is 25 per cent or more compound per annum, then a bonus pool is created which is equal to 2.5 per cent of the increase in that measure.
Between the above two points a proportionate calculation is undertaken.
The Committee believes that the asset value and the market value of the businesses are good short and long-term indicators of corporate performance and should reect rewards only when the shareholders have also received reward.
In addition, vesting under either pool is dependent upon the Remuneration Committee being satisfied that there has been an improvement in the performance of the Company over the three year period.
27 The bonus pools are then distributed up to 33 per cent to the executive directors, 40 per cent to other executives and the remainder on a discretionary basis.
The individual participation is calculated according to a points system, the points being referred to as participation points.
Each participant has been awarded a number of participation points and these are compared to the aggregate number of participation points awarded for the purposes of calculating the individuals entitlement to part of any bonus pool.
Mr C J A Jamieson was granted 290 participation points and Messrs J A van der Welle and R T Liddell were both awarded 190 participation points in the executive directors pool on 16 July 2001.
The benets under the scheme are paid half in cash and half in shares by dividing the cash value by the share price on the day prior to release of the award.
The cash payment shall be released in 2004.
The shares have an additional holding period of six months.
As part of the termination agreed with Mr R T Liddell, it was agreed that awards made to him under the scheme will vest in their entirety, and outstanding awards shall vest and be released without deduction on a pro rata basis, at Mr Liddells option at the date of completion of the restructuring of the Company or the normal vesting date and otherwise in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
Awards under this scheme will vest subject to performance up to the date of the Scheme of Arrangement.
The participants may in effect roll over their awards under the scheme to reect the restructuring of the Company.
Messrs C J A Jamieson and J A van der Welle have already confirmed to the Remuneration Committee that they intend to follow this course of action.
Premier Oil plc Share Incentive Plan audited Under this plan, employees may make contributions to acquire shares in the Company Partnership Shares.
In addition to the Partnership Shares, the Board has awarded a number of shares to each employee being an outright award of shares Free Shares, and or if an employee agrees to buy a certain number of Partnership Shares, the Company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares Matching Shares, on a one for one basis.
In the case of the award of Free Shares and Matching Shares the Company has not required performance criteria to be fullled, as the purpose of the plan was to allow all employees to become shareholders in the Company.
The Company made an award of Free Shares to all Company employees in the UK and overseas on 8 February 2002 of 526 shares per employee.
These shares will be held in a trust for a period of three years after which each director may either hold the shares in his name, or sell them provided the director is in employment at the end of the three year period.
The Company invited all UK employees to make contributions to acquire Partnership Shares on a monthly basis beginning in February 2002.
Messrs R T Liddell and J A van der Welle contributed the maximum monthly amount of 125 to the Plan, shares being purchased from June 2002.
The shares stated below will be held in this Plan until the shares are due to be released.
A new plan to allow for the future acquisition of Partnership Shares and Matching Shares will then be put into operation following the Court approving the Scheme of Arrangement.
Shares held beneficially by the directors under this plan were as follows: Total Partnership Shares Total Matching Shares purchased in 2002 in the awarded on a one for one Free Shares awarded on market on a monthly basis basis and purchased in the 08.02.02 at 19p vesting at prices between 20p and market between 20p and on 08.02.05 29p vesting in 2005 29p vesting in 2005 C J A Jamieson 526 R T Liddell 526 4,125 4,125 J A van der Welle 526 5,034 5,034 Approved by the Board 24 March 2003 28 Statement of directors responsibilities Company law requires the directors to prepare accounts for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group as at the end of the financial year: and the profit and loss account shall give a true and fair view of the profit or loss of the Company and of the Group for the financial year.

Entities in which the Group holds an interest on a long-term basis and are jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other venturers under a contractual arrangement are treated as joint ventures.
In the Group accounts Premiers proportion of operating profit or loss, exceptional items, interest, taxation, gross assets and gross liabilities of the joint ventures are included gross equity method.
Turnover Turnover represents the sales value of the Groups share of petroleum production during the year.
Revenue receivable under take-or-pay gas sales contracts in respect of undelivered volumes is accounted for as deferred income.
Fixed assets a Capitalisation of oil and gas expenditure The Group follows the full cost method of accounting under which all expenditure relating to the acquisition, exploration, appraisal and development of oil and gas interests is capitalised in one of six cost pools: UK, Southern Europe, Far East, Pakistan, Australia and International.
Proceeds on disposal of an interest are credited to the relevant cost pool.
Intangible xed assets consisting of expenditure on significant new exploration areas and licences are excluded from the capitalised tangible cost pools pending determination of commercial reserves.
Capitalised exploration expenditure is carried forward until either it is declared part of a commercial development or the licence area is abandoned, at which point the relevant total is transferred to the relevant tangible cost pool.
Where there are no development and producing assets within the cost pool, the transferred exploration costs are charged immediately to the profit and loss account.
The nancing cost of borrowings in respect of a eld development and related foreign exchange gains and losses are capitalised until production commences from that eld.
b Depreciation Amortisation of expenditure held in each tangible cost pool is provided using the unit of production method based on entitlement to proved and probable reserves of oil and gas and estimated future development expenditure expected to be incurred to access these reserves.
Changes in reserves are accounted for prospectively.
Pipeline assets are depreciated on a unit of throughput basis.
Depreciation on other xed assets is provided on a straight line basis to write them off over their estimated useful lives but not exceeding five years.
c Impairment of value An estimate of the discounted future net revenues is made where there are indications of impairment and compared to the net capitalised expenditure held in each cost pool.
Where, in the opinion of the directors, there is an impairment, tangible asset values are written down accordingly through the profit and loss account.
Decommissioning Provision for decommissioning is recognised in full at the commencement of oil and gas production.
The amount recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditure.
A corresponding tangible xed asset is also created at an amount equal to the provision.
This is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the production facilities.
Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is reected as an adjustment to the provision and the xed asset.
Stores, crude oil and products These are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Under and over lifts of crude oil and stocks relating to production are recorded at market value.
31 Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more tax, with the following exceptions: Provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Petroleum taxes are provided on a unit of production basis over the estimated remaining life of each producing eld.
The total tax for each producing eld is calculated after deducting all expenditure incurred on that eld.
Deferred petroleum taxes are provided for on the difference between the amount of tax calculated on the unit of production basis and current tax payable.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the period end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the period end.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rate subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
For the purposes of consolidation the closing rate method is used under which translation gains and losses on the opening net assets of overseas undertakings are shown as a movement in reserves.
profit and loss accounts of overseas undertakings and foreign branches are translated at the average exchange rate for the period.
Exchange differences on foreign currency loans, to the extent that they relate to investments in operations accounted for in foreign currencies, are taken to reserves.
Pension costs The cost of providing pension benets is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of service of employees.
Royalties Royalties are charged as production costs to the profit and loss account in the period in which the related production is accounted for.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments Rentals payable for assets under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives to manage its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and oil price uctuations.

Such gains would become taxable only if the assets were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief.
The total amount not provided is 3.6 million 2001: 3.6 million.
At present, it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
7 Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit after tax and on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.

The pension costs for the Scheme are determined with the advice of an independent qualied actuary.
The last formal valuation was undertaken as at 1 January 2002 using the attained age method and market related funding assumptions.
The market value of the Scheme assets was 7.9 million.
On the method and the assumptions adopted at the time, the assets covered 89 per cent of the members accrued benets based on projected pensionable salaries.
The employers contribution rate to the Scheme was increased from 22.3 per cent to 26.0 per cent of pensionable salaries with effect from January 2003 and a lump sum contribution of 0.9 million was also paid during the year.
The impact of the lump sum contribution will be spread over the future working lifetime of the Schemes active members.
Based upon the method and assumptions adopted for the valuation, the new contribution rate was projected to eliminate the deficit over the future working lifetime of the Schemes active membership.
The ratio of the Schemes assets to its liabilities under the Minimum Funding Requirement MFR was 92 per cent as at 1 January 2002.
The principal financial assumptions adopted for this actuarial valuation were: % Rate of investment return 6.8% pa Rate of salary increases 4.5% pa Rate of pension increases 2.5% pa The following gures have been prepared in compliance with the transitional provisions of FRS 17 Retirement Benets by a qualied independent actuary on the basis of the membership data current as at 31 December 2002.

In practice, the Scheme invests in both equities and bonds and the future funding of the Scheme will continue to have regard to the statutory obligations in respect of the MFR and to conventional funding assessments.
In respect of the former, the Scheme actuary has confirmed his opinion that the ratio of the Schemes assets to its liabilities under the MFR at 31 December 2002 was 100 per cent.
No payments were made in respect of unfunded pensions other than those disclosed in the remuneration report on pages 21 to 27.
Total payments made to date in respect of these unfunded pension contributions, including those made during 2002, were 807,154.
At 31 December 2002, the remaining obligation for accrued benets in respect of unfunded pensions based on the same actuarial assumptions used for the Scheme is estimated to be 1.6 million 2001: 1.4 million.
