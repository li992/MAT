In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are required to: Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: Make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: Comply with applicable accounting standards, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and of the Group and which enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that they have complied with these requirements and, having a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
