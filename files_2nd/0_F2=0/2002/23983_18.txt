Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the capital reserve, or in the revenue account depending on whether the gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature respectively.

Financial instruments The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares primarily in Japan.
These are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies: Bank loans denominated in Japanese Yen, for which the main purpose is to raise finance for the Companys operations: Short-term debtors, creditors and cash amounts arising directly from its operations: Derivative transactions principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts the purpose of which is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Companys investment activities: As an investment trust, the Company invests in securities for the long-term.
Accordingly it is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Companys policy that no short-term trading in investments or other financial instruments shall be undertaken.
34 Fleming Japanese Notes to the Accounts continued 17.
Financial instruments continued The main risks attached to the Companys financial instruments are market price risks which incorporate both foreign currency and interest rate risks.
Acceptance of these risks is a clear part of the Companys business as an investment trust and the Boards policy for managing these risks are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the year to which these financial statements relate.
Market Price Risk Market risk arises from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
The Boards principal control is to ensure that equity and other investments held within the portfolio are appropriately diversified across companies and industry sectors and it meets regularly each year to consider and monitor the position.
An individual fund manager has responsibility for monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Interest Rate Risk The Company borrows at fixed and floating rates of interest and uses interest rate swaps to generate both the desired interest rate profile and to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Foreign Currency Risk The Company has an exposure to foreign currency as part of the risk reward inherent from a company that invests overseas.
The income and capital value of the Companys investments can be affected by exchange rate movements as most of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling which is the Companys reporting currency.
The Board has identified four principal areas where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: movements in rates affect the value of investments: movements in rates affect the value of loans: movements in rates affect short-term timing differences: and movements in rates affect the income received.
The Company may be subject to short-term exposure to exchange rate movement, for instance where there is a difference between the date an investment purchase or sale is entered into and the date when settlement of the proceeds occurs.
Liquidity Risk The Companys assets comprise mainly realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
Fleming Japanese 35 Notes to the Accounts continued Currency Exposures An analysis of the Companys net currency assets and liabilities at 30th September is: 2002 2001 1 1 m m Investments 352.1 484.1 Net current assets liabilities 6.2 25.8 2 Unrealised profit on closed currency hedge contracts 6.9 11.2 Unrealised profit on open currency hedge contracts 11.5 Long term loans 18.3 87.3 Financial instruments outstanding at year end 346.9 393.7 1 These are Yen exposures which are expressed in sterling terms.
2 On 8th November 2001 the Company purchased Yen 13.5 million against sterling to close the currency hedge contract of Yen 13.5 million against sterling for the same settlement date.
Interest Rate Risk Profile of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The majority of the Companys financial assets are equity shares or other investments which neither pay interest nor have a maturity date.
Liabilities After taking into account the various interest rate swaps entered into by the Company, the analysis of the Companys financial liabilities at 30th September is: 2002 2001 1,2 1,2 m m Fixed rate liabilities 22.5 49.3 Floating rate liabilities 18.3 62.7 40.8 112.0 1 Short-term creditors have been excluded from these disclosures with the exception of the Yen 4.32bn loan 2001: Yen 4.32bn loan.
2 These are Yen exposures which are expressed in sterling terms.
The interest characteristics of the fixed rate liabilities are as follows: Weighted average interest rate 3.41% 3.28% Average period for which interest rate is fixed !
2 year 1 year The floating rate liabilities bear interest at rates based on Japanese Yen Libor and comprise: Yen 3.5bn committed facility Further details regarding maturity can be found in notes 9 and 10 on page 31.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments Financial assets and liabilities are included in the balance sheet at values which represent fair values except in respect of the items disclosed below.
The fair value of the loans, which are stated after the effect of interest rate swaps, have been calculated by estimating the cost of breaking the interest rate swap.
