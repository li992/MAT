Turnover between segments is not material.
Analyses by class of business are based on the groups divisional structure.
During 2002 reporting responsibility for N&N, a cheque cashing business, was transferred from the motor insurance division to UK home credit.
As a result, the turnover, operating profit and net assets for UK home credit in 2002 include 2,405,000 of turnover, 21,000 of operating profit and 884,000 of net liabilities in respect of N&N.
In 2001, N&Ns turnover, operating loss and net liabilities of 1,680,000, 16,000 and 899,000 respectively were included in motor insurance.
The 2001 figures have not been restated as the impact is not material.
Yes Car Credit was acquired on 18 December 2002.
Its post acquisition trading results were not significant and therefore in accordance with the requirements of FRS 3 Reporting Financial Performance, have not been disclosed as a separate column in the groups profit and loss account.
Following the acquisition, the group injected an additional 45 million of share capital into Yes Car Credit.
There is no material difference between the geographical analysis of turnover by location and destination.

In 2002, the company changed its definition of adjusted earnings per share to exclude exceptional items and goodwill amortisation as, following the disposal of Colonnade Insurance Brokers and the acquisition of Yes Car Credit, it is the directors opinion, that this measure better represents underlying business performance.
The adjusted earnings per share figures for 2002 and 2001, based on the 2001 definition, are shown below: 2002 2001 2002 Earnings 2001 Earnings Earnings per share Earnings per share 000 pence 000 pence Adjusted earnings and earnings per share as disclosed in 2001 Annual Report and Accounts 118,586 48.66 127,495 51.89 Profits of Colonnade Insurance Brokers, net of tax 700 0.29 1,079 0.44 Exceptional loss on disposal of Colonnade Insurance Brokers Limited 10,700 4.39 Adjusted earnings and earnings per share based on 2001 definition 128,586 52.76 126,416 51.45 The weighted average number of shares in issue during the year can be reconciled to the number used in the basic, adjusted and diluted earnings per share calculations as follows: 2002 2001 Weighted average number of shares Number Number In issue during the year 245,713,032 248,147,454 Held by the QUEST 2,027,669 2,456,807 Used in basic and adjusted earnings per share calculations 243,685,363 245,690,647 Issuable on exercise of outstanding options 812,670 1,546,712 Used in diluted earnings per share calculation 244,498,033 247,237,359 7 Directors remuneration Details of directors remuneration, share options, pension contributions and pension entitlements are included in the directors remuneration report on pages 11 to 17.

P. A.
Holdings Limited and fide Facto 946 Limited, the holding companies of the group of companies which operate Yes Car Credit.
Acquisition accounting has been adopted and consequently goodwill on the acquisition has been capitalised as an intangible asset in the balance sheet and is being amortised over a period of 20 years.
In the opinion of the directors the period of 20 years is a reasonable estimate of the useful economic life of the investment.
An analysis of the provisional book value and fair value of the net liabilities acquired is as follows: Provisional Provisional Provisional fair value fair value book value adjustment to the group 000 000 000 Fixed assets 3,871 3,871 Stock 10,321 10,321 Car finance receivables 161,986 161,986 Other assets 19,550 1,787 21,337 Cash at bank and in hand 615 615 Creditors falling due within one year 50,713 5,957 56,670 Creditors falling due after more than one year 153,263 153,263 Net liabilities at acquisition 7,633 4,170 11,803 Consideration: Cash, including costs paid by 31 December 46,093 Accrued costs 4,730 Loan notes issued to vendors note 15 e 6,910 Contingent consideration note 21 12,785 Total consideration 70,518 Goodwill arising on acquisition note 10 82,321 The fair value adjustment relates to a provision in respect of a fixed interest rate swap relating to the underlying borrowings of Yes Car Credit that had a fair value at the date of acquisition of a loss of 5,957,000, together with the related deferred tax thereon of 1,787,000.
Reconciliation to cash flow statement: 000 Cash, including costs paid by 31 December 46,093 Less: cash acquired 615 Cash outflow per cash flow statement 45,478 Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the group may make contingent consideration payments, payable primarily on 30 June 2004 or, if the vendors so elect, on 30 June 2005 partly in cash and partly in loan notes to i the senior management of Yes Car Credit and ii the institutional vendors.
The contingent consideration payments will be based on the average of the adjusted audited profits after tax of the Yes Car Credit business for the years ending 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2003 Average Adjusted Profits after Tax AAPAT as defined in the acquisition agreement.
i The contingent consideration payment to the senior management of Yes Car Credit will be calculated as 2.58 times the AAPAT, with a cap of 50 million which amount would only be payable if the AAPAT were to equal or exceed 19.38 million.
ii The contingent consideration payment to the institutional vendors will be calculated as 6.0 times the surplus of the AAPAT over 3.23 million, with a cap of 38 million which amount would only be payable if the AAPAT were to equal or exceed 9.57 million.
Initial estimates of the contingent consideration will be revised as further and more certain information becomes available with corresponding adjustments to goodwill.

The pro forma operating profit for Yes Car Credit for the year ended 31 December 2001 and period ended 18 December 2002 was 3.0 million and 6.6 million respectively.
This pro forma profit has been calculated assuming that Yes Car Credit was owned by the group for the entire period.
In calculating this pro forma profit, the operating profit loss shown in the table above has been adjusted to incorporate the benefit that Yes Car Credit would have had in those periods, had it had access to the lower funding costs of the group.

In accordance with FRS 13, these are defined as borrowings which have their interest rates reset at least once a year.
In practice, the group typically draws down on its borrowing facilities for periods of between three and six months.
The weighted average interest rate on sterling fixed rate borrowings at 31 December 2002 amounted to 7.04% 2001 6.65% and the weighted average period to maturity was 4.4 years 2001 3.7 years.
The weighted average interest rate on Polish zloty fixed rate borrowings at 31 December 2002 amounted to 10.59% 2001 15.93% and the weighted average period to maturity was 1.6 years 2001 1.9 years.

The floating rate borrowings bear interest at rates linked to relevant national LIBOR equivalents.
The group also has creditors due after more than one year, comprising trade creditors of 9,151,000 2001 nil and contingent consideration of 12,785,000 2001 nil.
These amounts are denominated in sterling and are non-interest bearing.

The remaining 141,915,000 of fixed rate sterling assets relate to net amounts receivable from customers falling due in more than one year.
The weighted average interest rate on these balances at 31 December 2002 was 23.8%.
The floating rate financial assets bear interest at rates linked to relevant national LIBOR equivalents.
c Fair values The fair values and book values of the groups financial instruments by category at 31 December 2002 are set out below: 2002 2001 Book Fair Book Fair value value value value 000 000 000 000 Primary financial instruments held to finance the groups operations: Current asset investments 503,796 503,796 430,621 430,621 Cash at bank and in hand 48,474 48,474 44,623 44,623 Debtors falling due in more than one year 141,915 141,915 9,614 9,614 Bank loans and overdrafts 657,098 657,098 454,747 454,747 US$ loan notes 61,453 54,625 61,453 60,523 Contingent consideration due after more than one year 12,785 12,785 Trade creditors due after more than one year 9,151 9,151 Derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest and currency profile: Currency swap re US$ loan notes 5,067 1,484 Forward foreign exchange contracts contracts in profit 101 contracts in loss 549 Other currency swaps contracts in profit 160 contracts in loss 3,813 8,704 Interest rate swaps on borrowings contracts in profit contracts in loss 10,644 5,773 Interest rate swaps on investments contracts in profit 14,320 7,455 contracts in loss 193 Cash settled commodity contracts 15,083 15,083 Interest rate caps 70 193 4 The deferred losses on these currency swaps are mainly offset by the deferred gains on their underlying liabilities the US$ loan notes.
The cash settled commodity contracts consist of two contracts, the net effect of which results in the company having received 14,997,000 during 2002 and repaying a guaranteed net 16,046,000 during 2003.
In accordance with FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions the contracts have been accounted for as a loan.
Market values have been used to determine the fair values of the groups financial instruments.
d Hedging instruments The following table shows the extent to which the group has unrecognised and deferred gains and losses, in respect of financial instruments used as hedges, at the beginning and end of the year.
All gains and losses on the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged transactions or positions.
Provident Financial | Annual Report and Accounts 2002 39 Notes to the accounts continued 16 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued d Hedging instruments continued The US$ loan notes, which are fully hedged by a currency swap arrangement, are translated at the forward rate inherent in the contract.
Consequently, the carrying value of the loan effectively includes the gain or loss on the hedging instrument, which is treated as deferred for the purpose of the table below: Unrecognised Deferred Total net Total net Gains Losses gains losses Gains Losses gains losses Gains and losses on hedging instruments 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 1 January 2002 7,619 15,224 7,605 930 930 Arising in previous years that were recognised in 2002 5,600 9,416 3,816 Arising in previous years not recognised in 2002 2,019 5,808 3,789 930 930 Arising in 2002 12,402 7,437 4,965 5,898 5,898 Gains and losses on hedging instruments at 31 December 2002 14,421 13,245 1,176 6,828 6,828 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2003 7,235 10,960 3,725 Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2004 or later 7,186 2,285 4,901 6,828 6,828 e Currency exposures As explained in the groups accounting policy, exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net assets of subsidiary undertakings and branches, which have currencies of operation other than sterling, net of any matching exchange differences on related foreign currency loans taken out to hedge overseas investments, are taken to reserves, together with the differences arising when the profit and loss accounts are translated at average rates and compared with rates ruling at the year end.
The table below shows the extent to which group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their functional currency.
Foreign exchange differences on the retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account of the group subsidiary concerned and the group.

The two major schemes, which cover 99% of scheme members, are of the funded, defined benefit type.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate, trustee administered funds.
The total pension cost for the group note 8 b was assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The latest actuarial valuations for the schemes were as at 1 January 2001 for the Provident Financial Senior Pension Scheme Senior Scheme and 1 June 2001 for the Provident Financial Staff Pension Scheme Staff Scheme.
The principal assumptions used were that the rate of return on investments would be 2.1% per annum higher than the rate of increase in salaries for the Staff Scheme and 1.1% higher for the Senior Scheme, and 4.1% and 3.6% per annum higher than the rate of increase in present and future pensions for the Staff Scheme and Senior Scheme respectively.
At the valuation dates the market value of the assets of the schemes was 181,100,000.
The market value of the assets was sufficient to cover 87% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
For the purposes of establishing the pension costs in the groups profit and loss account, the deficit is being amortised over the average remaining service lives of the employees who are currently members of the respective schemes.
Included in the groups balance sheet is a prepayment of 11,451,000 2001 5,661,000, which represents the excess of the contributions paid to the schemes over the charge in the profit and loss account.
Provident Financial | Annual Report and Accounts 2002 45 Notes to the accounts continued 30 Pension schemes continued b FRS 17 disclosures As noted above, the group operates two major defined benefit schemes in the UK.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out by a qualified independent actuary at 1 January 2001 on the Senior Scheme and as at 1 June 2001 on the Staff Scheme.
The valuation used in the FRS 17 disclosures has been based on these valuations which have been updated by the actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2002.
Scheme assets are stated at market value at 31 December 2002.
