44 44 Cambridg Cambridge e Antibody Antibody T Technolo echnolog gy y Gr Group plc oup plc Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies A summary of the principal accounting policies is set out below.
These have all been applied consistently throughout the periods covered by this report.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards in the United Kingdom UK GAAP.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Cambridge Antibody Technology Group plc the Company and its subsidiary undertakings collectively the Group, drawn up to 30 September each year.
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.
The acquisition of Cambridge Antibody Technology Limited CAT Limited, by way of share for share exchange on 20 December 1996 was accounted for as a group reconstruction in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 6.
Consequently, consolidated financial information is presented as if the Company has always owned CAT Limited.
Otherwise, the results of subsidiaries acquired are consolidated for the periods from the date on which control passed.
Such acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method.
The results of subsidiaries disposed of are consolidated up to the date on which control passed.
The profit for the financial year dealt with in the financial statements of the Company was 3,090,000 2001: 7,838,000.
As provided by S. 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no company only profit and loss account is presented in respect of the Company.
Goodwill Goodwill, representing the excess of fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised as an asset on the balance sheet.
On disposal of a previously acquired business, the attributable amount of goodwill previously written off to reserves under the then applicable accounting policy is included in determining the profit or loss on disposal.
Turnover Turnover principally consists of income received in the normal course of business from license fees, technical milestones, clinical milestones, fees for research and development services, payments for purchased rights, and royalties.
These are stated net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
A description of the various elements of turnover and their accounting policies is given below.
Licence fees Licence fees are deferred and recognised over the period of the licence term or the period of the associated research and development agreement where relevant.
In circumstances where no such defined period exists, the licence fee is deferred and recognised over the period to expiration of the relevant patents licenced.
For licence fees where a proportion of the fee is creditable against research and development services to be provided in the future that proportion of the amount received is deferred and recognised over the period during which the services are rendered.
Technical milestones During certain research and development programs the Group receives non-refundable milestone payments when it achieves certain defined technical criteria.
Such milestones are recognised based on the percentage of completion of the relevant research and development program subject to the total revenue recognised being limited to the aggregate amount of non-refundable milestone payments received.
The percentage completion is determined by reference to effort in hours incurred compared to total estimated effort for the program.
Clinical milestones The Group receives non-refundable clinical development milestones when a licensee or corporate partner achieves key stages in clinical trials which they are conducting with a view to the ultimate commercialisation of a product derived using the Groups proprietary technology.
Such milestones are recognised when received except that if such milestones are creditable against future royalty payments a relevant amount will be deferred and released as the related royalty payments are received.
Research and development services The Group provides research and development services to certain corporate collaborators, usually in the form of a defined number of the Groups employees working under the direction of the collaborator to further the collaborators research and development effort.
Such contracts are made on the basis of Full Time Equivalent FTE employees and are charged at a specified rate per FTE.
Revenues from FTE services are recognised as the services are rendered.
Purchased rights Under an agreement with Drug Royalty Corporation DRC the Group received a payment of 1.5 million in 1994 in return for rights to a percentage of revenues and certain other payments received by the Group over a period terminating in 2009.
The Groups accounting policy is that the payment be deferred and recognised ratably over the period for which rights were purchased.
On 2 May 2002 the Group bought out this royalty obligation with the issue of CAT shares to DRC.
The remaining balance of deferred income has been released in the year ended 30 September 2002.
Royalties Royalty income is generated by sales of products incorporating the Groups proprietary technology and is recognised when received.
The Group has yet to receive any significant royalty payments.
45 Cambridge Antibody Technology Group plc Government grants Grants of a revenue nature are credited to the profit and loss account as the related expenditure is incurred.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted by the balance sheet date.
The Company has adopted FRS 19 Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on a current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset, or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Research and development Research and development expenditure is written off as incurred.
Collaboration arrangements The Group has entered into certain collaboration arrangements whereby the parties agree to work jointly on research and development of potential therapeutic products.
Under such arrangements the parties agree which elements of research and development each will perform.
These arrangements do not include the creation of any separate entity to conduct the activities nor any separate and distinct assets or liabilities.
The parties agree that the combined cost of all relevant activities will be borne by the parties in a particular proportion and that net revenues derived from sales of any resulting product will be shared similarly.
The sharing of costs will result in balancing payments between the parties and such payments receivable or payable will be respectively added to or deducted from research and development costs in the profit and loss account.
Any amounts receivable or payable at a period end are included in the balance sheet under debtors or creditors.
Pension costs The Group operates a group personal pension plan which is a defined contribution scheme.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs is the Groups contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Intangible assets Purchased intangible assets excluding goodwill are capitalised as assets on the balance sheet at fair value on acquisition and amortised over their useful economic lives, subject to reviews for impairment when events or change of circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable using cash flow projections.
To the extent carrying values exceed fair values, an impairment is recognised and charged to the profit and loss account in that period.
This applies to intangibles purchased separately from a business and also to intangibles acquired as part of the acquisition of a business, if their value can be measured reliably on initial recognition.
The Groups purchased intangible assets include access to intellectual property and options for product development rights which are being amortised over seven years and also include certain patents which are being written off over their term to expiry which is between 12 and 16 years from the date of acquisition.
When reviewing all these assets for impairment the Directors have considered future cash flows arising.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets other than freehold land on a straight-line basis at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset over its expected useful life as follows: Freehold buildings: over 12 years.
Office and laboratory equipment: 25% per annum.
Fixtures and fittings: over either 5 or 20 years or the remaining lease term if less.
Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for any impairment.
Liquid resources Liquid resources comprise negotiable securities and term deposits and are shown at cost with accrued interest included in debtors.
Where relevant a provision is made such that cost plus accrued interest does not exceed market value.
46 Cambridge Antibody Technology Group plc Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies continued Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
The results of overseas operations and their balance sheets are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and results of overseas operations are dealt with through reserves.
Leases Assets held under finance leases, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to owned assets, are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful lives.
The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the leases to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Hire purchase transactions are dealt with similarly, except that assets are depreciated over their useful lives.
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term even if payments are made on another basis.
Estimates and assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting standards requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year.
In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions have been made by management concerning the selection of useful lives of fixed assets, provisions necessary for certain liabilities, the carrying value of investments, the recoverability of deferred tax assets and other similar evaluations.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
2 Turnover and loss on ordinary activities before taxation Turnover and loss on ordinary activities before taxation relate solely to the principal activity and are attributable to the continuing operations of the Group substantially all of which take place in the United Kingdom.
Turnover principally consists of licence fees, milestone payments and fees for research and development services provided under corporate agreements.
2002 2001 2000 000 000 000 Total turnover 16,891 9,421 7,018 Less: intra-group eliminations 7,420 2,300 Consolidated turnover 9,471 7,121 7,018 Consolidated turnover was generated from customers in the following geographical areas: 2002 2001 2000 000 000 000 United Kingdom 316 Rest of Europe 135 53 1,104 United States of America 8,674 6,969 5,598 Rest of World 662 99 9,471 7,121 7,018 Net liabilities of 349,000 excluding creditors eliminated on consolidation of 9,210,000 2001: net assets of 643,000, excluding creditors eliminated on consolidation of 2,387,000 and total assets of 549,000 2001: 643,000 are held in the United States of America.
47 Cambridge Antibody Technology Group plc 2 Turnover and loss on ordinary activities before taxation continued Consolidated turnover by type: 2002 2001 2000 000 000 000 Licence fees 1,676 1,635 699 Technical milestones 35 652 Clinical milestones 1,396 1,000 Contract research fees 5,611 5,369 4,536 Other 753 117 131 Total 9,471 7,121 7,018 During the financial years ended 30 September 2002, 2001 and 2000 certain customers individually contributed more than 10% of the Groups revenue in each year.
The amounts of those individual contributions in order of size by year were as follows: % 000 2002 Customer contributing greatest % to revenue 36 3,424 2002 Customer contributing second greatest % to revenue 31 2,954 Total 67 6,378 2001 Customer contributing greatest % to revenue 31 2,230 2001 Customer contributing second greatest % to revenue 30 2,101 2001 Customer contributing third greatest % to revenue 24 1,742 Total 85 6,073 2000 Customer contributing greatest % to revenue 37 2,609 2000 Customer contributing second greatest % to revenue 20 1,425 2000 Customer contributing third greatest % to revenue 15 1,050 2000 Customer contributing fourth greatest % to revenue 14 1,000 Total 86 6,084 As at 30 September 2002, the two customers shown above constituted 89% of the Groups trade receivables.
As at 30 September 2001 the three customers shown above constituted 96% of the Groups trade receivables.
3 Drug Royalty transaction costs General and administration expenses include 7.9 million of costs incurred in the year relating to the two transactions entered into with DRC during the year comparative periods: none.
In January 2002, the Group announced a recommended offer for the whole of DRC.
A competing offer was made by Inwest Investments Ltd of Canada which was accepted in April 2002.
Under an agreement with DRC, the Group received a payment of 1.5 million in 1994 in return for rights to a percentage of revenues and certain other payments received by the Group over a period terminating in 2009.
On 2 May 2002, the Group bought out this royalty obligation to DRC for consideration of 6.1 million CAD$14 million with the issue of 463,818 CAT shares to DRC.
The remaining balance of 0.6 million of deferred income has all been released to turnover in the period.
The professional fees incurred in the Groups bid and royalty buy-back were 1.8 million.
48 Cambridge Antibody Technology Group plc Notes to the Financial Statements 4 Loss on ordinary activities before taxation 2002 2001 2000 000 000 000 The loss on ordinary activities before taxation is stated after charging crediting : Depreciation and amounts written off owned tangible fixed assets: 2,617 2,146 1,808 Amortisation of intangible fixed assets 882 373 374 Auditors remuneration audit Deloitte & Touche 35 audit Arthur Andersen 42 27 other assurance Deloitte & Touche 19 other Deloitte & Touche 9 other Arthur Andersen 287 149 219 Foreign exchange loss gain 192 56 123 Profit on disposal of Denzyme ApS 2 Operating lease rentals: plant and machinery 5 33 other operating leases 874 721 290 Allocations under equity participation schemes 607 416 459 Arthur Andersen resigned as auditors to the Group on 17 May 2002 and were replaced by Deloitte & Touche.
5 Interest receivable 2002 2001 2000 000 000 000 Interest receivable 6,386 9,295 5,644 6 Staff costs The average monthly number of persons including Executive Directors employed by the Group during the year was: 2002 2001 2000 Management and administration 39 32 22 Research and development 235 192 139 274 224 161 000 000 000 Their aggregate remuneration comprised: Wages and salaries 9,771 7,268 5,233 Social security costs credit charge provided on unapproved options 248 194 523 on wages and salaries 970 740 527 Other pension costs 875 641 432 11,368 8,455 6,715 Further audited information on Directors remuneration is contained in the Remuneration Report.
The Group has made a provision for employers National Insurance payable on certain options granted under the CSOP Part B scheme in December 1999.
The liability will not crystallise until the options are exercised they are exercisable from December 2002 and the ultimate liability will be determined by the difference between the exercise price paid by the employee and the market price on exercise and on the then prevailing rate for employers contributions.
49 Cambridge Antibody Technology Group plc 6 Staff costs continued The options are exercisable subject to the condition that the proportionate increase in the closing price of shares in the Company over a specified period must exceed the proportionate increase in the total return on the FTSE All Share Index.
The specified period begins on the date of grant and ends between the third and fourth anniversary of the date of grant.
The provision is being made systematically by reference to the market value of the shares at the balance sheet dates over the period from the date of grant to the end of the performance period, and from that date to the date of actual exercise the provision will be adjusted by reference to changes in market value.
For this purpose the performance period is assumed to be of minimum duration.
The provision and corresponding charges to the profit and loss account will be affected by: the elapse of performance periods: the remaining number and option price of shares under option: and, the market value of the shares.
The market price of shares at the year end was 4.64.
If that price and the relevant number of shares under option remained unchanged, the charge for a further year would amount to 5,000.
If the market value of the shares were to increase by 10% over that at the year end, the charge would increase by 22,000.
7 Taxation 2002 2001 2000 000 000 000 Research and development tax credit 3,557 During the year ended 30 September 2002 the Group received a refund of 920,000 in respect of the surrender of tax losses created through research and development for the year ended 30 September 2000.
A similar claim has been made for the year ended 30 September 2001, which is reflected in other debtors at 30 September 2002, and for which the Group received a refund of 2,637,000 in October 2002.
The tax assessed for the year differs from that resulting from applying the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% 2001: 30%.
The differences are explained below: 2002 2001 000 000 Loss on ordinary activities before tax 31,764 11,771 Tax at 30% thereon 9,529 3,531 Effects of: Increase in losses carried forward 11,400 5,071 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1,041 1,205 Capital allowances in excess of depreciation 888 335 Utilisation of tax losses in respect of research and development tax credit 3,557 Movement in short term timing differences 58 3,557 Analysis of deferred tax balances: 2002 2001 000 000 Short term timing differences 58 Accelerated capital allowances 1,272 335 Tax losses available 23,658 18,126 Total unprovided deferred tax asset 22,444 18,461 At 30 September 2002 the Group had tax losses of approximately 79 million 2001: 60 million, 2000: 36 million available for relief against future taxable profits.
Due to the availability of tax losses there is no provision for deferred taxation.
A deferred tax asset amounting to 24 million representing such losses has not been recognised.
The deferred tax asset would become recoverable should the Group generate relevant taxable profits against which the tax losses would be offset.
The adoption of FRS 19 Deferred Tax by the Group has no effect on prior periods.
50 Cambridge Antibody Technology Group plc Notes to the Financial Statements 8 Loss per share Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
The computation of diluted net loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities and other contracts to issue ordinary shares were exercised or converted into ordinary shares or resulted in the issue of ordinary shares that then shared in the net loss of the Group.
Potentially dilutive issuable shares are included in the calculation of diluted loss per share if their issue would increase net loss per share or decrease net profit per share.
Since the Group has reported losses, its basic and diluted loss per share are therefore equal.
For the years ending 30 September 2002, 2001 and 2000 867,316, 1,077,800 and 1,548,764 potentially dilutive issuable shares attributable to the exercise of outstanding options were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share.
No adjustments were made to reported net loss in the computation of net loss per share.
11 Fixed asset investments Group Company Other Subsidiary investments undertakings 000 000 Cost and net book value At 1 October 2001 101,456 Additions 215 At 30 September 2002 215 101,456 The subsidiary undertakings of the Company, all of which are consolidated, are as follows: Country of incorporation Principal Percentage of and operation activity ordinary shares held Cambridge Antibody Technology Limited England Research and development 100% CAT Group EmployeesTrustees Limited England Share scheme trust company 100% Optein Inc. trading as Aptein Inc. USA Research and development 100% During the period the Group disposed of its wholly owned subsidiary, Denzyme ApS, in return for a minority interest in another company.
This transaction has no material impact on reported results.

The bank overdraft comprised payments to suppliers and other third parties which are in the course of presentation.
15 Creditors Group Group 2002 2001 000 000 Amounts falling due after more than one year: Deferred income 8,580 8,085 53 Cambridge Antibody Technology Group plc 16 Financial instruments The financial instruments of the Group comprise cash, liquid resources and debtors and creditors arising in the normal course of business.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments or derivatives.
The Groups liquid resources are managed on a discretionary basis by a third party.
The mandate under which the fund managers operate includes the following criteria: Investments only in freely negotiable instruments or deposits with specified banks and building societies.
For the whole fund, limits on the maximum exposure to counterparties with particular minimum credit ratings, which ratings have been set deliberately high.
For investments in particular classes of instrument, minimum credit ratings which are tighter than for the fund as a whole or an agreed counterparty list.
For the whole fund, a maturity profile which is tailored to the Groups expected cash requirements as investments are generally held to maturity.
No currency exposure or short positions.
These criteria are set by the Board and are reviewed when deemed necessary.
The principal purpose of the Groups liquid resources is for future funding and hence their safeguarding is considered to be a greater priority than the actual return made on the investments.
The criteria for fund management reflect this.
The Audit Committee review the return made on the Groups funds against benchmark market returns quarterly.
The majority of the Groups investments are short term investments and hence exposure to interest rate changes has been minimal.
Realisation of losses from interest rate movements is unlikely as investments are generally held to maturity.
Declines in interest rates over time will, however, reduce the Groups interest income.
The results of the Group have not, to date, been materially impacted by exchange rate fluctuations.
However, a significant proportion of current and future income is likely to be receivable in United States Dollars which may give rise to transactional currency exposures due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between United States Dollars and Sterling, which is the Groups functional currency.
Where possible, the Group seeks to match United States Dollar income with United States Dollar expenditure.
To date the Group has not hedged any transactional currency exposure but will keep such exposures under review and where prudent and appropriate may enter into such transactions in future.

The weighted average return on the fixed rate financial assets was 3.1% 2001: 6.1%, which was fixed over a weighted average term of 1.3 years 2001: 1.5 years.
The returns achieved on fixed and floating rate financial assets are determined by money market rates prevailing at the date a transaction is entered into.
In this disclosure financial assets comprise liquid resources and cash at bank and in hand.
Short term debtors and creditors have been excluded.
The financial liabilities on which no interest is paid comprise payments to third parties in the course of presentation.
These are payable on demand.
The Directors do not consider the deferred income balances to be financial liabilities where monies received are non-refundable.
Fair value of marketable securities is determined by reference to market value.
Currency exposures At the year end the Groups individual operations had the following net monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their functional currency.

Issued at an aggregate premium of 5,000. ii All Non-Executive Directors elected to take part of their fees in shares.
iii Shares were issued at a price of 13.26 per share, being the average share price for the ten days prior to 30 April 2002.
At 30 September 2002 options had been granted over ordinary shares of the Company.
Options also exist over shares in CAT Limited which are matched with share exchange option agreements whereby shares allotted in CAT Limited on exercise are immediately exchanged for shares in the Company.
The tabulation of options below reflects the effective numbers and exercise prices of options over shares in the Company.
Certain options were granted in one scheme in parallel with options in a different scheme under arrangements whereby the exercise of options in one scheme would cause a corresponding number of options to lapse in the other scheme.
Where relevant, pairs of linked options are counted as a single option.
ii These options were subject to the condition as stated in note iii below.
This condition had been satisfied as at 30 September 2002. iii These options are exercisable subject to the condition that the proportionate increase in the closing price of shares in the Company over a specified period must exceed the increase in the Total Shareholder Return TSR for the FTSE All Share Index.
In certain circumstances, such as the death of an employee, the rules of the CSOP permit the Directors to allow options which have been granted but which have not vested to be exercised provided the exercise takes place within the period prescribed in the CSOP rules in relation to these circumstances.
iv The number of options which will become exercisable will be determined on a linear sliding scale on the third anniversary of the date of grant based on the extent to which the TSR for the Company exceeds the percentage increase in the TSR for the FTSE All Share Index by an amount of between 0% and 33%.

60 Cambridge Antibody Technology Group plc Notes to the Financial Statements 25 Related party transactions During the 2000 financial year CAT Limited paid a fee of US$1.3 million to Prudential Vector Healthcare Group Prudential Vector under an arrangement whereby Prudential Vector agreed to provide certain financial advisory services.
The arrangement was subsequently terminated although Prudential Vector were, in certain circumstances, entitled to a further fee in respect of further transactions entered into by CAT Limited in the period up to February 2001.
No such further transactions or payments have taken place.
J L Foght was a managing director of Prudential Vector at the time the arrangement was entered into and the payment made and is a Non-Executive Director of the Company.
The Board of Directors has determined that this transaction did not interfere with Dr Foghts exercise of independent judgement and accordingly has determined that he is an independent Director under the provisions of the Combined Code and that it is in the best interests of the Company that he continue to serve on the Audit Committee.
In accordance with FRS 8, Related Party Disclosures, the Group does not disclose transactions or balances between group entities which are wholly eliminated on consolidation.
26 Litigation As previously reported, CATs patent infringement action against MorphoSys relating to the European Winter II and McCafferty patents in Munich is currently stayed pending the outcome of appeal proceedings at the European Patent Office.
In March 2002 the District Court in Washington DC issued a formal ruling that MorphoSys does not infringe CATs US Griffiths patent.
The decision was based on the method by which MorphoSys library is derived.
CAT has appealed this decision.
The appeal will be limited to the issue as to whether MorphoSys infringes the Griffiths patent.
A hearing date has not yet been set but it is anticipated that the hearing will take place in mid 2003.
May 2003 has been proposed as the trial date for the two legal actions in the District Court in Washington DC in which CAT claims that MorphoSys infringes its Winter II patent and two of the Winter Lerner Huse patents.
The preliminary Markman Hearings on these cases were postponed.
A new date for these hearings has yet to be set by the Court.
A trial date of 17 February 2003 has been proposed for the legal action brought by MorphoSys in respect of CATs US McCafferty patent.
The preliminary Markman Hearing on this case was postponed.
A new date for this hearing has yet to be set by the Court.
As previously reported, in 2000 Crucell issued writs against the Medical Research Council MRC, Scripps and Stratagene in a Dutch national court, seeking a declaration that the Winter II patent was invalid or that Crucell did not infringe the claims of the patent.
A separate writ against MRC sought a similar declaration in respect of the McCafferty patent.
Pursuant to its agreements with the defendants, CAT is responsible for the defence of these proceedings.
The Court has declined jurisdiction for Crucells non infringement claims and assumed jurisdiction only on the invalidity claims any decision will only cover Holland.
The Courts ruling to decline jurisdiction in the Winter II case is currently under appeal by Crucell.
CAT intends to defend these proceedings vigorously and does not believe there is merit in these claims.
Whatever the outcome of the above litigation activity, CAT believes that its ability to operate its own technology will not be materially and adversely affected.
As previously reported, following certain share issues by Cambridge Antibody Technology Limited, Continental Venture Capital Limited CVC issued proceedings in the State of New York claiming that it is entitled to anti-dilution shares equivalent to 25,790 ordinary shares of 10p each.
If CVC succeeds then the Directors would be obliged to issue anti-dilution shares to all similarly situated participants approximately 763,000 ordinary shares of 10p each.
Both parties issued cross motions for summary judgement which were denied in May 2000.
There has been no change in the status of proceedings during the year and the Directors continue to believe, on the basis of legal advice they have received, that the proceedings have no merit.
61 Cambridge Antibody Technology Group plc 27 Reconciliation to US GAAP Summary of Significant Differences Between UK GAAP Followed by the Group and US GAAP The Groups consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP, which differs in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP.
The following is a summary of significant adjustments to net loss and shareholders funds required when reconciling such amounts recorded in the financial statements to the corresponding amounts in accordance with US GAAP, considering the significant differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP.
Reconciliation of net loss from UK GAAP to US GAAP 2002 2001 2000 Notes 000 000 000 Net loss as reported under UK GAAP 28,207 11,771 8,289 Adjustments for: Compensation costs under variable plan accounting for stock options a 3,703 7,804 8,223 Acquisition of Aptein Inc. b 16 16 16 Revenue recognition c 422 422 111 Accounting for National Insurance on share options d 248 194 523 Reclassification of share issue expenses e 202 1,237 Profit on sale of Denzyme ApS f 229 Termination of DRC royalty agreement g 723 Foreign exchange difference h 491 Net loss as reported under US GAAP 31,291 19,565 17,131 Loss per share under US GAAP.
Under US GAAP, the Group would compute loss per share under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
128, basic net loss per ordinary share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted net loss per ordinary share for CAT is the same as basic net loss per ordinary share as the effects of the Companys potential ordinary share equivalents are antidilutive.
Under UK GAAP, the basis of calculation is the same.
However, since different net losses are produced under US GAAP and UK GAAP the net loss per share under US GAAP is presented below: 2002 2001 2000 Basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share pence 87.3 55.4 56.8 Shares used in computing net loss per ordinary share number 35,828,446 35,313,260 30,179,818 Antidilutive securities, not included above number 867,316 1,077,800 1,548,764 Antidilutive securities represent stock options outstanding which have not been included in the calculation of loss per ordinary share as the impact of including such shares in the calculation of loss per share would be antidilutive.
Reconciliation of shareholders funds from UK GAAP to US GAAP 2002 2001 2000 Notes 000 000 000 Shareholders funds as reported under UK GAAP 135,765 156,050 152,440 Acquisition of Aptein Inc. b 127 143 159 Revenue recognition c 2,375 2,797 1,768 Accounting for National Insurance on stock options d 81 329 523 Shareholders funds as reported under US GAAP 133,598 153,725 151,354 62 Cambridge Antibody Technology Group plc Notes to the Financial Statements 27 Reconciliation to US GAAP continued Reconciliation of movement in shareholders equity under US GAAP Share Total shareholders Number of shares Share capital premium account Other reserve Accumulated loss equity 000 000 000 000 000 000 Balance, 30 September 2000 34,770,438 3,477 187,274 13,492 52,889 151,354 Shares issued 685,427 69 14,062 14,131 Compensation costs for stock options 7,804 7,804 Foreign exchange translation 11 Net loss for the year under US GAAP 19,565 19,565 Total comprehensive income 19,564 Balance, 30 September 2001 35,455,865 3,546 209,140 13,492 72,453 153,725 Shares issued 758,484 75 6,794 5 6,874 Compensation costs for stock options 3,703 3,703 Foreign exchange translation 587 587 Net loss for the year under US GAAP 31,291 31,291 Total comprehensive income 30,704 Balance, 30 September 2002 36,214,349 3,621 219,637 13,497 103,157 133,598 Total accumulated other comprehensive income foreign currency translations at 30 September 2001 was 1,000 and at 30 September 2002 was 588,000. a Compensation costs under variable plan accounting for stock options.
CAT has granted stock options to employees that will vest upon the attainment of certain targets.
Under UK GAAP, there is no accounting for the cost of these grants after the initial grant date.
Under US GAAP, Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, the Company is required to follow variable plan accounting for these grants.
The nature of conditions attached to the stock options awards mean that management cannot make a reasonable estimate of the number of shares that will be eventually issued because the Company cannot control the achievements of the conditions.
As a consequence, the compensation expense for the stock awards is recorded when and only when the options vest when the target is achieved, based on the difference between the exercise price and market value at that date.
The targets were first achieved in the year ended 30 September 2000.
There is no tax effect related to the adjustments in respect of stock options.
b Accounting for the acquisition of Aptein Inc.
The Company acquired Aptein Inc. Aptein in July 1998 for consideration payable partly on completion, the remainder being deferred, payable subject to the achievement of certain conditions.
Aptein was acquired for its patent portfolio, which comprised its only material asset.
The value of purchase consideration therefore had a corresponding impact on the fair value ascribed to the patents, which are shown in the balance sheet as an intangible asset.
Under UK GAAP, in accordance with FRS 7 Fair Values in Acquisition Accounting, the fair value of the deferred consideration was recognised immediately and the fair value of the contingent consideration which was payable by the issue of shares in the Company was reported as part of shareholders funds as shares to be issued.
The difference between the initial investment of the contingent consideration and the actual amount was recorded as an adjustment to the purchase price in June 1999, when paid.
At this time a corresponding adjustment to the value of the intangible asset was also recognised.
Under US GAAP, APB Opinion 16, Accounting for Business Combinations, contingent consideration is not recorded until such time as the contingency is resolved.
Accordingly, prior to the actual payment of the contingent consideration the recorded value of the intangible asset under US GAAP was lower than under UK GAAP, resulting in a lower amortisation charge.
On payment of the contingent consideration, the amortisation charge under US GAAP increased above UK GAAP as a consequence of the higher unamortised cost.
63 Cambridge Antibody Technology Group plc 27 Reconciliation to US GAAP continued c Revenue recognition.
The nature of the Groups principal revenue streams and the Groups accounting policy for revenue recognition under UK GAAP are as detailed in note 1.
For US GAAP purposes, the Company has adopted, for all periods, Staff Accounting Bulletin 101 SAB101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, which was issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC in December 1999.
The treatment of revenues under US GAAP is equivalent to that under UK GAAP except as follows: Under US GAAP, where licensing arrangements are accompanied by an equity subscription agreement, the series of transactions have been accounted for as a multiple elements arrangement.
Accordingly the aggregate consideration has been allocated to the two elements of the arrangement as follows.
The fair value of the equity subscription is calculated as being the aggregate number of shares issued at the average of the opening and closing share prices on the date of issue.
Any deficit or premium arising from the aggregate value of the share subscription over the fair value of the shares is recorded as an adjustment to licence revenues.
No such reallocation is made under UK GAAP.
During the years ended 30 September 2002 and 2001 licence revenues under US GAAP were therefore 422,000 higher.
For the year ended 30 September 2000 licence revenues under US GAAP were 111,000 higher.
d Accounting for National Insurance on share options.
Under UK GAAP the Company has accounted for a potential liability to National Insurance on employee share options.
The provision is being made systematically by reference to the market value of shares at the balance sheet dates over the period from the date of grant to the end of the relevant performance period and from that date to the date of actual exercise the provision will be adjusted by reference to changes in market value.
The provision at 30 September 2002 was 81,000 and the net credit for the year then ended amounted to 248,000.
Under US GAAP, Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue 00-16 Recognition and Measurement of Employer Payroll Taxes on Employee Stock-Based Compensation, no liability to National Insurance is recognised until such time as the share option is exercised since this is when the liability crystallises.
Under the agreement with DRC the Group received an amount of 1.5 million in 1994 in exchange for rights to a percentage of the cash receivable in respect of certain revenues and certain equity issues where these equity issues form part of a commercial collaboration.
Under UK GAAP amounts paid to DRC as a result of an equity subscription are accounted for as a share issue expense since they are considered to be directly related to the share issue.
Under US GAAP these amounts are not considered to be a share issue cost since DRC are not providing any services in connection with the equity issue.
Accordingly, such amounts are charged to the profit and loss account for the year under US GAAP.
f Profit on sale of Denzyme ApS.
Goodwill of 229,000 arose on the purchase of Denzume ApS in June 1996.
In accordance with the UK accounting standard then in force Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 22 this goodwill was written off to reserves.
Under US GAAP the goodwill was expensed in the income statement.
The Company sold Denzyme ApS, a wholly owned subsidiary, in November 2001.
Under UK GAAP the calculated profit on disposal takes account of the goodwill previously written off to reserves resulting in a profit on disposal of 2,000.
Under US GAAP there is no requirement to write back the goodwill as it has already been charged to the profit and loss account.
Therefore under US GAAP the profit on disposal of Denzyme ApS is 231,000. g Termination of DRC royalty agreement.
Under an agreement with DRC the Group received a payment of 1.5 million in 1994 in return for rights to a percentage of revenues and certain other payments received by the Group over a period terminating in 2009.
On 2 May 2002 the Group bought out this obligation to DRC for 6.1 million C$14 million with the issue of 463,818 CAT shares to DRC.
Under UK GAAP the share price applied to this transaction defined in the contract, was the volume weighted average closing CAT share price over the ten days prior to 30 April 2002, being the date that the Group notified DRC that they intended to terminate the royalty agreement.
This resulted in a credit to the share premium account of 6,102,000.
Under US GAAP the share price applied was the fair value of the closing CAT share price on the 30 April 2002, resulting in a credit to the share premium account of 5,379,000. h Foreign currency translation.
Under UK GAAP, the results of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the closing exchange rate.
Under US GAAP, the average exchange rate for the year is used.
64 Cambridge Antibody Technology Group plc Notes to the Financial Statements 27 Reconciliation to US GAAP continued i Taxation.
Under UK GAAP, deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Net deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Under US GAAP, deferred tax is recognised in full in respect of temporary differences between the reported carrying amount of an asset or liability and its corresponding tax basis.
Deferred tax assets are also recognised in full subject to a valuation allowance to reduce the amount of such assets to that which is more likely than not to be realised.
As at 30 September 2002, 2001 and 2000, CAT has approximately 79 million, 60 million and 36 million respectively of cumulative tax losses.
These losses represent a deferred tax asset for accounting purposes.
In accordance with both UK GAAP and US GAAP, no asset has been recognised in respect of these tax losses due to the uncertainty as to whether these losses can be offset against future profits.
No tax effect has been recognised in the reconciliation of net loss from UK GAAP to US GAAP in respect of the differences arising in respect of those items, as the timing differences arising are offset in full by the unrecognised tax losses carried forward.
Consolidated statements of cash flows The consolidated statements of cash flows prepared under UK GAAP presents substantially the same information as that required under US GAAP by SFAS 95 Statement of Cash Flows.
These standards differ however with regard to classification of items within the statements and the definition of cash and cash equivalents.
Under UK GAAP, cash comprises only cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand.
Deposits are repayable on demand if they can be withdrawn at any time without notice and without penalty or if a maturity or period of notice of not more than 24 hours or one working day has been agreed.
Under US GAAP, cash equivalents are short term highly liquid investments, generally with original maturities of three months or less, that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates.
Under UK GAAP, cash flows are presented separately for operating activities, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investment, management of liquid resources and financing activities.
US GAAP requires only three categories of cash flow activity to be reported: operating, investing and financing.
Cash flows from taxation and returns on investments and servicing of finance under UK GAAP would, with the exception of dividends paid, be shown under operating activities under US GAAP.
The payment of dividends and the payment to acquire own shares treasury stock would be included as a financing activity under US GAAP.
Management of liquid resources under UK GAAP would be included as cash and cash equivalents.
Under US GAAP management of liquid resources would be included to the extent that the amounts involved have a maturity of less than three months and are convertible into known amounts of cash.
Summary statements of cash flow presented under US GAAP are given below: 2002 2001 2000 000 000 000 Net cash used in provided by operating activities 18,330 10,828 636 Net cash used in investing activities 5,106 21,735 32,725 Net cash provided by financing activities 1,448 15,380 132,293 Effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 32 2 Decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents 22,020 17,183 100,206 Beginning cash and cash equivalents 90,599 107,782 7,576 Ending cash and cash equivalents 68,579 90,599 107,782 65 Cambridge Antibody Technology Group plc 27 Reconciliation to US GAAP continued A reconciliation between the consolidated cash flow statement prepared in accordance with UK GAAP and US GAAP is presented below for the years ended 30 September: 2002 2001 2000 000 000 000 Operating activities Net cash used in operating activities under UK GAAP 26,808 19,150 3,609 Returns on investments and servicing of finance 7,558 8,322 4,245 Taxation 920 Net cash used in operating activities under US GAAP 18,330 10,828 636 Investing activities Capital expenditure and financial investment under UK GAAP 9,961 3,481 974 Management of liquid resources under UK GAAP 29,534 274 133,729 Cash equivalents with a maturity of less than three months 24,679 18,528 101,978 Net cash used in investing activities 5,106 21,735 32,725 Movement in cash Increase decrease in cash under UK GAAP 2,691 1,345 1,774 Cash equivalents with a maturity of less than three months 24,679 18,528 101,978 Effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 32 2 22,020 17,183 100,206 Accounting for share-based compensation As permitted under SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, in accounting for options granted under its share option schemes the Group has adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS 123, but opted to remain under the expense recognition provisions of APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Accordingly, for the years ended 30 September 2002, 2001 and 2000, compensation expenses of 3,703,000, 7,804,000 and 8,223,000 were recognised for options granted under these schemes.
Had compensation expense for options granted under these schemes been determined based on fair value at the grant dates in accordance with SFAS 123, the Companys charge to income for the years ending 30 September 2002, 2001 and 2000 would have been 1,523,000, 1,064,000 and 814,000 respectively.

This credit results in a surrender of certain lossses for which a valuation allowance was recorded in the prior year.
The change in valuation allowance above includes the establishment of the valuation allowance for the current year and the decrease in the valuation allowance resulting from the surrender of prior year losses.
The Group, to the extent it is eligible, will continue to record research and development tax credits in the period in which they become estimable.
As at 30 September 2002 the Group had approximately 79 million of tax losses available to carry forward indefinitely against future trading profits.
68 Cambridge Antibody Technology Group plc Notes to the Financial Statements 27 Reconciliation to US GAAP continued Recently issued accounting pronouncements In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of Long-Lived Assets and supersedes SFAS 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No.
30, Reporting the Results of Operations, for a disposal of a segment of a business.
SFAS 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after 15 December 2001, with earlier application encouraged.
We expect to adopt SFAS 144 as of 1 October 2002 and we do not expect that the adoption of the Statement will have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In April 2002 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No.
64, Amendment to FASB Statement No.
SFAS 145 streamlines the reporting of debt extinguishments and requires that only gains and loses from extinguishments meeting the criteria in Accounting Policies Board Opinion 30 would be classified as extraordinary.
Thus, gains and losses arising from extinguishments that are part of a companys recurring operations would not be reported as an extraordinary item.
SFAS 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after 15 May 2002 with earlier adoption encouraged.
We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 145 to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities was issued in June 2002 and addresses accounting and processing for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit and Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring.
SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal liability be recognised when the liability is incurred.
Under Issue 94-3, a liability for an exit cost was recognised at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan.
Under SFAS 146, fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability.
SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after 31 December 2002, with early application encouraged.
We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 146 to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 141, Business Combinations and SFAS No.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
SFAS 141 requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after 30 June 2001.
SFAS 141 requires intangible assets to be recognised if they arise from contractual or legal rights or are separable, ie, it is feasible that they may be sold, transferred, licensed, rented, exchanged or pledged.
As a result, it is likely that more intangible assets will be recognised under SFAS 141 than its predecessor, APB Opinion 16, although in some instances previously recognised intangibles will be subsumed into goodwill.
Under SFAS 142, goodwill will no longer be amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever indicators of impairment arise.
The goodwill impairment test, which is based on fair value, is to be performed on a reporting unit level.
A reporting unit is defined as a SFAS 131 operating segment or one level lower.
Goodwill will no longer be allocated to other long-lived assets for impairment testing under SFAS 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of.
Additionally, goodwill on equity method investments will no longer be amortised: however, it will continue to be tested for impairment in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.
Under SFAS 142 intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortised.
Instead they will be carried at the lower of cost or market value and tested for impairment at least annually.
All other recognised intangible assets will continue to be amortised over their estimated useful lives.
SFAS 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after 15 December 2001 although goodwill on business combinations consummated after 1 July 2001 will not be amortised.
The adoption of SFAS 141 and 142 is not expected to have any material impact upon the Groups results.
