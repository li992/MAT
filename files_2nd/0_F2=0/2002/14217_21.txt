15 Derivatives and other financial instruments The Finance Directors Review on pages 14 and 15 provides an explanation of the role that financial instruments have had during the year in creating or changing the risks the Group faces in its activities.
The numerical disclosures in this note deal with financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments.
Certain financial assets such as investments in subsidiary undertakings are excluded from the scope of these disclosures, as are short-term debtors and creditors, other than the currency disclosures.
Interest rate profile The Group has no financial assets other than cash at bank of 13.558m 2001: 10.348m, which are part of the financing arrangements of the Group.
After taking into account interest rate and currency swaps, the interest rate and currency profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2002 was as follows: Floating Fixed Floating Fixed Total rate rate Total rate rate 2002 2002 2002 2001 2001 2001 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Sterling 51,768 19,777 31,991 37,707 6,924 30,783 Euro 76,458 6,321 70,137 75,427 8,775 66,652 US dollar 8,712 8,712 - 6,542 6,542 - Total 136,938 34,810 102,128 119,676 22,241 97,435 46 SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 15 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued The fixed rates are fixed for a period of between one and nine years.
The interest rate on floating rate financial liabilities is linked to UK base rate in the case of sterling liabilities, EURIBOR for Euro liabilities, and US prime rate and LIBOR for US dollar liabilities.
24.149m 2001: 24.149m of the sterling and 64.588m 2001: 60.598m of the Euro fixed rate liabilities relate to the unsecured US Senior loan notes repayable after more than five years and attract an average interest rate of 6.851%.
7.842m 2001: 6.634m of the sterling and 1.750m 2001: 2.331m of the Euro fixed rate liabilities are lease contracts taken out over a maximum period of 5 years with an average interest rate of 5% 2001: 6.5%.
The remaining Euro fixed rate liabilities of 3.799m 2001: 3.723m have a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% 2001: 6.7% and are repayable over a weighted average period of 2 years 2001: 2 years.
Currency exposures The Groups objectives in managing the currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas in other words, its structural currency exposures are to maintain a low cost of borrowings and to retain some potential for currency-related appreciation while partially hedging against currency depreciation.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Transactional exposures that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account, are minimal as Group companies do not enter into significant amounts of cross border transactions.
The gain arising in the Group during 2002 in respect of transactional exposures amounted to 24,000 2001: 43,000.
Maturity of financial liabilities Borrowings The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2002 was as follows: 2002 2001 000s 000s In one year or less 31,863 20,624 In more than one year but not more than two years 4,102 11,738 In more than two years but not more than five years 10,487 2,104 In more than five years 90,486 85,210 Total 136,938 119,676 Borrowing facilities Borrowings The Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December 2002 as follows: 2002 2001 000s 000s Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years 25,000 28,772 Expiring in more than two years but not more than five years 10,589 - Expiring in more than five years - 15,000 Total 35,589 43,772 SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 47 Notes to the Accounts continued 16 Provision for liabilities and charges Group Company 2002 2001 2002 2001 Restated 000s 000s 000s 000s Deferred tax 1,609 1,089 8 - Other provisions and onerous lease contracts 2,697 2,613 - - 4,306 3,702 8 - Deferred tax Prior year adjustment The Group has adopted FRS 19 Deferred tax with effect from 1 January 2002.
FRS 19 requires deferred tax to be recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
The Groups previous policy was to recognise deferred tax to the extent that a deferred taxation liability was expected to arise in the foreseeable future.
This change has been accounted for as a prior year adjustment and previously reported figures have been restated accordingly.
The effect of this change in accounting policy on profit after taxation, net assets and earnings per share is as follows: Group 2001 000s Decrease in profit after taxation 790 Decrease in intangible fixed assets note 10 261 Increase in deferred tax provision see below 245 Decrease in net assets Note 18 506 Decrease in basic earnings per share pence 0.7p The impact of adoption of FRS 19 in 2002 has been an increase in the deferred tax charge of 0.175m.

In 2002, an adjustment has been made to reduce the cost of this investment and the associated goodwill arising by 4.835m following a review of amounts provided by the Group for liabilities to a former shareholder, which are no longer required.
The cumulative amount of goodwill resulting from acquisitions in earlier years which has been written-off directly against reserves, net of goodwill relating to undertakings disposed of, is 133.431m 2001: 138.266m.

d Pension scheme The Group operates a number of pension schemes, four 2001: four of which provide defined benefits based on final pensionable salary, the assets of which are held in trustee administered funds.
The others are defined contribution schemes all of which are independently managed.
The valuations of the UK defined benefits pension schemes are assessed by an independent actuary every three years who recommends the rate of contribution payable each year.
The main actuarial assumptions in the pension assessments were that over the long term the annual investment return would be 2.5% higher than the annual increase in pensionable salaries, and 1% higher than the annual increase in pensions.
The last formal actuarial valuations of two of the defined benefits schemes including the main scheme were conducted at 1 January 2001, and showed that the market value of the schemes assets were 24.6m and 2.1m and their actuarial values covered 83% and 117% respectively of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the third defined benefit scheme was at 30 June 2001 and showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 9.47m and its actuarial value covered 117% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the fourth defined benefit scheme was at 6 April 2001 and showed that the market value of the scheme's assets was 1.507m and its actuarial value covered 87% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for future expected increases in pensionable salaries.
Pensions for employees of overseas subsidiaries are provided in accordance with local requirements and practices.
SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 53 Notes to the Accounts continued 22 Guarantees and other financial commitments continued d Pension scheme continued As required by SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs, the figures included in the accounts in respect of the Groups pension schemes are based on actuarial valuations carried out at 1 January 2001, 30 June 2001 and 6 April 2001.
This does not take into account any impact of the fall in general stock market values since that date.
Any such impact will be reflected in the next triennial valuations, based upon which subsequent pension costs will be determined until adoption of FRS 17.
The pension charge for the year relating to the main scheme was 1.577m 2001: 1.830m and for the other schemes was 2.613m 2001: 1.872m.
The charge for the main scheme has been calculated on the basis that the shortfall within the scheme as at 1 January 2001 will be recognised over the average expected remaining service lives of the active membership of 11 years.
The Group contribution to the main scheme during the year amounted to 25.5% of pensionable salaries up to 31 July 2002 and 20.7% thereafter, following agreement with the members to increase employee contribution levels and reduce future benefits in order to limit future scheme liabilities.
Included in Group prepayments and accrued income at 31 December 2002 is 3.9m, 2001: 3.5m arising from the accumulated difference between contributions paid and pension costs charged.
Additional disclosures regarding the Groups defined benefit pension schemes are required under the transitional provisions of FRS 17 Retirement benefits and these are set out below.
The disclosures relate to the second year of the transitional provisions.
They provide information that will be necessary for full implementation of FRS 17 in the year ending 31 December 2005.
The actuarial valuations described above have been updated at 31 December 2002 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of FRS 17.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
The major assumptions used for the FRS 17 actuarial valuation of the main scheme were: 2002 2001 Rate of increase in salaries 4.3% 4.5% Rate of fixed increase of pensions in payment 5% 5% Rate of increase of LPI pensions in payment 2.3% 2.5% Discount rate 5.6% 6% Inflation assumption 2.3% 2.5% The fair value of the assets in the main scheme, the present value of the liabilities in the main scheme and the expected rate of return at the balance sheet date were: 2002 2002 2001 2001 % 000s % 000s Equities 7.5 17,306 8.0 19,800 Bonds 5.1 6,746 5.0 6,600 Other 4.5 62 5.0 200 Total fair value of assets 24,114 26,600 Present value of scheme liabilities 39,700 34,800 Deficit in the scheme 15,586 8,200 Related deferred tax asset 4,676 2,460 Net pension liability 10,910 5,740 Future joint contribution rates for the main scheme have been agreed at 18% of pensionable salaries plus fixed monthly company contributions of 86,430.
All defined benefit schemes are closed to new members, have an age profile that is rising and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
In respect of the three other defined benefit schemes the net FRS 17 pension liability at 31 December 2002 amounted to 3.047m 2001: net asset 0.327m.
