8 PENSIONS The principal group pension scheme, which was available to eligible UK full-time and part-time employees, was closed to new members on 31 December 2001.
This scheme is a funded, defined benefit scheme which is based on final pay levels.
There was also a defined contribution scheme available to employees which was also closed to new members on 31 December 2001.
Contributions to both schemes by both employees and group companies are held in externally invested trustee-administered funds.
Members of these schemes are contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme.
The total non government pension cost for the group, including directors, is analysed below: 2001 02 2000 01 m m Funded schemes 16.0 21.1 Unfunded scheme 0.4 2.1 Overseas schemes 0.1 0.1 16.5 23.3 The pension cost relating to the Whitbread Group Pension Fund is assessed in accordance with the advice of a firm of actuaries, Bacon & Woodrow, using the projected unit credit valuation basis.
As the scheme is now closed to new members the current service cost, under the projected unit credit valuation basis, will increase as a percentage of salary as members of the scheme approach retirement.
The pension cost for the year has been based on the latest actuarial valuation which was carried out as at 31 March 1999.
The main valuation assumptions were that the return on investments would be 4.25% per annum above inflation, that the annual increase in pensionable salaries including promotional increases would be 2.5% above inflation, that the annual increase in pensions in payment would average 0.25% below inflation and that 1 dividend growth would be 1% above inflation.
The average expected remaining service life of current employees is 102 years.
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 8 PENSIONS CONTINUED At the date of the valuation the market value of the Funds assets was 1,239m and the actuarial value of those assets represented 97% of the benefits that had accrued to the members.
The contribution rate is designed to reduce the deficit to zero over the expected remaining service life of existing members.
The pension prepayment included in debtors note 21 represents funding paid to Whitbread Group Pension Fund in excess of the pension cost, plus interest thereon.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits will change fundamentally the calculation and reporting of the cost of retirement benefits.
The disclosures below relate to the retirement benefit plans in the UK.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in updating the most recent valuations of the UK scheme to 2 March 2002 for FRS 17 purposes were: At At 2 3 02 3 3 01 Rate of increase in salaries 4.0% 4.0% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.5% 2.5% Discount rate 5.9% 5.7% Inflation assumption 2.5% 2.5% The assets in the scheme and the expected rate of return were: Long-term Long-term rate of rate of return Value at return Value at expected at 2 3 02 expected at 3 3 01 2 3 02 m 3 3 01 m Equities 7.50% 835.0 7.00% 904.0 Government bonds 5.00% 74.0 4.50% 93.0 Corporate bonds 5.90% 79.0 5.70% 77.0 Property 7.50% 7.0 7.00% 40.0 Cash 4.00% 48.0 5.75% 83.0 Total Market Value of Assets 1,043.0 1,197.0 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,127.0 1,152.0 Surplus deficit in scheme 84.0 45.0 Related deferred tax asset liability 25.2 15.7 Net pension asset liability 58.8 29.3 If FRS 17 had been adopted in the financial statements, the Groups net assets and profit and loss reserve at 2 March 2002 would be as follows: 2 3 02 3 3 01 m m Net assets excluding SSAP 24 pension asset liability 1,872.4 2,476.6 FRS 17 Pension asset liability 58.8 29.3 1,813.6 2,505.9 Profit and loss reserve excluding SSAP 24 pension asset liability 3,388.9 1,472.5 FRS 17 Pension reserve 58.8 29.3 3,330.1 1,501.8 Whitbread PLC 36 37 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 9 INTEREST 2001 02 2000 01 m m Interest payable and similar charges Bank loans and overdrafts 26.7 51.0 Other 44.7 45.7 71.4 96.7 Deduct: Interest receivable on short-term deposits 1.8 2.0 Interest receivable from joint ventures and associates 1.3 1.2 Interest capitalised 3.3 3.4 65.0 90.1 Interest payable by: Joint ventures 0.9 1.5 Associates 0.7 1.8 66.6 93.4 Exceptional interest payable 0.8 0.3 67.4 93.7 The exceptional interest payable represents refinancing costs associated with the demerger of the Pubs & Bars business.
