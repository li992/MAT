20 Contingent liabilities and guarantees At 31 December 2002 the Company had provided guarantees on various bank borrowings of its subsidiaries as set out in note 16: Creditors: amounts falling due within one year and note 17: Creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year.
In December 1999 SkyePharma Production SAS entered into a leasing arrangement with Lombard North Central PLC by which certain pharmaceutical manufacturing and laboratory equipment was the subject of a four-year sale and leaseback arrangement.
The Company has guaranteed the obligations of the lessee under this lease to an amount of 3.0 million a4.6 million.
In common with most business enterprises, Group companies are subject to a number of claims from third parties, the outcome of which cannot at present be determined but which are not considered to be material in the context of these Financial Statements.
Provision has been made in these accounts for any liabilities which are expected to materialise from such claims.

In March 2002 SkyePharma announced the acquisition of the outstanding voting shares in RTP in return for the issue of SkyePharma Ordinary Shares.
The total consideration of 39.4 million including acquisition costs comprised 49,959,367 Ordinary Shares and 4.1 million cash.
69 22 Share capital continued The cash consideration received on the issue of Ordinary Shares during the year amounted to 26,168,000 2001: 468,000.
Of this, 30 million Ordinary Shares were allotted to Kowa Company Limited for a total consideration of 25.3 million.
Following the US launch and first commercial sale of Paxil CR by GlaxoSmithKline in April 2002, the 12 million Deferred A Shares were converted into 12 million Ordinary Shares.

The holders of Deferred A and B Shares have no rights to participate in the profits of the Company, no voting rights and on a winding up or other return of capital only receive the nominal value of their shares if the holders of Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company have received the sum of 1,000,000 per Ordinary Share and, as such, are classified as non-equity shares.
Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, following the US launch and first commercial sale of Paxil CR by GlaxoSmithKline in April 2002, the 12 million Deferred A Shares were automatically converted into 12 million Ordinary Shares.
The 12 million Deferred B Shares automatically convert to 12 million Ordinary Shares on the Companys receipt of a royalty statement under the current Licence Agreement stating that reported sales of Paroxetine Paxil in combination with the GEOMATRIX technology have exceeded $1,000 million during any calendar period prior to 1 January 2006 or exceeded $337 million between 1 January 2006 and 3 May 2006.
In the event that this condition is not satisfied prior to 3 May 2006, the Deferred B Shares will not be converted and will be cancelled.
The vendor will not be entitled to any other compensation nor additional compensation.
The Deferred A and B Shares were issued on 20 July 2000 when the price of an Ordinary Share was 94.25 pence.
The difference between the nominal value of the Deferred B Shares and their fair value, taken to be 94.25 pence, at issue has been recorded as non-equity share premium.
Warrants The Company has the following warrants outstanding: a B Warrants Number At 1 January 2002 56,525,415 Warrants exercised 20,516,073 Warrants lapsed 36,009,342 At 31 December 2002 The B Warrants, which were issued in January 1996 on the basis of one warrant for every ten existing Ordinary Shares subscribed pursuant to the placing, rights issue and capitalisation of loan notes and in consideration for the outstanding warrants of Krypton, entitled the holders to subscribe for Ordinary Shares at any time during the period beginning six months after the date of issue and ending on 31 December 2002 at an effective price of 40 pence per Ordinary Share based on ten warrants.
Consequent upon the consolidation of existing Ordinary Shares in May 1996 the terms under which the B Warrants may be exercised were amended so that a holder was required to exercise ten B Warrants to acquire one Ordinary Share.
All outstanding B Warrants lapsed on 31 December 2002 and so the market value of B Warrants as at 31 December 2002 was nil pence 31 December 2001: 3.25 pence.
The market value of B Warrants during the period from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2002 ranged from the lowest mid-price of nil pence to the highest mid-price of 4.75 pence per B Warrant.
notes to the financial 70 statements continued SkyePharma annual report 2002 SkyePharma annual report 2002 22 Share capital continued b D and E Warrants The D and E Warrants were issued in March 2002 as part of the consideration for the agreement with Paul Capital to fund new product development.
The D and E Warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for a total of 5 million Ordinary Shares at any time during the period to 31 December 2008 at an exercise price of 73.75 pence per Ordinary Share.
A value of 0.3 million has been attributed to the D and E Warrants which has been recorded within Other Reserves.
c Other Warrants Warrants were issued in December 1999 as part of the acquisition of DepoTech and entitle the holders to subscribe for 291,777 Ordinary Shares at any time during the period beginning 31 December 1999 and ending on 25 February 2005 at an exercise price of $1.453 90.25 pence per Ordinary Share.
Share options The Company encourages employee participation in its shares through ownership and continues to operate various Share Option Schemes and the Unapproved Share Option Scheme.
Under the terms of these Schemes the Board may offer options to purchase Ordinary Shares in the Company to employees, including Directors, at a price not less than the higher of the nominal value and the market value of the shares.
Options granted to UK and European employees are only exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant, and are subject to the Companys Code of Conduct for dealing in Shares, and the Model Code.
Options granted to US employees prior to 2001 vest at 25% per annum from the date of grant and there were no performance criteria.
UK and European options may only be exercised if the growth in the Companys share price over a consecutive three-year period exceeds the growth over the same period in the FT-SE All Share Index for options granted prior to 2001.
This criteria was satisfied for the first time in March 2000.
Employees with options that are within their exercise period are now able to exercise those options within any one-year period from the date the performance condition is satisfied.
Super Options are exercisable after five years and are subject to higher performance conditions in accordance with those recommended by the Association of British Insurers.
Following changes to the option plans approved at the Annual General Meeting June 2001, options granted since that date to Directors and senior employees are subject to performance conditions linked to the total shareholder return of a comparator group of companies, and are not subject to retesting.
Options granted to other US employees continue to vest at 25% per annum with no performance criteria, and other European employees who are not Directors or senior employees can exercise their options after three years and are not subject to performance conditions.
The Groups plans are further detailed in the Remuneration Report.
The market value of Ordinary Shares during 2002 ranged from the lowest closing mid-price of 39.0 pence to the highest closing mid-price of 80.25 pence per share.

ii an additional 10 million Ordinary Shares in the event that the aggregate annual sales of the Krypton products exceeds $50 million and the Company is profitable in respect of these products before 31 December 2003: iii an additional 10 million Ordinary Shares in the event that the aggregate annual sales of the Krypton products and annual revenues of the Company exceeds $200 million and the Company is profitable in respect of these products before 31 December 2003: iv an additional 10 million Ordinary Shares in the event that the aggregate annual sales of the Krypton products and annual revenues of the Company exceeds $275 million and the Company is profitable in respect of these products before 31 December 2003.
In the event that two of hurdles ii, iii and iv are satisfied in relation to any single years sales, only the first such hurdle will be considered as having been satisfied.
notes to the financial 72 statements continued SkyePharma annual report 2002 SkyePharma annual report 2002 23 Shares and warrants to be issued continued Certain of the hurdles relating to the Krypton acquisition were not formulated to take account of the detailed arrangements currently envisaged by the Company.
Should the annual revenues of the Company approach the amounts specified in hurdles iii and iv, SkyePharma may need to renegotiate elements of the Krypton acquisition agreement.
As no Krypton products are marketed and no licensing partners have been identified for the products the Directors have taken the view that the above hurdles can no longer be reasonably expected to be met.
Consequently no provision for deferred consideration has been recognised as at 31 December 2002. b RTP As part of the RTP acquisition deferred consideration may be due to the former RTP shareholders in consideration for the loss of certain option rights.
If the SkyePharma share price is below 82 pence on 30 June 2003, then the Company is required to issue 200,000 additional shares, or pay an amount in cash, for each penny difference between the actual share price and 82 pence.
In the opinion of the Directors, the outcome cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty.
Therefore this deferred consideration has not been recognised as at 31 December 2002. c Paul Capital Royalty Acquisition Fund In March 2002 the Group announced a second transaction with Paul Capital Royalty Acquisition Fund under which SkyePharma will issue Ordinary Shares up to a value of $7.5 million if royalties and milestones received by SkyePharma in respect of those products included in the transaction are not in excess of minimum annual payments required to be made by Paul Capital.
During 2002 the royalties received by SkyePharma were substantially in excess of the minimum payments required to be made to Paul Capital, consequently the company has not provided for any additional obligations under this provision.

73 25 Financial instruments The Group holds financial instruments to finance its operations and to manage the currency risk that arises from these operations.
The Group finances its operations through a combination of shareholders funds, convertible bonds, bank loans and other borrowings.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and credit risk.
Liquidity risks The Groups policy is to maintain continuity of funding through a mixture of long-term debt and bank loans, raised to cover specific projects, and through the issue of shares to collaborative partners, where necessary, to finance development contracts.
Short-term flexibility is provided through the use of overdrafts.
The maturity profile of the Groups debt is set out below at note c. Foreign currency risk All of the Groups operations are based overseas in Continental Europe and North America giving rise to exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates notably the Swiss Franc, Euro, Swedish Krona, US Dollar and Canadian Dollar.
To minimise the impact of any fluctuations, the Groups policy has historically been to maintain natural hedges by relating the structure of borrowings to the trading cash flows that generate them.
Where subsidiaries are funded centrally, this is achieved by the use of long-term loans the exchange differences on which are taken to reserves.
Where it was not possible to use natural hedges, currency options, accrual forward options and forward currency contracts were used.
The Group has used these financial instruments during the year to minimise the currency exposure on operational transactions.
Foreign currency exchange movements did not have a material impact on the results of operations in 2002 compared with 2001.
Interest rate risk The Group borrows at fixed and floating rates of interest as deemed appropriate for its circumstances.
Where necessary the Group uses several interest rate swaps to achieve the desired interest rate profile.
During the year the Group had several cancellable, floating rate, interest rate swaps on 30 million of the 6% convertible bond liability.
The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities is set out in notes a and b respectively.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by third parties to financial instruments.
The Group does not expect any third parties to fail to meet their obligations given the policy of selecting only parties with high credit ratings and minimising its exposure to any one institution.
In the numerical disclosures that follow, short-term debtors and creditors that arise directly as a result of the Groups operations are excluded from all disclosures with the exception of note f on currency exposures.

The table below shows the extent to which the Group has off-balance sheet unrecognised and on-balance sheet deferred gains and losses in respect of hedges at the beginning and end of the year: 31 December 2002 Unrecognised Deferred Gains Losses Net Total Gains Losses Net Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Gains losses on hedges at 1 January 2002 31 31 20 20 Changes in value from 1 January 2002 to settlement 262 262 Gains losses arising in 2001 recognised in 2002 231 231 20 20 Gains losses not recognised in 2002 arising before 1 January 2002 Arising in 2002 598 98 500 Gains losses on hedges at 31 December 2002 598 98 500 At 31 December 2002, the Company had European style accrual forward options to purchase 154,000 of Swiss francs each week for the 26 weeks ending in July 2002 and 71,000 of Euro each week for the 14 weeks ending in April 2002.
At 31 December 2002, the Company had agreements in place for American style accrual forward options, commencing in January 2003, to purchase 113,000 of US dollars for the 44 weeks ending in November 2003 and 44,000 of Swedish Krona each week for the 45 weeks ending in November 2003.
Both of these structures lapsed in January and February 2003 respectively.
At 31 December 2002, the Company had forward currency contracts to purchase 4.5 million of Swiss francs, 1.1 million of Euro and 0.5 million of Swedish Krona.
The excess of fair values over book values for currency options shown in note 25 e represents the unrecognised hedging gain on these instruments as at 31 December 2002.
The actual gains or losses arising on these currency options will be dependent on future exchange rates and will be recognised in the profit and loss account, in 2003, as the operational transactions to which they are linked occur.
Unrecognised gains at 31 December 2002 include 0.5 million in relation to the cancellable swap agreement.
This is based upon the swap agreement continuing for the life of the convertible bond and as such the gain would be spread in the profit and loss account until 2005.
The Royal Bank of Scotland exercised its right to cancel the swap on 19 December 2001 and was replaced with a comparable swap on 27 February 2002.
Similarly, it was again cancelled and replaced on 15 December 2002.
