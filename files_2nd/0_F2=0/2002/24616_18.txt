3 Long-term Incentive Plan and Special Long-term Incentive Plan HBOS Directors and former Halifax Directors Details of the shares which have been conditionally awarded to Directors under the plans are set out below.
The performance conditions relating to these conditional awards are set out in the notes below the table.
The grants effective from January 2001 and January 2002 for Phil Hodkinson include 53,435 shares and 43,750 shares, respectively, which are related to his joining arrangements.
Note 3: Awards are not pensionable.
Note 4: Subject to performance and subject also to a minimum release of 60% of the grant, as agreed by Halifax shareholders at the time of the merger, shares granted under the long-term plans effective from January 2000 and January 2001 will be released to most individuals shortly after the three-year anniversary three and a half-year anniversary in respect of the grant effective from July 1999 of the relevant effective grant date.
However, shares receivable by Executive Directors and the Chairman from those grants will be retained by them or on their behalves for at least an additional two years.
For the 2002 grant, all participants can choose to take any shares released after three years or can continue to participate in the scheme for a further two years and take shares at that point based on the better of the three year and the five year performance outcome.
This design feature seeks to motivate participants continually to sustain strong performance or to improve lesser performance for their benefit and the benefit of shareholders.

For technical reasons he will become entitled to the cash value of the relevant shares on vesting.
This value will, subject to any withholdings for tax or National Insurance, be applied in acquiring shares on his behalf.
Note 6: The number of shares to be released to participants is dependent on the Groups TSR over a three year three and a half-year in respect of the grant effective from July 1999 period, compared to the annualised weighted average TSR of a basket of comparator companies over an equivalent period.
This basket of companies comprises:- For the July 1999 and January 2000 grants: Abbey National, Alliance & Leicester, Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Britannic Assurance, Legal & General, Lloyds TSB, NatWest, Northern Rock, Norwich Union, Prudential, Royal & Sun Alliance, Royal Bank of Scotland and Woolwich : For the January 2001 grants: Abbey National, Alliance & Leicester, Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Britannic Assurance, Legal & General, Lloyds TSB, Northern Rock, Prudential, Royal & Sun Alliance and Royal Bank of Scotland: For the January 2002 grants: Abbey National, Aviva, Barclays, Legal & General, Lloyds TSB, Prudential, Royal & Sun Alliance and Royal Bank of Scotland.
