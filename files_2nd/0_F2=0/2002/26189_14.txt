The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies SORP.
All of the Groups operations are of a continuing nature.
ii Basis of consolidation: The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of The Law Debenture Corporation p. l. c. and its subsidiaries made up to the end of the financial year.
iii Recognition of income and expenses: a Investment Trust: Dividends receivable from equity shares are taken to the revenue account on an ex-dividend basis: interest payable and receivable are accounted for on an accrual basis: expenses which are incidental to the purchase or sale of an investment are included within the cost or deducted from the proceeds of the investment: expenses of the investment trust are all allocated to revenue b Trustee services: Bank deposit interest receivable, recurring fees receivable, administration expenses and interest payable are all accounted for on an accruals basis: where single payments are received relating to trusteeships with a duration of one or more years, that part relating to the year of receipt is accounted for on an accruals basis with the balance deferred into future years: fees calculated by reference to time spent are credited when billed: other non-recurring fees are recognised on a receipts basis: where trustee expenses are recoverable from third parties, the recoveries and expenses are not included as income or expense.
iv Tangible fixed assets: Tangible fixed assets are recorded at historic purchase cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation has been calculated to write off the cost of all tangible fixed assets over the estimated useful lives of the relevant assets as follows: Leasehold improvements............................................................ over the lease period Office furniture and equipment.................................................. 3 10 years v Listed investments: The market valuation of listed investments is based on closing middle market prices.
No taxation or expenses which might result from a sale of the investments at the balance sheet date have been taken into account.
vi Unlisted investments: Unlisted investments are valued by the directors at cost or, where appropriate, at directors valuation.
vii Deferred income: Trustee fees received in respect of periods subsequent to the balance sheet date are carried forward as deferred income.
viii Capital reserves: Realised and unrealised capital gains and losses, together with exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are reflected through capital reserves.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of net assets of overseas subsidiaries are also taken to capital reserves.
ix Foreign currencies: Transactions recorded in foreign currencies during the year are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date.
x Operating leases: Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the life of the lease term.
xi Financial instruments: In accordance with FRS4 Capital Instruments, long term borrowings are stated at the amount of net proceeds immediately after issue.
The finance costs on such borrowings, being the difference between the net proceeds of a borrowing and the total payments that may be required in respect of that borrowing, are allocated to periods over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
38 Law Debenture Notes to the accounts continued 1 Statement of accounting policies continued xii Liquid resources: For the purposes of analysing assets, liquid resources include all readily realisable short term investments such as in money market funds as well as bank deposits.
xiii Pension plan: Contributions to the Corporations pension plan are charged to the revenue account so as to spread the cost of pension benefits over employees expected working lives with the Corporation.
xiv Deferred taxation: Deferred taxation is provided for using the full provision method following the adoption of Financial Reporting Standard No.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
This represents a change in accounting policy as more fully disclosed in note 17 as deferred tax was previously provided for using the partial provision method to the extent that it was probable that a liability would crystallise.
All staff are engaged in the provision of trustee and related services.
Other fees paid to the former auditors during the year amounted to 47,000 2001: 62,000 in respect of taxation and other services.
These figures do not include fees receivable by the auditors for work undertaken by them in connection with trusts for example, pension funds of which a member of the Group acts as trustee and whose trust deed requires or permits professional advice to be obtained or audits to be undertaken.
These figures do include fees for audits of certain trusts of which a member of the group is a trustee, where the trustee has voluntarily commissioned an audit.

There are no other directors for whom there is an accrued pension entitlement.
Details of options held and the emoluments of each director are shown in the Remuneration report starting on page 27.
All other interest continues to be allocated to the investment trust.
On this basis, the group tax charge is expected to remain significantly below the 30% standard UK rate.
Capital return per share is based on net capital losses for the year of 60,467,000 2001 loss: 34,684,000.
The calculations of both revenue and capital returns per share are based on 116,910,732 2001: 116,707,525 shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted revenue and capital returns per share are calculated using 116,914,356 2001: 119,117,975 shares being the diluted weighted average number of shares in issue during the year assuming exercise of options at less than fair value, and the revenue and capital returns shown above.
The following undertakings have not been included in the Group consolidation as the Corporations ability to exercise its rights as a parent company over the assets and management of these undertakings is severely restricted by contractual agreements with other parties.
The Group received a fee of 182,657 2001: 118,741 in respect of these undertakings.
Granite Mortgages 02-2 plc RTL Shareholder SVC Limited There were no amounts outstanding with these undertakings at the year end 2001: NIL 44 Law Debenture Notes to the accounts continued 13 Investments continued The Corporation, or a subsidiary thereof, owns all the issued share capital of the following principal subsidiaries.

As a result the financial statements have been restated to reflect this change in accounting policy.
The directors consider the adoption of this policy gives a fairer presentation of the results and financial position of the Group and Corporation.
A change in accounting policy gives rise to a provision for deferred taxation as at 31 December 2002 of 63,000 of which 13,000 arises in the year ended 31 December 2002, 41,000 arises in the year ended 31 December 2001 and the balance of 9,000 relates to 2000 and prior periods.
The prior period adjustment gives rise to a decrease in reserves of 50,000 Note 21 which has been stated as a prior year adjustment in calculating total gains recognised since the last Annual Report in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
The change in accounting policy has resulted in an increase in the extra tax charge of 13,000 in the 2002 accounts and 41,000 in the 2001 accounts Note 9 46 Law Debenture Notes to the accounts continued 18 Share capital 2002 2001 000 000 Authorised share capital 133,000,000 ordinary shares of 5p each............................................................................................................. 6,650 6,650 6,650 6,650 Allotted, issued and fully paid share capital 117,021,660 2001: 116,796,595 ordinary shares of 5p each................................................................. 5,851 5,840 5,851 5,840 During the year to 31 December 2002, 225,065 shares were allotted under the SAYE Scheme and Executive Share Option Scheme for a total consideration of 387,800 which includes a premium of 376,547 During the year, 91,415 options were granted under the Corporations SAYE scheme and 31,205 under the Executive Share Option Scheme.

48 Law Debenture Notes to the accounts continued 22 Financial instruments The Groups investment objective is to achieve long term capital growth and steadily increasing income through investing in a diverse portfolio of investments spread both geographically and by sector.
In pursuit of this objective, the Group has the power to deploy the following financial instruments:- Equities and fixed interest securities Cash, short term investments and deposits, and working capital arising from the Groups operations Debentures, term loans and bank overdrafts to allow the Group to raise finance Derivative transactions to manage any of the risks arising from the use of the above instruments It remains the Groups policy that no trading in derivatives is undertaken.
The principal risks facing the Group in the conduct of its investment management are:- market price risk, arising from uncertainty in the future value of financial instruments.
The Board maintains policy guidelines whereby a spread of investments in different geographical regions reduces the risk arising from factors relating to a particular country.
In addition the stock selections and transactions are actively monitored throughout the year by the investment manager, who reports to the Board on a regular basis to review past performance and develop future strategy.
foreign currency risk, arising from movements in currency rates applicable to the Groups assets, liabilities and transactions denominated in currencies other than sterling.
Risks are reduced by an international spread of investments and selective currency borrowings at levels to ensure that such hedging is limited to the related asset exposure of each currency.
The Groups assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than sterling were:- 2002 2001 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities millions millions millions millions US Dollar 17.6 0.5 31.3 0.9 Euro 25.3 32.5 Danish Krone 1.4 2.1 Greek Drachma 0.5 0.8 Swedish Kroner 0.9 2.1 Swiss Franc 5.7 5.2 Hong Kong Dollar 0.3 0.5 51.7 0.5 74.5 0.9 The holdings in the Henderson Japan Capital Growth and Pacific Capital Growth OEICs are denominated in sterling but have underlying assets in foreign currencies equivalent to 16.7 million.
49 Law Debenture Notes to the accounts continued 22 Financial instruments continued liquidity risk, arising from any difficulty in realising assets or raising funds to meet commitments associated with any of the above financial instruments.
To minimise this risk, the Boards policy guidelines only permit investment in equities and fixed interest securities quoted in major financial markets.
In addition, cash balances and overdraft facilities are maintained commensurate with likely future settlements.
The liquidity profile of the Groups liabilities at 31 December 2002 was:- millions Within one year 13.9 Between one and two years 1.1 Between three and five years 5.5 Over five years 41.9 Undrawn overdraft facilities of 443,000 are also available to the Corporation.
Of the Groups gross assets of 262 million, over 99% are realisable within one year.
interest rate risk, arising from movements in interest rates on borrowing, deposits and short term investments.
The Board reviews the mix of fixed and floating rate exposures and ensures that gearing levels are appropriate to the current and anticipated market environment.
The Groups interest rate profile at 31 December 2002 was:- millions Sterling HK Dollars US Dollars Fixed rate assets Floating rate assets 19.5 0.3 2.3 Fixed rate liabilities 39.2 Floating rate liabilities 0.5 Weighted average fixed rate 6.13% fixed for 32 years credit risk, arising from the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of their contract.
In practice, the Board considers that this risk is low, since investment trust transactions are settled on the basis of delivery against payment.
Fair value The directors are of the opinion that the financial assets and liabilities of the Group are stated at fair value in the balance sheet.
The fully diluted net asset value is based upon the diluted number of shares in issue of 117,023,420 2001: 118,395,195 shares, assuming exercise of options at less than fair value.
All references to shares in issue reflect the share split in August 2002.
