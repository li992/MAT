Management believes that exclusion of these non-recurring items provides a better comparison of business performance for the periods presented.
Statutory results include these non-recurring items.
This information is provided as a supplement to that included in the consolidated statement of profit and loss on pages 76 and 77 prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
The Group, as a multinational business, operates in many countries and earns revenues and incurs costs in many currencies.
The results of the Group, as reported in sterling, are therefore affected by movements in exchange rates between sterling and overseas currencies.
The Group uses the average exchange rates prevailing during the year to translate the results of overseas companies into sterling.
The currencies which most inuence these translations are the US dollar, the Euro and the Japanese Yen.
During 2002 average sterling exchange rates were stronger against the US dollar and the Japanese Yen by four per cent and seven per cent, respectively, and weaker against the Euro by one per cent, compared with 2001.
In order to illustrate underlying performance, it is the Groups practice to discuss its results in terms of constant exchange rate CER growth.
This represents growth calculated as if the exchange rates used to determine the results of overseas companies in sterling had remained unchanged from those used in the previous year.
The discussion in this report is therefore in terms of CER unless otherwise stated.
% represents growth at actual exchange rates.
CER% represents growth at constant exchange rates.
During 2002 FRS 19 Deferred tax has been implemented by the Group.
This FRS requires deferred tax to be accounted for on a full provision basis, rather than a partial provision basis as in 2001 and earlier years.
This change has been accounted for as a prior year adjustment and comparative information has been restated as necessary.
Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements The Group's reports led with the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC, including this document and written information released, or oral statements made, to the public in the future by or on behalf of the Group, may contain forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements give the Group's current expectations or forecasts of future events.
An investor can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.
They use words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, intend, will, project, plan, believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance.
In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and financial results.
The Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties.
The Group cautions investors that a number of important factors including those in this document could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.
Such factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Risk factors on pages 64 and 65 of this Annual Report.
