Under the Combined Code the increase in pension is the increase during the year net of inflation and the increase in the transfer value represents the transfer value of that increase.
Under the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations the increase in pension relates to the difference between the accumulated pensions at the end of 2001, and 2002.
Also disclosed is the transfer value of the accumulated pensions at 31 December 2002 and 2001.
The increase in transfer value for 2002 is the difference between these values, and represents an obligation on the pension fund where funded or the Company where unfunded they are not sums paid or due to the director.
Although the director may have had an increase in pension benefits over the year, the fall in equity markets since the beginning of 2002 may have resulted in a reduced transfer value.
Payments to former directors No payments or awards were made to former directors during the year, and no former directors received any increase in retirement benefits in excess of the amount to which they were entitled on the later of the date when the benefits first became payable or 31 March 1997.
No compensation for loss of office was made to any director, or former director, during the year.
