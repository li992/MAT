34 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2002 Notes to the Accounts For the year ended 31 December 2002 1 Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
A summary of the principal accounting policies, which, except for the first time adoption of FRS 19 Deferred tax referred to in i below, have been applied consistently, is set out below: a Accounting convention The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention as modied by the revaluation of freehold and long leasehold properties.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheet include the financial statements of the company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to the end of the financial year.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of their acquisition or up to the date of their disposal.
Inter-company sales and profits are eliminated on consolidation.
c Goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between the fair value of a business or company acquired, as represented by the consideration paid, and the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and trading assets is capitalised at cost and subsequently amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life up to a maximum of 20 years.
This reects the period over which the directors estimate that the value of the underlying businesses acquired is expected to exceed the value of the underlying assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed for impairment, in accordance with FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets and FRS 11 Impairment of xed assets and goodwill, at the end of the first full year after acquisition and in other years if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Any impairment assessed is charged to the profit and loss account.
Under the transitional arrangements of FRS 10, up to 31 December 1997 goodwill arising on acquisitions was brought in at cost and offset rstly against negative goodwill arising during the year on similar acquisitions, secondly against available reserves and thereafter against retained profits brought forward.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1 January 1998 has not been reinstated.
On the subsequent disposal of any business to which previously written off goodwill attaches, the related amount is charged or credited in the profit and loss account as appropriate.
Cumulative goodwill relating to acquisitions made prior to 1998, excluding subsequent disposals, written off against reserves since 1 January 1989 amounted to 53 million.
The directors do not consider it practicable to extract information in respect of earlier periods.
Deferred consideration in respect of acquisitions is discounted using an appropriate discount rate, in accordance with FRS 7 Fair values in acquisition accounting.
d Turnover Turnover, which is exclusive of value added tax and transactions nanced within the group, comprises: Instalment credit agreements Revenue earned e below.
Goods and services Gross amounts of goods or services supplied.
Debt collection Fees and commission income on external debt recovered and gross amounts collected on purchased debt.
Brokerage Fees and commission income on loan applications referred to lenders.
Finance leases Revenue earned n below.
Factoring Interest and charges receivable on debts factored.
e Instalment credit revenue recognition An initial amount of the gross revenue is credited to the profit and loss account, mainly to cover the costs associated with the setting up of the transaction.
Deferred revenue comprises the remaining amount of gross revenue which is carried forward in customers accounts receivable.
This is calculated to adequately cover future collecting and nancing costs and to allow for an appropriate contribution to profits in subsequent accounting periods.
In respect of home collected credit, deferred revenue is released to profit on a straight line basis in proportion to the reduction in the collectible amount.
Deferred revenue on monthly instalment credit is released on a rule of 78 basis over the lesser of the contracted and effective term of the agreement.
Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2002 35 1 Accounting policies continued f Pension funding The group operates a dened benefit pension scheme, the assets of which are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The expected cost of pensions is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the service life of employees in the scheme.
Variations from the regular costs are spread over the average expected remaining working lives of current members in the scheme.
The pension cost is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualied actuaries.
The transitional disclosure requirements under FRS 17 Retirement benets have been adopted in these financial statements and are explained more fully in note 8.
The scheme was closed to new entrants from 1998.
The group also operates a dened contribution scheme introduced in 1998.
The pension cost in respect of this scheme is the contributions payable.
Payments made to personal pension plans are charged to the profit and loss account as they become payable.
The group provides no other post-retirement benets to its employees or directors.
g Customers accounts receivable Customers accounts receivable consist of amounts outstanding under instalment credit agreements, finance leases and factoring agreements including repayments not yet due at the year end, less appropriate provision for bad and doubtful debts based upon the individual assessment of accounts and formulae related to past experience.
h Default debt Default debt purchased by The Lewis Group is included at cost and is normally amortised over a period not exceeding six years at a rate based on the expected recoverability of the debt.
i Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise, based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in different periods from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
The adoption of FRS 19 Deferred tax has not led to any prior year adjustment.
j Stocks Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
k Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included at cost, unless, in the opinion of the directors, a permanent diminution in value has occurred, in which case the deficiency is provided for and charged in the companys profit and loss account.
l Investments own shares held Own shares held represent the cost of shares in the company held by the trustee of the Employee benefit Trust in respect of the Restricted Share Scheme and are disclosed as xed asset investments, in accordance with UITF 13 Accounting for ESOP trusts.
Information in respect of this scheme, together with details of conditional awards of shares under the scheme, is shown in the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration on pages 21, 22, 26 and 27.
36 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2002 Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies continued m Tangible xed assets and depreciation The cost of xed assets is their purchase cost together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of tangible xed assets on a straight line basis by reference to the estimated useful economic life and residual value of the assets concerned, at the following principal rates: Freehold buildings 2% per annum Long leasehold buildings 2% per annum Short leasehold expenditure 5% to 20% per annum Fixtures and equipment 10% to 20% per annum 1 Computer equipment 20% to 33 3% per annum Motor vehicles 20% per annum Assets held for rental 20% per annum Depreciation is not provided on freehold and long leasehold land.
As permitted under the transitional arrangements of FRS 15 Tangible xed assets, the group has chosen to retain the book values of land and buildings which were previously revalued, and not to revalue the assets in the future.
Fixed assets are reviewed for impairment, in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of xed assets and goodwill.
If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, any impairment in value is charged to the revaluation reserve or the profit and loss account, as appropriate.
n Leasing As lessor: Assets owned and leased out to customers under operating lease agreements are recorded as xed assets.
Rental income is recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
The amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as customers accounts receivable at the amount of the net investment in the lease.
The total gross earnings are allocated to accounting periods to give a constant periodic rate of return on the net cash investment in each period.
As lessee: Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at their fair value on the inception of the agreement and depreciated over the shorter of the period of the agreement and the estimated useful economic lives of the assets.
The finance charges are allocated over the period of the agreement in proportion to the capital amount outstanding and are charged to the profit and loss account.
Operating leases: Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease on a straight line basis.
o Interest rate hedging The cost of any premium paid for the purchase of an interest rate cap or collar is amortised on a straight line basis over the life of the contract and reected in the profit and loss account in the total charge for interest on borrowings.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of financial hedging instruments are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the contracts.

3 Holding company profit and loss account As part of the integration of the businesses of Shopacheck Financial Services Limited and Welcome Financial Services Limited, the available distributable reserves of each company, amounting in aggregate to 130.0 million, were paid or proposed as dividends to the holding company in respect of the year ended 31 December 2002.
Consequently, the consolidated profit includes 148.0 million 2001: 28.5 million, before the elimination of inter-company dividends, which has been dealt with in the financial statements of the company.
The company has taken advantage of section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 and has not included its own profit and loss account in these financial statements.

38 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2002 Notes to the Accounts 5 Taxation 2002 2001 The charge for taxation based on the profit for the year is as follows: 000 000 Current tax: UK corporation tax at 30% 2001: 30% 28,486 21,768 Adjustments in respect of previous years 595 3,168 27,891 24,936 Deferred tax: Origination and reversal of timing differences 2,051 465 Adjustments in respect of previous years 1,117 3,310 26,957 22,091 The charge for the year was reduced by 307,000 2001: 72,000 as a result of the contribution made to the Cattles QUEST to satisfy the exercise of SAYE share options by employees under the Cattles Employee Sharesave Scheme.
The standard rate of tax for the year, based on the UK standard rate of corporation tax, is 30% 2001: 30%.
The actual tax charge for the current and the previous year is less than the standard rate for the reasons set out in the following reconciliation: 2002 2001 000 000 profit on ordinary activities before tax 93,609 75,828 Tax on profit on ordinary activities at standard rate 28,083 22,748 Factors affecting charge for the year: Accounting depreciation in excess of capital allowances 979 523 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes including goodwill amortisation 66 739 Isle of Man tax charged at lower rate than UK standard rate 1,407 1,135 QUEST deduction 307 72 Movement on short term timing differences 1,072 11 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous years 595 3,168 Current tax charge for the year 27,891 24,936 Provided Unprovided The amounts of deferred tax provided and 2002 2001 2002 2001 unprovided in the accounts are as follows: 000 000 000 000 Group Capital allowances 1,209 830 81 Revaluation surplus and rollover relief 80 80 Other timing differences 390 910 819 80 1 80 Company Capital allowances 50 Other timing differences 2,160 2,091 2,160 2,141 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2002 39 5 Taxation continued Group Company The movement in the deferred tax asset liability during the year was as follows: 000 000 As at 1 January 2002 80 2,141 Arising on acquisitions 35 profit and loss account credit charge 934 19 As at 31 December 2002 note 16 819 2,160 6 Dividends 2002 2001 2002 2001 pence pence 000 000 Interim 3.40 2.95 10,146 9,537 Proposed final 7.00 6.05 22,847 18,015 10.40 9.00 32,993 27,552 Dividends of 126,000 2001: 93,000 have been waived by the trustee of the Employee benefit Trust in respect of those shares held under the Restricted Share Scheme.

The total value of shares vested in directors during the year under the Restricted Share Scheme was 617,000 2001: 607,000.
A detailed analysis of all directors emoluments, including salaries, benets in kind, performance related bonuses, share options, long term incentives and pension arrangements, is provided in the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration on pages 25 to 29 and forms part of these financial statements.
The average monthly number of persons employed by the group during the year 2002 2001 was as follows: Number Number Consumer Division 4,035 3,841 Corporate Division 130 125 Central Support Services 173 176 Total 4,338 4,142 40 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2002 Notes to the Accounts 8 Pension costs SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs The group operates a funded dened benefit pension scheme for employees which is contracted out of the state scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately in a trustee administered fund.
Contributions to the scheme are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualied actuary using the projected unit method.
This scheme was closed to new entrants from 1998.
Actuarial valuations are normally carried out triennially, the most recent valuation being as at 31 March 2001.
At that date the market value of the assets of the scheme was 34.0 million excluding assets relating to members additional voluntary contributions, representing 84% of the market-related value of the benets that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The assumptions, relative to price ination, which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation, are those relating to the rate of return on investments, the rate of increase in earnings, and the rate of equity dividend growth.
For the valuation, it was assumed that the investment return would exceed price ination by 3.8% per annum existing investments and 4.5% per annum future investments, salary increases would exceed price ination by 2.0% per annum, and dividend growth would exceed price ination by 1.2% per annum.
These assumptions have also been used to calculate the pension cost for accounting purposes.
The funding shortfall disclosed has been spread over 10 years, representing the average expected future working lives of scheme members, using the straight line method.
The cumulative excess of pension cost over the groups contributions at 31 December 2002 amounted to 0.8 million compared with 1.3 million at the previous year end.
A reduction of 0.5 million has therefore been credited in the current year in respect of this decrease and is included within the group charge for pension cost for this scheme for the year of 1.9 million 2001: 2.1 million.
With effect from 1 April 2002, the group has paid contributions to the pension scheme of 2.6 times member contributions, together with, during the year, supplementary contributions of 0.7 million based on the shortfall determined at the previous actuarial valuation at 2001 and additional contributions, to meet contractual commitments to members benets of 0.5 million.
In 2003 the company is expected to continue to contribute to the fund at a rate of 2.6 times member contributions, and the supplementary contributions will amount to 0.9 million.
Members have contributed at the rate of either 3% or 5% of pensionable salaries, depending on their membership status, throughout the accounting period.
The group also operates a dened contribution group personal pension scheme for new employees and existing employees who are not members of the dened benefit pension scheme.
The pension cost in respect of this scheme is the contribution payable of 0.8 million 2001: 0.9 million.
FRS 17 Retirement benets As noted above, the group operates a dened benefit pension scheme for certain staff.
The scheme is funded and is contracted out of the state scheme.
Under the projected unit method, the current service cost will increase as a percentage of pensionable salaries as members approach retirement.
However, as the contributing membership reduces, pensionable payroll is expected to reduce over the longer term, and this is likely to more than offset the rising contribution rate.
The last formal valuation of the scheme was performed as at 31 March 2001 by a professionally qualied actuary.
A further valuation is due to be made as at 2004.
In addition, and in accordance with FRS 17 Retirement benets, a funding review of the scheme was carried out by the independent qualied actuary as at 31 December 2002.

It is not possible to identify the share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the Fund relating to individual participating employers.
As such, in accordance with FRS 17, the company will account for its liability to the Fund as if it were a dened contribution scheme.
Thus no disclosure of the balance sheet position will be made and the charge to profit and loss under FRS 17 in future years will represent the actual contributions paid by the company.
The rates of contribution are as shown above and are the same for all participating employers.
Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2002 43 9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding own shares held note 13 which are treated, for this purpose, as being cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
