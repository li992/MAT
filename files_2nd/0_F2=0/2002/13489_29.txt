Exceptional Items In 2002, non-operating exceptional items comprised a profit of 39.5 million on the sale of the Groups aerated concrete businesses, Durox and YTONG, and its concrete products business in the Netherlands, after charging goodwill previously written off to reserves of 51.3 million shown as profit on disposal of discontinued operations, a loss of 13.9 million on the withdrawal from certain non-core operations in the USA and Germany shown as loss on disposal termination of continuing operations and a profit of 1.7 million on the disposal of fixed assets and investments in the USA and Germany.
Operating exceptional items of 31.4 million comprised anticipated fines for anti-competitive activities and associated legal costs totalling 15.9 million, principally arising from the German Federal Cartel Office investigation into the cement industry, redundancy costs arising from the Groups business review of 9.5 million, abortive disposal costs of 3.4 million and a write-down of the shares held by the Trustee of the Long Term Incentive Plan to market value at 31 December 2002 amounting to 2.6 million.
In addition there was a goodwill impairment in the Groups associate, Huttig Building Products, Inc. in the USA of 4.1 million.
In 2001, non-operating exceptional items comprised a loss of 14.4 million on the disposal of the Groups interest in Tilbury Aggregates in Great Britain and the concrete products business in France these items are shown as a loss on disposal of continuing operations, and a gain of 5.2 million on the sale of office buildings in Germany, shown as profit on disposal of fixed assets.
The loss on disposal in continuing operations included 0.8 million of goodwill written back on the concrete products business in France.
There were no operating exceptional items in 2001.
This years tax charge has benefited from the utilisation of past tax losses and the release of prior year provisions following closure with tax authorities.
There are no known specific factors that will impact the deferred tax charge in future years.
Taxation continued FRS 19 Deferred Tax has been adopted with effect from 1 January 2002.
The effect of restating the prior year comparatives is as follows: Group 2001 m Profit and loss account Increase in taxation charge 15.4 Decrease in minority interest charge 1.3 Decrease in basic earnings per share 5.4 p Balance sheet Decrease in shareholders equity funds 188.3 Decrease in minority interests 9.8 555555555555555555555555155551555511111 551 Decrease in total capital and reserves 198.1 555555555555555555555555155551555511111 551 555555555555555555555555155551555511111 551 Applying the principles of SSAP 15 Accounting for Deferred Taxation to the results for 2002 would not materially alter the tax charge or earnings per share.

The number of shares used for calculating basic earnings per share was 265,082,150 2001: 264,132,437.
The number of shares used for calculating diluted earnings per share, taking into account employee share option schemes, was 265,686,708 2001: 265,150,206. c Supplementary basic and diluted earnings per share have been calculated to exclude the effect of goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
The adjusted numbers have been provided in order that the effects of goodwill amortisation and exceptional items on reported earnings can be fully appreciated.

c Pension schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The majority of these schemes are self-administered and are separately funded.
The schemes assets are held independently of the Groups finances, with the exception of those in Germany, which are financed mainly by internal provisions.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent,  actuaries.
The main schemes in the UK are of the defined benefit type and in Germany and the USA both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes are operated.
The results of the most recent valuations or reviews of the main defined benefit schemes were as follows: UK Germany USA Date of last valuation review 31 March 2001 31 Dec 2001 31 Dec 2002 Method used projected unit projected unit projected unit Market value of investments 463.2m 15.0m 12.5m Assumed return on assets exceeds salary inflation by 1.75% 3.0% 4.5% Level of external funding 119% 15% 54% Charge during year 7.7m 7.2m 0.9m Total provision 15.6m 94.8m 1.3m 5555555555555555555555551551 1111551 551 551 UK The four main defined benefit schemes undertook full formal actuarial valuations as at 31 March 2001.
The disclosed surplus in the largest fund has enabled the employing companies to continue to make contributions at a rate below the full ongoing funding rate until at least the next triennial valuation of the Fund.
During the year the two defined benefit schemes operated by The Rugby Group Limited were transferred into the RMC Pension Fund, and are included in the table above for the UK.
The level of external funding in the main Rugby Scheme was 98% and the return on assets was assumed to exceed salary inflation by 1.0%.
As a result of the transfer and the uncertain market conditions, it has been agreed that the next full actuarial valuation will be calculated as at 31 March 2003.
Germany The funding of the defined benefit schemes is met mainly by a book reserve.
The provision shown above relates to the book reserve held in the accounts of companies in the Readymix AG group.
A proportion being provided through external insurance arrangements.
The value of investments and level of external funding shown above reflects these insurance arrangements.
The above provision no longer includes the liability for employees of YTONG which RMC sold during the year.
The pension charges relating to other foreign schemes comply with the policy of providing for pensions on systematic and rational bases, so that the charges represent a consistent proportion of the related payroll costs.
d Post-retirement benefits The Group provides post-retirement healthcare, mainly in the UK and the USA to certain groups of its retired employees.
The Group conforms with the provisions of the Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 6 Accounting for Post-retirement Benefits other than Pensions which require accrual of these costs over the period during which employees become eligible for such benefits.
At 31 December 2002 the provision for both the UK and the USA totals 15.6 million 2001: 15.0 million, of which 8.1 million 2001: 7.6 million relates to the UK and 7.5 million 2001: 7.4 million relates to the USA.
Independent qualified actuaries have calculated these provisions.
The actuaries have assumed rates of inflation for medical expenses of 5% a year UK and 9% USA and discount rates of 5.5% a year UK and 7.3% USA.
RMC Group Annual Report and Accounts 2002 56 9.
Employees and Directors continued e FRS 17 Retirement Benefits The valuations used for the FRS 17 disclosures with respect to the UK funds have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations at 31 March 2001 and updated by the scheme actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities at 31 December 2002.
In Germany and the USA actuarial reviews were completed at 31 December 2001 and 31 December 2002 respectively.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value on 31 December 2002.
For all arrangements in each of the three countries the projected unit method of valuation was adopted.
The principal defined benefit schemes operated by the Group are in the UK, Germany and the USA.
These schemes cover over 95% of the Groups defined benefit pension liabilities.
The related deferred tax for Germany has been calculated on the difference between the deficit under FRS 17 and the book reserves held locally.
These book reserves are calculated in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary and are believed to be sufficient to meet the pension liabilities in this country.
Annual Report and Accounts 2002 RMC Group 57 Notes to the Accounts at 31 December 2002 9.
The impact of this disposal has been treated as a non-operating related exceptional item in the profit and loss account and has therefore not been recognised as a curtailment gain within FRS 17.

The SSAP 24 charge for the accounts for the largest defined benefit scheme UK is based on the last formal valuation carried out at 31 March 2001 when a surplus existed.
The valuation carried out using the different assumptions implicit in FRS 17 for the 2002 disclosures of the same scheme results in a deficit, reflecting the significant downturn in equity markets during 2001 and 2002.
Having discussed the position with the Companys actuaries and reviewed the information provided for FRS 17 the Directors are satisfied that the charge made in 2002 is appropriate.
In view of the market movements however, the next full formal valuation for that fund under SSAP 24 has been brought forward and will be carried out as at 31 March 2003.
Disposals primarily relate to the sale of YTONG.

Derivatives and other financial instruments The Group Finance Directors review on pages 26 and 27 provides an explanation of the role that financial instruments have had during the period in creating or changing the risks the Group faces in its activities.
The explanation summarises the objectives and policies for holding or issuing financial instruments and similar contracts, and the strategies for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the period.
The numerical disclosures in this note deal with financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in Financial Reporting Standard 13 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures FRS 13.
For this purpose non-equity interests are dealt with in the disclosures in the same way as the Groups financial liabilities, but separately disclosed.
Certain financial assets such as investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated undertakings are also excluded from the scope of these disclosures.
As permitted by FRS 13, short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures.
RMC Group Annual Report and Accounts 2002 70 29.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued a Interest rate profile The Groups financial assets of 212.4 million comprise cash and short-term deposits of 129.0 million, other investments of 4.8 million, loans to joint ventures and associated undertakings of 18.0 million see Note 13 and debtors due after more than one year of 60.6 million see Note 15.
Short-term cash deposits are placed at money market rates appropriate to the relevant currency of deposit with certain elements held at no interest on bank current accounts.
Certain small short-term sterling borrowings are linked to base rate and certain small US dollar borrowings are linked to the Prime Rate.
Further information relating to interest rates on long-term borrowings is provided in Note 19.
The Group also has provisions of a contractual nature amounting to 12.0 million 2001: 7.9 million, the timing of which cannot be determined with certainty and for which no interest rate profile is shown.
b Currency exposures As explained in the Group Finance Directors review on pages 26 and 27, the Group considers a variety of issues including interest rate levels and tax in determining the appropriate level of borrowings in each currency which are used as a hedge against the currency translation exposures arising from its net investment overseas.
Gains and losses arising from these translation exposures are recognised in the Statement of total recognised gains and losses on page 48.
Annual Report and Accounts 2002 RMC Group 71 Notes to the Accounts at 31 December 2002 29.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Because of the nature of its business, the Group experiences little currency exchange transaction exposure.
Such exposures would arise as a result of monetary assets and liabilities being denominated in a currency other than the operating currency of the relevant operating unit and any gains or losses would be recognised in the profit and loss account.
Because the Group considers its transaction exposures to be immaterial, no disclosure of such exposures is provided.

Derivatives and other financial instruments continued f Gains and losses on hedges The Group enters into interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate profile and cross currency swaps to alter the currency profile of its borrowings.
The effect of the cross currency elements of swaps is recognised by revaluation of the currency of swap liability at the accounting date and hence currency elements of swaps are revalued on balance sheet.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is not recognised in the financial statements until the hedged position matures, i. e. interest is accrued or paid.
