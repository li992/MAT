54 Capita Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31st December 2002 1 Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The accounts comply, to the extent detailed below, with the following new Financial Reporting Standards issued by the UK Accounting Standards Board.
FRS17 Retirement benefits This standard replaces the use of actuarial values for assets in a defined benefit pension scheme with a market value approach.
Fluctuations in market values will be reflected in the statement of recognised gains and losses whilst the standard requires the profit and loss account to show the service cost, the interest cost and the expected return on scheme assets.
The Group has complied with the transitional disclosure requirements of the standard.
FRS19 Deferred taxation The adoption of FRS19 has resulted in a change in accounting policy for deferred taxation.
Deferred taxation is recognised on a full provision basis in accordance with the accounting policy described below.
Previously, deferred taxation was provided for on a partial basis, whereby provision was made on all timing differences to the extent that they were expected to reverse in the future without replacement.
Compliance with this standard has necessitated a restatement of figures reported for prior periods.
The impact of this change in accounting policy is disclosed in note 18.
The Group continues to comply with FRS18 Accounting Policies, which is concerned with the selection, application and disclosure of accounting policies in the accounts.
b Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and each of its subsidiary undertakings.
Subsidiary undertakings are accounted for from the effective date of acquisition until the effective date of disposal.
Inter-company sales are eliminated on consolidation so that the Group accounts relate to external transactions only.
A separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the parent undertaking only has not been presented as provided by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. c Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions made before 1st January 1998, which was previously transferred to a goodwill write-off reserve, has been eliminated against the merger reserve and the profit and loss account reserve and has not been reinstated on the implementation of FRS10.
If a subsidiary is subsequently sold or closed, any goodwill that arose on the acquisition will be taken into account in determining the profit or loss arising.
Following the adoption of FRS10, goodwill arising on acquisitions made on or after 1st January 1998 is capitalised and classified as an asset on the balance sheet.
It is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, which ranges from five to 20 years.
It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
d Turnover Turnover represents fees invoiced in respect of services provided during the year stated net of value added taxation, except in respect of long-term contracts where turnover is described in e below.
Turnover was earned within the United Kingdom and Europe.
e Long-term contracts i Property consultancy contracts Turnover represents the sales value of work done in the year, including fees invoiced and estimates in respect of amounts to be invoiced after the year end.
Profits are recognised on long-term contracts where the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
In calculating this the percentage of completion method is used based on the proportion of costs incurred to the total estimated cost.
Cost includes direct staff costs and outlays.
Full provision is made for all known or anticipated losses on each contract immediately such losses are forecast.
Amounts recoverable on contracts are stated at the proportion of the anticipated net sales value earned to date less billed on account.
To the extent that fees paid on account exceed the value of work performed, they are included in creditors as payments on account.
ii Greenfield contracts A greenfield contract is where an entirely new service is being established for our customer.
To date this only includes Criminal Records Bureau and Transport for Londons Congestion Charging Scheme.
For greenfield contracts no profit is recognised until service commences and is being invoiced.
Until the commencement of operation the only turnover recognised is non-refundable milestone payments where applicable.
Upon commencement turnover represents fees invoiced in respect of services provided.
Direct incremental costs incurred on the contract prior to service commencement and reimbursable during the contract, excluding any overheads, are included in amounts recoverable under contracts and amortised over the life of the contract.
iii Brownfield contracts Brownfield contracts are where there is a transfer of an existing operation to Capita.
For brownfield contracts all costs incurred prior to service commencement are expensed as incurred and turnover represents fees invoiced in respect of services provided.
f Tangible fixed assets Costs incurred in establishing a new or changed operation after contract award but before the delivery of outsourced services that meet the criteria for recognition as tangible fixed assets under FRS15 Tangible Fixed Assets are capitalised in tangible fixed assets.
Such costs are amortised over the life of the asset, in order to match these costs against the associated contracted revenues.
Those costs that do not meet the criteria under FRS15 are recognised as an expense when they are incurred.
55 Capita Capita Notes to the Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies continued Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned, as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Long leasehold property 50 years Computer equipment 3-10 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment 4-5 years Leasehold improvements over the period of the lease Motor vehicles 3-5 years g Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost, less provisions for impairment.
Investments held as current assets are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The carrying value of fixed assets investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
h Pension schemes The Group maintains a number of contracted-out money purchase schemes and contributions are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they are due.
The Group also operates defined benefit pension schemes.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives within the Group.
Variations in pension cost, which are identified as a result of actuarial valuations, are amortised over the average expected remaining working lives of employees in proportion to their expected payroll costs.
Differences between the amounts funded and the amounts charged to the profit and loss account are treated as either provisions or prepayments in the balance sheet.
i Leasing and hire purchase commitments Assets obtained under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful economic lives.
The finance charges under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are allocated to accounting periods over the period of the lease and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals due under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
j Employee Benefit Trust The shares in the Company held by the Employee Benefit Trust are recorded in the balance sheet and are classified within fixed assets.
The expected net cost of benefits is charged against profits over the performance period during which the benefits are earned by employees.
k Surplus properties The Group provides on a discounted basis for the future rent expense and related cost of leasehold property net of estimated sub-lease income where the space is vacant or currently not planned to be used for ongoing operations.
l Pre-contract costs Pre and post-contract award bidding costs are expensed as incurred.
m Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, taxation, with the following exceptions: Provision is made for taxation on gains arising from the revaluation and similar fair value adjustments of fixed assets and gains on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to taxation only where the replacement assets are sold Provision is made for deferred taxation that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable Deferred taxation assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred taxation is measured on an undiscounted basis at the taxation rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on taxation rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
56 Capita Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies continued n Foreign currencies Company Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the transaction is covered by a forward exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or if appropriate at the forward contract rate.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign equity investments, which are taken directly to reserves together with the exchange difference on the carrying amount of the related investments.
Group The accounts of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The exchange difference arising on consolidation of opening net assets is taken directly to reserves.
All other translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in foreign enterprises, which are taken directly to reserves together with the exchange difference on the net investment in these enterprises.
o National Insurance on share option gains National Insurance on outstanding share options at the year end has been grossed up and shown as a provision and a receivable on the balance sheet.
In order to maintain the required focus, to meet the demands made on the Group through growth and success in our chosen markets a fourth division, Integrated Services, has been created.
The effect of the above on the 2001 comparatives was first, to reduce Business Services turnover by 78,928,000 and operating profit before goodwill by 2,895,000: secondly to increase Commercial Services turnover by 23,922,000 and reduce operating profit before goodwill by 2,544,000: thirdly, to increase Integrated Services turnover by 129,063,000 and operating profit before goodwill by 15,808,000: and fourthly, to reduce Professional Services turnover by 74,057,000 and operating profit before goodwill by 10,369,000.
Included within turnover from acquisitions is 4,952,000 in respect of City Financial Group Limited, 3,094,000 in respect of Mission Testing Plc, 9,198,000 in respect of Capita Absence Management Services Limited formerly Wynchgate Holdings 1997 Limited, 309,000 in respect of Cost Auditing Limited and 11,575,000 in respect of Veredus.
Other minor acquisitions during the year have been completely integrated within existing businesses of the Group.
Accordingly, it is not possible to determine their post acquisition results.
A small amount of turnover and profit before taxation was generated within the Republic of Ireland but otherwise all other turnover and profit before taxation was generated within the United Kingdom.
The net assets of the Group are based in the United Kingdom apart from a small amount of net assets based in the Republic of Ireland.

During the year the Group has adopted Financial Reporting Standard 19 Deferred Taxation FRS19.
Consequently the comparatives for the year to 31st December 2001 have been restated.
The impact of these changes on the profit and loss account for the year ended 31st December 2001 is to increase the taxation charge by 694,000 and reduce goodwill amortisation by 74,000.
The impact of these changes on the balance sheet as at 31st December 2001 is to reduce intangible assets by 1,366,000, increase the deferred taxation asset by 3,805,000 and to increase shareholders funds by 2,439,000.
The impact of these changes on the Company balance sheet as at 31st December 2001 is to increase the deferred taxation asset by 21,000 and to increase shareholders funds by the same amount.
The effect of FRS19 on the current year is immaterial.

As at 31st December 2002 it is uncertain whether this threshold will be attained.
Movements in the year are shown in note 21.
During the year the Company issued sterling and US Dollars denominated bonds to financial institutions.
The bond issue was in the form of 55,000,000 sterling, and US Dollars amounts of $66,000,000 and $36,000,000.
These issues mature on 20th June 2009, 20th June 2009, and 20th June 2012 and are issued at interest rates of 6.44%, 6.1% and 6.47% respectively.
The Group then entered into cross currency swaps for the US dollar issue thereby converting the $66,000,000 and $36,000,000 bonds into a sterling denominated long-term loan of 69,959,000 and an interest rate swap for the sterling issue, the maturity dates being the same as for the issues themselves.
Issue costs incurred were 500,000 that are being spread over the life of the bonds to their maturity.
The effect of these swaps is to convert the interest cost on the debt to six month LIBOR plus 1%.
69 Capita Notes to the accounts 21 Derivatives and other financial instruments It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged.
The disclosure below excludes short-term debtors and creditors.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, bond issues, loan notes, finance leases, hire purchase contracts and cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations.
a Interest rate risk The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest.
The interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the Group as at the year end was as follows: Weighted Financial Weighted average period liabilities Fixed rate average to maturity of on which no weighted period of non interest interest is average which rate bearing Floating rate Fixed rate payable Total interest rate is fixed liabilities Financial liabilities 000s 000s 000s 000s % Years Years 31st December 2002 Sterling 125,501 34,973 11,935 172,409 4 2 3 31st December 2001 Sterling 59,447 52,336 5,311 117,094 5 2 2 The financial liabilities of the Group comprised: 2002 2001 000s 000s Bank overdraft repayable on demand 1,000 9,447 Bank loans payable in more than one year 50,000 Loan notes 34,110 50,183 Bonds 124,501 Obligations under finance leases 863 1,553 Other creditors falling due after more than one year 11,935 5,311 Preference shares of a subsidiary undertaking 600 172,409 117,094 The bank overdraft bears interest at Barclays Bank standard rates based on the bank base rate and the bonds bear interest at six month LIBOR plus 1% see note 20.
The financial liabilities of the Group include loan notes.
The following loan notes are repayable on demand, but no later than dates of maturity that are, 366,000 on 30th June 2004, 1,171,000 on 1st February 2003, and 3,051,000 on 31st May 2007.
The remaining loan notes of value 25,470,000 are repayable in more than one year, 5,000,000 of which is payable in five instalments, on demand, of 1,000,000.
The final instalment is due on 5th May 2004.
The balance of 20,470,000 is repayable on receipt of one years advance notification of the intent to redeem from either the loan note holder or the Company.
Consequently 21,470,000 of the loan notes are deemed to be due in more than one year.
The interest rates attributable to the loan notes are fixed for each new issue.
These rates range from 3.45% to 5.25%.

b Foreign currency risk During the year the Group had investments in subsidiary undertakings in the Republic of Ireland, Poland and the Czech Republic, which are affected by movements in the local currency sterling exchange rates.
However, as this does not significantly affect the Group balance sheet the Group does not currently hedge this currency exposure and any exchange differences are taken directly to reserves and are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
At 31st December 2002 those companies based in Poland and the Czech Republic were no longer trading.
The Group does not have any significant currency exposures on monetary assets and liabilities.
c Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, bank loans, bond issue, loan notes, finance leases and hire purchase contracts.

The Group acquired fixed assets of 439,000, debtors of 672,000, creditors of 1,083,000 fair value 1,133,000 and cash in bank of 1,023,000.
These other acquired businesses have been completely integrated within the continuing businesses of the Group and consequently it is not possible to determine the post acquisition results of the businesses.
The fair value adjustments reflect adjustments necessary to comply with the Groups accounting policies in respect of the estimated useful lives of fixed assets, the Groups estimate of the fair value on intangible fixed assets, fixed assets acquired and estimates of liabilities in respect of accruals.
Intangible fixed assets relate to goodwill on the acquired companies balance sheets and hence is written off on acquisition.
There were no significant impacts on deferred taxation in relation to the fair value adjustments.

26 Pension commitments The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
These pension schemes are funded and the payment of contributions are made to separately administered trust funds.
The assets of the pension schemes are held separately from the Group.
The pension charge for the defined contribution pension schemes for the year is 4,903,000 2001: 3,939,000.
The unpaid contributions outstanding at the year end are 853,000 2001: 600,000.
There are three defined benefit schemes: The Capita Pension and Life Assurance Scheme Capita scheme : The McLaren Dick and Company Limited Pension and Assurance Scheme McLaren scheme : and The Eastgate Assistance Retirement Benefit Scheme Eastgate scheme.
The pension costs for the defined benefit schemes are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
The independent qualified scheme actuaries carried out the latest full valuation of the Capita scheme on 6th April 2002 market value of assets 54.5m, the McLaren scheme on 1st May 2002 market value of assets 89.1m, and the Eastgate scheme on 1st January 2000 market value of assets 5.6m and the Capita and McLaren valuations were updated to 31st December 2002.
Surpluses or deficits on the pension schemes arising from the actuarial valuations are spread over the remaining average service lives of the members of the relevant scheme on a straight-line basis.
Included within prepayments are pre-paid pension costs of 2,927,000 2001: 2,927,000.
The pension charge for the defined benefit schemes for the year is 11,435,000 2001: 7,936,000.
The contributions made to the defined benefit pension scheme during the year amounted to 11,010,000 2001: 5,667,000 of which 8,984,000 was in respect of the Capita, McLaren and Eastgate schemes.
The additional 2,026,000 represents contributions made under admitted body status to our customers defined benefit schemes in respect of certain TUPE employees.
The unpaid contributions outstanding at the year end was 1,263,000 2001: 749,000.
The current agreed employer contribution rates equate to an average of 15.9% Capita scheme and 16.5% Eastgate scheme of pensionable salaries.
Contribution levels to the McLaren scheme have been increased after discussion with the Groups actuary, see comment below.
The major assumptions for the last full valuations performed in 2000 and 2002 and used for the calculation of the profit and loss charge were as follows: Capita scheme McLaren scheme Eastgate scheme %%% Rate of return on investment before retirement 7.25 7.00 7.50 Rate of return on investment after retirement 5.75 5.50 6.00 Rate of price inflation 2.75 2.75 3.25 Rate of salary increase 4.25 4.25 5.00 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.75 2.75 3.50 Based on the 2000 and 2002 actuarial valuations, the value of the schemes was sufficient to cover approximately 95% Capita scheme, 90% McLaren scheme, 100% Eastgate scheme of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in wages and salaries.
The results of the actuarial valuations also showed that the schemes were 109% Capita scheme, 99% McLaren scheme and 117% Eastgate scheme funded at the valuation date based on the methods and assumptions for the purposes of the minimum funding requirement MFR.
The market value of the schemes assets at 31st December 2002 are set out in the FRS17 disclosures below.
As at 31st December 2002, an approximate roll forward of the actuarial valuation was performed on the Capita scheme and the McLaren scheme.
The results of this showed that the valuation of these schemes was sufficient to cover 67% of the Capita Scheme and 75% of the McLaren scheme benefits that have accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in wages and salaries representing a gross deficit of 46.2m.
As a result of this, and advice from the Groups actuary, total contributions into the schemes have been increased by 4,400,000 per annum from 1st January 2003 across these two schemes.
