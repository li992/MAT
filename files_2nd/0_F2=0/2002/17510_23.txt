notes to the US GAAP reconciliation Deferred taxation Under UK GAAP, deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, with the following exceptions: Where fixed assets have been revalued, provision is made for deferred tax only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold: Provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable: and Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Under US GAAP, full provision for deferred tax is required for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Groups assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates.
Own shares Under UK GAAP, company shares held by Group, to hedge future requirements of share option schemes are recorded in the balance sheet as fixed assets-investments.
Under US GAAP, such shares would be recorded in the balance sheet as a reduction of shareholders interest.
Dividends Under UK GAAP, dividends are recorded in the year in respect of which they are announced or declared by the Board of Directors to the shareholders.
Under US GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period in which dividends are declared.

Explanation: Categories of Accounting Status Associate Associated undertakings are accounted for using the equity method.
The Groups share of the net assets of the Associate are shown on the balance sheet under non-current assets as a single line.
The results of the associate appear in two lines in the profit and loss account.
The Groups share of the profit before tax of the associate appears on the face of the profit and loss account.
The Groups share of the associates tax charge appears in the tax note.
Joint Venture JV JVs are arrangements where the partners share in the profits of the JV operations.
JVs are accounted for using the gross equity method.
The Groups share of the gross assets and gross liabilities of the JV are shown as two lines on the face of the balance sheet within non-current assets.
Treatment in the profit and loss account is similar to associated undertakings except that turnover is grossed up for the Groups share of the turnover of the JV, which is then deducted on the face of the P&L to arrive at Group turnover.
JANE Joint arrangements not creating an entity JANE are characterised by the sharing of output eg, the physical commodity or a transport facility rather than the sharing of profit from operations of the JV.
JANES are proportionately consolidated on a line-by-line basis.
Subsidiary Subsidiaries are 100% consolidated on a line-by-line basis.
Where a subsidiary is not 100% owned, the minority interests share of net assets and profits are deducted on the face of the balance sheet and profit and loss account as single lines.
