Effective from 19 March 2002, the Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Marks and Spencer p. l. c. following implementation of a Scheme of Arrangement under section 425 of the Companies Act 1985.
This scheme involved the issue of 17 ordinary shares and 21 redeemable B shares by the Company for every 21 ordinary shares held by the shareholders of Marks and Spencer p. l. c. The effect of this scheme is reected in the directors interests shown above.
2 In accordance with the Scheme of Arrangement described above, ordinary shares held in Restricted Share Plans were replaced by new ordinary shares and B shares.
The Remuneration Committee decided that, upon the Scheme becoming effective, the restrictions applicable to the B shares and the new ordinary shares would cease to apply.
As a result, Roger Holmes and Alison Reed have incurred an income tax liability on these shares.
In order to meet this tax liability they sold 57,494 and 14,704 ordinary shares respectively, at a price of 389p and redeemed 282,326 and 80,000 B shares respectively at a price of 70p each.
The participants in the Restricted Share Plans have entered into an agreement with the Company that, in the event that they cease to be employed in circumstances where, but for the Scheme, their shares would have been forfeited, they will pay the Company an amount equal to the market value of the shares on the date of release less the tax payable on release.
