Capital and reserves in 1999 reect the increase of 1 382 million as a result of the issue of the preference shares.
g Return on shareholders equity is substantially inuenced by the Groups policy prior to 1998, of writing off purchased goodwill in the year of acquisition as a movement in profit retained.
Return on capital employed and net gearing are also inuenced but to a lesser extent.
h During the year ended 31 December 2002, Unilever recognised for US GAAP reporting purposes SFAS 142 which ceased amortisation of goodwill and indefinite-lived assets.
Amortisation expense on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on a US GAAP basis for the years ended 31 December 2001, 2000, 1999 and 1998 were 1 748 million, 810 million, 369 million and 356 million respectively.
i During the year ended 31 December 2002, Unilever changed its method of calculating expected return on plan assets for US GAAP purposes by adopting the actual fair market value at the balance sheet date rather than a market related value.
Had this methodology been applied in previous years, it would have resulted in an increase in net income for the years ended 31 December 2001, 2000, 1999 and 1998 of 86 million, 210 million, 57 million and 83 million respectively.
