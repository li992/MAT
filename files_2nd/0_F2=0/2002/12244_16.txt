7 Dividends and earnings per share 2002 2001 m m Ordinary interim paid 21 March 2001 2.5p per share 2001: 2.0p 1.8 1.4 Ordinary final proposed 8.0p per share 2001: 6.4p 5.7 4.6 7.5 6.0 The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on dividing profit on ordinary activities after taxation by the weighted average of 71,601,266 2001: 69,805,507 ordinary shares in issue during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted for all potentially dilutive options and deferred convertible shares.
This dilution can arise as a result of the exercise of share options or the conversion of deferred convertible shares where the exercise or conversion price is less than the average market value of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the relevant performance criteria are expected to be satisfied.
27 7 Dividends and earnings per share continued Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

36 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 June 2002 22 Financial instruments Policy The Group does not use complex derivative financial instruments.
Where it does use financial instruments these are mainly to optimise interest receivable or interest payable.
The Groups policy is that major currency risks should be hedged so as to minimise the uncertainty of any impact on the Groups financial statements in respect of currency fluctuations.
The Group does not have any material foreign currency risks in respect of its trading activities.
The Group has limited borrowings and the exposure to interest rate movements is therefore not material.
The Group has a number of small investments in overseas operations and, as a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
These currency exposures are not material as at the date of these financial statements.
Currency exposures are reviewed regularly.
The Groups financial liabilities consist of loan notes and deferred convertible shares and total 2.9m 2001: 3.3m.
Financial assets consist of cash and short term deposits and total 20.8m 2001: 23.7m.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all of the following disclosures, other than the currency risk disclosures.
Financial liabilities Of the Groups financial liabilities of 2.9m 2001: 3.3m, 2.8m carry fixed interest rates 2001: 3.2m and 0.1m represent non-interest bearing deferred convertible shares 2001: 0.1m.
The fixed rate liabilities consist of loan notes, denominated in sterling which are at a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% 2001: 4.4%, fixed for an average of three months.
All the Groups financial liabilities mature in less than one year.
Financial assets Of the Groups financial assets of 20.8m 2001: 23.7m, 2.6m carry fixed interest rates 2001: 2.9m and 18.2m carry variable interest rates 2001: 20.8m.
The fixed rate assets consist of deposits, denominated in sterling, which are at a weighted average interest rate of 4.4% 2001: 5.1%, fixed for an average of three months.
Currency exposures The Group had no material net foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that were not denominated in the functional currency of the relevant Group company involved as at 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2001.
The Groups monetary assets and liabilities consist of cash, loans and overdrafts and certain short-term debtors and creditors.
Borrowing facilities The Groups principal source of borrowing facilities is through an on demand bank overdraft of 5m 2001: 5m, which is, by definition, uncommitted.
These facilities are generally reviewed on an annual or ongoing basis and hence the facilities expire within one year or less.
The Group has no committed borrowing facilities as at 30 June 2002 2001: nil.
Fair values of financial instruments At 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2001 there were no material differences between the book value and the fair value of the Group financial assets and liabilities.
