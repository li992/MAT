Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies including goodwill arising on acquisitions are translated at the mid-market rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date unless matched by forward contracts.
Where the translation of overseas subsidiaries and associated undertakings, net of any foreign currency borrowing used to finance them, gives rise to an exchange difference, this is taken directly to reserves.
Other exchange differences are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments The principal derivative instruments utilised by the Group are interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.
These instruments are used for hedging purposes in line with the Groups risk management policy and no trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
Interest differentials are taken to net interest receivable in the profit and loss account, and premiums and fees are amortised at a constant rate over the life of the underlying instrument.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements.
In the holding company and its subsidiaries the liability is assessed with reference to the individual company.
On consolidation the liability is assessed with reference to the Group as a whole.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.

5 Pension costs The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24.
The disclosures given below are those required by that standard.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits was issued in November 2000 but will not be fully mandatory for the Group and the Company until the year ended 31st December 2005.
Prior to this, phased transitional disclosures are required.
The required disclosures are shown below.
The Group operates a pension scheme which covers the majority of United Kingdom employees.
Membership on a final salary basis was closed in 2001 but the scheme remains open to new entrants on a defined contribution basis.
The assets are held in trust funds separate from the Groups assets.
Other defined benefit schemes operated within the Group are the Mono Equipment Limited Pension and Life Assurance Scheme and the Amari plc Pension and Life Assurance Plan.
Various defined contribution schemes exist across the Group and the total contributions in the year were 0.6m 2001: 1.2m.
34 Annual Report & Accounts Notes to the accounts 5 Pension costs continued The latest full valuation of the main United Kingdom scheme was carried out by Watson Wyatt Partners, independent consulting actuaries, as at 1st July 2000 using the projected unit credit method.
The principal assumptions on which the valuation was based for the purposes of establishing the Groups pension cost were that the investment return would be 1.5% greater than general salary increases, and between 2.25% and 3% greater than increases in future pension payments.
The results of the valuation showed that the scheme had an aggregate market value of 793.0m and was 107% funded.
The surplus has been spread forward on the fixed monetary amount basis.
This valuation has been used for the 2002 accounts.
At 31st December 2002 the pension prepayment held in the Groups balance sheet is 20.9m 2001: 13.5m.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account in the year to 31st December 2002 was nil 2001: nil.
The combination of the normal pension cost for 2002 and the full amortisation of surplus shown in the valuation would generate a pension credit of approximately 5m.
As in the past, no credit has been taken in the profit and loss account in 2002 for pensions and a nil cost has been recorded, as such a net credit situation is unlikely to recur following the next full valuation.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on an updated actuarial valuation at 31st December 2002 by a qualified actuary.
This takes account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31st December 2002.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31st December 2002.
The financial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under FRS 17 were: 2002 2001 Rate of increase in salaries 3.50% 3.75% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 2.00 - 3.15% 2.50 - 3.25% Discount rate 5.65% 5.85% Inflation assumption 2.00% 2.25% The assets of the aggregated schemes and the expected rate of return are: Long term asset Long term asset returns expected 2002 2002 returns expected 2001 2001 %m % m Equities 8.3 221.1 7.5 333.9 Bonds 5.3 282.5 5.6 272.9 Property 6.7 61.3 6.6 60.9 Other 3.8 20.5 4.3 17.7 Total market value of assets 6.5 585.4 6.6 685.4 Actuarial value of liabilities 649.0 685.1 Deficit surplus in the scheme 63.6 0.3 Related deferred tax asset 19.1 Net pension deficit asset 44.5 0.3 Group scheme contributions of 7.4m based on pensionable salaries were made during the year ended 31st December 2002.
It has been agreed with the trustees that contributions for the next year will be 18.2% 2001: 18.2% for all members accruing benefits on a final salary basis with the exception of members of the former 1970 scheme and 36.5% 2001: 36.5% for members of the former 1970 scheme.
These rates are subject to review at the next triennial actuarial valuation.
As the Group scheme is closed to new entrants, under the projected unit credit method, the current service cost, expressed as a percentage of pensionable salaries, will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.

The Group manages the financial instrument credit risk and investment risk by entering into transactions with established financial institutions and relationship banks.
Major corporate-related transactions are carried out by the group treasury team which operates as a cost centre.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.
Policies for managing these risks are governed by board approved policies and procedures, which have remained unchanged since the beginning of 2002.
Foreign currency transactional risk The Group requires its operating units to use forward currency contracts for any material committed sales or purchases denominated in currencies other than the units functional currency.
Operating units undertake transactional hedging within the parameters set by the board and the level of transactional hedging and exposure is reviewed by group treasury on a monthly basis.
Foreign currency structural risk With its strategy of growth and expansion on an international scale, the Group has significant investments in overseas operations.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of such structural currency exposures by borrowing in the same currency as the functional currency of its operating units.
In managing the structural currency exposures, the Groups objectives are to minimise borrowing costs and to retain some potential for currency-related appreciation whilst hedging against currency depreciation.
At the end of 2002, the Euro and US dollar liabilities represented 26.8% of Euro net assets and 4.3% of US dollar net assets respectively.
Interest rate risk The Group maintains its policy to minimise interest rate risk on its borrowings and deposits by using interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements where appropriate.
The Groups policy is, normally, to have between 25% and 75% of debt at fixed rates at any time, depending on debt levels and market conditions.
Interest rate risk is currently minimised, without the need to use derivative financial instruments, as explained in the paragraph below.
42 Annual Report & Accounts Notes to the accounts 18 Financial instruments continued The Group started its financial year with surplus funds, providing it with the opportunity to develop its core businesses.
As the Groups objective was to maintain flexibility in utilising these funds, the maturity profile has been kept short throughout 2002, and a large proportion of the acquisitions made during the year were financed by the surplus funds.
At the year end, all of the Groups investments were floating rate, with a weighted average maturity of one month.
The ongoing financial liabilities are all interest bearing and floating rate.
Short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all of the following disclosures, other than the currency exposure.
