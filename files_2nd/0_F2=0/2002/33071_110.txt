94 Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 18 Deferred taxation United Kingdom Financial Reporting Standard 19 FRS 19 Deferred Tax, which requires full provision to be made for deferred taxes, has been adopted with effect from 1 January 2002.
The impact on the balance sheet of adoption of this standard has been reected in all periods covered by these accounts by means of a prior period adjustment.
As Unilever has previously provided for deferred taxes on a full provision basis in accordance with Netherlands law, FRS 19 does not have a material impact on reported net profit.
FRS 19 does not allow deferred tax to be provided on the revaluation of xed assets and therefore deferred tax so provided in respect of the revaluation of Bestfoods tangible xed assets has been adjusted against goodwill in the comparative gures.
Deferred tax was provided in respect of the planned remittance of unremitted earnings of Bestfoods subsidiaries: FRS 19 does not allow such provision unless the dividend has been declared.
These deferred tax liabilities have also been adjusted against goodwill in the comparative gures.
In addition, where prior to 1998 tax-deductible goodwill was written off directly to reserves, FRS 19 does not allow a deferred tax asset to be created at acquisition.
Instead, a deferred tax liability must be created over the life of the goodwill.
The consequent reversal of deferred tax assets and creation of deferred tax liabilities has been adjusted in the comparative gures.
These two adjustments result in a reduction of shareholders equity as at 31 December 2001 of 202 million.
The implementation of FRS 19 has also changed the accounting treatment in the year ended 31 December 2000 for our then anticipated disposal of Elizabeth Arden.
The effect of implementing FRS 19 means that operating profit for that year is reduced by 121 million, whilst the tax charge on ordinary activities is also reduced by 121 million.
This adjustment has been made in the comparative gures for the year ended 31 December 2000.
There is no impact on reported net profit.
Capital and reserves at 31 December 2001 have been reduced in aggregate by 202 million 2000: 195 million.
In the 2001 closing balance sheet, goodwill has been reduced by 133 million 2000: 77 million while debtors have been reduced by 60 million 2000: 91 million through a reduction in deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities at the end of 2001 have been increased by 9 million 2000: 27 million.
There are no material unrecognised deferred tax assets.
