This results from better customer and channel management and brand development, which improves returns on acquired businesses.
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards in the The carrying value of this goodwill will continue to be reviewed annually for impairment United Kingdom.

A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation of where changes have the financial statements depart from the specific requirements of the company legislation to amortise goodwill over a finite period.
The directors consider this to be necessary for been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
Because of the indefinite life of these intangible assets, it is not possible to quantify the impact of this departure.
b Changes in accounting policies The Group has adopted FRS 19 Deferred tax in these financial statements.
The adoption of this standard represents a change in accounting policy and the comparative figures Impairment review The need for any goodwill impairment write-down is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of the asset against the higher of net realisable value or have been restated accordingly.
Details of the effect of adopting FRS 19 are given in value in use.
The value in use is determined from estimated discounted future cash flows.

Software licences The Group recognises the revenue allocable to software licences and specified upgrades upon shipment of the software product or upgrade, when there are no d Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value attributed to investments in businesses or significant vendor obligations remaining, when the fee is fixed and determinable and when collectability is considered probable.
Where appropriate the Group provides a reserve for subsidiary undertakings over the fair value of the underlying net assets at the date of their estimated returns under the standard acceptance terms at the time the revenue is recorded.
In accordance with FRS 10, for acquisitions made on or after 1 October 1998, goodwill has been capitalised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to Postcontract customer support Revenue allocable to PCS is recognised on a straight-line that date was eliminated against reserves in accordance with the accounting standard then in force.
If a subsidiary or business is subsequently sold or closed, any goodwill arising on basis over the term of the PCS.
Revenue not recognised in the profit and loss account under this policy is classified as deferred income in the balance sheet.
consolidation that was eliminated against reserves or that has not been amortised through the profit and loss account is taken into account in determining the profit or loss on sale or closure.
Other products and services Revenue allocable to other products and services is recognised as the products are shipped, or services are provided.
The directors have concluded that they should evaluate the life of goodwill on a case by case basis, amortising goodwill in instances where a fixed life is considered appropriate.
Goodwill which is not amortised, is subject to an annual impairment review.
Goodwill capitalised on businesses acquired since 1 October 1998 has all been assessed as having an indefinite life.
This is because the main intangible assets that the Group has acquired are customer bases, channels of distribution and brands.
However none of these intangible assets qualify as a separable net asset under FRS 10, therefore they have not been accounted for separately.
