The principal relevant differences between US GAAP and UK GAAP that impact profit or shareholders equity as set out above are summarised above.
132 Xstrata plc notes to the US GAAP reconciliation Goodwill Under UK GAAP, purchased goodwill on acquisitions is amortised over its useful economic life, subject to a maximum of 20 years.
Under US GAAP, FAS 142, goodwill arising on acquisitions and indefinite-lived intangible assets are no longer amortised but reviewed annually for impairment, or if an event occurs to indicate the possibility of impairment.
FAS 142 is effective from 1 January 2002.
Impairment Both UK GAAP and US GAAP require that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
For the purpose of impairment review, US GAAP requires, in performing the review for recoverability, the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.
If the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognised.
Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets and identifiable intangibles that an entity expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the assets.
An impairment review is undertaken on income generating units for UK GAAP purposes, which may be defined as divisions or countries of operation in accordance with the Relevant Statement of Recommended Practice.
To the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, that is the higher of net realisable value and value in use fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis the fixed asset is written down to its recoverable amount.
Derivative instruments The Group are party to derivative contracts in respect of some of their future transactions in order to hedge their exposure to fluctuations between certain currencies.
Under UK GAAP, these contracts are accounted for as hedges: gains and losses are deferred and subsequently recognised when the hedge transaction occurs.
US GAAP requires all derivative instruments including those embedded in other contracts to be recognised on the balance sheet at their fair values.
Changes in fair values are either recognised periodically in income or shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income depending on whether the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting and, if so, whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.
Changes in fair value of derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective as hedges, are recorded in shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income, net of income taxes.
Changes in fair value of derivatives used as hedges of net investments in foreign operations are reported in other comprehensive income net of income taxes and reflected as part of the cumulative translation adjustment.
Changes in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are reported in net income.
Inventory valuation at acquisition date Under UK GAAP, the inventories of acquired companies are valued at the lower of replacement cost and net realisable value.
Under US GAAP, FAS 141, finished goods and work in progress are valued at estimated selling price less costs to complete.
Raw materials and consumables are valued at replacement cost.
