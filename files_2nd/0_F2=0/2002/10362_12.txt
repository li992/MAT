ii Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share are presented to provide more comparable and representative information on the continuing and established trading activities.
Accordingly, the adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share figures exclude exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and the investment expenditure in the B2C Internet Services operations.
As discussed in the 2001 Report and Financial Statements, the results of the continuing B2B Internet Services operations have now been included within the Financial Services Division and are no longer excluded from the adjusted earnings per share figures.
