Prior year comparatives were restated for consistency.
2 In 1999, following an accounting presentation change, Assets and liabilities under stock borrowing and lending agreements were no longer reported as on-balance sheet items, but as contractual commitments.
Accordingly, total assets were reduced by 15,026m as at 31 December 1998, with an equivalent reduction in Total liabilities.
3 Prior to 1999, Dealing profits included within Fees, commissions and other income also included interest receivable on trading securities and interest payable on their associated funding.
Following an accounting presentation change in 1999, such interest is now included in Net interest income.
The 1999 comparative balances were restated with the effect being a 12m increase in net interest income and a corresponding decrease in Dealing profits for these years.
4 Prior to 2000, Depreciation on operating lease assets was reported as a charge against income on operating lease assets within Commissions, fees and other income.
Such income continues to be reported within Commissions, fees and other income, however, following an accounting presentation change, Depreciation on operating lease assets is now reported within Operating expenses, but shown as a separate item within that heading because such assets are used for a different purpose to xed assets used in administrative functions.
The prior year comparatives for the two years ended 1999, were restated with the effect being a 52m 1999 and 20m 1998 increase in Commissions, fees and other income.
This change results from the application of FRS 15, Tangible xed assets, which first applied to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2000.
5 Equivalent US dollar amounts are shown in Shareholder information Dividends on ordinary shares, included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
6 The calculation of the gross equivalent dividend per ordinary share applies a tax rate of 20% for grossing-up purposes for dividends up to and including the interim dividend for 1998.
Thereafter the rate of 10% has been applied.
7 Prior to 2002, Reserve capital instruments were reported as a component of non-equity shareholders funds, with coupon payments treated as a non-equity appropriation of profit.
Following an accounting presentation change, Reserve capital instruments are now reported within Subordinated liabilities, with coupon payments recorded as Interest payable, within Net interest income.
qxd 5 3 03 4:00 pm Page 163 THE ABBEY NATIONAL GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FIVE YEAR RECORD continued 163 The 2001 comparative amounts have been restated to reect this accounting policy change and as a consequence profit before tax has been reduced by 19m, with profits attributable to shareholders remaining unchanged.
Shareholders funds including non-equity interests have been reduced by 297m in 2001.
Comparative amounts for years prior to 2001 are unaffected.
This change results from the application of UITF 33, Obligations in capital instruments, which first applies to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2002.
8 The application of FRS 19, Deferred tax, for the year ended 31 December 2002 has resulted in deferred taxation being provided on all timing differences that have not reversed before the balance sheet date at the rate of tax expected to apply when those timing differences will reverse.
Deferred tax assets are now recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
Previously, deferred taxation was accounted for where it was probable that a liability or asset would arise.
The 2001 and 2000 comparative amounts have been restated to reect this accounting policy change and as a consequence the tax charge has been reduced by 24m 2001, 16m 2000, 17m 1999 and 17m 1998, respectively.
Shareholders funds including non-equity interests have been increased by 120m 2001, 96m 2000, 80m 1999 and 63m 1998, respectively.
9 Amounts stated in dollars have been translated from sterling at the rate of 1.00 $1.6095, the noon buying rate on 31 December 2002.
10 Prior to 2002, the costs of equity-based instruments issued to employees under compensation schemes were generally accounted for under the intrinsic value method.
The Group now accounts for the costs of share-based instruments on a fair value basis.
The costs of share-based payments are computed by reference to the grant date: such costs are expensed over the vesting period of the instrument.
The 2001 and 2000 profit and loss accounts and statements of total recognised gains and losses comparative amounts have been restated to reect this accounting policy change and as a consequence profit before tax has been reduced by 6m 2001, 4m in 2000, 3m 1999 and 2m 1998, respectively, with a corresponding credit to the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
No prior period adjustment to shareholders funds is required.
11 In 2002 certain adjustments were made to period end market values in reporting long term assurance business.
The 2001 and 2000 comparative amounts have been restated to reect this change in accounting policy.
The reported earnings in these periods have been reduced by 443m and 102m, respectively.
See note 20 Long term assurance business for further information.
Determination of the impact on reported earnings in 1999 and 1998 is not practicable.
12 Included in Total income are profits from associated undertakings and profits on disposal of Group undertakings amounting to 65m 2002, 81m 2001, 62m 2000, 12m 1999 and nil 1998, respectively.

qxd 5 3 03 4:00 pm Page 164 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE ABBEY NATIONAL GROUP 164 FIVE YEAR RECORD continued 1 profit after tax divided by average total assets.
2 profit after tax divided by average equity shareholders funds.
3 profit after tax divided by average risk weighted assets.
4 Net interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.
5 Cost: income ratio equals operating expenses excluding depreciation on operating lease assets divided by total operating income less depreciation on operating lease assets.
6 All credit quality data is calculated using period-end balances, except for provisions for bad and doubtful debts as a percentage of average loans and advances to customers, excluding assets held under purchase and resale agreements.
7 The non-performing loans used in these statistics are calculated in accordance with conventional US denitions.
The value of non-performing loans represents the aggregate outstanding balance of all loans and advances 90 days or more overdue or, for unsecured loans less than 90 days overdue, the balance of loans where a provision has been made or interest suspended.
Interest continues to be debited to substantially all of these loans and advances for collection purposes.
The proportion of this interest whose collectability is in doubt is then suspended and excluded from the profit and loss account.
Accordingly, the interest income gures included in the profit and loss account are the same as would be reported in the United States.
However, the value of non-performing loans is higher by the cumulative amount of this suspended interest.
In cases where borrowers have made arrangements to pay off their arrears over a period of time, the arrears remain on the loan accounts until cleared and as a result the loans are included in non-performing loans even though the customers are currently performing and many will ultimately discharge their loans fully.
Abbey National generally holds a first mortgage over the properties securing the UK residential mortgage loans.
The value of the security will in many cases completely cover the value of the loan and the arrears and in the remainder will considerably reduce the size of the loss incurred.
Non-performing loans also include the full value of loans for which Abbey National has enforced its security by taking into possession the borrowers properties.
In many such cases the value of the losses expected to result on sale of the security is known with some certainty and is included in the specic provisions.
However, the value of the losses is not charged off until the properties are sold and the losses have thus been determined precisely.
Other banks, including those in the United States, may charge off losses more rapidly.
Although Abbey Nationals practice does not affect net income or the carrying value of loans and advances to customers, it does increase the reported value of non-performing loans.
For these reasons, the value of the non-performing loans is not necessarily indicative of the value of losses which Abbey National is likely to suffer.
Management believes that it is important to consider the quality of Abbey Nationals UK residential mortgage portfolio compared with those of its competitors.
Over the reporting periods covered by this table, the number of mortgage loans which are six months or more in arrears as a percentage of the total number of outstanding mortgage loans has been broadly comparable with the UK Council of Mortgage Lenders CML industry average.
As at 31 December 2002, Abbey Nationals percentage was 0.34% compared with a CML percentage of 0.48%.
The value of these Abbey National non-performing loans as a percentage of its total UK residential mortgage loan assets was 0.39%.
Non-performing loans in this table also include the value of arrears cases between three and six months in arrears and the value of properties in possession.
On this basis, the non-performing UK residential mortgage loans are 0.5% of its total UK residential loans and advances.
If the remainder of the Groups loans and advances excluding finance leases are included, this ratio increases to 2.36%.
8 For the purpose of calculating the ratios of earnings to xed charges, earnings consists of income before taxes plus xed charges.
Fixed charges consists of interest payable, which includes the amortisation of discounts and premiums on debt securities in issue and interest payable on finance lease obligations.
9 These ratios were restated for the year ending 31 December 1998.
The restatement reects the change in accounting policy whereby the stock lending and borrowing balances are now treated as off-balance sheet items see note 2 on page 162.
10 These ratios have been restated for each of the comparative periods due to the US GAAP total assets being restated.
Exchange rates The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain information concerning the exchange rate for pounds sterling based on the noon buying rate in New York City for cable transfers in foreign currencies, as certied for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, expressed in US dollars per 1.00.
No representation is made that amounts in pounds sterling have been, could have been or could be converted into US dollars at the noon buying rate or at any other rate.
2 With respect to February 2003, for the period from February 1 to February 10.
