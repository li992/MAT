Directors remuneration report continued Cash bonus Under this part of the plan, executive directors would receive a cash bonus of up to 50% of their basic salary if appropriate performance conditions were met.
Half of the bonus would be achieved if either the Group or business unit, as appropriate, met their integration savings targets, and the other half would be achieved if the Group or business unit met their trading performance targets during 2000 and 2001.
The integration targets were met in full but some of the Group and business unit trading targets were not fully achieved.
As a consequence, the executive directors became eligible to receive cash bonuses which were paid in March 2002.
The amounts are included in Salary and Bonuses disclosed above on page 38.
In addition to focusing senior executives on the achievement of both trading performance and integration savings, the integration incentive plan achieved the objective of retaining key employees throughout the integration period.
Norwich Union Restricted Share Plan Norwich Union had a deferred bonus arrangement in which a small number of senior managers participated.
Awards were granted which vest after three years, subject to the attainment of a performance measure based on Total Shareholder Return TSR.
To vest, Norwich Unions ranking against the TSR of the FTSE 100 companies would have to be better than median, when 25% of the awards would vest, rising to 100% of the awards vesting if the Company ranked 20th or above.
This plan lapsed in 2000 upon the merger of CGU and Norwich Union.
However, a one-off arrangement based on phantom shares was introduced at that time to replicate the plan but only in respect of the three-year performance period which commenced in 1999.
Based on the TSR over the performance period subject to appropriate weighted adjustments being made to recognise that the Company, for the purpose of the calculation, was Norwich Union plc up to 30 May 2000, the Company was ranked 43rd against the FTSE 100 and therefore a cash award, based on 42.5% of the number of phantom shares awarded and the market value of an ordinary share, was paid in March 2002.
Mr Snowball was the only executive director to participate in this phantom plan as it was not extended to those former Norwich Union executives who became directors of Aviva at the time of the merger.
In respect of these directors, the Committee reserved the right to approve a discretionary cash payment and, in this regard, the Committee awarded a cash bonus to these directors based on a number of shares and the Companys share price on 8 March 2002.
The cash bonuses were paid in March 2002 and are disclosed under Salary and Bonuses above on page 38.
Non-executive Directors The Companys articles of association provide that the total remuneration paid to directors shall be determined by the Board within the limits set by shareholders.
The current limit is 1 million per annum as approved by shareholders at last years Annual General Meeting.
Executive directors receive no fees for acting as directors.
The emoluments paid to the Chairman and Deputy Chairman take into account their duties and the amounts paid by competitors and similar-sized companies.
Non-executive directors receive a basic annual fee in respect of their Board and Board committee duties, with a further fee being paid to those directors other than the Chairman and Deputy Chairman who have the additional responsibility of chairing the meetings of the Board committees.
These fees are reviewed, but not necessarily increased, annually and are set by the Board to attract individuals with the broad range of skills and experience appropriate for a major international company.
In determining the level of non-executive directors fees, including the Chairmans and Deputy Chairmans fees, the recommendation of executive directors is considered, which takes into account the time commitment expended in preparing for and attending meetings as well as market practice.
Other than the Chairman who receives a car allowance, non-executive directors receive no benefits in addition to their fees nor do they participate in any incentive or performance plans.
The emoluments paid to the non-executive directors during the year were: 2002 2001 000 000 Pehr Gyllenhammar 297 268 Guillermo fide la Dehesa 68 57 Wim Dik 38 36 Sir Michael Partridge 38 36 George Paul 160 160 Derek Stevens 63 54 Dr Elizabeth Vallance 38 36 Andr Villeneuve 38 36 The fee disclosed for Pehr Gyllenhammar includes a car allowance.
The fee for George Paul reflects his duties as Deputy Chairman, which includes chairing the Remuneration Committee and acting as the senior non-executive director.
The fee for Derek Stevens includes an additional amount for acting as the Chairman of the Boards Audit Committee and of the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme and that for Guillermo fide la Dehesa includes a fee for acting as the non-executive chairman of the Groups operations in Spain.
No non-executive director accrued retirement benefits during the year.
The aggregate amount of emoluments, paid to directors in 2002 was 6.6 million 2001: 6.6 million.

3 Changes in accounting policy a Provision for deferred tax Financial Reporting Standard 19 FRS19 Deferred Tax was published by the Accounting Standards Board in December 2000, and replaced the existing Statement of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP15 on deferred tax.
FRS19 is effective for the year ended 31 December 2002.
The principal impact of the change from the accounting policy applied under SSAP15 is to provide additional deferred tax on unrealised appreciation or depreciation of investments.
The additional deferred tax provision results in a reduction in the fund for future appropriations for with-profit life business and a reduction in profit and loss account reserve for general insurance business.
In the case of non-profit life business, the establishment of an additional deferred tax provision has a neutral effect on shareholders funds as the increase in deferred tax provision is offset by a corresponding decrease in the additional value of in-force longterm business.
The Group has chosen to adopt the discounting option for its deferred tax balances, to reflect the time value of money.
The effects of implementing FRS19 are as follows: i An incremental provision for deferred tax was established at 31 December 2001 of 945 million and has been accounted for as a prior year adjustment.
This incremental provision has reduced to 112 million at 31 December 2002.
The establishment of the incremental provision has resulted in the following at the respective balance sheet dates: 2002 2001 m m With-profit business Reduction in fund for future appropriations 53 735 Non-profit business Increase in additional value of in-force business 12 90 General insurance business and other Reduction in shareholders funds 47 120 Incremental deferred tax provision arising from the move from SSAP 15 to FRS 19 112 945 56 Aviva plc Annual report accounts 2002 3 Change in accounting policy continued ii The implementation of FRS 19 has resulted in a decrease in loss after tax of 151 million 2001: increase in profit after tax of 226 million.
b Presentation changes The Groups long-term businesses include various service companies as well as the main operating companies.
The results of the former were previously included in the long-term business technical account but are now shown as part of profit from other operations in the non-technical account.
The loss reclassified in 2002 is 54 million 2001: profit of 9 million.

In addition to the goodwill arising on the acquisitions of these subsidiary undertakings, the Group acquired a further 30% of the share capital of Eurovita Italcasse Assicurazioni S. p. A. Eurovita, a 50.96% subsidiary of the Group, for a cash consideration of 21 million.
The consideration is equivalent to the increase in the Groups share of net assets and there is no additional goodwill arising.
The Group now owns 80.96% of this subsidiary.
The Group also made a number of smaller acquisitions in continental Europe.
These gave rise to an additional amount of 38 million goodwill.
Total positive goodwill arising in the year was 76 million note 18. c Disposals The net loss profit on the disposal of subsidiary undertakings comprises: 2002 2001 m m Long-term savings businesses: Canada 5 General insurance businesses: UK see i below 20 France see ii below 6 New Zealand - State Insurance 52 Australia and New Zealand see v below 66 United States 125 Belgium 46 Spain see iv below 94 Other businesses: France see iii below 1 UK 70 Other small operations 19 1 4 287 i In January 2002, the Group completed the disposal of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sabre Insurance Company Limited, for a total consideration of 14 million.
The net assets disposed of amounted to 24 million and the loss on disposal, after transaction costs and the inclusion of 10 million of goodwill previously written off to reserves, was 20 million.
ii In May 2002, the Group completed the disposal of its wholly-owned subsidiary CGU Courtage SA, for a total consideration of 189 million.
The net assets disposed of amounted to 137 million and the profit on disposal, after transaction costs, warranties and indemnities was 6 million.
iii In May 2002, the Group completed the disposal of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Royal Saint Georges Banque, for a total consideration of 16 million.
The net assets disposed of amounted to 15 million and the profit on disposal, after transaction costs, was 1 million.
68 Aviva plc Annual report accounts 2002 17 Subsidiary undertakings continued iv In July 2002, the Group completed the disposal of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Plus Ultra Compania Anonima fide Seguros y Reaseguros, for a total cash consideration of 152 million.
Net assets at the date of disposal amounted to 52 million and the profit on disposal, after transaction costs, was 94 million.
v In October 2002, the Group entered into a binding agreement to dispose of its Australian and New Zealand general insurance businesses which became unconditional on 24 December 2002.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Group sold its wholly-owned subsidiaries CGU Australia Limited and Belves Investments Limited, which are the holding companies for all of Avivas general insurance businesses in Australia and New Zealand, for a total cash consideration of 651 million including a pre-completion dividend of 106 million.
At the date of disposal, the combined businesses had total net assets of 293 million, including the value of acquired goodwill.
The loss on disposal, after writing back goodwill of 300 million previously written off to reserves and after deducting associated costs of sale, was 66 million.
In calculating the 86 million loss on the disposal of Sabre Insurance Company Limited, CGU Australia Limited and Belves Investments Limited, 310 million of goodwill previously written off to reserves has been brought back into account, as required by FRS10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
The same goodwill amount is also credited directly to the profit and loss account reserve and therefore has a neutral effect on shareholders funds.

The valuation of properties has been undertaken by qualified external valuers or prepared or monitored by qualified members of staff reporting to the Head of Property of Morley Fund Management Limited, who is a Fellow of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, or by local qualified staff of the Group in overseas operations.
All properties are valued at market value.
20 Investments in joint ventures a As part of their investment strategy, the UK long-term business policyholder funds have invested in a number of property limited partnerships PLPs during the year, through a mix of capital and loans.
The PLPs are managed by general partners GPs, in which the UK long-term business shareholder companies hold equity stakes and which themselves hold nominal stakes in the PLPs.
Most of the PLPs have raised external debt, secured on their respective property portfolios.
The lenders are only entitled to obtain payment, of both interest and principal, to the extent that there are sufficient resources in the respective PLPs.
The lenders have no recourse whatsoever to the policyholder or shareholders funds of any company of the Aviva Group.
Accounting for the PLPs as subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures or other financial investments depends on the shareholdings in the GPs and the terms in each partnership agreement.
Where the Group exerts control over a PLP, it has been treated as a subsidiary and its results, assets and liabilities have been consolidated.
Where the partnership is managed by a contractual agreement such that no one party exerts control, notwithstanding that the Groups partnership share in the PLP including its indirect stake via the relevant GP may be greater than 50%, such PLPs have been accounted for as joint ventures.
Here, the Groups share of the respective PLPs gross assets and gross liabilities are shown on the face of the consolidated balance sheet, in accordance with the requirements of FRS9 Associates and joint ventures.
Where the Group holds minority stakes in PLPs, with no disproportionate influence, the relevant investments are included in other financial investments at their market value.
In addition to the PLPs described above, the Group has invested in a joint venture life assurance company in China which had not commenced operations at 31 December 2002.
Details of the principal joint ventures are given in section c below.

d In addition to the investments in participating interests detailed in note 21, the Group holds investments exceeding 20% of a class of the equity capital in a number of other companies in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.
These investments do not represent a material part of the assets or investment income of the Group.
These include the Groups 8.3% 2001: 7.8% shareholding in Delta Lloyd Investment Fund NV.
As this company invests mainly in equities and all dividends received are passed on to the shareholders, the Groups interest has been shown in other financial investments in these accounts.
The economic benefits of ownership of an additional holding of 21.2% 2001: 16.6% belong to the Delta Lloyd Pension Fund.
e Included within other financial investments are shareholdings held on a long-term basis in the issued share capital of Socit Gnrale, a banking company incorporated in France, Mnchener , a reinsurance company incorporated in Germany and The Royal Bank of Scotland Group, a banking company incorporated in Scotland.

Of these holdings, the long-term business operations owned 355 million 2001: 453 million of the Socit Gnrale shares, 211 million 2001: 509 million of the Mnchener  shares and 911 million 2001: 1,510 million of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group shares.
f At 31 December 2002, the Group held equity index futures, forwards and options to buy a notional total of 1,480 million 2001: 1,771 million and to sell a notional total of 1,832 million 2001: 1,657 million for long-term business operations.
These contracts have a net positive fair value of 331 million 2001: 86 million.
No adjustment has been made to the classification of existing investments to reflect the effect of the future settlement of these transactions.
In 1998, the Group purchased several swap options from a European bank to cover a possible future exposure to interest rates related to guaranteed annuities in a subsidiary purchased prior to 1998.
At 31 December 2002, the exposure hedged by these options was 2,550 million 2001: 2,451 million and the contracts had a fair market value of 167 million 2001: 132 million.
These options have varying expiry dates up to 2028. g The Group has entered into stocklending arrangements in the United Kingdom and overseas during the year in accordance with established market conventions.
In the United Kingdom, investments are lent to locally-domiciled counterparties and governed by agreements written under English law.
Other investments are specifically deposited under local laws in various countries overseas as security to holders of policies issued there.
Included within other financial investments are 295 million 2001: 336 million of debt securities and other fixed income securities which have been sold under stock repurchase arrangements.
The obligations arising under these arrangements are included in other creditors see note 43.
73 Aviva plc Annual report accounts 2002 Notes to the accounts continued 23 Securitised mortgages and related assets Other financial investments include loans secured by mortgages, subject to non-recourse finance arrangements, in a UK long-term business subsidiary and in a Dutch subsidiary.
These balances are accounted for using a linked presentation in accordance with FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions.
Details of the relevant transactions are as follows: a In a United Kingdom long-term business subsidiary NUER, the beneficial interest in two portfolios of equity release mortgages has been transferred to two special purpose securitisation companies, Equity Release Funding No 1 plc ERF1 and Equity Release Funding No 2 plc ERF2 together the ERF companies, in return for initial consideration and, at later dates, deferred consideration.
The deferred consideration represents receipts accrued within the ERF companies after meeting all their obligations to the noteholders, loan providers and other third parties in the priority of payments.
No gain or loss was recognised on the transfer to ERF1, and a gain of 5.2 million was recognised on the transfer to ERF2.
The purchases of the mortgages were funded by the issue of fixed and floating rate notes by the ERF companies.
The ultimate effective holding company of both the ERF companies is Equity Release Funding Holdings Limited, whose shares are held on trust.
NUER does not own, directly or indirectly, any of the share capital of the ERF companies or their parent company.
NUER has no right to repurchase the benefit of any of the securitised mortgage loans, other than in certain circumstances where NUER is in breach of warranty or loans are substituted in order to effect a further advance.
NUER has indemnified the ERF companies for any losses they may suffer should its customers set off any shortfall in their annuities purchased from another Aviva Group company against amounts they owe to the ERF companies, and any shortfall due to negative equity not insured elsewhere.
NUERs liability under these indemnities, estimated as 5 million, is included in other creditors in the consolidated balance sheet, whilst the linked liabilities figure has been reduced by the same amount to show the Groups net interest in these securitisations.
NUER has purchased 12.5 million of subordinated fixed rate notes in ERF1, which are repayable in 2031.
These are included in debt securities and other fixed income securities within other financial investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
NUER receives payments from the ERF companies in respect of fees for loan administration and cash handling purposes.
Income of 2 million 2001: 1 million has been included in investment income, relating to the securitisation of the mortgage portfolios.
b In a Dutch subsidiary DL, the principal benefits of three portfolios of mortgage loans have been transferred to three special purpose securitisation companies, Arena 2000-1 BV, Arena 2001-1 BV and Arena 2002-1 BV, the Arena companies, which were funded primarily through the issue of fixed rate notes.
No gains or losses were recognised on these transfers.
All the shares in the Arena companies are held by independent trustees, respectively Stichting Security Trustee Arena 2000-1 BV, Stichting Security Trustee Arena 2001-1 BV and Stichting Security Trustee Arena 2002-1 BV.
DL does not own, directly or indirectly, any of the share capital of the Arena companies or their parent companies.
DL has no right, nor any obligation, to repurchase the benefit of any of the securitised mortgage loans, other than in certain circumstances where DL is in breach of warranty.
DL has purchased 18 million of the fixed rate notes in Arena 2000-1 BV, which are repayable in 2062, and 21 million of the fixed rate notes in Arena 2001-1 BV, repayable in 2053.
These are included in debt securities and other fixed income securities within other financial investments in the consolidated balance sheet at their market value of 5 million 2001: 41 million.
DL receives payments from the Arena companies in respect of fees for loan administration services, and also under the terms of interest rate swaps written between DL and the Arena companies to hedge their respective exposures to movements in interest rates arising from these transactions.
In each case, the effect of the interest rate swaps is that the Arena companies swap all or part of the interest flows receivable from customers in respect of the securitised mortgage loans into fixed interest flows which are designed broadly to match the interest payable to the noteholders.
Included in investment income is 71 million 2001: 36 million relating to the securitisation of these mortgage loan portfolios.
In all of the above transactions, Aviva Group and its subsidiaries are not obliged to support any losses that may be suffered by the noteholders and do not intend to provide such support.
Additionally, the notes were issued on the basis that noteholders are only entitled to obtain payment, of both principal and interest, to the extent that the available resources of the respective special purpose securitisation companies, including funds due from customers in respect of the securitised loans, are sufficient and that noteholders have no recourse whatsoever to other companies in the Aviva Group.
