Notes to the accounts 1 Basis of preparation The Group accounts include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings all of which are made up to 31 December 2002.
As provided for by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, a separate profit and loss account is not presented for the Company.
2 Accounting policies Convention The financial information is prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include revaluation of the fixed asset properties and in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards.
The Group has adopted the new accounting standard FRS 19: Deferred tax during the year.
As a result of the implementation of this standard, a previously unrecognised deferred tax asset has been recognised.
In the current year, a deferred tax asset of 481,000 has been recognised and the tax charge has been adjusted to take account of 133,000 2001: 277,000 of deferred tax charge arising from the reversal of timing differences during 2002.
The opening profit and loss reserve has been increased to reflect the opening deferred tax asset, which would have been recognised as at 31 December 2001, amounting to 614,000.
The comparative figures for the year ended 31 December 2001 have been restated to reflect the recognition of the deferred tax asset.
The Group has implemented stage two of the transitional rules of FRS 17: Retirement Benefits during the year.
Required disclosures are included in note 28.
Turnover and profits Turnover principally arises from the sale of residential properties and land.
Turnover and profits in respect of house sales, land sales and land exchanges are taken at the time of legal completion of the sale.
Turnover does not include the sale of properties accepted in part exchange.
The net profits or losses arising on the sale of part exchanged properties are dealt with in cost of sales.
Profits arising from land exchanges are recognised only when the profits are supported by cash generation.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse, based on tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date.
Fixed assets and depreciation In complying with FRS 15: Tangible Fixed Assets revalued tangible fixed asset properties owned by the Group at 31 December 1999 are retained at their prevailing book values as at 31 December 1999.
In doing so, the directors have carried out an impairment review as at 31 December 2002 and have confirmed the prevailing valuations as acceptable.
Depreciation is provided on freehold and long leasehold properties based upon the difference between book value and estimated residual value charged over the estimated useful life of the property.
The directors are of the opinion that, having regard to estimated residual values, based on prices prevailing at the dates of acquisition or subsequent revaluation, and the estimated useful economic lives, any depreciation involved, either annual or cumulative, would not be material.
All the properties are subject to an annual impairment review.
An impairment loss on a revalued property is recognised in the profit and loss account if it is caused by a clear consumption of economic benefits.
Other impairments of revalued properties are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses until the carrying amount of the property reaches depreciated historical cost and thereafter in the profit and loss account.
Impairment losses on other properties held at cost are charged to the profit and loss account.
Plant and machinery is depreciated on a 33.3% reducing balance basis.
Computer equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over three years.
Office machinery is depreciated on a 25% reducing balance basis.

Land held for development, including land in the course of development until legal completion of sale, is recorded at cost and contains no addition for overheads.
Land acquired on deferred terms through the use of bills of exchange is included based on the face value of the bill.
Options purchased in respect of land are capitalised and amortised over the life of the option to enable full amortisation at the date the option period ends.
Options are reviewed for impairment on a regular basis and provision made accordingly to reflect loss of value.
The remaining amortised value of the option at the date of exercise is included within the cost of land purchased as a result of the option.
Raw materials and consumables are recorded at cost as invoiced by suppliers.
Housing stocks and properties taken in part exchange are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Work in progress is valued at prime cost of labour and materials with an addition for overheads other than those for general administration.
Progress payments received and receivable from contracts are deducted from work in progress.
Provision is made, where appropriate, to reduce the value of stocks and work in progress to estimated realisable value.
Bills of exchange Bills of exchange accepted by the Group in connection with the purchase of land on deferred terms are included at the face value of the bill from the date of acceptance.
Pensions Pension contributions for the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme, a defined benefits scheme, are charged to the profit and loss account on a basis which spreads the cost over the employees expected average working lives with the Group.
Pension contibutions for the Bovis Homes Group Personal Pension Plan, a defined contribution scheme, are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.

9 Pensions The required disclosures under FRS17: Retirement Benefits are included in note 28.
The following disclosures are based on the accounting rules under SSAP24: Accounting for pension costs.
The Bovis Homes Pension Scheme is an occupational pension scheme providing benefits based on employees length of service and final average earnings.
The assets of the Scheme are held in a trust separately from the Company.
The Group paid contributions during 2002 equal to the 2002 pension cost of 2,215,772 2001: 1,842,337.
The 2002 pension cost is based on the results of the actuarial valuations completed at 30 June 2001, carried out by an independent qualified actuary.
The 2001 actuarial valuation revealed that the pension cost was 20% of pensionable earnings less lower earnings limit adjustments where appropriate.
The 2001 valuation used the projected unit method, the assets were taken into account at their market value and the assumptions used to value the Schemes liabilities were as follows: 2001 valuation assumptions % per annum Discount rate - for past service 6.0 - for future service 6.5 Rate of increase in earnings 4.0 Rate of increase in pensions - for service to 5 April 1997 2.25 - for service from 6 April 1997 2.5 Rate of price inflation 2.5 At the date of the 2001 valuation 30 June 2001 the market value of the Schemes assets was 31.0 million and the actuarial value of the Schemes assets represented 97.5% of the value of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The Bovis Homes Group Personal Pension Plan is a defined contribution scheme established on 1 January 2002 for new employees joining the Group.
The Group paid contributions during 2002 of 14,242 2001: nil.

Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated on profit after tax of 73,503,000 2001: 56,329,000 over the diluted weighted average of 116,616,844 2001: 115,391,819 ordinary shares potentially in issue during the year.
The diluted average number of shares is calculated in accordance with FRS 14: Earnings Per Share.
The dilutive effect relates to the average number of potential ordinary shares held under option during the year.
This dilutive effect amounts to the number of ordinary shares which would be purchased using the aggregate difference in value between the market value of shares and the share option exercise price.
The market value of shares has been calculated using the average ordinary share price during the year.
Only share options which have met their cumulative performance criteria as at the year end have been included in the dilution calculation.
There is no dilutive effect on the profit after tax used in the diluted earnings per share calculation.
The weighted average number of shares excludes shares held in employee share trusts where dividends have been waived.

uk Notes to the accounts continued 19 Financial instruments The Groups financial instruments comprise cash and liquid resources, bank loans and overdrafts, and various items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
Short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the financial instrument disclosures.
Throughout the period under review, the Groups policy has been that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The Group has no exposure to currency risk as all its financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
The Group has various bilateral committed revolving loan facilities.
At 31 December 2002 these facilities totalled 211 million with seven banks.
These facilities are split into five tranches: Facility Set up date Maturity date 35 million 11 December 2000 10 December 2005 20 million 11 December 2000 10 December 2007 124 million 10 January 2002 9 January 2007 20 million 6 February 2002 5 February 2007 12 million 3 May 2002 2 May 2007 At 31 December 2002, 136 million of these facilities remained undrawn.
The facilities which mature on 10 December 2005 and 10 December 2007 were fully drawn.
Of the facility which matures on 9 January 2007, 20 million was drawn.
Financial assets and liabilities of the Group at 31 December 2002 comprised: 2002 2001 000 000 Cash balances 4 386 Short term deposits 81,544 6,000 Bank overdraft and bank loans repayable within one year 1,935 8,614 Bank loans repayable after more than one year 75,000 55,000 Other debtors falling due after more than one year 5,082 8,465 Other creditors due after more than one year 16,657 12,320 Bills of exchange payable after more than one year - 43,985 The interest rate profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2002 was as follows: 2002 2001 000 000 Floating rate 1,935 614 Fixed rate 75,000 63,000 No interest 16,657 56,305 93,592 119,919 The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets at 31 December 2002 was as follows: 2002 2001 000 000 Fixed rate 81,544 6,384 No interest 5,086 8,467 86,630 14,851 Bovis Homes Group PLC Page 63 Notes to the accounts continued 19 Financial instruments continued The maturity of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2002 can be analysed as follows: 2002 2001 000 000 One year or less, or on demand 1,935 8,614 More than one year but not more than two years 7,821 55,377 More than two years but not more than five years 83,836 35,928 More than five years - 20,000 93,592 119,919 The floating rate bank overdraft is subject to interest rates related to bank base rate and is repayable on demand.
The fixed rate financial assets relate to cash placed on the money market.
These sums earn interest based on interest rates set by contract and have short term fixed periods to maturity.
At 31 December 2002 the Group held borrowings of 75 million.
These borrowings, although repayable at dates in 2003 are drawn down through bilateral committed revolving loan facilities which mature at dates after 31 December 2003.
The borrowings are capable of being refinanced under these facilities and are therefore disclosed as liabilities due after more than one year.
Of the 75 million of borrowings, 35 million is repayable on 11 June 2003 and attracts a fixed rate of interest of 6.57% per annum, 20 million is repayable on 11 June 2003 and attracts a fixed rate of 6.70% per annum and 20 million is repayable on 10 January 2003 and attracts a fixed rate of interest of 6.09% per annum.
All of these loans have interest rates which are based on floating interest rates prevailing at the dates of drawing down, however, the rates of interest are fixed through interest rate swap arrangements.
The interest rate swap arrangements which fix the interest rates payable on 55 million of the Groups borrowings were established on 11 December 2000, 35 million fixed for a five year period and 20 million fixed for a seven year period.
The swap arrangements are recalculated on a semi annual basis to fix the interest rates at 6.57% and 6.70% respectively.
The interest rate swap arrangements which fix the interest rates payable on the remaining 20 million of the Groups borrowings were established on 10 January 2002 for a five year period.
These swap arrangements are calculated on a semi annual basis to fix the interest rate at 6.09%.
The weighted average interest rate applying to borrowings as at 31 December 2002 was 6.48% 2001: 6.34% and the weighted average maturity period of borrowings was 3.8 years 2001: 4.2 years.
The Group has not entered into derivative transactions other than the interest rate swap arrangements.
Other debtors and other creditors due after more than one year are not subject to interest.
Other than the Groups borrowings, amounts due after one year relate almost exclusively to sums due on land purchase contracts.
These sums are generally due for payment based upon details included within the land purchase contract and their maturity is therefore certain.
The fair value of land creditors due after more than one year amounted to 13.4 million compared with their carrying value of 16.1 million.
The fair value was derived from the discounting of future cash flows in settling land creditors.
The fair value of the Groups fixed rate borrowings, fixed by interest swap arrangements, repayable after more than one year amounted to 78.7 million compared with their carrying value of 75.0 million.
The increase in fair value over book value reflected the cost of borrowing prevailing at 31 December 2002 as against the fixed rate of borrowings arising from the swap arrangements.
The fair value differences of the long term financial liabilities are not required to be accounted for within the profit and loss account.
The differences as disclosed will reverse as these liabilities near their maturity.
There were no material differences between the book value and fair value of the Groups financial assets due after more than one year.
