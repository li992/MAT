The Company believes that, given their detailed knowledge of the Groups operations, its structure and accounting policies and the importance of carrying out detailed due diligence as part of the acquisition process, it is appropriate for this additional work to be carried out by the Companys auditors rather than another firm of accountants.

22 Pensions The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes throughout the world.
The funds of the principal schemes are administered by trustees and are held independently from the Group.
The net pension cost for the Group was 16.1m 2001: 16.1m of which 8.7m 2001: 11.0m was in respect of principal defined benefit schemes which provide benefits based on final pensionable salary.
This cost is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
Valuations of the principal UK defined benefit schemes were carried out as at 5 April 2000.
The regular pension cost of the principal UK defined benefit schemes is adjusted for the amortisation of the difference between the actuarial surpluses and the prepayment on the balance sheet over the remaining service lives of current employees and is offset by interest arising on the surpluses.
The results of the most recent actuarial valuations of the principal defined benefit schemes were: UK US Date of most recent valuations 5.4.
02 Method used Projected unit method Entry age normal method Main assumptions: investment return return on assets per annum 6.0% 8.0% salary increases per annum 4.25% 5.0% market value of investments at last valuation date 144.8m 54.5m level of funding, being the actuarial value of assets expressed as a percentage of the accrued service liabilities 101% 86% The Group operates other schemes overseas in accordance with local practice and legislation.
Some of these schemes are externally funded, while others are internally funded, the amount set aside being shown in provisions for liabilities and charges.
FRS17 Retirement Benefits Whilst the Group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with SSAP24 Accounting for Pension Costs, under FRS17 Retirement Benefits FRS17 the following additional transitional disclosures are required: The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in updating the most recent valuations of the principal UK and US schemes to 31 December for FRS17 purposes were: UK US 2002 2001 2002 2001 Rate of increase in salaries 3.25% 3.5% 4.0% 5.0% Rate of increase in pensions 2.25% 2.5% Discount rate 5.5% 6.0% 6.75% 7.25% Inflation rate 2.25% 2.5% 2.5% 3.5% The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
