Prudential plc Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2002 1 Chairmans Statement This is my first statement to shareholders as Chairman of Prudential.
Since joining the Company at the beginning of December, I have been impressed with the quality of businesses we have around the world.
People often think of us as simply a UK life insurer with some overseas operations.
The reality is that we are a major international financial services group with a strong franchise, excellent people and a strategy focused on delivering value for our shareholders and policyholders over the long-term.
Seventy per cent of our new business achieved profit is now derived from overseas and our financial position is among the strongest in our peer group.
These factors enabled us to report total Group insurance and investment sales of 27.6 billion, an increase of 29 per cent, and an achieved basis operating profit of 1,133 million, up two per cent.
These results were particularly pleasing as they were achieved against the background of some of the most challenging market conditions we have seen for many years.
Clearly, we were not immune to these difficult economic and market conditions but our performance shows that we have built a good platform on which to continue delivering growth in the future.
Jonathan Bloomer, Group Chief Executive, talks in more detail about our focus on delivering value in his review on the following pages of this Report.
A commentary about our businesses in Asia, the United States and the United Kingdom can be found in the Business Review on pages 6 to 13.
The difficult market conditions affected our modified statutory profits which fell to 432 million.
The main causes of this were the lower bonuses paid by the UK Life Assurance business and the credit losses arising in our US Assurance business.
Turning to the issue of dividends, the Board announced a total dividend for 2002 of 26 pence, a small increase on the previous year.
But, looking to the future, the Board has felt that it needed, given the uncertainty in capital markets, to retain flexibility and could not recommit to the policy of progressive dividend increases from the current level.
We recognise that this has created uncertainty for shareholders and we will seek to address this when we reach the interim results in July.
Coming into the industry, one of the things on which I have spent time is the way life insurers in the United Kingdom report their financial results.
In particular, people often ask why we present these in two different ways: modified statutory basis and achieved profits basis.
Philip Broadley, Group Finance Director, talks about this in detail in his Financial Review later in this Report but I wanted to touch briefly on the issue here as it has a direct relationship with our focus on delivering value over the long term.
2 Prudential plc Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2002 We are required to account for our insurance business on the We have given thought in the Board to the Higgs Review of modified statutory basis MSB of reporting under UK accounting the role and effectiveness of non-executive directors, both as rules.
In essence, this determines our statutory profit and reserves a major company in our own right and as investor in a very large and is an indicator of the cashflow generated by continuing number of UK listed companies.
We are broadly supportive operations.
What MSB does not do, however, is provide a of the Review, although any attempt to define Best Practice measure of the value that is generated each year for shareholders quickly brings to mind a number of successful companies that by companies such as Prudential that write long-term insurance do not follow all of the principles outlined.

of our greatest assets is of course our staff.
As I have visited some of our businesses around the world since joining the Group, I have been impressed with their professionalism and commitment and I would like to thank all of them for their considerable efforts.
During the year, there have been some changes to the Board.
David Clementi Sir Roger Hurn announced his intention to step down from Chairman the Board in April but agreed to stay on as Chairman until a successor had been identified and was in place.
Sir Roger made a significant contribution to the development of the Company and I know that my colleagues on the Board are very grateful for the support, advice and guidance he gave over the three years he was with the Group.
In May, Bart Becht joined as a non-executive director.
Bart, who is Chief Executive of Reckitt Benckiser plc, has a wealth of international experience and he has already made a valuable contribution to our discussions at the Board.
Prudential plc Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2002 3 Group Chief Executives Review In recent years Prudential has undertaken a number of far-reaching initiatives which have resulted in a Group with a diversified range of international businesses and strong growth prospects.
This strategy is evident in the Groups results for 2002.
The Group achieved significant increases in sales of insurance and investment products and at the same time it expanded its margin on new business.
Over the last few years we have developed and grown the Group significantly.
We have expanded our Asian business, developed Egg and shareholder backed businesses in the UK and grown Jackson National in the US.
In doing this we have managed the need for capital while recognising the importance of distributions to our shareholders.
2002 was a tough year, with market confidence being adversely affected by increased political risk and a deteriorating economic outlook.
In February 2003, it was clear that stock markets around the world continued to be volatile and consumer confidence had deteriorated.
WE WILL In this context, the Group continued to review its growth and cash flow plans.
As in the past, we will invest for value, not simply for top line growth, and we will allocate capital to those areas of our business where we see the greatest value creation opportunities.
We will therefore continue to invest in INVEST our businesses in Asia, where growth prospects remain high, while we expect to manage the level of business in the more mature markets of the US and UK to achieve a balance FOR VALUE between value creation and capital consumption.
Focus on Sustainable Value WE WILL ALLOCATE CAPITAL TO THOSE In 2002 we made good progress towards achieving our goal of AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS WHERE WE doubling the intrinsic value of the Group over four years.
One SEE THE GREATEST VALUE CREATION of the key measures of whether we are on track is new business OPPORTUNITIES.
achieved profits which, to double in four years, would need to compound at an annual growth of 19 per cent.
While we believe that 2003 will be a particularly stretching year, our priority will be to continue to develop and deliver our strategy to build value across the Group.
SUCCESSFUL The success of Prudentials strategy is clear from the 2002 full-year results.
Total Group insurance and investment sales were 27.6 billion, an increase of 29 per cent on 2001.
On an annual premium equivalent APE basis insurance sales were STRATEGY up nine per cent to 1.9 billion, reflecting growth of 23 per cent and 18 per cent in the US and Asia respectively.
Approximately 74 PER CENT OF GROUP SALES CAME FROM 74 per cent of total Group sales came from outside the UK, OUTSIDE THE UK, DEMONSTRATING THE demonstrating the benefits of the Groups international BENEFITS OF THE GROUPS INTERNATIONAL diversification.
The results showed generally improving margins for new business as the Group continued to benefit from a focus on high-margin business.
Margins in 2002 for the US increased from 35 per cent to 39 per cent and in Asia from 59 per cent to 60 per cent.
In the UK, margins for long-term business declined slightly, moving from 30 per cent in 2001 to 29 per cent in 2002.
Group new business achieved profit rose by 15 per cent in 2002 to 774 million.

On the institutional side, M&G continues to benefit from its competitive advantage in specialist fixed interest and private finance.
Egg continues to go from strength to strength.
The UK business is now profitable as well as having almost 2.6 million customers Jonathan Bloomer and a five per cent market share of credit card balances.
This is Group Chief Executive a strong performance considering the business was only launched just over four years ago.
Egg has now also successfully launched the first stage of its international expansion in France.
Favourable Demographics The long-term demographic trends in the US, an ageing population and increasing life expectancy, and a relatively low level of social security support for retirement savings, remain favourable for Jackson National Life JNL which, with its valuebased approach, has positioned itself to take advantage of the opportunities.
In what is a very fragmented market with a huge number of players, JNL has developed into one of the leading life insurers in the US.
However, instead of focusing on becoming a scale player purely in terms of size, it has a value-based definition of scale, meaning that it only seeks leading positions in segments of the market that it can serve profitably.
This, together with a cost base below the industry average, modern and highly sophisticated IT systems, and diversified and flexible products and distribution, mean that JNL is positioned to benefit from growth in the US savings market.

Life product sales were down on 2001 with total sales down five per cent and APE sales down eight per cent to 247 million.
However, during 2002, the UK insurance operations maintained its position as a leading distributor of with-profits bonds through Independent Financial Advisers.
Prudential believes that with-profits continue to offer an attractive investment option for investors.
It expects to remain one of the leading providers of with-profits policies in the future and is developing new products, which offer the advantages of a smoothed investment return, but with increased transparency.
In October 2002 Prudential entered the structured ISA market, launching the first offer of the Prudential Growth and Income Plan, sales of which were encouraging.
A further series of offers are planned for 2003, the first of which was launched in January.
Prudential broadened its distribution during the year through a distribution agreement with Abbey National for an initial four-year period.
This arrangement anticipates proposed changes to polarisation rules that will liberalise sales channels and allow banks to offer advice on other companies regulated 6 Prudential plc Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2002 products and will allow Prudentials with-profits bonds to be made available for distribution through Abbey Nationals extensive high street branch network.
Pre-depolarisation, BROADENED Prudential has entered into a similar distribution arrangement that will meet the current regulatory requirements, and will provide similar benefits.
This arrangement was launched on 11 December 2002 and sales have been encouraging.
DISTRIBUTION Since the year-end Prudential has announced a proposed PROPOSED RULE CHANGES WILL distribution arrangement with Zurich Financial Services, LIBERALISE SALES CHANNELS FOR which is expected to further broaden Prudentials distribution, INSURANCE PRODUCTS.
In November 2001 the Company announced a target for cost savings of 175 million by the end of 2004 and in July 2002 increased this target to 200 million.
These savings arise from the creation of the single customer service organisation, the rationalisation of support services and a refocusing of IT investment.
Of this amount, it is estimated that 65 million on an achieved profit basis will be attributable to shareholders.
Good progress has been made and 130 million of savings were delivered in 2002 with an annualised value of 155 million.
Prudential remains confident of achieving this important reduction in operating costs.
In September 2002 the Company announced plans to establish an offshore service centre in India to improve customer contact service and achieve additional cost savings.
The new processing centre will be established in Mumbai and is now expected to be operational in 2003.
This initiative is expected to incur a restructuring charge of approximately 20 million.
The current estimated impact on shareholders would be a charge of 5 million against achieved basis operating profit, spread over 2002 and the next two years.
However, due to the creation of a lower-cost servicing centre, this charge will be offset by expected annual gross cost savings from 2006 of approximately 16 million, of which 4 million per annum will be attributable to shareholders.
As a result of the continuing depressed levels of world stock markets, bonuses were reduced on conventional and unitised with-profits policies in February 2003.
This followed earlier reductions on unitised with-profits policies in September and December 2002.
These actions were taken to protect the strong financial position of the with-profits fund and to protect the long-term interests of customers.
2002 was a turbulent year for global equity markets, with the FTSE 100 falling by 24.5 per cent during the year.
However, the investment return on Prudentials with-profits fund was negative 8.1 per cent in the year to 31 December 2002 reflecting its diversified investment mix.
In 2002, profits distributed from Prudentials main with-profits fund amounted to 2.7 billion, of which 2.45 billion 90 per cent was added to policies as bonuses, and 273 million 10 per cent is available for distribution to shareholders.
We believe that the UK market for long-term savings will continue to be difficult in 2003.
Prudential with its trusted brand and financial strength is well placed to compete strongly in this environment.

Prudential Europe In early 2002 Prudential reviewed its strategy for the Prudential and Scottish Amicable branded long-term business within continental Europe.
The review concluded that an organic strategy based on investment in the German and French markets would be unlikely to meet return on capital targets.
Analysis indicated that the returns achievable from any available acquisition would be too low to justify the investment of capital.
As a consequence, in November 2002 Prudential agreed to sell its German life business to Canada Life Financial Corporation Canada Life for 129 million 82 million.
The sale was completed on 1 January 2003.
Irish High Court approval for the transfer of the relevant life assurance policies to Canada Life is expected early in the second half of 2003.
Prudential will continue to run its existing operations in France for value, but not push for growth.

Prudential plc Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2002 11 Business Review continued Asia Prudential Corporation Asia PCA continued to strengthen its 2002 APE sales by country 513m total position in 2002 as a leader in both the life insurance and mutual fund markets across the region.
Based on preliminary estimates, Singapore 14% PCA believes it ended 2002 with top five market shares in eight Asian life insurance markets, two mutual fund markets and Malaysia 12% Hong Kongs Mandatory Provident Fund MPF market.
This Hong Kong 19% demonstrates its continuing success in building a very strong Japan 8% portfolio of businesses across the region.
Taiwan 29% The economic environment in 2002 was challenging, but PCA Other 18% nevertheless delivered a very positive set of results for the year.
Insurance sales on an APE basis were 513 million in 2002, up 18 per cent compared to 2001 and new business achieved profits NBAP of 307 million increased by 20 per cent.
PCAs average New business achieved profit NBAP margin on APE insurance sales remained broadly constant at 60 per cent 59 per cent in 2001.
Operating achieved profits % before tax, head office expenses and minority interests, were 100 490 million, up 24 per cent from 2001, and modified statutory basis profits before tax, head office costs and minority interests, 80 for the year were 62 million, up from 25 million in 2001.
60 40 PCAs primary business is the manufacture and distribution Traditional of life insurance and medium and long-term savings products 20 through agency and third-party distribution channels.
A key Accident and health 0 driver of our success has been the rate at which it has been 1998 2002 Linked able to expand its agency force, and the productivity achieved by its agents.
PCA now has 89,000 agents across Asia and regional teams ensure that quality training and best practice are applied consistently.
The largest increases in agent numbers in 2002 have been in its recently established operations in Vietnam and India.
During the year PCA also made significant progress in enhancing agent productivity through sales and product training programmes in many of its operations.
Bancassurance, through distribution agreements with banks, has continued to provide a material source of new business.
Across the region, PCA now has a total of 18 bancassurance agreements in 10 countries.
Alternative distribution, which includes bancassurance, produced 21 per cent of insurance APE sales in 2002, compared with 17 per cent in 2001.
PCAs success in markets across the region is in large part due to its product innovation, and its readiness to package and market products to meet specific customer needs.
In 2002 PCA continued to leverage its regional leadership in capital efficient unit-linked products with successful launches in India, the Philippines and regular premium unit-linked products in Taiwan.
Additionally, PCA LIFE Japan secured regulatory approval for variable annuity products, drawing on technical expertise developed in Jackson National Life in America.
Working with JNL on product design and pre-launch preparations meant a successful launch in October 2002 was possible, very soon after regulatory approval was received.
Being a pioneer and leader in the introduction of capital efficient unit-linked life insurance remains a significant source of competitive advantage in both its established and newer markets: 30 per cent of PCAs APE sales in 2002 came from unit-linked life products, up from 23 per cent in 2001.
PCAs operations in Greater China achieved significant growth in 2002.
In Hong Kong its market share on an APE basis for yearto-date 30 September 2002 was 10.4 per cent.

In Guangzhou China, its joint venture with CITIC grew insurance APE sales by 39 per cent and it has recently Products secured a second licence in Beijing.
Life: traditional unit linked The focus of PCAs South Asia operations continues to be its Mutual funds well-established market presence in Singapore and Malaysia.
General In 2002 PCA improved its position in both of these markets.
Distribution In Malaysia for year to date 30 September 2002 it was number Agency one for insurance APE sales for the first time, and in Singapore Bank for year to date 30 September 2002 it was number two for the Broker important regular premium market.
In Singapore a new regulatory Direct regime was introduced in late 2002.
While the full impact of 1994 this will be known over time, PCA has thoroughly evaluated the December 2002 potential outcomes and consequences and is well positioned to build upon its strong franchise in 2003 and beyond.
PCA has recently entered the very large and material North Asian markets of Japan and South Korea through the acquisition of small but operationally and financially sound local companies.
There are clear plans in place to build significant and sustainably profitable operations over the long term in both countries.
In 2002 very good progress was made with management teams being strengthened and the product ranges and pricing structures re-based.
The focus is on building distribution and raising brand awareness.
In 2002, PCA continued to pursue its long-term strategy of building a complementary, material and profitable regional mutual fund business.
Progress to date has been very encouraging with market-leading positions in India and Taiwan, growing operations in Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong and the recent acquisition of a mid-sized investment trust management company in the large South Korean market.
As at 31 December 2002 total mutual funds under management have increased to 5.1 billion, up 59 per cent on last year, with strong net inflows of 1 billion.
As would be expected in the current economic environment the majority of the funds under management are in lower margin fixed income type products.
This, coupled with ongoing investment in the development and start-up of this business, means net MSB profits from PCAs mutual fund business are currently not material in the Group context.
During 2002 PCA undertook a comprehensive review of the regions life and mutual fund markets and updated its strategy to optimise growth and profit prospects within a rigorous capital allocation framework.
The long-term prospects for the region, and for PCA as a significant force in the market, remain very positive.
Continued successful implementation of Prudentials strategy should deliver material and sustained profitable growth in the years ahead.
PCA remains well positioned to participate in Asias outstanding long-term growth prospects.
It has a strong track record of successful delivery and a robust business model firmly focused on building businesses in markets and sectors that combine scale opportunities with secure long-term profitability and very attractive returns on capital.

Achieved profits basis financial statements are prepared under guidance issued by the ABI in December 2001.

We believe that the achieved profits basis provides useful information for 6,000 shareholders.

Achieved profits basis methodology Internal The achieved profits basis is a value based method of reporting reporting in that it reflects the change in value of the business.
The results on the achieved profits basis can be used to demonstrate the underlying development of the business.
Set Project Net present Analysis assumptions cash flows of change value Shareholders funds on an achieved profits basis at a given point in time represent, in present value terms, the value of future cash flows expected to arise from the current book of long-term External insurance business plus the net worth of the company.
The reporting results can be presented in a way that provides details to management and shareholders of the change in value during the reporting period.
The change in this value can be analysed as shown in the achieved profits basis shareholders funds chart.
This takes account of: the value added from new business sold during the year: the change in value from existing business already in place in force at the start of the year: short-term fluctuations in investment returns and economic assumption changes: other items for example, profit from other Group operations, tax, foreign exchange, exceptional items : and dividends.
The value added from new business being the present value of the cash flows arising from new business written in the year is a key metric used in the management of the business.
The change in value of business in force in the year demonstrates how the existing book is being managed.
Achieved profits basis results are prepared by first making assumptions about a number of factors including levels of 24 Prudential plc Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2002 future investment return, expenses, surrender levels and Illustration mortality.
These best estimate assumptions are used to project Modified statutory basis and achieved profits basis future cash flows.
The present value of the future cash flows profit profiles for a typical with-profits product is then calculated using a discount rate which reflects both the time value of money and the risks associated with the cash flows.
The risk discount rate is determined using the actual yield on long-term government bonds plus a risk margin.
The projected future cash flows are prepared on a single set of assumptions and the actual outcome may be different from that projected.
Where the actual outcome is different, this will be reflected in the experience variances for that year.
The total profit that emerges over time from an individual contract as calculated using the achieved profits basis is the same as that calculated under the modified statutory basis.
However, since the achieved profits basis reflects discounted future cash flows under this methodology the profit emergence 123456789 10 is advanced: thereby linking more closely to the consequences Duration years of current management actions and the risks and benefits from business sold in the year.
Modified statutory basis The achieved profits basis can be illustrated by considering Achieved profits basis a theoretical individual contract.
Using assumptions for the drivers of future income and expenditure including levels of future investment return, expenses, surrender levels and mortality a profile of future cash flows can be estimated.

cumulative profit profiles for a typical with-profits product The achieved profits basis profits emerging in a given accounting period will comprise the unwinding of the discount which 100% arises from discounting future cash flows for one fewer period and the profit or loss arising from any difference between the actual cash flow and the cash flow, which had been assumed in the accounting period under review.

The payouts in both cases depended on Jackson National Lifes US GAAP net income in the final year and resulted in no payment from either plan.
Michael McLintock Michael McLintocks 2000 cash long-term incentive plan has a three-year performance period and has the same performance conditions described in the section on long-term incentive plans on page 34.
The phantom share price at the beginning of the performance period was 1 and as a result of M&Gs profit growth and fund performance of M&G over the three years, the phantom share price at the end was 1.36.
This resulted in a payment from the phantom share award of 306,000.
Mark Tucker Mark Tuckers 1999 and 2000 cash long-term incentive plans had the same performance conditions as described in the section on long-term incentive plans on page 34.

40 Prudential plc Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2002 Directors Pensions and Life Assurance It is the Companys policy to offer executive directors the facility to save for retirement through efficient pension vehicles.
Changes were introduced by the UK Government in 1989 which restrict the pension provision which can be made under Inland Revenue approved pension schemes for new entrants after 31 May 1989 to benefits on annual basic salary up to a threshold known as the earnings cap.
The earnings cap for the 2002 2003 tax year is 97,200 per annum.
For this reason UK executive directors employed since 1989 are offered a combination of Inland Revenue approved pension schemes and supplementary provision.
UK Inland Revenue Approved Pension Schemes Executive directors are eligible for one of two Inland Revenue approved pension schemes on the same basis as other employees.
The Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS is a non-contributory defined benefit scheme, which provides a pension of 1 60th of Final Pensionable Earnings for each year of service on retirement at age 60 with an option to commute pension for a tax free cash sum.
The scheme also provides on death in service, a lump sum of four times pensionable salary, a spouses pension of the greater of 25 per cent of pensionable salary or 54 per cent of prospective pension at 60, and childrens pensions of the greater of 8.33 per cent of pensionable salary or 18 per cent of prospective pension at 60 in accordance with the scheme rules.
On death in retirement, a spouses pension of 50 per cent of the pension available at retirement before commutation is payable and a lump sum is also payable if death occurs in the first five years of retirement.
Some of the pension payable is guaranteed to increase in line with the Retail Prices Index capped at five per cent, but in recent years all pensions in payment have been increased fully in line with the Retail Prices Index.
Mark Tucker, having commenced employment before 1989, is eligible for benefits from PSPS on all basic salary.
Philip Broadley and Mark Wood are eligible for benefits from PSPS on basic salary up to the earnings cap.
Jonathan Bloomer only receives a lump sum death benefit of four times basic salary up to the earnings cap from PSPS.
The M&G Group Pension Scheme MGGPS is a contributory defined benefit scheme that provides a target pension of 2 3rds of Final Pensionable Earnings on retirement at age 60 for an employee with 30 years or more potential service.
The MGGPS also has an option to commute pension for a tax free cash sum.
The scheme provides on death in service, a lump sum of four times pensionable salary and a spouses pension of 50 per cent of prospective pension at 60.
Some of the pension payable is guaranteed to increase in line with the Retail Prices Index capped at five per cent, but in recent years all pensions have been increased fully in line with the Retail Prices Index.
Members currently contribute 2.4 per cent of basic salary towards the cost of the benefits.
Michael McLintock is eligible for benefits under MGGPS on basic salary up to the earnings cap.
US Directors Clark Manning participates in the JNL Defined Contribution Retirement Plan which is a US tax qualified defined contribution plan a 401k plan under which the total Company contribution for 2002 was 13,973.
Supplementary Arrangements David Clementi is provided with a salary supplement, part of which is a contribution to a personal pension, and life assurance provision of four times his annual fees under the Prudential Supplementary Life Assurance Scheme PSLAS.
The premiums paid by the Company to this scheme are a taxable benefit.
Jonathan Bloomer, Philip Broadley, Michael McLintock and Mark Wood are entitled to taxable salary supplements calculated on a formula based on their basic salary not covered for pension benefits under a UK Inland Revenue approved scheme.
These directors may elect to have this salary supplement paid directly to them or to a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme FURBS established in their name.
In either case it is a taxable emolument.
In addition, these directors are eligible for death benefits broadly equivalent to the PSPS death benefits both the lump sum and the capitalised value of spouses and childrens pensions on that part of their basic salary not covered by the Inland Revenue approved scheme under the Prudential Supplementary Life Assurance Scheme PSLAS.
Clark Manning is provided with life assurance cover of two times basic salary.
