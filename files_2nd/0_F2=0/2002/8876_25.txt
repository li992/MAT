XX 55 ACCOUNTS Johnston Press Annual Report & Accounts 2002 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Year to 31 December 2002 1.
Accounting Policies The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain fixed assets, and using applicable accounting standards.
No Profit and Loss Account is presented for the Parent Company as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Of the Group profit for the financial year, 89,004,000 2001 - 40,528,000 is dealt with in the accounts of the Parent Company.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of Johnston Press plc and all its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
The Group has adopted the acquisition method of accounting.
Under this method the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Group Profit and Loss Account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
In accordance with FRS10, as from 1 January 1998, goodwill is capitalised.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year ended 31 December 1997 and earlier periods was written off to reserves in accordance with the accounting standard then in force.
As permitted by the current accounting standard the goodwill previously written off to reserves has not been reinstated in the balance sheet.
On disposal or closure of a previously acquired business, the attributable amount of goodwill previously written off to reserves is included in determining the profit or loss on disposal.
Publishing titles Publishing titles separately acquired after 1 January 1989 are stated in the Balance Sheet at cost.
All publishing titles owned by subsidiaries acquired after 1 January 1996 are included in the Balance Sheet at Directors valuation.
The Company has taken the view that these titles have no finite life, and in accordance with the provisions of FRS10 and FRS11 annual impairment tests are undertaken to determine any diminution in value.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are shown at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment, as set out in note 13.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at varying rates calculated to write off cost or valuation over their useful lives.
The principal rates employed are: 1 Heritable and freehold property excluding land 2 2% on written down value Leasehold land and buildings equal annual instalments over term of lease Web offset presses 5% straight line basis Pre-press systems 20% straight line basis Other plant and machinery 15% on written down value 2 6 3%, 10% and 20% straight line basis Motor vehicles 25% straight line basis 25% on written down value Revaluation of properties The Group has adopted the transitional provisions of FRS15 in retaining previously revalued book amounts.
The valuations carried out in 1996 and 1997 will no longer be updated.
Where depreciation charges were increased following a revaluation, an amount equal to the increase is transferred annually from the revaluation reserve to the profit and loss account as a movement on reserves.
On the disposal or recognition of a provision for impairment of a revalued fixed asset, any related balance remaining in the revaluation reserve is also transferred to the profit and loss account as a movement on reserves.
Fixed asset investments Listed investments are shown at current market valuation.
Upward revaluations are credited to the revaluation reserve.
Downward revaluations in excess of any previous upward revaluation are taken to the Profit and Loss Account.
Other fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provisions for impairment except for investments in associated undertakings.
In the Group Accounts, investments in associated undertakings are accounted for using the equity method.
The Group Accounts include the Groups share of the profit and net assets of associates.
56 ACCOUNTS Johnston Press Annual Report & Accounts 2002 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value as follows: Cost incurred in bringing materials to their present location and condition comprises: a raw materials and goods for resale at purchase cost on a first-in first-out basis: and b work in progress at cost of direct materials, labour and certain overheads.
Net realisable value comprises: selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Leasing Assets held under finance leases and other similar contracts, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to owned assets, are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful lives.
The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the Profit and Loss Account over the period of the leases to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Turnover Turnover represents net invoiced sales to customers excluding value added tax.
Taxation Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current rate.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the financial statements.
Neither is deferred tax recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Finance costs Finance costs of debt are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account over the term of such instruments at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
When a debt facility is re-financed, the finance costs of the old facility are written off to the Profit and Loss Account.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to interest rate movements.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
For an interest rate swap to be treated as a hedge the instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities or a probable commitment, and must change the nature of the interest rate by converting a fixed rate to a variable rate or vice versa.
Interest differentials under these swaps are recognised by adjusting net interest payable over the period of the contract.
XX 57 ACCOUNTS Johnston Press Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Development grants Development grants are credited to the Profit and Loss Account by equal instalments over 10 years.
Pension costs The Group provides pensions to employees through various schemes.
The expected cost of pensions in respect of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes is charged to the Profit and Loss Account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the service lives of employees in the schemes.
Variations from the regular cost are spread over the expected remaining service lives of current employees in the schemes.
The pension cost is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
The Group has elected to adopt the transitional disclosure requirements of FRS17.
The cost of contributions to the Groups money purchase scheme is charged to the Profit and Loss Account when incurred.
As required by SSAP 24, provision has been made for unfunded pension commitments, and payments to pensioners in respect of these commitments are charged to the provision.
Further information regarding the Group pension schemes is provided in notes 20 and 25.

The disclosures relate to the second year of the transitional provisions.
They provide information which will be necessary for full implementation of FRS17 subsequent to the review of the International Accounting Standard IAS19.
The actuarial valuations described above have been updated at 31 December 2002 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of FRS17.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
The major assumptions used for actuarial valuation were: 2002 2001 Rate of increase in salaries 3.2% 3.5% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.2% 2.5% Discount rate 5.5% 6.0% Inflation assumption 2.2% 2.5% The fair value of the assets in the Schemes, the present value of the liabilities in the Schemes and the expected rate of return at the balance sheet date were: Existing Acquired Total 2002 2002 2002 2002 2002 2001 2001 % m % m m % m Equities 7.0 70.0 7.0 43.3 113.3 7.5 90.0 Bonds 4.5 47.0 4.5 9.1 56.1 5.0 45.0 Cash 3.5 2.0 3.5 1.6 3.6 3.5 4.0 Total fair value of assets 119.0 54.0 173.0 139.0 Present value of scheme liabilities 169.0 78.9 247.9 152.0 Net pension deficit 50.0 24.9 74.9 13.0 The contribution rate was increased to 19.3% and will increase annually by 0.6% over the next three years from 15.0% in April 2002 for the existing schemes and to 19.0% from 17.6% in the acquired schemes in October 2002.
This contribution rate in the acquired companies has been set for the next three years and was in addition to the one-off Company contribution in October 2002 of 1.0 million.
