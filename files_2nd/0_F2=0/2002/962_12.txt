Trade collieries refers to operations primarily associated with the production of coal for the world export market, while Power generation collieries refers to operations that primarily produce coal for internal power generation requirements.
Other resources refers to project areas not included in the Trade collieries or Power generation collieries.
The reserve and resource tonnages reflect a gain of 94 million ROM tonnes on an attributable basis due to the purchase of 16.7% of CZN in Colombia and the gain of 102 million ROM tonnes on a 100% basis due to the purchase of 51% of Moura mine in Australia and associated sale of 30% of German Creek mine and 49% of the Theodore, Dawson and Taroom coal resource blocks.
The resource tonnages also reflect a disposal of 360 million MTIS tonnes reportable for various coal resource blocks in South Africa, including the disposal of resources in KwaZulu Natal and in Kriel South.
3 Coal Reserves are quoted on a run of mine ROM reserve tonnage basis, which represent the tonnes delivered to the plant, and on a Saleable reserve tonnage basis, which represent the product tonnes produced.
4 Coal Resources are quoted on a mineable in situ MTIS tonnage basis in addition to the ROM reserves.
5 Yield percentage represents the ratio of Saleable tonnes to ROM tonnes and is quoted on an in situ to in situ basis or on an air dry to air dry basis.
6 The coal quality is quoted as a weighted average of the heat content of all saleable coal products.
The coal quality for the coal resources are reported on an in situ basis.
Coal quality parameters for the coal reserves for trade collieries meet the contractual specifications for coking coal, metallurgical coal, steam coal and domestic coal.
Coal quality parameters for coal reserves for power generation collieries meet the specification of the individual supply contracts.

3 Infill and exploration drilling plus pit re-design at Rosario added reserves resulting in a net reduction in the high grade sulphide Reserve and an increase in low grade sulphide Reserve.
4 Compaia Minera Disputada fide Las Condes Limitada, including Los Bronces and El Soldado mines and Chagres smelter, was acquired on 13 November 2002.
The Reserves for Los Bronces and El Soldado are reported as per the 2002 ExxonMobil mine plans, and the Reserves and Resources classification still follow some of ExxonMobils standards.
Los Bronces Reserves & Resources contain on average 0.014%Mo.
Los Bronces has an additional 73 million tonnes low grade leachable sulphides piled-up and partially under leaching.
5 El Soldado has an additional 4.2 million tonnes of old tailings leaching currently operational and an additional 1.9 million tonnes at 1.6 TCu of slag from Chagres Smelter.
6 ICu insoluble copper total copper less acid soluble copper, ASCu acid soluble copper, TCu total copper.
7 Quellaveco reserves contain on average 0.02% Molybdenum.
8 Black Mountain Mineral Reserves contain 3.1 million tonnes of silver ore at 48 g t. The substantial decrease in mineral reserves in the current mine was due to a revision of the life of mine plan and the transfer of uneconomic reserves to resources.

3 For Collahuasi all resources are contained within a US$1.15 lb Cu pit.
Resource and Reserve classification still follow some of ExxonMobils standards.
5 ICu insoluble copper total copper less acid soluble copper, ASCu acid soluble copper, TCu total copper.
6 Quellaveco resources contain on average 0.02% Molybdenum.
7 Black Mountain Mineral Resources contain 28.4 million tonnes of silver ore at 35 g t. The increase in mineral resources was due to: i a revision of the life of mine plan and the transfer of uneconomic reserves to resources, and ii now including those resources on the same levels as the mine plan which had previously been omitted.
8 The increase in tonnage and grade is due to converting inferred resources to indicated resources through additional exploration drilling.
The level under investigation contains a higher proportion of massive sulphide than the upper levels.

3 The substantial decrease in the 2002 mineral reserve and resource figures is mainly due to a change in cut-off grade methodology applied, and a revision of the geological model reassigning Measured and Indicated Resources to Inferred Resources.

3 Hotazel Manganese Mines report Measured and Indicated mineral resources as inclusive of those mineral resources modified to produce the ore reserve JORC, i. e. the reserves are included in the resource figure.
4 The decrease in the total mineral reserves is due to the transfer of sub-economic mostly underground reserves to mineral resources.
This accounts for the increase in the total mineral resources.
5 The total Mineral Resource tonnage includes 103 million tonnes of low carbon Cr O material.
The processing plant is optimised for high carbon 2 3 Cr O.
Currently it is not envisaged that Zimbabwe Alloys will resume low carbon ferrochrome production.
2 3 FOREST PRODUCTS The Mondi Group in South Africa owns and manages 335,474 2001: 344,110 hectares of sustainable man-made forest.
All of its producing forests have been certified by the Forestry Stewardship Council.
The annual cut is currently 5.5 million tonnes but the future sustainable production will increase as more recently established areas are harvested.
