A R 2002 7 3 03 6:27 pm Page 38 notes to the accounts 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation The consolidated accounts, which are prepared under the historical cost convention, supplemented by the revaluation of certain assets in prior years, and which have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards, comprise the accounts of the parent company and its subsidiary undertakings.
As permitted by FRS 15 - Tangible fixed assets, a policy of revaluation has not been adopted.
The Group has adopted FRS 19 - Deferred Taxation and the comparative statements have been restated accordingly.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts include the accounts of the company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31st December 2002.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Under section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
Goodwill Purchased goodwill arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions since 1st January 1998 has been capitalised and is being amortised over 20 years.
Prior to 1998, goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a business acquired prior to 1998, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging the gross amount of any related goodwill previously taken to reserves.
Turnover Turnover comprises net sales to external customers.
Depreciation Depreciation is calculated on cost or valuation on a straight line basis at rates which write down the value of the assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives.
The principal rates are as follows: Freehold land nil Office furniture and fittings 10% Freehold buildings 1.5% Office equipment 12.5 - 20% Leasehold properties 10% Motor vehicles 20% Plant and machinery 10-12.5% Tooling and patterns 10% Stocks Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost, including overheads where appropriate, and estimated net realisable value.
Cash and liquid resources Cash, for the purpose of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts payable on demand.
Liquid resources are current asset investments which are disposable without curtailing or disrupting the business and are either readily convertible into known amounts of cash at or close to their carrying values or traded in an active market.
Research and development expenditure Research and development expenditure is charged against profits as incurred.
36 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc A R 2002 7 3 03 6:27 pm Page 39 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is recognised without discounting at current rates of tax on short and long term timing differences in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 19 - Deferred Tax which the company has adopted this year.
Foreign currency translation Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at 31st December.
Trading results of overseas subsidiary undertakings have been translated into sterling at average rates of exchange ruling during the year.
Differences arising from the changes in rates of exchange are treated as part of the trading profit where they relate to items of a trading nature.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in overseas subsidiary undertakings, borrowings to hedge those net investments and between the profits for the year translated at average and closing rates, are disclosed as movements on reserves.
Leases Assets held under finance leases are recorded in the balance sheet as fixed assets and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and useful economic lives.
The obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included as appropriate under creditors due within, or creditors due after more than, one year.
The interest element of the rental obligation is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation for each accounting period.
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on an accruals basis.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits Pension schemes are operated by the Company and subsidiary undertakings which employ the majority of Group employees.
Contributions to the schemes are charged to the consolidated profit and loss account such that the cost is spread over the estimated working lives of employees of the Group.
The Group has adopted the transitional requirements of FRS 17 - Retirement Benefits as reported in note 29.
The costs of providing post-retirement benefits other than pensions, principally healthcare, are charged to the profit and loss account on a consistent basis over the average service lives of employees.
Such costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.

The Group operates three defined benefit schemes in the UK and one defined contribution scheme.
Two of the defined benefit schemes were closed to new entrants during 2001.
The defined contribution scheme was established in 2001 to provide pension benefits to new employees.
The cost of the UK defined benefit pension schemes was determined using the projected unit and attained age methods following the advice of a qualified actuary.
The cost of the defined contribution scheme is equal to the contributions paid.
The most recent actuarial valuations in the UK schemes were carried out at either 31st December 2001 or 5th April 2002.
The valuations show that the market value of the assets was 109,700,000 and was sufficient to cover 98 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
This shortfall should be eliminated within the average working lifetime of the employees in the UK.
The most important assumptions used in the valuations for accounting purposes concern the rate of return on investments and the rates of increases in salary and pensions.
It was assumed that investment returns would exceed salary increases by an average of 2.9 per cent per annum and pension increases by an average of 3.9 per cent per annum.
Included in other debtors in the Group balance sheet are prepaid pension costs of 5,942,000 2001: 5,481,000.
In respect of certain overseas schemes the excess of 9,323,000 2001: 8,474,000 of the accumulated pension cost over the amount funded is provided in the accounts note 23.
Part of this provision relates to the unfunded German defined benefit scheme.
The charge for post-retirement benefits other than pensions for the Group in 2002 was 107,000 2001: 51,000 and related to health care.
Provisions for the benefit obligations at 31st December 2002 amounted to 602,000 2001: 610,000 and are included in provisions for post retirement benefits note 23.
The future costs of benefits are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries and are based on assumed discount rates of 6.75%.
FRS 17 disclosures Whilst the Group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension costs, under FRS 17 Retirement benefits the following transitional disclosures are required: The actuarial valuations of the Groups defined benefit schemes were carried out at various dates between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2002.

Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc 51 A R 2002 7 3 03 6:27 pm Page 54 notes to the accounts continued 33 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group does not enter into significant derivative transactions.
The Group's principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, guaranteed senior notes, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group's operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group's policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained fundamentally unchanged since the beginning of 2000.
Interest rate risk The Group borrows in desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest as appropriate to the purposes of the borrowing depending on which gives best value.
At the year-end 19% of the Group's debts were at fixed rates.
Liquidity risk The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, loans and finance leases as appropriate.
Foreign currency risk The Group has operations around the world and therefore its balance sheet can be significantly affected by movements in the rate of exchange between sterling and various other currencies particularly the US dollar and euro.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of this structural currency exposure by borrowing in these currencies where appropriate while maintaining a low cost of debt.
At 31st December 2002 the percentage of debt to net assets, excluding debt, was 63% 2001: 68% for the euro and 48% 2001: 49% for the US dollar.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures principally as a result of trading between Group companies.
Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by an operating unit in currencies other than the unit's functional currency.
Net cash flows between any two currencies of less than 1m per annum would not usually be considered sufficiently material to warrant forward cover.
Forward cover is not taken out more than twelve months in advance or for more than 80% of the forecast exposure.
The disclosures below exclude short-term debtors and creditors.
Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities The interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the Group as at 31st December was as follows: Fixed rate Floating rate Financial financial financial liabilities on 2002 Total liabilities liabilities which no interest is paid 000 000 000 000 Euro 39,481 1,524 36,608 1,349 US dollar 11,870 9,908 1,962 - Other 9,342989,244 - 60,693 11,530 47,814 1,349 2001 000 000 000 000 Euro 41,392 2,345 37,912 1,135 US dollar 13,645 13,645 - - Other 7,030 1,040 5,990 - 62,067 17,030 43,902 1,135 In respect of fixed rate financial liabilities the interest rate for euro financial liabilities is 4.6% fixed for 3.3 years 2001: 4.4 years.
The interest rate for US dollar financial liabilities is 6.7% fixed for 3.1 years 2001: 4.1 years.
The benchmark rates for the floating rate financial liabilities are as follows: Canadian dollar Japanese yen LIBOR } US dollar Euro LIBOR EURIBOR 52 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc A R 2002 7 3 03 6:27 pm Page 55 33 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Interest rate risk profile of financial assets The interest rate profile of the financial assets of the Group as at 31st December was as follows: Financial assets on Floating rate which no financial interest is 2002 Total assets earned 000 000 000 Sterling 16,606 16,500 106 Other 20,072 15,296 4,776 36,678 31,796 4,882 2001 000 000 000 Sterling 4,147 4,083 64 Other 16,312 12,064 4,248 20,459 16,147 4,312 Floating rate financial assets comprise cash placed on money market deposit mainly at call and three month rates.
Currency exposures As explained above, the Group's objectives in managing the currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas in other words, its structural currency exposures are to maintain a low cost of debt while partially hedging against currency depreciation.
All gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are dealt with in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Transactional or non-structural exposures give rise to net currency gains and losses that are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures include the monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the Group balance sheet that are not denominated in the operating or 'functional' currency of the operating unit involved.
At 31st December the currency exposures in respect of the euro was a net monetary asset of 273,000 2001: 105,000 net monetary liability and in respect of the US dollar a net monetary asset of 1,032,000 2001: 882,000.
Foreign exchange contracts There were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at 31st December 2002.
Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities at 31st December was as follows: 2002 2001 000 000 In one year or less, or on demand 19,685 21,983 In more than one year but no more than two 20,757 5,006 In more than two years but no more than five 19,925 35,078 In more than five years 326 - 60,693 62,067 Borrowing Facilities The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31st December in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date were as follows: 2002 2001 000 000 Expiring in one year or less 17,872 9,495 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities A US dollar loan with a book value of 9,908,000 2001: 13,644,000 had a fair value at 31st December of 10,525,000 2001: 14,107,000.
Apart from this loan, fair values of financial assets and liabilities at that date were not considered to be materially different from book values due to their size or the fact that they were at short term rates of interest.
