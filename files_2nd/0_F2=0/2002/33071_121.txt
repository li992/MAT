29 Equity-based compensation plans As at 31 December 2002, the Group had a number of equity-based compensation plans: i All-Employee Option Plans Local All-Employee Option Plans have been set up in 16 countries to enhance employee involvement with Unilever and its performance by providing a potential financial benefit linked to the Unilever share price.
There are no individual performance targets to be met.
The plans permit participation by all permanent employees in the country where the relevant plan applies.
ii Executive Option Plans The Executive Option Plans were introduced in 1985 to reward key employees throughout the world for their contribution to the enhancement of the Groups longer-term future and their commitment to the Group over a sustained period.
The grant is dependent on performance of the Group and the individual.
iii The Share Matching Plans If managers invest part of their annual bonus in Unilever shares, the Company will match this with the same number of shares on the condition that they keep all shares for an agreed number of years and will still be employed by Unilever on the vesting date.
iv The TSR Long-Term Incentive Plan This plan was introduced in 2001 and depending on the TSR ranking see page 40 and 41 of Unilever in comparison with its peer group it will potentially award top executives on the vesting date three years later with a number of Unilever shares.
v The Restricted Share Plan Restricted shares are awarded to a select number of executives for special performance.
After the agreed number of years the awards will vest provided they are still employed by Unilever at that time.
vi The North American Performance Share Plan A long-term incentive plan for North American managers awarding Unilever shares if company and personal performance targets are met over a three-year period.
Unilever will not grant share options in total in respect of Executive Option Plans of more than 5% of its issued ordinary capital, and for all Plans together, of more than 10% of its issued ordinary capital.
The Board does not apportion these limits to each plan separately.
In recent years we have met the obligations under our share option and award plans by purchasing shares in advance and transferring them, in return for the grant price, to directors and employees as the options are exercised.
Unilever Annual Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 104 Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 29 Equity-based compensation plans continued The Group applies accounting policies based on Netherlands law and UK GAAP which are consistent with APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations in accounting for these plans.
Accordingly, the Group has recognised the following compensation costs: 86 million in 2002, 46 million in 2001 and 6 million in 2000.
Had the Group accounted for options under the requirement of SFAS 123, the impact on reported results would have been as follows: million million million 2002 2001 2000 Net profit as reported 2 129 1 838 1 105 Add back actual compensation costs recognised 86 46 6 a Less pro forma compensation cost under SFAS 123 185 106 57 Pro forma net profit under SFAS 123 2 030 1 778 1 054 Euros per 0.51 Euro cents per 1.4p 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 Actual earnings per share 2.14 1.82 1.07 32.05 27.27 16.08 Pro forma earnings per share 2.04 1.76 1.02 30.53 26.36 15.32 Actual diluted earnings per share 2.07 1.77 1.05 31.10 26.54 15.69 Pro forma diluted earnings per share 1.97 1.71 1.00 29.62 25.65 14.94 a Included in this amount is 2 million 2001: nil: 2000: nil relating to the HLL Executive Option Plan in India.

The remaining disclosures required by SFAS 123, including a description of the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair values of options and the weighted-average information, are given below for each type of plan, on a combined basis.
i All-Employee Option Plans Unilever has All-Employee Plans in 16 countries, which can be grouped together as follows: a Plans which follow a standard framework: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
b Other plans: North America, South Africa and United Kingdom.
Group a : The standard framework for these countries means, in principle, an annual grant of options over NV shares, at the same grant date, exercise price the market price on the grant date and grant size including part-time employees pro rata and with the same eligibility criteria all permanent employees in a country.
There are no vesting conditions other than being continuously employed by a Group company until the vesting date.
Group b : The UK and South Africa plans annually offer options over PLC shares, combined with a compulsory UK or optional South Africa savings plan.
The exercise price is the market price at date of grant, except that prior to 2000 the exercise price of the UK plan was set at either 80% or 90% of the market price with the discount being amortised to remuneration cost over the vesting period.
The North American plan is a share purchase offering, with a compulsory savings plan, under which up to 10% of the salary of eligible employees is withheld.
At the end of the period employees can use the savings to buy NV New York shares at a discount of 10%.
This discount is amortised to remuneration cost over the vesting period.
The maximum number of shares made available under the plan is 8.9 million.
Until 2001 the plan had an offering period of two years: the 2002 plan one year.

Employee share option plans: additional information At 31 December 2002, there were options outstanding to purchase 16 693 951 2001: 12 446 685 0.51 ordinary NV shares, and 79 141 530 2001: 56 763 080 1.4p ordinary PLC shares in respect of equity-based compensation plans of NV and its subsidiaries and the North American plans, and 3 846 623 2001: 2 782 756 0.51 ordinary NV shares and 45 785 840 2001: 44 038 928 1.4p ordinary PLC shares in respect of equity-based compensation plans of PLC and its subsidiaries.
To satisfy the options granted, certain NV group companies hold 17 711 169 2001: 13 679 007 certicates or depositary receipts of ordinary shares of NV and 69 162 782 2001: 43 038 640 of PLC and a forward equity contract to buy 10 000 000 PLC shares in 2006, and trusts in Jersey and the United Kingdom hold 43 176 360 2001: 41 531 145 PLC shares.
The book value of the shares held by the trusts, together with their borrowings, is taken up in the entity accounts of PLC, as required by United Kingdom UITF Abstract 13.
The trustees of these trusts have agreed, until further notice, to waive dividends on these shares, save for the nominal sum of 0.01p per 1.4p ordinary share.
Shares acquired during 2002 represent 1.0% of the Groups called-up capital.
The book value of 1 952 million 2001: 1 480 million of all shares held in respect of equity-based compensation plans for both NV and PLC is eliminated on consolidation by deduction from other reserves see note 23 on page 98.
Their market value at 31 December 2002 was 2 058 million 2001: 1 681 million.
At 31 December 2002 the exercise price of 11 163 031 2001: 1 314 187 NV options and of 13 156 190 2001: 11 382 978 PLC options was above the market price of the shares.
Shares held to satisfy options are accounted for in accordance with Netherlands law.
Any difference between the market value of the shares at the grant date and the exercise price of the related options is charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period.
In accordance with Netherlands law, all other differences between the purchase price of the shares held to satisfy options granted and the exercise price of those options, or sale proceeds in the event that options lapse, are charged to other reserves.
Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 17 in the United Kingdom would require differences between the purchase price of the shares held and the exercise price or sale proceeds to be charged to the profit and loss account.
For 2002 this charge would have been 23 million 2001: 13 million.
In addition, a further 8 million would have been recognised as an impairment charge for shares held to meet options expiring in the short term which are priced above market value.
Obligations over the following number of shares were granted, exercised, forfeited or expired between 31 December 2002 and 28 February 2003.
