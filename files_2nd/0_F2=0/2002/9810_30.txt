Notes to the accounts 19 Financial instruments continued The fair values of the interest rate swaps and forward start swaps which have no book value have been determined by reference to prices available from the markets on which the instruments involved are traded.
Trade loans are excluded from the fair value table as they are linked to customer supply terms.
All other fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
Hedges As explained above, the Groups policy is to hedge interest rate risk using interest rate swaps.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are as follows: Unrecognised losses m Losses on hedges at 30 September 2001 15.1 Arising in the period 3.4 Losses on hedges at 28 September 2002 11.7 of which: Expected to be recognised within one year 5.6 Expected to be recognised in greater than one year 6.1 Other instruments Additional disclosure on financial instruments is made in the Financial review on page 20.
Throughout the year the Group adhered to the financial instruments policy given by the Board.
20 Prior year adjustment FRS 19, Deferred Tax Group The effect of the change in the Groups accounting policy to adopt FRS 19 was as follows: m Increase in deferred tax provision at 30 September 2001 16.6 Increase in goodwill intangible assets at 30 September 2001 4.6 Reduction in profit and loss reserve at 30 September 2001 12.0 The Group has assessed the deferred tax position of acquisitions undertaken in previous years.
The previous fair values attributed to deferred tax on acquisitions have been restated for the effect of implementing the Groups new accounting policy for deferred tax in accordance with FRS 19.
The effect of increasing the deferred tax provision at 30 September 2001 for FRS 19 is consequently attributed between goodwill net of subsequent amortisation to the extent it related to prior year acquisitions, and the profit and loss reserve.
The effect of the change in policy on the profit and loss account for the year ended 28 September 2002 was to decrease tax by 0.3m 2001: 0.7m, increase goodwill amortisation by 0.4m 2001: 0.4m, and decrease profits for the financial year by 0.1m 2001: 0.3m increase.
Company The effect on the Company of adopting FRS 19 was to increase the deferred tax provision at 30 September 2001 by 2.3m, with a corresponding reduction to its profit and loss reserve.
There was no effect on the Companys profit and loss account for the year ended 28 September 2002 2001: nil.
