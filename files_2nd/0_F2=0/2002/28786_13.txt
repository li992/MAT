29 PENSION COMMITMENTS J. Rothschild Capital Management Limited has pension commitments in respect of its participation in the RITCP Scheme.
The Scheme has two parts: a defined benefit section which is closed to new members and money purchase arrangements which have been set up for Lord Rothschild.
The last actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section of the RITCP Scheme was carried out as at 1 January 2002 and the report was produced using the projected unit method of funding using the following assumptions: Annual compound rate Investment return 6.50% Rate of increase in salaries 3.50% Rate of increase in payment of all pensions 4.00% Inflation assumption 2.00% This report showed assets valued at 5.188 million and a projected deficit of 1.177 million as at 1 January 2002.
During the year ended 31 March 2002 the Group contributed 34% of pensionable salaries to the defined benefit scheme and also made an additional contribution of 0.2 million.
The funding rate in respect of the money purchase arrangements was 20% of pensionable salary.
No changes have been made to these funding rates to date.
Since the defined benefit scheme is closed to new entrants, the service costs as a percentage of pensionable salary, calculated using the projected unit method, would be expected to increase as the current membership approaches retirement.
The pension contributions made during the year are analysed below: Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2002 2001 000 000 Defined benefit scheme annual contributions 331 334 additional contribution 200 Money purchase scheme 62 60 Personal pension schemes 131 106 724 500 In accordance with the requirements of Financial Reporting Standard 17, Retirement Benefits FRS17, this note discloses the main financial assumptions made in valuing the liabilities of the Scheme and the fair value of assets held.
