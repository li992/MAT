PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The consolidated financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned life insurance and non insurance subsidiary undertakings, have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of section 255A of, and the special provisions relating to insurance groups of Schedule 9A to, the Companies Act 1985.
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards, which have been applied consistently except as noted below, and with the Association of British Insurers Statement of Recommended Practice on Accounting for Insurance Business ABI SORP dated December 1998.
FRS 19 Deferred tax and certain transitional elements of FRS17 Retirement benefits became effective, and were adopted, during the period.
Neither standard has a material impact on the financial statements.
The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Section 226 of, and Schedule 4 to, the Companies Act 1985 adopting the exemption conferred by Section 230 of that Act of omitting the profit and loss account.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities and results of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year.
Associated undertakings are companies other than consolidated subsidiary undertakings in which the Group has 20% or more but less than 50% of the equity share capital for the long term and over which the Group is in a position to exercise a significant influence.
Associated undertakings are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Change in accounting policies The December 2001 financial statements commented that the accounting for insurance groups is in a state of transition.
Accordingly, the Company has changed its accounting policy to exclude the value of internally generated in-force business from its core business and associated undertaking, and the financial statements have been restated.
This restatement is explained more fully in note 2.
PAGE 49 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued Profit recognition relating to the value of long-term business in-force Following the change in accounting policy, profits emerging on long-term assurance business in-force are determined in accordance with the Modified Statutory Solvency Basis of reporting, which is consistent with the ABI SORP.
Under this method, the statutory result arising in the period, which includes the long-term business provision determined in consultation with the Appointed Actuaries following their annual investigations, is required to be adjusted under the Companies Act 1985 Insurance Companies Accounts Regulations 1993 for certain items, including the deferral of acquisition costs and movements in certain reserves, which are recognised in the long-term business technical account.
Premiums Premiums are accounted for when receivable, other than unit-linked premiums, which are credited to revenue when the associated liability is established.
Reinsurance premiums are charged as they become payable.
Investment return Investment return comprises investment income including dividends, interest, realised investment gains and losses, movements in unrealised investment gains and losses and related expenses.
Dividends are included as investment income on the date that shares become quoted ex-dividend.
Interest and expenses are included on an accruals basis.
Realised investment gains and losses are calculated as the difference between net sales proceeds and the purchase price.
Unrealised investment gains and losses represent the difference between the valuation of investments at the balance sheet date and their original cost or, if they have been previously valued, their valuation at the last balance sheet date.
Net rental income is recorded when due.
Claims Claims are charged to revenue when they become due for payment or, in the case of deaths, when notification of death is received.
Recoveries from risk reassurances are included in the same period as the relevant claims.
Acquisition costs Costs of acquiring new insurance contracts principally comprise commission and costs associated with policy issue and underwriting, which are not matched by policy charges.
Such costs are deferred and amortised against margins in the PAGE 50 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued future revenues of the insurance contracts, to the extent that the amounts are recoverable out of the margins.
This deferred acquisition cost is included as an asset within the balance sheet.
Movements in that asset are shown in acquisition expenses.
In all instances the deferred acquisition costs are calculated before tax with an appropriate charge or credit being made for deferred tax.
Investments Investments held to cover linked long-term assurance liabilities are stated at their current value.
Investments comprise listed securities, units in authorised unit trusts and OEICs, deposits and property.
Listed investments are included at mid-market value, units in unit trusts and OEICs are at published bid prices and deposits are included at cost.
Land and buildings occupied by the Group for its own activities, which are depreciated over their useful economic lives, are stated at market value on a vacant possession basis for existing use.
Unlisted investments are included at Directors valuation.
Derivative instrument contracts, which comply with regulatory requirements for use within the internal linked funds, are held at market value.
Other derivatives held by non-life subsidiaries are valued on an amortised cost basis.
All derivates are used solely for hedging purposes.
All realised and unrealised gains and losses on investments held within the long-term business fund are dealt with in the technical account.
Realised and unrealised gains and losses on other investments are included in profit before taxation in the non-technical account.
Investment in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are valued at cost less any provision for impairment in value.
Goodwill Prior to 1998, purchased goodwill was eliminated against reserves as a matter of accounting policy, as all such transactions took place before FRS10 became effective on 23 December 1998.
As permitted under the transitional arrangements of FRS10, such amounts previously written off to reserves have not been reinstated as an asset, but will be charged to the profit and loss account on disposal of the businesses to which they relate.
PAGE 51 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued Long-term business provision and technical provisions The long-term business provision is calculated on actuarial principles.
The calculation is in accordance with statutory reporting for solvency and uses the gross premium method.
The provisions held for linked liabilities are the unit liabilities together with certain non-unit provisions.
Whilst the directors consider that the gross long-term business provision and the related reinsurance recovery is fairly stated on the basis of the information currently available to them, the ultimate liability will vary as a result of subsequent information and events and may result in adjustments to the amount provided.
The provision, estimation technique, and assumptions are periodically reviewed with any changes in estimates reflected in the long-term business technical account as they occur.
Present value of acquired long-term business in-force In accordance with the ABI SORP, the present value of acquired long-term business in-force PVIF is recognised as an additional asset within the consolidated balance sheet.
The value is determined at the date of acquisition is amortised over the anticipated lives of the related contracts in the portfolio.
The rate of amortisation is chosen by considering the profile of the in-force business acquired and the expected reduction in its value over time.
The carrying value of the amortised PVIF asset is also tested for impairment on an annual basis.
The amortisation charge for the year is charged to the long-term business technical account, included within other technical charges.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction or, if hedged forward, at the rate of exchange under the related forward currency contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
PAGE 52 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued Tangible fixed assets The cost of fixed assets is their purchase cost, together with any incidental cost of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets less their estimated residual values, over the expected useful economic lives as follows: % per annum On a straight line basis: Computers 33 Fixtures and fittings 20 Office equipment 20 Motor vehicles 25 Leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
They are regarded as recoverable to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Pensions The SJPC Group operates a defined contribution personal pension plan for its employees.
The contributions payable to the scheme are recognised within the technical account for the accounting period in which they occur.
The Group also has an occupational scheme with both a defined contribution and a defined benefit section, both of which are closed to new members.
Employer contributions on the defined contribution section are recognised within the technical account for the accounting period in which they occur.
No employer contributions are made for the defined benefit section.

IMPACT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY The impact of the restatement to exclude the value of the internally generated in-force business and thus present the Groups primary statements in accordance with the ABI SORP is as follows: Year Ended 31 December 2001 Million Net assets as previously reported 509.6 Value of long-term business in-force previously reported for the SJP Group 287.9 Acquired value of long-term business in-force 56.6 after amortisation Investment in LAHC 31.5 Restated net assets 246.8 The post tax profit for the year ended 31 December 2001 differs from that previously reported, due to the change in accounting policy and LAHC see note 16, as shown below.
Year Ended 31 December 2001 Million Profit on ordinary activities after tax as previously reported 59.2 Movement in internally generated value of long-term business in-force 66.2 Movement in investment in participating interest 2.0 Amortisation of acquired value of long-term business in-force 1.6 As restated 6.6 The audited supplementary information presented on pages 80 to 85 discloses the results of the Groups long-term business on an Achieved Profit basis, a methodology similar to the embedded value basis applied in the prior years financial statements.
This shows that, for the current year, the loss after tax would reduce by 22.5 million to a loss of 21.9 million, and net assets would increase by 268.7 million to 460.7 million if the financial statements had been prepared on a basis consistent with the prior year.

The Directors do not believe the value of the building to have changed significantly since this valuation.
PAGE 63 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 16.
INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATED UNDERTAKINGS The Group holds an investment of 22.7% 2001: 22.6% in the shares of Life Assurance Holding Corporation Limited LAHC.
This investment has been dealt with in the consolidated accounts as an associated undertaking and equity accounted on the basis of management accounts on the modified statutory solvency basis covering the year to 31 December 2002. a Change in accounting policy In accordance with the Groups change in accounting policy outlined in notes 1 and 2, the Groups interest in LAHC has been revised to exclude the internally generated value of long-term business in-force.
The acquired value of long-term business in-force, valued in accordance with ABI guidance, has been amortised over the average duration of the underlying policies.
In addition the profit on the transfer of LAHCs asset management business to Aberdeen Asset Management has been restated to reflect the profit in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
The impact of these adjustments on the carrying value of LAHC at 31 December 2001 is as follows: 31 December 2001 Million Million As previously reported 88.4 Value of long-term business in-force 85.7 Acquired value of long-term business in-force after amortisation 54.2 31.5 Restated 56.9 The impact of these adjustments on the profit after tax for the year is as follows: 31 December 2001 Million Million Previously reported 8.5 Movement in internally generated value of long-term business in-force 21.5 Other recognised gains and losses 19.5 2.0 Restated 6.5 PAGE 64 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 16.
INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATED UNDERTAKINGS CONTINUED b Movement in current year The movement in interest in LAHC for the year to 31 December 2002 is analysed below: Million Value at 1 January 2002 56.9 Share of pre-tax loss for the period 27.7 Share of tax for the period Value at 31 December 2002 29.2 The loss for the year is the result of a number of one-off factors: the fall in value of LAHCs holding in Aberdeen Asset Management: an increase in its provision for pension misselling largely caused by stock market falls : and the reassessment of prior year tax provisions.
c Carrying value of LAHC In 1998 as part of the financing of the acquisition of the GAN group of companies, LAHC entered into a loan arrangement with a consortium of banks, on which regular repayments have been made, financed by dividend and loan repayments from its subsidiaries.
If its subsidiaries were unable to pay a sufficient dividend in order to meet the instalment payable in May 2003, LAHC would need to approach its bankers to reschedule the repayments.
While this creates uncertainty in relation to the carrying value of LAHC, the Directors of SJPC can see no reason why the bankers would not agree to this course of action.
In the light of the above, the Directors of SJPC have reviewed the future cash flows of LAHC and the dividends attributable to SJPC, prepared by the management of LAHC.
The present value of these dividends, using an after-tax rate of 10% per annum, exceeds the carrying value of LAHC included in these financial statements.

OTHER FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS CONTINUED b Debt securities and other fixed income securities The cost of these investments is 43.9 million 2001: 44.7 million, relating to investments listed on a recognised Stock Exchange.
NASCENT GROUP SA SJPC holds the following investment in Nascent Group SA Nascent, a Luxembourg incorporated holding company for an Italian Financial Services business.
Class of share Number % Ordinary shares of 1.25 41,497 19.5 12.5% Series A cumulative preference shares of 1.25 173,483 26.7 12.5% Series B cumulative preference shares of 1.25 66,408 26.7 SJPC also has voting power over 17,758 ordinary shares in an employee trust, giving it voting control of 27.8% of the ordinary shares.
However as another party controls in excess of 50% of the voting capital of Nascent, SJPC considers the level of influence it may exercise over the management of Nascent to be an investment.
In addition SJPC holds 1,066,800 of 3.5% Convertible Loan due from Nascent representing 26.7% of the total loan issued.
Under the terms of a Convertible Loan Agreement with the other shareholders of Nascent, SJPC is committed to subscribe for a further 1,656,600 of 3.5% Convertible Loan during 2003.
This amount represents 26.7% of the un-subscribed Convertible Loan Note.
Due to difficult trading conditions in Italy subsequent to the launch of the Nascent business, it has proved extremely difficult for the Nascent Group to establish itself and the results have fallen significantly short of shareholders expectations.
Accordingly SJPC considers its investment in Nascent is now fully impaired, resulting in an exceptional charge of 19.4 million in the year.
Included as part of this charge is a provision for SJPCs commitment to subscribe for the further 1,656,600 of convertible loan.
Nascent is in the process of disposing of its operations, before winding up the remainder of the group.
As part of this restructuring plan, Nascent has the option to require SJPC to acquire Nascent Life and Nascent Services, at 60% of their net asset value, to manage the run-off of the portfolio of Nascent Lifes clients.
This option expires on 31 March 2003.
If the option is exercised the purchase price is expected to be some 2 million.

ACQUIRED VALUE OF LONG-TERM BUSINESS IN-FORCE Restated Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2002 2001 Million Million Value at start of period 56.6 58.2 Amortisation 2.6 1.6 Value at end of period 54.0 56.6 20.
LONG-TERM BUSINESS TECHNICAL PROVISION The long-term business provision is determined in consultation with the Appointed Actuaries following their annual investigations of the long-term business.
The assumptions underlying the calculation of the UK longterm business provision for statutory solvency purposes have been determined in accordance with industry accepted actuarial techniques and are detailed in the returns to the Financial Services Authority.
These returns are due to be submitted by 31 March 2003 and will then be available to any shareholder on request.
The principal sensitive assumptions used in calculating the provisions for linked and non-linked policies are noted below.
Linked policies The long-term provision consists of sterling reserves designed to cover any future cash flows without recourse to additional capital.
The cash flows are projected assuming: unit growth rates between 4% and 6% per annum 2001: between 4% and 6%, depending on the tax status and territory of the contract: a projection of current expenses assuming inflation of between 3% and 4% per annum 2001: between 4% and 4.5%, depending on the territory of the contract: and mortality and morbidity costs are derived from actual rates charged by reassurers and industry experience.
The resulting cash flows are discounted at a rate of interest between 3.0% and 4.25% 2001: between 4% and 5%, depending on the tax status and territory of the contract to calculate the sterling reserve.
Non-linked policies The long-term provisions are calculated using the gross premium valuation method.
The assumed rate of interest is 3.0% 2001: 3.25% for life business.
Mortality rates are based on recognised mortality tables suitably adjusted to reflect actual experience.
Morbidity rates are derived from the Companys own experience, published data, the rates charged by reassurers and industry experience.

LONG-TERM BUSINESS TECHNICAL PROVISION CONTINUED Critical illness experience As reported in last years financial statements, the Group entered into a financial reassurance arrangement with respect to the uncertainty on its critical illness claims experience.
Under the terms of this financial reassurance arrangement, the reassurer has agreed to maintain the current reassurance rates, provided it can recover experience in excess of those rates from profits on future new business written by the Group.
These arrangements remain in place.
Following discussions with its Appointed Actuaries, the Group has included in its statutory long-term provision prior to reassurance, reserves of 18.3 million 2001: 23.7 million as a result of the financial reassurance, although the net provision after reassurance remains unchanged.
This financial reassurance has been accounted for in accordance with FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions and accordingly a liability of 18.3 million 2001: 23.7 million has been established.
The cash balance outstanding under the arrangement at 31 December 2002 was, however, nil 2001: nil.
Regulatory reviews During the year the Group has completed the various required regulatory reviews and therefore there are no provisions outstanding at 31 December 2002 2001: 6.7 million.

SHARE CAPITAL CONTINUED In addition, the authorised share capital includes one Special Rights Redeemable Preference Share of 1, which was until 20 December 2002 issued to the J. Rothschild Name Company Limited, an entity formed to protect the use of the name J. Rothschild.
Following a request from the holder of the special share, the Company redeemed the Special Share at par value being 1 out of distributable profits on 20 December 2002.
It is proposed that the authorised Special Share is cancelled by way of a special resolution at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Share Options On the acquisition of the remaining share capital of St. Jamess Place Wealth Management Group plc formerly J. Rothschild Assurance Holdings plc JRAH in 1997, SJPC agreed to issue further shares, up to a maximum of 25.8 million, to satisfy the exercise of options held over JRAH shares at the time of acquisition.
A reserve for shares to be issued was established in recognition of the commitment and 1.7 million shares have still to be issued from this reserve.
During the year options over 3 million shares have been granted at a range of prices between 1.04 and 2.95.
In addition, during July 2002 options over some 25 million SJPC shares, previously issued to members of the St. Jamess Place Partnership and a small number of employees at prices ranging from 2.375 to 4.075 were surrendered and new options over the same number of shares were issued to the relevant individuals at 1.45.
Options outstanding under the various share option schemes at 31 December 2002 amount to 55.5 million shares 31 December 2001: 57.0 million.
Of these, 43.5 million are under option to Partners of the St. Jamess Place Partnership, 9.3 million are under option to executives and senior management and 2.7 million are under option through the SAYE scheme.
These are exercisable on a range of future dates.
The following table sets out the anticipated proceeds if all option holders exercised their shares at the first available opportunity.
RESERVES Group Share Shares to Profit and Premium be Issued Other Loss Account Reserve Reserves Account Million Million Million Million At 1 January 2002 3.4 0.5 228.2 213.2 Prior year adjustment 226.0 36.8 3.4 0.5 2.2 176.4 Release of reserve on issue 0.1 of shares Exercise of options 1.2 Retained loss for the year 56.2 At 31 December 2002 4.6 0.4 2.2 120.2 The shares to be issued reserve was established on the acquisition of St. Jamess Place Wealth Management Group plc SJPWM to account for the share options in that company that were unexercised at the acquisition date as detailed in note 23.
The movement in the reserve during the year occurred on the exercise of these options.
As explained in note 2, the Group changed its accounting policies during the year to exclude the present value of internally generated in-force business.
This resulted in the elimination of 203.5 million previously included in Other Reserves as a non-distributable reserve, which represented the increase in the internally generated PVIF recognised in the financial statements each year.
Also included in Other Reserves was an acquisition reserve of 22.5 million arising from the acquisition of SJPWM.
The acquisition fell within Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 and therefore no share premium account was required to be established.
The acquisition reserve arose on consolidation and represented the excess of the SJPC share price on the date SJPWM was acquired, over the nominal value of those shares issued.
The goodwill of 150.4 million that arose on 26 June 1997, following SJPCs acquisition of the then remaining share capital of St. Jamess Place Holdings plc, was written off against this reserve.
Following the change in accounting policy, the 22.5 million balance remaining on this reserve has been transferred to the Profit and Loss account in equal proportion to the amortisation charge arising on the acquired VIF arising on this change in policy.
PAGE 72 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 24.
RESERVES CONTINUED The impact of the prior year adjustment on the Profit and Loss account of 36.8 million relates to the fide-recognition of internally generated PVIF relating to LAHC, and the amortisation of the acquired PVIF of SJPC and LAHC, after taking into account the 22.5 million reserve transfer discussed above.

The distributable reserves of the Company were 67.1 million 2001: 50.2 million.

As a result of this transaction, a number of share options lost their approved tax status and SJPC has agreed to compensate share option holders to ensure the effect on individuals is neutral.
The value of this provision is dependent, amongst other things, on the current SJPC share price and accordingly the provision has been adjusted at 31 December 2002 to reflect the movement of the share price during the year.
The year end deferred tax position is analysed as follows: 31 December 31 December 2002 2001 Million Million Deferred acquisition costs 15.9 15.2 27.
