Acquisitions and Disposals a Equitable Life Assurance Society The Equitable On 1 March 2001, the Halifax Group acquired the operating assets, sales force and unit-linked and non-profit business of The Equitable for 508 million including costs of acquisition of 8 million.
Net assets with a preliminary fair value of 341 million were acquired, creating a balance of goodwill on the acquisition of 167 million.
The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted and the results of the acquired operations have been consolidated in full from that date.
On 11 January 2002, The Equitables guaranteed annuity rate and non-guaranteed annuity rate policyholders voted in favour of a scheme of arrangement to compromise their respective claims against the with-profits fund.
Following Court approval the scheme became effective on 8 February 2002.
As a result of this, in accordance with the terms of the acquisition, Halifax plc a subsidiary of HBOS plc agreed to waive unconditionally the repayment of 250 million of loans advanced by it to The Equitable under a fully collateralised loan facility of 251 million, which was granted in 2001.
The amount waived has been treated as additional goodwill.
As a result of the compromise scheme having become effective prior to 1 March 2002, in accordance with the terms of the acquisition, the HBOS Group is obliged to pay up to a further 250 million depending on the extent to which certain new business sales and profitability targets are achieved in 2003 and 2004 by the distribution channel acquired from The Equitable.
No provision has been made at 31 December 2002 for this contingent consideration because it is not currently expected that any payment will be made.
In accordance with FRS 7, Fair Values in Acquisition Accounting, preliminary fair value adjustments were made and were disclosed in the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2001.
The principal adjustment required reflects the fact that, as a mutual life assurance society, The Equitable did not prepare accounts on an embedded value basis.
A preliminary fair value adjustment for 277 million was therefore made, being an estimate of the value of acquired in-force business.
Following a review of the preliminary fair value adjustments, the value of acquired in-force business has been adjusted from 277 million to 265 million.
This revised value is reflected in the table below.
As a result of this, the preliminary fair value of net assets acquired has been reduced by 12 million to 329 million and the balance of goodwill on acquisition has increased to 429 million.
The other accounting policy and revaluation adjustments are not individually material.
The following table summarises the effects of this acquisition:- Accounting Total Fair Acquired Revaluation policy fair value value to book value adjustments adjustments adjustments the Group million million million million million Long-term assurance business attributable to shareholders 265 265 265 Long-term assurance assets attributable to policyholders 4,106 4,106 Other assets 149 10 10 159 Total assets 4,255 275 275 4,530 Long-term assurance liabilities attributable to policyholders 4,106 4,106 Other liabilities 84 12 1 11 95 Total liabilities 4,190 12 1 11 4,201 Net assets 65 12 276 264 329 Goodwill 429 Consideration 758 Satisfied by:- Cash 500 Waiver of loan 250 Acquisition costs 8 758 The goodwill arising on acquisition, prior to the waiver of the loans referred to above, is being amortised over a period of 20 years to reflect the strategic rationale of the acquisition and the period over which the economic benefits associated with the goodwill are expected to arise.
The additional goodwill arising in 2002 is being amortised over a period equivalent to the balance of the period of 20 years over which the original goodwill is being amortised.

Acquisitions and Disposals continued b On 16 February 2001, Bank of Scotland acquired 99.99% of the share capital of ICC Bank plc, which is based in Ireland.
The remaining equity was acquired during that year.
The consideration of 227 million inclusive of fees and expenses was satisfied partly in cash raised from the proceeds of a placing of Bank of Scotland stock and partly by stock issued.
Net assets with a preliminary fair value of 163 million were acquired, creating a balance of goodwill on the acquisition of 64 million.
In accordance with FRS 7, preliminary fair value adjustments were made and disclosed in the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2001.
The principal fair value adjustment reflects the revaluation of debt securities and equity shares to market value.
A preliminary fair value adjustment for 33 million was therefore made.
Following a review of the preliminary fair value adjustment, the value of net assets acquired has been adjusted from 163 million to 153 million.
As a result of this, the balance of goodwill on acquisition has increased to 74 million.
