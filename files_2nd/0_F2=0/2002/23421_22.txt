52 Electra Investment Trust PLC Accounts Notes to the Accounts 15 Financial Instruments i Management of Risk As an investment trust, the Groups investment objective is to seek capital growth from a portfolio of securities drawn from markets both within the UK and worldwide.
The holding of these financial instruments to meet this objective results in certain risks.
The Groups financial instruments comprise: 1.
Securities in unquoted and quoted companies, and partnership interests which are held in accordance with the Groups investment objective set out in the Investment Managers Review on pages 12 to 27.
A loan facility, the purpose of which is to finance tender offers, other share buy-backs and on-market purchases of shares, the financing of new investment and refinancing existing debt.
Investments are held with a view to identifying suitable opportunities for realisation.
Trading in quoted securities has occurred during the year through a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are fluctuations in market price, interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summarised below.
These policies have remained constant throughout the year under review and the preceding year.
Market Risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Groups operations.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements, mitigated by stock selection.
The Group does not use derivatives.
The Board meets on a number of occasions during each year to consider the realisation programme of the investment portfolio in order to minimise the risk associated with particular sectors.
Electra Partners has responsibility for monitoring the realisation programme of the portfolio in accordance with the Groups investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations through retained profits including both realised and unrealised capital profits.
In addition, financing is obtained through loan facilities.
During the year, long-term foreign currency loan facilities were in existence.
The initial drawdown under the loan facilities was in US Dollars and Euros.
The loans have a floating rate of interest.
The cash balances held on deposit mitigate in part the interest rate risk.
The resultant proceeds will be held as cash or short-term securities and used towards the repayment of the facility.
Interest rate risk profiles for financial assets and liabilities are shown in part iii of the Note.
These profiles exclude short term debtors and creditors.
Liquidity Risk The Groups assets comprise listed and unlisted equity and non-equity shares and fixed income securities.
There have been significant disposals in the period of both listed and unlisted investments, which have been used to repay loan facilities and in the prior year to return capital to shareholders.
As a result the Groups liquidity has increased marginally during the year.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the revolving loan facility.
The maturity of the Groups existing borrowings are set out in part iv of the Note.
Foreign Currency Risk The Groups total return and net assets are affected by currency translation movements as a significant proportion of the investments held in the year are denominated in currencies other than sterling.
Revenue received in currencies other than sterling is converted into sterling at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at the year-end rate.
The treatment of foreign currency transactions has been described in greater detail in the accounting policies note on page 47.
The foreign investments held are principally in the USA, Continental Europe, Latin America and the Far East.
During the year, the Group held loans denominated in US Dollars and Euros, which partially offset exchange risks suffered on foreign fixed asset investments.
Foreign currency exposures are analysed in part ii of the Note.
Electra Investment Trust PLC 53 Accounts Notes to the Accounts 15 Financial Instruments continued ii Foreign Currency Exposures A portion of the financial assets and financial liabilities of the Group are denominated in currencies other than sterling, which will have an impact on the net assets and return of the Group as at 30 September 2002.

Under these schemes the participants invest in every new investment made by the Company.
In return the participants receive a percentage of the total capital and revenue profits made on each investment.
The participants do not receive any profits until the Company has received back its initial investment.
During the year ended 30 September 2002 the participants received 5,216,000 2001: 6,712,000 under these schemes and had unrealised gains of 18,382,000 2001: 17,595,000.
In addition the participants are entitled to a percentage of the incremental value of unlisted investments held at 31 March 1995, subject to the Company having received in total proceeds equal to the valuation of those investments as at 31 March 1995 and a preferred return.
During the year ended 30 September 2002 the participants received nil 2001: nil under the scheme and had unrealised gains of 799,000 2001: 769,000.
Under the arrangements relating to the management of the listed portfolio, certain executives of the Electra Partners Group will receive bonuses over a one year period if the listed portfolio outperforms a composite index.
At 30 September 2002 the unrealised gain under these arrangements was 1,861,000 2001: 1,861,000.
No Directors of Electra participate in the above schemes.
Under terms agreed by shareholders in June 2001 the participants waived their rights under the long term incentive scheme and the 16,000,000 previously provided was written back through unrealised reserves.
Electra also waived its right to an outstanding loan note repayment of 4.5 million due from the Electra Partners Group.
Electra also assigned its interests in profit share entitlements of Electra Partners valued at 7 million and was issued with a loan note by Electra Partners for 7 million.
22 Provision for Liabilities and Charges Electra and the Company has historically deducted amounts due under incentive schemes from investments.
These amounts have now been re-classified under Provision for liabilities and charges.
This treatment is considered to be more appropriate in view of the substance of these schemes.
There is no effect on the net assets of the Company or of the Group from this re-classification.
The prior year figures have been restated accordingly.
