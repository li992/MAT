45 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2002 1.
Accounting Policies Accounting Convention The accounts are prepared in accordance with the historical cost accounting convention, modified to include the revaluation of certain assets, and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
Financial Reporting Standard FRS 19 Accounting for Deferred Tax has been adopted with effect from 1 January 2002.
Under FRS 19, the Group is required to make full provision for deferred tax in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
The Groups previous accounting policy in respect of deferred tax was to recognise deferred tax only to the extent that a liability or asset was likely to be payable or recoverable, in accordance with SSAP 15.
The adoption of FRS 19 has resulted in a net deferred tax asset of 5,276,000 at 31 December 2002.
Prior periods have been restated, increasing the net deferred tax asset by 7,424,000 and decreasing goodwill by 4,109,000, producing an increase in net assets of 3,315,000 at 31 December 2001.
There was no material impact on the tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2001 or 2002.
Basis of Consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all subsidiaries for the financial period ended 31 December 2002.
The results of all subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passed and acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method.
The profit or loss on the disposal of a previously acquired business includes the attributable amount of any purchased goodwill relating to that business.
Turnover Turnover represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
An appropriate proportion of total long-term contract value is included in turnover and a prudent level of profit is taken based on estimated percentage completion if the final outcome can be reliably assessed.
Goodwill On the acquisition of a business fair values are attributed to the Groups share of separable net assets.
Where the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair values of the net assets acquired, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill.
After 1 January 1998 goodwill has been capitalised and is being amortised over its estimated useful economic life with a maximum of 20 years.
In accordance with the Groups accounting policy prior to FRS 10, goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998 has been written off to reserves.
Such goodwill will be charged to the profit and loss account on any subsequent disposals of the businesses to which it relates.
Licences, Patents and Trademarks Licences, patents and trademarks are included at cost and amortised in equal instalments over the period of the agreements, which is their estimated useful economic life.
Provision is made for any impairment.
Tangible Fixed Assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
On other assets it is provided on cost or revalued amounts in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: Freehold buildings 40 to 50 years Long and short leasehold property over period of lease Plant and machinery 5 to 10 years Fixtures and fittings 3 to 10 years Motor vehicles 4 to 5 years Investments i Shares in Group companies are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value except for investments acquired before 1 January 1988 where Section 131 merger relief has been taken when investments are stated at the nominal value of the shares issued in consideration.
ii Other investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost represents materials, direct labour and production overheads.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Long-term contracts are dealt with in accordance with SSAP 9 revised.
Provision is made for the full amount of foreseeable losses on contracts.
Deferred Taxation Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred taxation is not provided on timing differences arising from the sale or revaluation of fixed assets unless, at the balance sheet date, a binding commitment to sell the asset has been entered into and it is unlikely that any gain will qualify for rollover relief.
Foreign Currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, at the forward contract rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
The results of overseas operations are translated at average rates of exchange for the year.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the opening net assets and results of overseas operations and on foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they hedge the Groups investment in such operations, are reported in the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Other exchange differences are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
Meggitt PLC Report and Accounts 2002 46 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2002 Research and Development All research and development expenditure is written off as incurred.
Pension Scheme Arrangements The Group operates a number of contributory pension schemes and accounts for pension costs in accordance with the requirements of SSAP 24.
For defined contribution schemes the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and other post retirement benefits is the contribution payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
For defined benefit schemes, defined benefit pension costs and the costs of providing other post retirement benefits are charged to the profit and loss account on a systematic basis over the service lives of the eligible employees in accordance with the advice of qualified independent actuaries.
Leases Assets held under finance leases and the related lease obligations are recorded in the balance sheet at the fair value of the leased assets at the inception of the leases.
The excess of the lease payments over the recorded lease obligations are treated as finance charges which are amortised over each lease term to give a constant rate of charge on the remaining balance of the obligation.
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Provision for Liabilities and Charges In accordance with FRS 12 provision is made for onerous property leases, environmental and litigation liabilities and for product warranty claims.
Provisions are discounted where appropriate to reflect the time value of money.
Financial Instruments The Group uses financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk.
To the extent that such instruments are matched against an underlying asset or liability, they are accounted for using hedge accounting.
Gains or losses on interest rate instruments are matched against the corresponding interest charge or interest receivable in the profit and loss account over the life of the instrument.
For foreign currency instruments, gains or losses and premiums or discounts are matched to the underlying transactions being hedged.
The 2001 segmental analysis is restated to include as discontinued, the results of the businesses discontinued in 2002.

Net Loss Profit on Disposal of Discontinued Operations a An exceptional loss of 12,936,000 arose in 2002 relating to the disposal of Wayfarer Transit Systems Limited and Systech Solutions Limited on 13 November 2002.
The loss arose after charging 18,979,000 of goodwill which had previously been written off directly to reserves.
Before writing off goodwill the profit on this disposal was 6,043,000. b Other business asset and investment sales during 2002 gave rise to a net loss after making appropriate sale provisions of 31,000. c An exceptional profit of 2,728,000 arose in 2001 relating to the disposal of Meggitt Electronic Components Limited.
No tax credit is available in respect of the exceptional loss in 2002 nor on the exceptional profit in 2001.

Owing to the availability of tax losses and foreign tax credits, it is currently estimated that no additional tax would arise if any such amounts were to be distributed.
Factors that may affect future tax charges relate to deferred tax see note 22.

Financial Instruments A discussion of the Groups objectives, policies and strategies with regard to financial risk and the use of financial instruments can be found in the Financial Review.
Short term debtors and creditors arising directly from the Groups operations are excluded from the following disclosures other than the currency analysis of net assets.
i Interest Rate and Currency Profile of Financial Liabilities After taking account of the financial derivatives that alter the interest and currency basis of the financial liabilities entered into by the Group, the interest rate exposure on gross borrowings was: Fixed rate borrowings Weighted Non interest Weighted average time Floating Fixed bearing Total average for which 2002 2002 2002 2002 interest rate rate is fixed 000 000 000 000 % Years US dollars 65,456 93,616 159,072 6.46.8 1.3 Swiss francs 32,011 32,011 Euro 67 1,437 1,504 2.5 0.5 97,467 93,683 1,437 192,587 Fixed rate borrowings Weighted Non interest Weighted average time Floating Fixed bearing Total average for which 2001 2001 2001 2001 interest rate rate is fixed 000 000 000 000 % Years US dollars 85,815 131,090 216,905 6.46.8 1.9 Swiss francs 37,291 37,291 Euro 210 506 716 2.5 1.0 123,106 131,300 506 254,912 The Group has taken out an interest rate collar to hedge against the exposure to movements in US interest rates and this accounts for the weighted average interest rate range quoted.
The actual outcome will depend on the level of US$ LIBOR during the life of the instrument.
Meggitt PLC Report and Accounts 2002 53 ii Interest Rate and Currency Profile of Financial Assets The interest rate and currency profile of the Groups financial assets after taking account of the financial derivatives was: Non interest Non interest Floating bearing Total Floating bearing Total 2002 2002 2002 2001 2001 2001 000 000 000 000 000 000 Sterling 29,414 1,085 30,499 76,320 1,094 77,414 US dollars 13,740 513 14,253 22,867 27 22,894 Swiss francs 717 6 723 254 11 265 Euro 7,778 8 7,786 5,455 6 5,461 Other 723 723 508 508 52,372 1,612 53,984 105,404 1,138 106,542 Interest payments on the floating rate assets and liabilities are determined by reference to short term benchmark rates applicable in the relevant currency or market, such as LIBOR, the US Prime Rate and the UK Bank Base Rate.
A number of currency swaps have been executed to best utilise surplus cash whilst maintaining asset hedging.
This accounts for the higher sterling assets and corresponding higher US dollar and Swiss Franc liabilities shown in this note compared to those recorded in the Balance Sheet.
v Fair Values A comparison of current and book values of all the Groups financial instruments is provided below.
Where market prices are not available for a particular instrument, fair values have been calculated by discounting future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.

vii Market Price Risk and Credit Risk The Group uses derivative instruments only for hedging purposes and generally holds its interest bearing assets and liabilities to maturity and therefore does not consider itself subject to price risk.
The Group is subject to credit risk on the counterparties to its financial instruments, which it controls through dealing only with highly rated counterparties and netting transactions on settlement where possible.
Meggitt PLC Report and Accounts 2002 54 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2002 viii Hedges The Groups policy is to use derivative instruments to hedge against exposure to movements in interest rates and exchange rates.
Changes in the fair value of instruments used for hedging are not recognised in the financial statements until the hedged exposure is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging purposes are set out below: Total net Gains Losses gains losses 000 000 000 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 January 2002 1,220 7,415 6,195 Less: gains and losses arising in previous years that were recognised in the year 976 5,172 4,196 Gains and losses arising before 1 January 2002 that were not recognised at 31 December 2002 244 2,243 1,999 Gains and losses arising in the year that were not recognised at 31 December 2002 3,832 4,193 361 4,076 6,436 2,360 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 31 December 2002 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2003 3,824 4,360 536 Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2004 or later 252 2,076 1,824 Environmental Empty property Warranty Company & litigation costs costsDeferred tax Grouptotal a b c d see note 22 total see note 22 21.

Provision has been made for the gross estimated liability and an asset of 17,996,000 2001: 9,597,000 has been recognised as a debtor for the amounts recoverable from the insurers.
At acquisition, Whittaker was also subject to certain litigation claims, both existing and threatened, relating to businesses it had sold but for which it retained a liability.
A provision exists representing the best estimate of the outcome of the claims including costs.
The provisions are expected to be utilised over the next ten years.
b In relation to certain litigation claims a balance has been reclassified between other creditors and provisions during the year.
c Provision has been set up for the estimated rental shortfall in respect of empty properties and will be utilised over the lease terms.
d Provision has been made for product warranty claims.
These provisions are expected to be utilised over the next three years.

The Group has unprovided deferred tax assets of 16,036,000 2001: restated 16,776,000.
The majority of these timing differences relate to the groups operations in the USA.
Deferred taxation assets have not been recognised in respect of these items, as it is not regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred taxation assets not recognised would be recoverable in the event that they reverse and suitable taxable profits are available.
Shares under option marked have been purchased in the market from previously issued share capital and are held by the trustee of the ESOP as shown in note on page 50.

Contingent Liabilities The parent Company has given guarantees in respect of uncommitted credit facilities for certain of its subsidiaries, some property leases, other leasing arrangements and the performance by some current and former subsidiaries of certain contracts.
Also, there are similar guarantees given by certain of the management companies.
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
The directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
Pensions a Group Schemes In the UK, most employees are members either of the Meggitt Group 1990 Pension Plan 1990 Plan or the Meggitt Executive Pension Plan MEPP.
These are defined benefit plans, the assets of which are held in trust funds separate from the Groups finances.
The latest actuarial valuation of the 1990 Plan carried out as at 1 July 2001 showed that the Plan was 108% funded on estimated final salaries using a 3% per annum gap between salaries and yields.
The assets were valued at 134.2 million.
The valuation of the MEPP was carried out as at 6 April 2001 and was 109% funded using a 2.5% per annum gap between salaries and yields.
These assets were valued at 32.0 million.
These valuations do not take into account any impact of the fall in general stock market values since these dates.
Any such impact will be reflected in the next respective SSAP 24 triennial valuations based upon which subsequent pension costs will be determined.
The pension costs relating to the Plans are assessed in accordance with the advice of Mercer Human Resource Consulting, consulting actuaries.
They used the projected unit method for the 1990 Plan and the attained age method for the Executive Plan.
The figures currently used for accounting purposes as regards pension costs are likely to change significantly as and when FRS 17 is adopted.
The pension charge in the UK for the year was 3.5 million 2001: 1.9 million.
An amount of 4.0 million 2001: 4.3 million is included in other debtors, being the excess of the amount funded over the amount charged to the profit and loss account.
This is being amortised over the average remaining service lifetime of employees.
In the USA most employees are covered by defined contribution 401k plans.
In 1994, prior to acquisition by the Group, Whittaker Corporation amended its 401k plans and also froze benefits to the Whittaker Corporation Employees Pension Plan Whittaker Frozen Plan, a defined benefit scheme.
This frozen plan is reviewed annually for FASB87 purposes by Aon Consulting and at 31 December 2002 the assets were valued at $110.3 million with a projected benefit obligation of $134.0 million.
In other overseas countries the Group provides pensions in accordance with statutory requirements and local customs and practice.
In 2002 the actual cost to the Group for overseas pensions was 6.2 million 2001: 7.0 million.
b FRS 17 Retirement Benefits In November 2000 the Accounting Standards Board ASB issued FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, replacing SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
In November 2002 an amendment to FRS 17 was published which allowed an extension to the transitional arrangements of FRS 17.
The probability of implementation is uncertain and partly dependent upon proposals from the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
The Group will take advice to ensure that it continues to adopt best practice in respect of accounting for retirement benefits.
The Group is in the second year of the transitional arrangements under FRS 17 and the required disclosures are made below.
Assumptions, asset, liability and reserves disclosures The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuations at April 2001 for MEPP, July 2001 for the 1990 Plan and December 2001 for the Whittaker Frozen Plan and Whittaker Unfunded Plan and updated by the actuaries to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2002.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2002.
Employer cash contributions for the year were: MEPP 0.7 million 2001: 0.8 million, 1990 Plan 1.6 million 2001: 1.1 million, Whittaker Frozen Plan 3.8 million 2001: 1.4 million and Whittaker Unfunded Plan 0.5 million 2001: 0.6 million.
