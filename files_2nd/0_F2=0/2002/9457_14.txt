com Financial statements 53 Notes to the financial statements 1 Statement of accounting policies The following are the principal accounting policies of the group which have been applied consistently throughout the period and preceding year.
The adoption of Financial Reporting Standard FRS 19 Deferred tax did not necessitate any restatement of results in either period.
Basis of accounting The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable UK accounting standards.
Merger accounting These financial statements have been prepared under the merger accounting principles, as set out in FRS 6 Acquisitions and mergers, in relation to the merger of Logica plc and CMG plc companies incorporated in Great Britain.
Under merging accounting, the results and cash flows of Logica plc and CMG plc have been combined from the beginning of the financial period in which the merger occurred.
The profit and loss account, balance sheet and cash flow comparative figures have been restated on the combined basis.
As a result of the merger, comparatives for geographic segments have been restated to reflect the geographical areas of the combined business.
Basis of consolidation The group financial statements include those of the company and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December 2002.
The group's share of the results of subsidiary undertakings is included for the period during which they are a member of the group.
In the group financial statements, investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method.
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the group's share of associates' profits less losses, while the group's share of the net assets of the associates is shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
The investment in the joint venture has been accounted for using the equity method as the separate assets and liabilities are not material to the group.
Goodwill Purchased goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses representing any excess of fair value of consideration over the fair value of net assets is capitalised and amortised over its estimated useful economic life and included as intangible assets on the balance sheet.
The useful economic lives do not exceed 20 years and are the periods over which the directors estimate that the value of the underlying businesses are expected to exceed the value of the underlying assets in accordance with FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets.
Goodwill arising prior to 1 January 1998 remains written off to the profit and loss account reserve as permitted by FRS 10.
Provision is made for impairment.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost.
Depreciation is provided at rates to write the cost of the fixed assets down to their residual value evenly over their expected useful lives on a straight line basis at the following rates: Furniture 10%-20% Computer rooms 20% Partitions and office equipment 10%-20% Computers 25%-33% Freehold property 2% Motor vehicles 25% Leasehold property Over life of lease Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Stock Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Leases Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the group, and hire purchase contracts, are capitalised in the balance sheet at their present value of minimum lease payments payable during the lease term and are depreciated over their useful lives.
The capital elements of future obligations under the leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged in the profit and loss account over the period of the leases and hire purchase contracts and represent a constant proportion of the balance of the capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Taxation Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current rate.
Assets are recognised and provision is made for deferred taxation to take account of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for accounts purposes and their treatment for tax purposes.
Assets are recognised and full provision has been made in the accounts for deferred taxation arising from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements when the recoverability is regarded as more likely than not, except for certain exemptions set out in FRS 19 Deferred tax.
54 Financial statements LogicaCMG report and accounts 2002 Notes to the financial statements 1 Statement of accounting policies continued Foreign currency Foreign currency assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates prevailing at that date or, if hedged, at the forward contract rate.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are accounted for at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, at the rate of exchange under the related forward exchange contract.
The exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account for the period.
Trading results of foreign subsidiaries are included in the group's results using average exchange rates.
Gains and losses arising from the re-translation of the opening net investment in foreign subsidiaries and the results of foreign subsidiaries at the year-end rate are taken directly to reserves.
All other foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in the profit and loss account.
The most important exchange rate for the group is the euro.
The relevant exchange rates for translation were: 6 months ended 31 December 2002 12 months ended 30 June 2002 Average Closing Average Closing 1 1.57 1.53 1.61 1.54 The primary reporting currency of the group is UK pounds sterling.
Interest rate transactions Interest rate swap receipts and payments are accrued so as to match the net income or cost with the related finance expense.
No amounts are recognised in respect of future periods.
Hedge accounting The group uses forward contracts and currency options to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risks.
The group considers these financial instruments to be 'hedges' that is, an offset of foreign exchange and interest risks when the following criteria are met: the financial instruments must be related to a foreign currency asset or liability that is probable and whose characteristics have been identified it must involve the same currency as the hedged item and it must reduce foreign currency risk on the group's operations Gains and losses on hedges of existing assets or liabilities are included in the carrying amount of those assets or liabilities and are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Gains and losses on qualifying hedges of firm commitments or anticipated transactions are classified as deferred and recognised in the profit and loss account or as adjustments in the carrying amount of the transaction when it occurs.
Forward contracts used to hedge the currency mix of the group have their contracted rates valued against the balance sheet rates with net unrealised gains or losses being shown as part of the debt they are hedging.
The difference between spot and forward rate for these contracts is recognised as net interest payable over the period of the contract.
The groups policy for financial instruments is given in note 24.
Gains or losses on financial instruments that do not qualify as hedges are recognised as other income or expenses.
Research and development Research and development costs are written-off in the period in which they are incurred unless they are to be reimbursed by third parties.
Turnover Turnover represents the value of work done for clients including attributable profit and after adjusting for all foreseeable future losses but excluding local sales taxes.
Revenue in respect of software product licences with no significant service revenue is recognised 100% on delivery.
For other software product licences, revenue is recognised on a percentage of completion basis.
Recognition of profits Profit on contracts for the supply of professional services at pre-determined rates is taken as and when the work is performed, irrespective of the duration of the contract.
Profit is taken on fixed price contracts while the contract is in progress, having regard to the proportion of the total contract which has been completed at the balance sheet date and estimated costs by reference to the costs incurred to date versus total estimated costs to completion.
Provision is made for all foreseeable future losses.
Amounts recoverable on contracts Amounts recoverable on contracts represent turnover which has not yet been invoiced to clients on fixed price contracts.
Such amounts are separately disclosed within debtors.
The valuation of amounts recoverable on fixed price contracts is adjusted to take up profit to date or foreseeable losses in accordance with the accounting policy for recognition of profits.
com Financial statements 55 Notes to the financial statements 1 Statement of accounting policies continued Other amounts recoverable on contracts are valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realisable value.
Cost comprises: professional amounts recoverable valued at the cost of salaries and associated payroll expenses of employees engaged on assignments and a proportion of attributable overheads and unbilled expenses incurred and equipment purchased for clients in connection with specific contracts.
Post-retirement benefits The costs of the group's defined benefit pension arrangements are charged against profits in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs on a systematic basis allowing for the expected pension costs spread over the remaining service lives of the scheme members, as calculated by the actuaries of the group.
The cost of the group's defined contribution arrangements are charged against profits on the basis of the contributions paid by the group.
The cost of providing non-pension post-employment benefits, other than pensions, is charged to the profit and loss account to spread the regular cost over the service lives of employees.
The group has continued to disclose the amounts relating to the group's defined benefit pension schemes as required under the transitional provisions of FRS 17 Retirement benefits.
Employee share ownership trusts The net result of the employee trusts, including profits or losses on sales of shares and tax thereon, is included in the financial statements.
Shares owned by the employee trusts are included in the balance sheet at average cost less provisions for impairment.
The net assets, excluding shares and cash, are shown as part of creditors.
Any difference between exercise price and the market value at the date of grant of share options is charged through the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period to which the performance criteria relates.
Government grants Capital grants are treated as deferred income and credited to the profit and loss account on the same basis as the related assets are depreciated.
Revenue grants are credited to the profit and loss account in the same period as the related expenditure is charged.

com Financial statements 57 Notes to the financial statements 4 Exceptional items On 30 December 2002 Logica plc and CMG plc completed their merger.
22.6m was incurred in relation to transaction costs directly attributable to the merger.
In the six months to 31 December 2002, we carried through the previously announced restructuring in Logica's mobile networks business and CMG's Noord Nederland operation and took some actions relating to the proposed merger which became effective on completion.
A total charge of 7.7m was made in the period under review: 3.5m related to the CMG Netherlands costs: the balance of 4.2m was merger-related.
In accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill, the carrying values of the group's goodwill balances have been compared to their recoverable amounts represented by their value in use to the group.
The value in use has been derived from discounted cash flow projections which cover the five years from 1 January 2003.
After this five-year period, the projections use a longterm growth rate compatible with projections for the countries concerned.
The discount rate used to arrive at this calculation was 14% on a pre-tax basis.
The review has resulted in a charge of 444.6m in respect of various acquisitions made by the group in the past, principally Admiral acquired in 2000 by CMG, and pdv.
Amounts written-off investments in the prior period represent the write-down in carrying value of own shares held in the Logica ESOP trust.
The profit on disposal of 0.5m in the prior period relates to the disposal of CMG Denmark.

In some countries, pension is made by contributions into the state pension schemes.
The pension cost charge of these defined contribution schemes amounted to 15.7m for the six months ended 31 December 2002 year ended 30 June 2002: 36.5m.
In addition, the group also operates several defined benefit pension schemes for the benefit of employees primarily in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.
The CMG schemes were closed to new members in 1994.
The Admiral scheme was closed to new members in November 2000.
The CMG UK and Admiral UK schemes merged with effect from 1 July 2002.
The Logica Netherlands scheme was closed to new entrants and for future accrual in November 1999.
Consequently no contributions were made during the period ended 31 December 2002.
At 31 December 2002 the market value of the assets was 8.8m.
58 Financial statements LogicaCMG report and accounts 2002 Notes to the financial statements 6 Employees continued As part of the terms of the ESIS EPFAL acquisition in February 2001, it was agreed that the assets and liabilities in the defined benefit scheme in respect of the employees of the acquired business would be transferred into a new defined benefit scheme established by Logica on 1 July 2001.
From 1 July 2001 contributions were paid into the new scheme however, at 31 December 2002, the assets and liabilities were still to be transferred across from the old scheme.
Each scheme is funded in advance by contributions from the employing companies to meet the costs, at rates assessed by the actuary or insurer of each scheme, in regular funding reviews.
The schemes' assets are held in funds separate from the group.
The group contributes to a life policy scheme in the US for 12 ex-employees.
This scheme is closed to new members and is considered immaterial in respect to other pension schemes.
The assets of the scheme, valued at 3.8m at 30 June 2002, are held by an insurance company for Logica Inc.
The total amount payable for death benefits is 2.7m at 30 June 2002.
Valuation of significant defined benefit schemes The costs of the CMG and Admiral schemes operated in the UK were assessed by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method of valuation.
The principal assumptions were a rate of investment return of 8.5% per annum and salary increases during service of 6.5% per annum.
Pension increases are allowed for at the rates guaranteed in the scheme rules, based on an inflation assumption of 4.5%, with future awards of discretionary increases assumed to be covered by future investment surpluses.
The cost of the Admiral scheme operated in the UK was assessed as at 1 March 1999.
The market value of the assets of this scheme at the valuation date was 23.8m.
The actuarial value of these assets was taken to be 84% of the market value, that is, 20.0m.
This was 97% of the actuarial value of the accrued liabilities.
The deficit is being amortised over the remaining service lives of employees and is allowed for in the pension cost.
The cost of the existing CMG scheme in the UK was assessed as at 1 January 2000.
The market value of the assets of the CMG UK scheme at the valuation date was 58.5m.
The actuarial value of the assets was taken to be 81% of the market value, that is, 47.4m.
This was 107% of the actuarial value of the accrued liabilities.
The surplus is being amortised over the remaining service lives of employees and is allowed for in the pension cost.
An actuarial valuation for funding purposes is being carried out as at 1 July 2002.
The results of this are not yet available but will be used to set the employer contribution rates and SSAP 24 charge with effect from 1 January 2003 and are likely to result in increased employer contribution rates.
The cost of the CMG scheme in the Netherlands was assessed as at 1 January 2002 by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method of valuation.
The principal assumptions were a rate of investment return of 6.0% per annum, salary increases during service of 4% per annum and taking assets at market value.
The market value of the assets of the CMG Netherlands schemes at the valuation date was 93.8m.
This was 152% of the actuarial value of accrued liabilities.
The pension prepayment of 0.2m at 31 December 2002 30 June 2002: liability 0.1m represents the accumulated difference between the pension cost charged to the profit and loss account of 3.2m and pension contributions paid to defined benefit schemes by group companies see note 18.
Of this prepayment, 2.0m year ended 30 June 2002: 2.2m relates to the Netherlands schemes and 1.8m liability year ended 30 June 2002: 2.3m liability relates to the UK schemes.
Impact of accounting under FRS 17 Retirement benefits Additional disclosures regarding the group's defined benefit schemes are required under the transitional provisions of FRS 17 Retirement benefits and these are set out below.
Qualified actuaries have performed actuarial valuations or updated recent actuarial valuations at 31 December 2002 using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of FRS 17.
Investments have been valued at market value for this purpose.
The contribution rate throughout the 2002 calendar year was 13% of pensionable salaries for the CMG UK scheme and 8.9% for the Admiral UK scheme.
The net contribution paid to the CMG Netherlands scheme during 2002 was 2.0m and this was paid in the first six months of the year.
The schemes are closed schemes and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members of the schemes approach retirement.

Losses of approximately 41.6m relate to Germany and 26.3m relate to the US.
The group operates in countries where the tax rate is different to the UK corporation tax rate and therefore the future split of geographical profits may affect future tax charges.
The future use of unrecognised tax losses may also effect future tax charges.
The effective tax rate for the period and prior year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 30%, the differences are analysed as follows: 6 months ended 12 months 31 December ended 2002 30 June 2002 m m Loss on ordinary activities before tax 444.7 804.1 Impairment of goodwill 444.6 825.2 Amortisation of goodwill 24.3 76.7 Amounts written-off investments - 20.2 Other exceptional items 30.3 42.1 Profit on ordinary activities 54.5 160.1 Taxation on profit on ordinary activities at the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% Prior period 30% 16.4 48.0 Adjustment to current and deferred tax in respect of prior periods 2.1 3.8 Adjustment in respect of foreign tax rates 0.8 1.2 Tax loss utilisation 0.9 4.5 Deferred tax assets not recognised 3.0 15.5 Other items including permanent differences 1.1 8.4 Tax on operating activities before exceptional items 16.1 45.6 Tax on costs of exceptional items 3.0 15.2 13.

Earnings per share, excluding goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, have also been included as the directors consider this figure to be helpful for a better understanding of the underlying business.
In the period ended 31 December 2002 and year ended 30 June 2002, the group made a loss and consequently the effect of share options is anti-dilutive.
Therefore there is no difference between the weighted average number of shares for the unadjusted basic and diluted loss per share.

The group's policies with respect to managing these risks are set out below.
The group does not undertake any trading or speculative activity in financial instruments.
It operates within policies and procedures that are formally approved by the board, which include strict controls on the use of financial instruments in managing the group's risk.
Short-term debtors, creditors and provisions less than one year have been excluded from the disclosure below.
Management of cash and current asset investments Surplus funds are invested in high quality liquid marketable investments, including bank deposits, asset management funds and commercial paper.
Foreign currency risk The group reviews the credit quality of counter parties and limits individual aggregate credit exposure accordingly.
Group companies have their local currency as their functional currency.
The majority of the turnover and expenses of group companies are denominated in their local currency.
To mitigate foreign currency risk, material contracted transactional amounts not denominated in local currencies of group companies are hedged by means of forward contracts, foreign currency options or currency overdrafts.
Remittances are then applied to the overdrafts.
The overdrafts are part of set-off arrangements against the positive cash balances of the group companies.
As a result of hedging provided by the use of currency overdrafts and forward contracts there are no material transactional currency exposures which are consistent with the prior year.
For this reason, a table of foreign currency exposures as required by FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments has not been presented.
The group does not hedge the translation effect of the consolidated profit and loss account.
At period end and during the period, the translation of the groups balance sheet has been substantially hedged by managing the currency mix of the group debt by the use of foreign currency borrowings and forward contracts.
The most significant consequence is to substantially hedge the group's euro denominated assets.
The selected currency mix takes into account the availability and cost of funds, and the sensitivity of group gearing and earnings ratios to exchange rate movements.
Interest rate risk The interest rate profile of the group's financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2002 was as follows: Financial Floating Fixed Floating liabilities rate rate rate 31 December on which no financial financial financial 2002 interest is liabilities liabilities assets Total paid m m m m m Currency Sterling 1.5 112.3 3.1 0.2 116.7 Euro 0.8 124.7 0.1 77.5 48.1 Other currencies 0.4 - 0.2 55.6 55.0 At 31 December 2002 2.7 237.0 3.4 133.3 109.8 70 Financial statements LogicaCMG report and accounts 2002 Notes to the financial statements 24 Financial instruments continued The interest rate profile of the group's financial assets and liabilities at 30 June 2002 was as follows: Financial Floating Fixed Floating liabilities on rate rate rate which no financial financial financial 30 June 2002 interest is paid liabilities liabilities assets Total Currency m m m m m Sterling 2.5 139.7 3.0 40.0 105.2 Euro 1.5 103.4 0.2 85.6 19.5 Other currencies 2.5 - 0.2 29.4 26.7 At 30 June 2002 6.5 243.1 3.4 155.0 98.0 Floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates, based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents, which are fixed in advance for periods of between one day and six months.
The weighted average period until maturity for floating rate financial liabilities on which interest is paid is 40 months.
Fixed rate liabilities represent amounts outstanding on finance leases.
The average interest rate on fixed rate liabilities for the period is 6.9%.
The weighted average period for which rates are fixed on these financial liabilities is 26 months.
Financial liabilities on which no interest is paid relate to provisions greater than one year as disclosed in note 18.
All financial assets except for 0.5m of fixed asset investments earn interest at floating rates based on relevant national LIBID equivalents or goverment bonds fixed in advance for periods ranging from one day to one month.
The groups policy is to fund its operations through a mixture of retained earnings, equity and bank debt.
To ensure immediate access without material interest rate penalty, all group cash and liquid resources balances were invested on a floating rate basis throughout the period.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities The book value of primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the group's operations is not materially different from the fair value of those instruments.
Fair values of interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts are based on the market price of comparable derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and fair values of the group's interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts at 31 December 2002 and 30 June 2002.

Substantial committed facilities are maintained with a group of leading international banks.
At 31 December 2002 the group had committed floating rate facilities of 350m of which 230m matures in May 2006 and 120m matures in November 2003, 236.7m had been drawn down at 31 December 2002.
During the period the highest amount drawn on these facilities was 258.4m.
Hedges The group hedges its net transactional exposure arising on trade debtors and creditors and all committed trade flows fully through the use of forward contracts and overdrafts.
The group selectively hedges its anticipated currency cash flow exposures on some product related trade up to 18 months ahead through the use of forward contracts and selective purchase of currency options.
com Financial statements 71 Notes to the financial statements 24 Financial instruments continued Currency risk on some contract bids is hedged proportionate to the likelihood of the contract being won.
For these contracts the currency risk is fully hedged once the contract has been won.
The table below shows the extent to which the group has off-balance sheet unrecognised gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning and end of the period.
It also shows the amount of such gains and losses which have been included in the profit and loss account for the period and those gains and losses which are expected to be included in next year's, or later, profit and loss accounts.
