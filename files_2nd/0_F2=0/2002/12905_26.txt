62 RAC plc Annual Report 2002 34 Pension schemes The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs, see a, b, and c below.
The relevant transitional disclosures under the new accounting standard, FRS 17 Retirement benefits, are shown in d below.
The UK Accounting Standards Board have delayed full mandatory adoption of FRS 17 until 2005, and pending proposals from the International Accounting Standards Board.
The disclosures under SSAP 24 relate to the most recent formal actuarial valuations of the pension schemes.
Since the date of those valuations, changes in market conditions have meant that there has been a deterioration in the funding position of the schemes, consequently the Group will make further additional contributions into the pension funds during the course of 2003.
Details of the most recent actuarial valuations of the Lex and RAC pension schemes are shown in a and b below.
These pension schemes were merged with effect from 1 January 2002 and subsequently renamed RAC 2003 Pension Scheme.
a Lex Service Pension Scheme The Group operates a funded defined benefits scheme for eligible UK employees.
The assets of the UK scheme are held independently from those of RAC plc and its subsidiaries.
Three of the scheme participants are joint venture undertakings.
The Groups pension costs are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread them systematically over employees working lives with the Group.
The Lex Service Pension Scheme was the subject of an actuarial valuation as at 5 April 2001.
The valuation was carried out by an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method on an ongoing basis.
The assets were taken at market value.
The principal assumptions applied in the valuation calculation were: a.
Increases in pensionable salaries 4.5% p. a. c. Price inflation 2.5% p. a.
In addition, the valuation included an allowance for discretionary increases to pensions in payment of 1.67% p. a. relating to service before 6 April 1997 and an allowance of 2.5% p. a. for guaranteed pension increases relating to service after 5 April 1997 pensions relating to service after 5 April 1997 are guaranteed to increase in line with RPI up to a maximum of 5% p. a.. At the date of valuation, the market value of the assets of the scheme was 340.2 million which was sufficient to cover 99% of the benefits which had accrued to members, allowing for future expected increases in earnings.
Additional contributions are being paid by the employer to make good this shortfall over a period of 12 years.
For determining pension cost, the shortfall of the market value of assets over liabilities is spread throughout the expected remaining service lives of employees currently in the scheme.
The total pension cost, including administration costs, for this section of the merged scheme was 11.9 million 2001 5.9 million of which 1.8 million 2001 1.0 million was attributable to joint venture undertakings.
An amount of 37.6 million 2001 39.2 million is included in creditors falling due after more than one year, this being the excess of the accumulated pension cost over the payment of contributions to the schemes.
b RAC Holdings Limited RAC Holdings Limited operates both defined benefit and defined contribution scheme for its staff.
The RAC pension scheme was closed to new members from 31 December 2000.
All new RAC employees who join from 1 January 2001 are offered membership of the Lex Service Pension Scheme.
The defined benefits plan, a non-contributory scheme, applied to all permanent staff who were under the age of 55 on entry.
Pensions based on final pensionable earnings are paid on retirement at 65 and 62 for certain executives.
Under the defined contributions scheme, a contributory scheme for all employees other than executive directors and a small number of senior managers, a percentage of earnings is paid into a fund to provide pension benefits on retirements.
An actuarial valuation of the defined benefits fund was carried out on 31 December 1999 by independent qualified actuaries, using the projected unit method.
The principal assumptions applied in the valuation calculations were: a.
Increases to pensionable salaries 4.4% p. a. c. Price inflation 2.9% p. a.
The valuation revealed a surplus of assets over liabilities of 43.4 million which corresponded to a funding level of 142%.
The market value of the funds defined benefits sections assets at the valuation date was 147.8 million.
The total pension cost for this section of the merged scheme was 6.5 million 2001 5.9 million.
RAC plc Annual Report 2002 63 Notes to the accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2002 34 Pension schemes continued c Other schemes The Group operates a number of smaller defined benefits and defined contribution schemes.
The aggregate total pension cost of these schemes was 1.1 million 2001 0.8 million.
d FRS 17 Retirement benefits The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuations at 5 April 2001 for the Lex Service Pension Scheme and 31 December 1999 for the RAC Pension Scheme and updated to 31 December 2002 by Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited.
These schemes were merged during the year and the disclosures represent the combined values.
The major financial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under FRS 17 are: 2002 2001 Valuation method Market related Discount rate 5.6% 6.0% Inflation rate 2.2% 2.5% Increase to deferred benefits during deferment 2.2% 2.5% Increase to pensions in payment 2.2% 2.5% Salary increases 3.7% 4.0% On full compliance with FRS 17, on the basis of the above assumptions, the amounts that would have been charged to operating profit, finance income and consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses for the year ended 31 December 2002 are set out below: Group 2002 m Operating profit Current service cost 17.7 Past service cost Total charge to operating profit 17.7 Finance income Expected return on pension scheme assets 31.4 Interest on pension scheme plan liabilities 31.9 Net charge to finance income 0.5 Consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses Actual return less expected return on post employment plan assets 104.6 Experience gains and losses arising on the plan liabilities 16.8 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the plan liabilities 5.8 Actuarial loss recognisable in the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses 115.6 Movement in deficit in year Deficit in scheme at 31 December 2001 69.2 Movements in year: current service cost 17.7 past service cost contributions 18.2 net charge to finance income 0.5 actuarial loss 115.6 Deficit in scheme at 31 December 2002 184.8 History of experience gains and losses Difference between the expected and annual return on plan assets: amount million 104.6 percentage of scheme assets 27% Experience losses on plan liabilities: amount million 16.8 percentage of the present value of scheme liabilities 3% Total amount recognised in consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses: amount million 115.6 percentage of the present value of scheme liabilities 20% 64 RAC plc Annual Report 2002 34 Pension schemes continued d FRS 17 Retirement benefits continued The assets and liabilities in the schemes and the expected rate of return were: Long-term rate of Long-term rate of return expected at return expected at 31 December 2002 31 December 2001 2002 2001 m m Equities 6.72% 7.15% 270.8 386.8 Bonds 5.03% 4.95% 111.0 71.8 Other 4.00% 4.00% 7.4 4.6 Total market value of assets 389.2 463.2 Present value of scheme liabilities 574.0 532.4 Deficit in the schemes 184.8 69.2 Related deferred tax asset 55.5 20.8 Net pension liability 129.3 48.4 2002 2001 m m Net assets Net assets excluding net SSAP 24 pension asset 416.2 423.2 Pension liability 129.3 48.4 Net assets including pension liability 286.9 374.8 2002 2001 m m Reserves Profit and loss account excluding net SSAP 24 pension asset 255.5 263.9 Pension liability 129.3 48.4 Profit and loss reserve 126.2 215.5 35 Post-retirement medical benefits The Company provides medical benefits on a discretionary basis for certain pensioners and their dependants in the United Kingdom.
In addition, certain employees may also become eligible for this benefit on retirement.
The number of pensioners entitled to this benefit at 31 December 2002 was 193 2001 194.
The Company's obligation for these benefits was assessed in 2002 by independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The future health care cost trend rates were 7.5% for two years, falling to 4.3% p. a. thereafter.
The discount rate used to determine the liability and cost was 6.0% p. a..
The Group funds these benefits when incurred.
The accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation of 3.9 million 2001 4.2 million has been included in creditors falling due after more than one year.
36 Contingent liabilities The Company and certain of its subsidiary undertakings have given cross guarantees in respect of joint bank accounts.
The Company has also given other guarantees in respect of certain bank overdrafts of, and loans to, subsidiary undertakings.
The Company's contingent liabilities in respect of these items amounted to 7.7 million at 31 December 2002 2001 4.0 million.
The consolidated balance sheet includes all of the overdrafts and loans.
The Company also has contingent liabilities relating to letters of credit issued by banks in support of liabilities of subsidiaries amounting to 34.3 million 2001 7.4 million.
The European Union directive on the disposal of end of life vehicles was issued in September 2000.
Member states were required to enact legislation by 21 April 2002, however this has been delayed and is expected to be finalised during 2003.
The legislation is likely to result in additional cost to the industry, however there are a number of uncertainties surrounding the exact form and implementation of the legislation in the UK, and the method of allocation of cost has not been finalised.
The directors feel that there is still insufficient information available to allow the assessment of the form or value of any obligations that may fall to the Group.
RAC plc Annual Report 2002 65 Notes to the accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2002 37 Financial instruments The principal financial instruments held or issued by the Group are as follows: cash: debt, including loan notes and finance lease obligations: forward foreign exchange contracts: interest rate and currency swaps: and certain debtors and creditors that meet the definition of a financial instrument as set out in FRS 13.
