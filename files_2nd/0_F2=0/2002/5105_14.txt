easyJet plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Notes forming part of the financial statements 1 Accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the consolidated financial statements of easyJet plc and its subsidiaries the group with the exception of the new financial reporting standard FRS 19, Deferred Tax which has been adopted during the year.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with currently applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate those of the holding company and its subsidiaries for the years made up to 30 September 2002 and 2001.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
In accordance with Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
The companys profit for the financial year was 7.4 million 2001: Loss of 3.1 million.
Goodwill On the acquisition of a business fair values are attributed to the separable net assets acquired.
Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such net assets.
Goodwill is capitalised and amortised to the profit and loss account in equal instalments over its estimated useful life, not to exceed 20 years.
Associates An associate is an undertaking, not being a subsidiary, in which the group holds a long term interest and over whose commercial and financial policy decisions it actually exercises significant influence.
The groups share of the profit less losses from its associate is included in the consolidated profit and loss account on the equity accounting basis.
The carrying value of associates in the groups balance sheet is calculated by reference to the groups share of the net assets of such undertakings.
Deutsche BA is deemed to be an associate of the group and details are set in out in note 10 below.
Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost plus capitalised interest.
To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account.
37 easyJet plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Notes continued 1 Accounting policies continued Revenue Revenues comprise the invoiced value of airline services, net of passenger taxes, discounts, including internet booking discounts, plus ancillary and advertising revenue.
Revenue from the sale of flight seats is recognised in the period in which the service is provided.
Unearned revenue represents flight seats sold but not yet flown and is included in Creditors, within Accruals and deferred income.
Refunds made to passengers in the pre-flight period are recorded as reductions in revenue and any refunds made post flight are ordinarily recorded as marketing expense in the profit and loss account.
Commissions from the sale of insurance, accommodation and car hire to passengers are recognised in the profit and loss account in the period during which the commissionable service is provided.
Change fees paid for alteration of flight details, together with associated costs, are recognised in the profit and loss account on the date that the change is requested.
Credit card fees, together with associated costs are recognised in the profit and loss account on the date that a booking is made.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of assets, on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic lives to the group over the following periods: Aircraft - airframe, engines and landing gear - 7 years Aircraft - prepaid maintenance - 3-6 years Aircraft - spares - 10 years from date of manufacture Leasehold improvements - 5 years Fixtures, fittings and equipment - 3 years Computer hardware and software - 3 years The aircraft which the group holds are expected to have an operational life of 20-30 years.
However, the group has a policy of using recently manufactured aircraft and, therefore, expects to hold them only for a period of approximately 7 years before selling them.
An element of the cost of a new aircraft is attributed on acquisition to prepaid maintenance of its engines and airframe and is amortised over a period ranging from three to six years from the date of manufacture.
Subsequent costs incurred which lend enhancement to future periods such as long term scheduled maintenance and major overhaul of aircraft and engines are capitalised and amortised over the length of period benefiting from these enhancements.
All other costs relating to maintenance are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Depreciation is charged at approximately 7.5 per cent per annum, which, over a seven year period, reduces the net book value of an aircraft to its estimated residual value at that time.
Advance payments and option payments made in respect of aircraft purchase commitments and options to acquire aircraft are recorded at cost and separately disclosed.
On acquisition of the related aircraft, these payments are included as part of the cost of aircraft and are depreciated from that date.
Interest incurred on borrowings that specifically fund progress payments on assets under construction is capitalised, either as part of the asset or if that asset is subsequently sold and leased back, deferred and amortised over the term of the lease.
38 easyJet plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Notes continued 1 Accounting policies continued Pensions The group contributes to defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the group in independently administered funds.
Group contributions are charged to the consolidated profit and loss account in the year in which they are incurred.
Employee share schemes The cost of performance related awards to employees that take the form of rights to acquire or receive shares is recognised over the period of the employees related performance.
The cost represents the difference between the option exercise price if any and the market value of the shares at the date of gift or grant.
Where there are no performance criteria, the cost is recognised over the period from gift or grant to when the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the shares.
Where contingently issuable shares are gifted the cost of the share gift is recognised upon the crystallisation of the contingency.
These costs are included in administrative expenses.
Deferred tax The company has adopted FRS 19 Deferred Tax during the year.
This did not effect the prior year comparatives.
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Foreign currencies The group holds its aircraft through overseas subsidiaries.
The functional currency of these subsidiaries is considered to be US dollars because they are funded substantially with US dollar loans and the aircraft are anticipated to be sold for dollars within approximately 7 years of their acquisition.
Profits and losses of these and other overseas subsidiaries are translated into pounds sterling at average rates of exchange during the year, with the adjustments to closing rates at the year end being taken to consolidated reserves.
The net assets of the overseas subsidiaries, including the advance payments made to secure the delivery of aircraft, are translated at closing rates, with gains and losses on re-translation also being taken to consolidated reserves.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings that hedge foreign currency net assets are also taken to reserves.
Where foreign currency borrowings have been used to finance foreign equity investments or where those borrowings provide a hedge against the exchange risk associated with the existing foreign equity investments, the foreign equity investments are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The resulting exchange difference on the foreign equity investments is taken to consolidated reserves and, to the extent thereof, the resulting exchange difference on the foreign borrowings is offset against these exchange differences.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, other than as referred to above, are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the consolidated profit and loss account.
Other exchange differences are taken to the consolidated profit and loss account.
39 easyJet plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Notes continued 1 Accounting policies continued Financial instruments Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments are recognised in the profit and loss account when realised as an offset to the related income or expense, as the group does not enter into any such transactions for speculative purposes.
Leases All of the groups lease contracts are of an operating lease nature and are accounted for as operating leases, where the rental charges are charged to the consolidated profit and loss account on a straight-line basis.
Aircraft maintenance Provision is made for the estimated future costs of major overhauls of leased airframes, engines and auxiliary power units by making appropriate charges to the profit and loss account calculated by reference to the number of hours or cycles operated during the year as a consequence of aircraft rectification obligations placed on the group by the operating lease agreements.
Cash Cash, for the purposes of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts repayable on demand, where formal offset arrangements are in place.
2 Segmental information All revenues derive from the groups principal activity as an airline and include scheduled services, inflight and related sales.
Substantially all of the groups external revenues are earned by companies incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The geographical analysis of turnover is as follows: 2002 2001 Continuing operations Acquisitions Total 000 000 000 000 Within the United Kingdom 106,078 14,375 120,453 86,545 Between the United Kingdom and the Rest of Europe 337,263 51,614 388,877 244,764 Within the Rest of Europe 42,514 - 42,514 25,550 485,855 65,989 551,844 356,859 All the groups operating profit arises from airline-related activities.
The only revenue earning assets of the group are its aircraft fleet.
Since the groups aircraft fleet is employed flexibly across its route network, there is no suitable basis of allocating such assets and related liabilities to geographical segments.

The total payable to the auditor for audit and non-audit services during the year was 2.0 million 2001: 1.1 million, which included 0.3 million in respect of flotation related services.
Auditors remuneration for audit of the company as a stand-alone entity was 15,000 2001: 15,000.
Included within administrative expenses are the following items: - Costs of integrating the businesses of Go Fly and easyJet, totalling 7.1 million.
Included within these costs is 5.1 million as an accrual for the cost of the Management Combination Incentive Plan the Combination Plan.
The Combination Plan is designed to reward key participants in the process of combining the businesses of easyJet and Go with free shares if performance milestones are met within certain periods.
Good progress has been made towards the three performance milestones of single brand, single AOC and combination completion.
Other costs have been incurred in respect of systems, property and consultancy.
Included within administrative expenses in 2001 were the following exceptional items: - 1.8 million, principally in respect of granting a one-off gift of shares to certain employees of the group, which crystallised upon the company obtaining a listing on the London Stock Exchange during 2001.
The charge to the profit and loss account during the year was based upon the estimated fair value of the shares of the company at the date it granted the shares to the employees.
41 easyJet plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Notes continued 3 Profit on ordinary activities before taxation continued - 2.0 million in respect of a court decision against easyJet Switzerland.
The Swiss Federal Tax Administration SFTA brought a claim against easyJet Switzerland, relating to VAT on tour operators for services provided.
Following successive proceedings and appeals, in 1998 the Federal Recourse Committee for VAT matters, a specialised court dealing with tax matters, ruled in favour of easyJet Switzerland, stating that its charter operations were not subject to VAT.
In 1999, the SFTA appealed against this decision to the Swiss Federal Court the highest court in Switzerland and gained a decision in its favour during the 2001 financial year.
The total amount claimed by the SFTA is approximately 9.4 million plus interest estimated at approximately 1.0 million.
The majority of this has now been re-claimed from its customers.
Taking into account amounts, which the group believes it will collect from these customers, has resulted in a net profit and loss account charge of approximately 1.0 million, plus interest of approximately 1.0 million.
4 Staff numbers and costs The average number of persons employed by the group including executive directors during the year, analysed by category, was as follows: Number of employees 2002 2001 Continuing operations Acquisition Total Number Number Number Number Operations and administration 1,668 136 1,804 1,362 Sales and marketing 210 31 241 237 1,878 167 2,045 1,599 The aggregate payroll costs of these persons were as follows: 2002 2001 Continuing operations Acquisition Total 000 000 000 000 Wages and salaries 56,559 4,267 60,826 45,722 Social security costs 4,465 5,586 444 6,030 Pension costs 2,428 104 2,532 1,761 64,573 4,815 69,388 51,948 Staff numbers and costs stated as being related to Acquisition are those of Go Fly, but only in the period from 1 August 2002 the effective date of acquisition to 30 September 2002 and therefore shows only one sixth of the actual numbers employed by Go Fly during the period.

The actual current tax charge for the current and the previous year differs from the standard rate for the reasons set out in the following reconciliation: 2002 2001 000 000 Profit on ordinary activities before tax 71,577 40,133 Tax charge at 30% 21,473 12,040 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 2,502 2,324 Lower tax rates in certain overseas jurisdictions 2,137 1,192 Movement in share option scheme deduction 2,695 9,125 UK losses incurred in previous years used in period 5,647 - Overseas losses incurred in period not used 73 4 Overseas losses incurred in previous years used in period 1,234 - Purchased goodwill not deductible - 927 Capital allowances in advance of depreciation 2,590 - Depreciation in advance of capital allowances - 402 Other fixed asset timing differences 1,829 1,050 Adjustments in respect of previous periods - 57 15,467 2,226 Deferred tax 7,101 - 2,226 22,568 The following tax losses were estimated to be available to offset against profits in future periods: At 30 September At 30 September 2001 2002 000 000 United Kingdom - 3,516 Overseas 21 14 21 3,530 Share options A deduction is available for the difference between the market value of the shares at the date of exercise of the share option or the market value at 30 September 2002 if the options remain unexercised and the option price for UK employees.
This deduction has only been available since 22 November 2000, the date that easyJet plcs shares were first admitted to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange.
If the share price increases between 30 September 2002 and the date of exercise of the outstanding options, then a further tax deduction will be recognised in subsequent financial years.
However, if the share price falls, as it has during the financial year, then there will be a tax charge.
Given the number of options outstanding see note 17 below, movements in the share price could potentially cause a significant variation in the tax charge and the effective tax rate in future years.
45 easyJet plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Notes continued 6 Taxation continued For Swiss employees, a similar tax deduction is available, but only when the stock options have been exercised.
As a result of the rights issues of ordinary shares during the year, the number options and their exercise price were realigned to reflect the bonus element of that rights issue.
The effect of a one penny movement in the share price is 0.2 million 2001 - 0.2 million.
The closing price at 30 September 2002 was 2.60 2001: 2.97 3.36 before adjustment of bonus element of rights issue.
easyJet Switzerland, a group member, has the benefit of an exemption from communal and cantonal taxes in Switzerland until 1 January 2008, subject to meeting certain conditions.
The effective tax rate in Switzerland at present is 7.6%, but will rise to 27.5% from 1 January 2008 assuming that tax rates remain unchanged.
7 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit for the period retained for equity shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period after adjusting for changes to the capital structure of the group.
The number of shares used for 2001 has been increased by 12.9% to allow for the effect of the bonus effect of the rights issue of July 2002.
The calculation for diluted earnings per share uses the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted by the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The dilution effect is calculated on the full exercise of all ordinary share options granted by the group including other share schemes, which the group consider to have been earned.
The calculation compares the difference between the exercise price of exercisable share options, weighted for the period over which they were outstanding during the year, with the average daily mid-market closing price over the period when they were in existence as options.
The earnings per share are based on the following: Year ended Year ended 30 September 30 September 2001 2002 Profit for the year retained for equity shareholders 000s 49,009 37,907 Number Number Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year used to calculate basic earnings per share 000s 335,493 281,485 Weighted average number of dilutive share options used to calculate dilutive earnings per share 000s 15,002 17,232 46 easyJet plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Notes continued 7 Earnings per share continued The derivation of profit for the calculation of EPS before goodwill amortisation is as follows: Year ended Year ended 30 September 30 September 2002 2001 000 000 Profit for the year retained for equity shareholders 49,009 37,907 Add back: goodwill amortisation 3,091 168 38,075 52,100 Goodwill did not affect the tax charge.

On 31 July 2002, the group acquired Newgo1 Limited, the ultimate holding company of Go Fly Limited, an operator of low cost airline services between London Stansted, Bristol, East Midlands and Western Europe and the Czech Republic.
The total consideration payable, including the costs of acquisition, was 387.1 million, which was satisfied by cash.
The cash was partly funded by the issue of 104.4 million ordinary shares of 25 pence at 2.65 each, generating net proceeds of 271.9 million, plus cash of 115.2 million.
Acquisition accounting has been used as the basis for consolidating the results of Newgo1 Limited within those of the easyJet group.
Goodwill arising from the acquisition has been included as an intangible fixed asset on the groups balance sheet, and will be depreciated over a period of 20 years in accordance with the directors opinion as to the estimated useful economic life of the goodwill purchased.
The investment in Newgo1 Limited has been included in the companys balance sheet at cost, which is not less than its fair value, at the date of acquisition.

Following the success of the bid in March 2001, easyJet invested 7.2 million including 0.3 million legal and consultancy fees as its investment to provide the Airline Group with the initial capital base needed for the purchase.
The investment included 0.3 million of accrued interest receivable.
This investment has been written off during the year ended 30 September 2002 since, following the events of 11 September 2001, which caused a substantial reduction in NATS revenues, potential returns from NATS are uncertain.
The amount written off includes loan notes of 6.6 million.
The accrued interest on the loan notes including that which has been internally capitalised within the Airline Group is 0.8 million 2001: 0.3 million.
This accrued interest has not been recognised since its recovery is subject to uncertainty.
Deutsche BA In August 2002, easyJet and British Airways Plc British Airways entered into an agreement under which the group was granted an option to acquire from British Airways its 100 per cent holding in Deutsche BA Holding GmbH DBA.
The group will assist in the conversion of DBA to a low cost airline, and under this acquisition agreement easyJet has significant influence over the operations of DBA.
Accordingly, DBA is an associated undertaking of the group.
The group contributed 5 million 3.1 million to its associate at the time of entering into the agreement to fund capital expenditure.
This amount represents the groups current investment in DBA.
If the option is exercised, the group will in addition to the 600,000 monthly sum noted below pay between 32 million and 39 million 20.1 million and 24.5 million, respectively to British Airways.
If the option is not exercised by the group, the 5 million will be forfeited.
DBA is currently loss-making and under the terms of the agreement the group is required to pay 600,000 0.4 million to British Airways for each month until the option is exercised or lapses the option is exercisable up to 30 April 2003, extendable by the group to August 2003.

These are as a result of obligations in the lease contract in respect of the return conditions applied by lessors, which require aircraft airframes, engines and auxiliary power units to reach at least a specified condition on their return at the end of the lease.
This requires significant spend, often towards the end of the lease period.
The group pays maintenance reserves to lessors on a monthly basis in respect of certain leases, based on usage, to provide a security deposit for the lessor should the aircraft be returned without meeting its return conditions.
These maintenance reserves are then returned to the group on production of evidence that qualifying maintenance expenditure has been incurred.
However, in many instances maintenance reserves payable by the group are insufficient to meet the expected cost of the return conditions imposed.
A further amount is provided in respect of the expected average monthly maintenance charge to be incurred over the life of the lease, less the net maintenance reserves paid to the lessor by the group and additional maintenance costs incurred.

The auditors reviewed the basis of the board of directors' computation and concluded that the adjustments were fair and reasonable.
The adjustments have also been approved by the Inland Revenue.

Employees may not dispose of any shares that have resulted from the exercise of options within two years from the date of Admission to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority, except to the extent of settling their liabilities to personal tax, National Insurance contributions and the exercise price per option exercised.
Substantially all of the employees accepted employers Secondary National Insurance contributions due on the exercise of the first tranche of options.
It is a condition of those options granted at an exercise price in excess of 1.61 per share that the option holders accept liability for the employers Secondary National Insurance contributions due on the exercise of the options.
For UK employees, once vested, the options remain in place should the employee leave the group and may be exercised within a period ending ten years from the date of grant.
For Swiss employees, once vested, the options remain in place should the employee leave the group and may be exercised within a period ending seven years from the date of grant.
56 easyJet plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Notes continued 17 Share options and other share awards continued An easyJet Supplemental Flotation Share Option Scheme was established in respect of both UK and Swiss employees to grant options to a number of participants who had inadvertently been issued with incorrect paperwork or who had been omitted from the original grants.
These options replaced options, which had lapsed, but which had been included in the aggregate totals disclosed in the Listing Particulars for the company when it floated.
These shares are included in the table of share options and grants outstanding above.
ii the easyJet Non-Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme: This award of options over ordinary shares in easyJet plc was granted in December 2000 to eligible employees of FLS easyTech Limited easyTech, a 25 per cent associate of easyJet Airline Company Limited with a three year vesting period and no performance criteria.
This grant was a catch-up, as it had not been possible to grant options to these employees under the easyJet Key Employee Pre-Flotation Share Option Scheme.
Further awards were made in December 2001 to all easyJet employees.
The options granted are subject to a three year vesting period and will be exercisable subject to performance criteria.
iii the easyJet Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme: This award of options over ordinary shares in easyJet plc was granted in December 2001 to eligible employees of the group on terms that meet Inland Revenue requirements for an Approved share option scheme.
In addition to the share options above, easyJet had also established three further share schemes as follows: iv As at 30 September 2000, 838,607 shares were allocated under a share gift scheme with 478,712 shares vesting on Admission to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority with the remainder vesting on the first anniversary of Admission.
At 30 September 2002 nil 2001: 210, 392 shares were outstanding under this scheme.
v On 22 November 2000, 471,172 shares were allocated under the Share Bonus Scheme.
The employees entitled to these shares at the date of Admission have an obligation to retain these shares for at least two years from that date.
vi The Management Combination Incentive Plan.
Since July 2002, a total of 3,071,253 shares have been granted under the terms of the plan, which is designed to reward key participants in the process of combining the businesses of easyJet and Go Fly with free shares if the three performance milestones of single brand, single AOC and combination completion have been met within certain agreed timescales.
Alternative accounting treatment Changes to the accounting for share options are proposed within a recently issued accounting exposure draft, Financial Reporting Exposure Draft 31 Share-based Payments, which include a proposal to expense the fair value of the share options.
These proposed accounting requirements are suggested to be effective for all share options issued after October 2002.
Had this accounting treatment been mandatory for all the share options issued by the group up until 30 September 2002 the profit and loss account would have been subject to an additional charge of 4.3 million for the year ended 30 September 2002 2001: 5.4 million.
B 25 per cent of the share options granted vest at the dates below: Date of Admission of the company: First anniversary of Admission: Second anniversary of Admission: and Third anniversary of Admission.
C Granted under the easyJet Non-Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme and subject to meeting certain earnings per share targets D Granted under the easyJet Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme and subject to meeting certain earnings per share targets E Granted under the Management Combination Incentive Plan and subject to meeting certain combination milestones as set out above There were no movements during the year in the share options granted to directors of the company except for the share options granted under the scheme described in C, D and E above.
In 2001, Nick Hartley and Vilhelm Hahn-Petersen were allocated 6,452 and 22,581 shares, respectively, under the bonus share scheme in v above during the year, and Nick Hartley was gifted 280 shares by easyJet Holdings Limited, the companys, then parent undertaking, as an employee present at the time of the first flight.
The middle market price of the companys ordinary shares at 30 September 2002 was 260p and the range during the year to 30 September 2002 was 244p to 503p, as restated for the bonus effect of the Rights Issue.
The shares granted on 26 February 2000, 26 September 2000, 22 November 2000 and 6 December 2001 have been amended, both in number and exercise price, to reflect the bonus effect of the Rights Issue.
The table above reflects the position after the amendments had been made.
59 easyJet plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Notes continued 18 Contingent liabilities The group is involved in various disputes or litigation in the normal course of business.
Whilst the result of such disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, the company believes that the ultimate resolution of these disputes will not have a material affect on the groups financial position or results.
Go Fly Limited, a group company, is currently engaged in a dispute with Go Voyages, a French travel company.
Go Voyages has started proceedings in the French civil court in Paris alleging a trade mark infringement by Go Fly Limited in relation to the trade mark Go Voyages and unfair competition.
Go Voyages is claiming 3 million damages, for which no provision has been made within the financial statements.
The group is vigorously defending the claims and does not consider the amount of any likely settlement to be material to the financial statements.
If Go Fly Limited were to lose the case, it may have to pay damages and may also be prevented from using its French or European Community trademarks, which may be subject to cancellation.
On 15 May 2002, Navitaire Inc. Navitaire, a former supplier to easyJet Airline Company Limited, a group company, of airline reservation software, issued proceedings against that group company alleging copyright infringement in relation to airline reservations software.
easyJet Airline Company is vigorously defending the claims.
The directors consider that, in the event of Navitaire being successful in any claim, any award of damages is unlikely to be material to the group.

The principal financial instruments used by the group to finance its operations are cash and loans.
During the current financial period, certain financial instruments have been acquired as a result of the acquisition of Newgo1 Limited.
Whilst the financial instruments acquired will run their course, it is not proposed to replace them once they expire.
The significant financial risks faced by the group and the policies that it applies are considered below.
These have not materially changed from the previous year.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
Historically, the group has seldom used derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fuel, foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations, although natural hedges limit the exposures to these risks, as explained below.
However, during 2001, the group acquired a derivative to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in the price of fuel.
This derivative capped the fuel price to the group at 95 US cents per US gallon for 90 per cent of its estimated requirements over the six months ended 31 March 2002.
In the event, the fuel price remained below this level for the entire period and therefore no cash return was received from the financial instrument.
On 1 August 2002 the group acquired Newgo1 Limited which has used financial instruments to hedge its exposure to the price of fuel and also fluctuations in the Euro and US dollar rates of exchange.
As at 30 September 2002, there are a number of these arrangements in place.
Over time these will mature and the combined group will not make any further use of such financial instruments.
The extent of these financial instruments at 30 September 2002 was to hedge 30 per cent of the Go Fly fuel requirement for the year ending 30 September 2003, 48 per cent of the Go Fly US dollar requirements for the year ending 30 September 2003 and 43 per cent of the net Go Fly Euro requirements in the year ending 30 September 2003.
All such arrangements are expected to expire by 30 June 2003.
A fair value adjustment was booked for the financial instruments owned by Newgo1 Limited as part of the acquisition accounting at completion.
62 easyJet plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Notes continued 21 Financial instruments continued For the purposes of this note, other than currency disclosures, the only debtors and creditors included are bank and shareholder loans, in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 13, Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments.
Foreign currency risk The group has an international business.
Its reporting and principal trading currency is pounds sterling.
Aircraft purchases, sales and leasing transactions together with other aircraft related costs are denominated in US dollars.
The group also operates, to a lesser extent, in a number of other currencies.
The groups trade activity is concentrated in Europe, where there is a matching, to some extent, of the cash inflows and outflows of different European currencies.
The majority of the groups trading revenue is derived in pounds sterling, although a significant amount of revenue is also derived in other European currencies and, other than fuel, aircraft lease and some of the maintenance costs, the groups cost base has a similar profile.
Fuel, aircraft lease and some of the maintenance costs are payable in US dollars and movements in the value of the US dollar against pounds sterling impact these costs to the group: a strong pound sterling against the US dollar reduces these costs to the group.
Approximately 16 per cent 2001: 40 per cent of the groups total assets that is, its owned aircraft and deposits paid towards the future acquisition of aircraft are denominated in US dollars, with the effect that the groups balance sheet and, in particular, shareholders funds, can be significantly affected by movements in the rate of pounds sterling against the US dollar.
The group mitigates the effect of such movements by borrowing in the same currencies as those US dollar denominated assets.
Owned aircraft are anticipated to be sold for US dollars within approximately 7 years of their acquisition.
The resulting sale proceeds are expected to be used largely to pay down US dollar loans and as a result these large US dollar inflows are not considered to create a significant currency exposure to the group.
The US dollar pounds sterling exchange rates at the respective year end were as follows: Year end exchange rate US$ : 30 September 2002 1.57 30 September 2001 1.47 63 easyJet plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Notes continued 21 Financial instruments continued 5 per cent of the total group costs in the year ended 30 September 2002 were incurred by easyJet Switzerland 2001: 9 per cent, whose functional currency is the Swiss Franc.
The costs of that business are translated into pounds sterling at average exchange rates for the purposes of inclusion into the consolidated profit and loss account, and the net assets at the year end exchange rate of the Swiss Franc against pounds sterling.
To a large extent, the exposure to the Swiss Franc is mitigated as revenue in that currency is also earned by the group.
The table below summarises the groups exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operation to which they relate.

However, there is no such formal policy on bank loans, which are now all at floating rates.

The loans are repayable in quarterly and six monthly instalments.
The majority of the groups financial assets comprise bank balances, which attract interest at the applicable money market deposit rates.
The group also pays operating lease rentals for the lease of aircraft.

Credit risk Potential concentrations comprise principally cash and trade debtors.
The majority of the groups trade debtors are represented by amounts due from a few well established credit card companies.
The cash balances are held with several major banks.
The credit ratings for the credit card companies and the banks do not suggest there to be significant exposure as a result of these concentrations.
Funding risk The most significant investment activity undertaken by the group historically has been the acquisition of aircraft.
To a large extent, these have been financed by asset-backed bank loans.
The group also sells and leases back the aircraft in certain cases to manage its funding risks.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities A comparison by category of book value and fair value of the groups financial assets and liabilities is provided in the table below.

The fair value of the bank loans that are subject to fixed rate interest terms is not considered to be materially different from their book value on the basis that the period over which the interest terms are fixed is relatively short and that the fixed interest terms are agreed on an arms length basis.
The fair value of cash approximates to its book value due to its immediate availability.
