Change in accounting policy Deferred tax The Group adopted FRS 19 Deferred Tax during the year, which requires that deferred tax is recognised in full in respect of timing differences.
Previously, deferred tax was provided where there was a reasonable probability that the asset or liability would crystallise in the foreseeable future.
Impact of accounting policy change As a result of this change in accounting policy, prior year figures have been restated.
The effects on the current and prior years are as follows: 2002 2001 m m Increase in tax 0.1 Decrease in retained profit 0.1 Increase in shareholders funds at 1st January 0.3 0.3 Increase in shareholders funds at 31st December 0.2 0.3 Increase in debtors 0.2 0.3 Increase in shareholders funds at 31st December 0.2 0.3 Decrease in earnings per share 0.1 p 2.

Borrowings and financial instruments The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The Groups financial instruments comprise cash, borrowings and other items arising directly from its trading operations which include long and short-term debtors, and long and short-term land, trade and other creditors.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the following analyses.
The Group has historically entered into derivative transactions in the form of interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity and interest rate risks.
i Liquidity risk The profile of the Groups borrowing facilities is representative of the nature of its activities, being a combination of medium and long-term projects.
During 1999 the Group reviewed its funding policy and took the decision to extend the average maturity of its facilities.
Accordingly, 40.0m of 10-year fixed debt was borrowed in 1999, and a further 40.0m of 10-year fixed debt was acquired during 2000.
The average annual interest rate on this debt is 7.2%.
At the year end 67% of the Groups borrowings were due to mature after more than 5 years.
The average maturity of the committed facilities was 3.4 years.
The Groups policy is to monitor current and forecast gearing levels with borrowings normally remaining within the level of the committed facilities.
ii Interest rate risks As at 31st December 2002, the Company had no interest rate swap arrangement for hedging purposes 2001: Nil.
Historically the Group has borrowed at floating rates of interest and then used interest rate swaps 64 Notes to the accounts Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 15.
Borrowings and financial instruments continued to generate the required interest profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations, based on cash flow and interest rate forecasts.
At 31st December 2002, 67% of the debt was at fixed rates.
The year end borrowings position was not typical due to the cyclical pattern of the receipts of both housing and property development completion monies throughout the year.
No interest is payable on long-term land creditors.
Bank borrowings are all unsecured with floating interest rates linked to money market rates: LIBOR, EBBR and base rate.
The floating rates are fixed in advance for periods generally ranging from one to three months.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft and short-term committed and uncommitted bank facilities.
Floating rate financial assets are linked to UK base rate.
The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, which are all sterling balances, at 31st December was: Group Group 2002 2001 m m Floating rate financial assets 15.3 4.2 Financial assets on which no interest is paid 0.2 15.5 4.2 Floating rate financial liabilities 39.8 60.0 Fixed rate financial liabilities 79.9 79.8 Financial liabilities on which no interest is paid 34.6 12.8 Gross financial liabilities 154.3 152.6 Financial assets comprise cash at bank of 2.3m 2001: 3.5m, fixed asset investments of 12.5m 2001: Nil and long-term trade debtors of 0.7m 2001: 0.7m.
The weighted average interest rate for the fixed rate financial liabilities was 7.2% for 2002 2001: 7.2%, with, at 31st December 2002, a weighted average period of 7.1 years 2001: 8.1 years for which the rate is fixed.
The weighted average period until maturity of the financial liabilities on which no interest is paid is 2.2 years 2001: 2.3 years.
iii Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity of the Groups financial liabilities at 31st December was as follows: Group Group 2002 2001 m m In one year or less or on demand 14.8 15.6 In more than one year but not more than two years 47.7 9.5 In more than two years but not more than five years 11.8 47.7 In more than five years 80.0 79.8 154.3 152.6 Included within the above are the following amounts relating to bank and other loans and overdrafts: Group Group 2002 2001 m m Bank overdrafts 14.8 15.6 Bank loans repayable otherwise than by instalments Amounts falling due: In more than one year but not more than two years 20.0 In more than two years but not more than five years 5.0 44.4 In five years or more 80.0 80.0 Less issue costs 0.1 0.2 Bank and other loans and overdrafts Note 14 119.7 139.8 Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 Notes to the accounts 65 Notes to the accounts continued 15.
Borrowings and financial instruments continued Loans repayable otherwise than by instalments falling due in five years or more are 80.0m of unquoted 10-year sterling loan notes, 40.0m of which are repayable in April 2009, with the balance repayable in October 2010.
These notes carry interest at an average rate of 7.2% and are unsecured.
iv Borrowing facilities The Group currently has sterling bank and other borrowing facilities amounting to 417.5m.
Committed facilities amount to 370.0m, of which 205.0m are available under short and medium-term committed lines.
All bank facilities are subject to floating interest rates linked to money market rates.
The terms of the 80.0m of long-term facilities are set out on pages 64 and 65.
The undrawn committed borrowing facilities available to the Group at 31st December, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met, had the following spread of maturity: Group Group 2002 2001 m m Expiring in one year or less 45.0 66.9 Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years 95.0 5.0 Expiring in more than two years 125.0 180.6 265.0 252.5 v Fair value of financial liabilities Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of the Groups financial liabilities: Group Group Group Group 2002 2002 2001 2001 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations: Short-term borrowings net of cash in hand 2.3m 2001: 3.5m 12.5 12.5 12.1 12.1 Medium-term borrowings 25.0 25.0 44.4 44.4 Long-term borrowings 79.9 85.4 79.8 84.7 Land creditors 34.6 34.6 12.8 12.8 Long-term debtors 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 151.3 156.8 148.4 153.3 The fair values of long-term borrowings have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
There is no material difference between the book value and the fair value of the Groups other financial assets and liabilities.
vi Gains and losses on financial liabilities held for hedging purposes The Groups policy is to hedge a proportion of interest rate risk using interest rate swaps.
Gains and losses on the interest rate swaps are recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which they occur.
