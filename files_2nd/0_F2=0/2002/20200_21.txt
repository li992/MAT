It provides an estimate of the repricing profile of the Groups assets, liabilities and other off-balance sheet exposures for non-trading activities.
For the major categories of assets and liabilities, the gap table shows the values of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which reprice within selected time bands.
Items are allocated to time bands by reference to the earlier of the next interest rate repricing date and the legal maturity date.
This leads to an apparent timing mismatch where the anticipated maturity date is different from the legal maturity date and hedges have been structured accordingly.
The positions shown reflect both the repricing behaviour of the administered rates on mortgage and savings products over which Abbey National has control and contracted wholesale on and off-balance sheet positions.
The tables do not purport to measure market risk exposure.

Loans and advances to personal customers are made both at variable and at fixed rates.
As there is no active secondary market in the UK for such loans and advances, there is no reliable market value available for such a significant portfolio.
However, if a market value could be ascertained, the directors believe it would reflect the expectation of a long term and continuing relationship with a majority of the customers.
Although substantial, this value is intangible and it cannot therefore be included in the fair value under SFAS 107.
Consequently the directors believe that, for the purposes of SFAS 107, the carrying value of the variable rate loans may be assumed to be their fair value.
Certain of the loans secured on residential properties are at a fixed rate for a limited period, typically two to five years from their commencement.
At the end of this period these loans revert to the relevant variable rate.
The excess of fair value over carrying value of each of these loans has been estimated by reference to the market rates available at 31 December 2002 for similar loans of maturity equal to the remaining fixed period.
