During 2002, FRS 19 Deferred Tax has been implemented by the Group.
This FRS requires deferred tax to be accounted for on a full provision basis, rather than a partial provision basis as in 2001 and earlier years.
This change has been accounted for as a prior year adjustment and comparative information has been restated as necessary.
