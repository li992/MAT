Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of certain land and buildings and are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The true and fair override provisions of the Companies Act 1985 have been invoked in respect of investment properties see page 57.
Change in accounting policy Financial Reporting Standard FRS 19, Deferred Tax, has been adopted with effect from 1 January 2002.
The adjusted accounting policy is that deferred tax be recognised on a full provision basis in accordance with the accounting policy described below.
Prior to 1 January 2002, deferred tax was provided using the liability method on all material timing differences to the extent that it was probable that the liability would crystallise.
The prior year comparatives have been restated to comply with FRS 19, resulting in a deferred tax provision of 16.5m at 31 December 2001.
The net effect on reserves of 11.8m includes an increase in the net book value of goodwill as at 31 December 2001 of 4.7m.
Due to the additional deferred tax provision on the Airport balance sheet at disposal, the profit on disposal for the year to 31 December 2001 is increased by 20.3m to 112.0m.
After an additional amortisation charge for the Group of 0.3m in 2001, the net effect is to increase the Groups profit after tax by 20.0m from 94.3m to 114.3m.
Basic earnings per share has been increased by 15.5p to 88.4p.
There was no impact on the prior year comparatives for the Company.
The Groups loss for the current year has been reduced by 6.0m and the Companys loss for the current year was increased by 0.1m as a result of the change in accounting policy.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of National Express Group PLC and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year.
No profit and loss account is presented for National Express Group PLC as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
On acquisition of a business, the acquisition method of accounting is adopted, and the Group profit and loss account includes the results of subsidiary and business undertakings purchased during the year from the date of acquisition as set out below.
Purchase consideration is allocated to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition.
On the sale of a business, the Group profit and loss account includes the results of that business to the date of disposal as set out below.
Business acquired Date of acquisition Stock Transportation Limited 4 July 2002 Business disposed Date of disposal Eurolines Nederland BV 2 August 2002 MultiSystems IT Division 15 August 2002 National Express Group Australia Bayside Trains Pty Limited trading as M Train 23 December 2002 National Express Group Australia Swanston Trams Pty Limited trading as M Tram 23 December 2002 National Express Group Australia V Line Passenger Pty Limited 23 December 2002 These companies were put into administration and receivership on 23 December 2002.
Undertakings, other than subsidiary undertakings, in which the Group has an investment representing not less than 20% of the voting rights and over which it exerts significant influence are treated as associates.
The Group accounts include the appropriate share of these associates results and reserves based on their latest accounts.
Goodwill In accordance with FRS 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, goodwill arising on acquisitions made after 1 January 1998 is capitalised within intangible fixed assets and amortised over its useful economic life up to a presumed maximum of 20 years or the life of the rail franchise, if shorter.
Goodwill in respect of acquisitions made prior to 1 January 1998 has been set off directly against reserves.
Fair value accounting adjustments are made in respect of acquisitions.
Fair value adjustments based on provisional estimates are amended in the following years accounts where necessary, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in order to refine adjustments to reflect further evidence gained post-acquisition.
56 National Express Group PLC 1 Accounting policies continued If a subsidiary, associate or business is subsequently sold or closed, any goodwill arising on acquisition that was written off directly to reserves or that has not been amortised through the profit and loss account is taken into account in determining the profit or loss on sale or closure.
Leased assets Assets held under hire purchase contracts and finance leases, which are those leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Group, are capitalised in the balance sheet as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over their useful economic lives.
The capital element of future obligations under hire purchase contracts and finance leases is included as a liability in the balance sheet.
The interest element of rental obligations is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Stock Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowance for obsolete or slow moving items.
Investment properties Certain of the Groups properties are held for long-term investment.
Investment properties are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP 19, Accounting for Investment Properties, whereby investment properties are revalued annually and the aggregate surplus or deficit is transferred to a revaluation reserve unless a deficit, or its reversal, on an individual investment property is expected to be permanent, in which case it is recognised in the profit and loss account for the year: and no depreciation or amortisation is provided in respect of investment properties.
Although the Companies Act 1985 would normally require the systematic annual depreciation of fixed assets, the Directors believe that this policy of not providing depreciation or amortisation is necessary in order for the accounts to give a true and fair view, since the current value of investment properties, and changes in that current value, are of prime importance rather than a calculation of systematic annual depreciation.
Depreciation or amortisation is only one of the many factors reflected in the annual valuation, and the amount which might otherwise have been shown cannot be separately identified or quantified.
Tangible fixed assets Investment properties and freehold land are not depreciated.
Other tangible assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Short leasehold properties over the period of the lease Long leasehold properties 15 to 40 years Freehold buildings 30 to 50 years Airport buildings, runways, etc 50 years Infrastructure assets 10 to 14 years Public service vehicles 2 to 15 years Plant and equipment 3 to 10 years The Group has followed the transitional provisions in FRS 15, Tangible Fixed Assets, and will not revalue properties in the future, although as permitted by the standard, properties that have been revalued in the past have been retained at their existing book value.
The last valuation was at 31 December 1995.
Pension costs Pension costs are recognised on a systematic basis so that the costs of providing retirement benefits to employees are evenly matched, so far as is possible, to the service lives of the employees concerned.
Any excess or deficiency of the actuarial value of assets over the actuarial value of liabilities of the pension scheme is allocated over the average remaining service lives of current employees.
Differences between the amount charged in the profit and loss account and payments made to schemes are treated as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet.
National Express Group PLC 57 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies continued Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all material timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is considered more likely than not in that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Pre-contract costs Pre-contract costs associated with securing new rail franchises are expensed as incurred, except where it is virtually certain that a franchise will be awarded, in which case they are recognised as an asset and are expensed to the profit and loss account over the life of the franchise.
Costs associated with the commencement of new contracts are expensed as incurred.
Insurance The Groups policy is to self-insure high frequency, low value claims within the businesses.
To provide protection above these types of losses, the Group purchases insurance cover from a selection of proven and financially strong insurers.
These insurance policies provide individual claim cover subject to excess limits and aggregate stop losses for total claims within the excess limits.
A provision is made for the estimated cost to the Group to settle claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date, subject to the overall stop loss.
Foreign currencies Group The trading results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling using average rates of exchange for the year.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end and exchange differences arising are taken directly to reserves.
All other translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account, with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts which are used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in foreign enterprises.
These are taken directly to reserves.
The most significant exchange rates to the pound for the Group are as follows: 2002 2002 2001 2001 Closing rate Average rate Closing rate Average rate US dollar 1.61 1.51 1.46 1.44 Australian dollar 2.86 2.78 2.84 2.80 Canadian dollar 2.54 2.47 Company Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end except where forward cover has been arranged, in which case the forward rate is used.
Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Any exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the profit and loss account, with the exception of differences arising on the translation of foreign currency equity investments, and on foreign currency borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts which are used to finance or provide a hedge against these investments.
Derivatives and other financial instruments The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate exposures and fuel swaps to hedge fuel price exposures.
The Group considers these derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting when certain criteria are met.
The Groups criteria for these swaps are that the instrument must be related to an asset, liability or future obligation, and it must change the character of the interest rate or fuel price by converting a variable rate to a fixed rate or vice versa.
Differentials are recognised by accruing the net interest or fuel cost payable.
These swaps are not revalued to fair value or shown on the Group balance sheet at the year end.
58 National Express Group PLC 2 Turnover and segmental analysis The turnover of the Group comprises revenue from road passenger transport, train passenger services, airport operations and related activities in the UK, North America and Australia.
Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and sales tax.
Due to the nature of the Groups businesses, the origin and destination of turnover is the same.
Within the Trains division, franchise agreement receipts from the Strategic Rail Authority SRA and local Passenger Transport Executives within the West Midlands region and Scotland are treated as turnover.
During the year, annual franchise agreement receipts amounted to 634.9m 2001: 554.8m in the UK and 62.5m 2001: 56.0m from the Victoria Department of Public Transport in Australia.
The goodwill impairment charge for 2002 relates to Australia bus.

The earnings are unremitted as they are continually reinvested by the Group, and therefore no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing property or intangible assets or on the sale of property or intangible assets where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
The total amount unprovided is 5.4m 2001: 5.4m.
Such tax would become payable only if the property or intangible was sold without it being possible to claim further rollover relief and this is not expected to occur in the foreseeable future.
In the overseas subsidiaries, the potential deferred tax assets exceed the deferred tax liabilities.
There is no recognition of the deferred tax assets in relation to the excess on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence to determine that it is recoverable.
The total amount of deferred tax assets that the Group has not recognised in the accounts amount to 23.6m 2001: 8.0m.
9 Loss attributable to shareholders of the parent company The loss attributable to shareholders of the parent company was 89.8m 2001: 227.3m loss.

Basic loss earnings per share is calculated by dividing the loss for the financial period of 105.3m 2001: 114.4m profit restated by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue in the period, excluding those held by employees share ownership trusts which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
For 2002, the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of calculating the diluted loss per share is identical to that used for the basic loss per share.
This is because the adjustment for dilutive potential ordinary shares would have the effect of reducing the loss per ordinary share and is therefore not dilutive under the terms of FRS 14 Earnings per Share.
The reconciliation of weighted average number of ordinary shares is detailed as follows: Number Number of shares of shares 2002 2001 Basic weighted average shares 131,602,152 129,457,561 Adjustment for dilutive potential ordinary shares 5,622,274 8,852,402 Diluted weighted average shares 137,224,426 138,309,963 The normalised diluted earnings per share has been calculated in addition to the basic and diluted earnings per shares required by FRS 14 since, in the opinion of the Directors, it reflects the financial performance of the core business more appropriately.
The normalised diluted earnings per share for the years ended 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001 exclude the earnings from discontinued operations, with 2001 earnings restated to exclude earnings from operations discontinued in 2002.
They have not been adjusted to reflect the interest earned on the cash proceeds from the disposal of the discontinued operations.

12 Intangible assets Goodwill arising on all acquisitions, except Prism, is amortised evenly over the Directors estimate of their useful economic life of 20 years.

The carrying value of goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Australia bus businesses has been reviewed at 31 December 2002 by reference to its value in use to the Group.
The value in use was calculated using future expected cash flow projections, discounted at 9% on a pre-tax basis, and is not intended to reflect a realisable value on disposal.
The review has resulted in an impairment of 13.5m 2001: nil to goodwill.
The Directors have reviewed the valuation of the Groups investment properties at 31 December 2002 and are of the opinion that the open market value of these properties at 31 December 2002 is fairly stated in these accounts.

The assets of all schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Contributions to the schemes are determined by independent professionally qualified actuaries.
A summary of the latest full actuarial valuations, and assumptions made, is as follows: Buses Buses Travel West Trains Trains Tayside Midlands Coaches long-term short-term Date of actuarial valuation 31 March 2002 31 March 2001 5 April 2001 31 December 2001 31 December 2001 Actuarial method used Attained age Attained age Projected unit Projected unit Projected unit Rate of investment returns per annum 5.4% 5.6%6.5% 5.5%6.5% 5.5%6.3% 5.5%6.3% Increase in earnings per annum 4.1% 4.0% 4.3% 4.0% 4.0% Scheme assets taken at market value 36.2m 352.1m 13.8m 128.7m 555.8m Funding level 107% 119% 67% 89%108% 94%109% A lump sum of 5.0m was paid into the coaches scheme on 11 March 2003 in order to improve the funding position.
Future contributions will be adjusted accordingly to eliminate any actuarially calculated funding shortfalls.
The range of funding levels for Trains reflects the range of funding levels in the various sections of the RPS.
b North America bus and Australia divisions Subsidiaries in North America contribute to a number of defined contribution plans.
The Australia subsidiaries contribute to a number of pension schemes providing benefits both on a defined benefit and defined contribution basis.
The principal defined benefit schemes were within the Australia trains division for 2001 and 2002.
They are State run and comprise a large number of participating companies which are not controlled by the Group.
In accordance with the franchise agreements, the Group is not responsible for any shortfall in funding prior to the date when the franchises were awarded.
Since the exit of the Group from the Australia trains division on 23 December 2002, no further liability exists in respect of these schemes.
c FRS 17, Retirement Benefits The Accounting Standards Board ASB has deferred the full mandatory adoption of FRS 17 following an announcement by the International Accounting Standards Board that it is to review IAS 19, the current international accounting standard for retirement benefits.
Currently, FRS 17 has to be applied to disclosures only.
This is the second year that disclosures have been made for the Group under FRS 17, and this year extends to performance information for the first time.
The additional disclosures required by FRS 17 during the transitional period for the Bus, Coach and Train divisions defined benefit schemes are set out below.
They are based on the most recent actuarial valuations disclosed above, which have been updated by independent professionally qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements of FRS 17.
In respect of the Australia State-run multi-employer schemes for the train companies, the Group has been unable to identify its share of underlying assets and liabilities in these schemes on a consistent and reasonable basis, and therefore has treated them as if they were defined contribution schemes.
The six UK train franchises ScotRail Railways Limited, Central Trains Limited, Silverlink Train Services Limited, Wales and West Passenger Trains Limited, Cardiff Railway Company Limited and West Anglia Great Northern Railway Limited which expire in 2004 are shown separately as short term in the disclosures below.
