Where the Group is required to undertake research and development activities and the fee is creditable against services provided by the Group, that licence fee is deferred and recognised over the period over which the services are performed.
Contract research fees are recognised in the accounting period in which the related work is carried out.
Access fees and milestones receivable are recognised when they fall contractually due.
Profit is recognised on long-term contracts when the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty by including in the profit and loss account, turnover and related costs as contract activity progresses.

The second smallpox vaccine contract with the US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention CDC is a fixed fee arrangement requiring the delivery of products as well as a concurrent research and development R&D programme.
This arrangement has been treated as a single long-term contract, whose elements have not been accounted for separately.
Turnover and profits are recognised according to the stage reached in the contract, as described above.
Manufacturing costs are deemed to be incurred on delivery of products: R&D costs are recognised as incurred.
Cost of sales The Group has classified costs which are directly attributable to funded research and vaccine manufacture programmes as cost of sales.
Certain research and development costs were, in prior years, classified as R&D expenditure.
The Directors believe that the new classification more appropriately reflects the nature of the arrangements the Group has entered into.
This reclassification has been applied to the two CDC smallpox vaccine contracts.
The financial information for 2001 and 2000 has been re-presented so that cost classifications are shown on a comparable basis.
The monetary impact of this re-classification in 2001 and 2000 is 5.1m and 0.5m respectively, which was previously included within R&D costs.

Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.

20 Financial instruments 11 The Groups financial instruments comprise primarily cash and liquid resources, a long-term finance lease, an overdraft facility and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors, that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide working capital for the Groups operations.
The Group holds funds in both US dollars and sterling.
The Groups current policy is to hold surplus funds in sterling over the long term, which currently achieves a higher interest rate return, whilst also mitigating exchange rate exposure.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of 2000.
All of the Groups short-term debtors and creditors are excluded from these disclosures, other than currency risk disclosures.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations predominantly through cash, liquid resources and lease financing.
It is the Groups policy to invest surplus cash in money market funds, managed by professional money managers.
The performance of the funds invested is reviewed by the Board on a regular basis to ensure that competitive rates of return are being achieved.
The Board reviews regularly the financing facilities available to the Group to ensure competitive rates of interest are being obtained.
Liquidity risk The Board monitors the level of cash and liquid resources on a regular basis, and management on a daily basis, to ensure that the Group has sufficient liquid funds THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS COLUMN to enable it to continue as a going concern.
This is achieved through the production and review of cash forecasts, including sensitivity analyses.
The Groups liquid HAS NOT BEEN AUDITED.
31 resources are managed on a discretionary basis by a third party within strict parameters, which have been set by the Board.
32 NOTES TO GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2002 20 Financial instruments continued Foreign currency risk The Group has one principal subsidiary that operates and trades overseas Acambis Inc.
It operates in the US and its revenues, expenses and financing are denominated principally in US dollars.
The Group has a US dollar-denominated overdraft facility, as described in note 18, which is held in the UK and is subject to exchange rate movements.
These are recognised as incurred.
In addition, the Group has other current assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which the Board does not consider to be significant.
The tables below show the extent to which Group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currency.

The majority of these resources are invested in managed funds, denominated in sterling and US dollars, and are available for use with a days notice.
During 2002, these funds achieved weighted average returns of 4.1% 2001 5.4% for funds invested in UK sterling, and 1.9% 2001 4.7% for funds invested in US dollars.
The Group also holds shares in Medivir AB see note 14 b.
This investment does not subject the Group to interest rate risk as it has no maturity date.
Financial liabilities The Groups overdraft facility, which is denominated in US dollars and is underwritten by PowderJect, is explained in note 18.
At 31 December 2002, the Group had fully utilised the overdraft facility 2001 fully utilised.
Interest on the facility is charged at 0.35% per annum above the bank-lending rate for US dollars.
During 2002, the weighted average interest payable on the facility was 2.0% 2001 4.5%.
The only other financial liability of the Group at 31 December 2002 was a long-term lease-finance facility, which matures within four years.
This $40m c. 25m leasefinance facility, arranged through Baxter International, Inc. Baxter, was approved by shareholders in December 2001.
The Group secured financing of $10m c. 6.8m for the sale-and-leaseback of the land and shell of the manufacturing plant, and up to $25m c. 17m to lease-finance the capital expenditure items purchased to reactivate the manufacturing plant.
In December 2001, the Group received $18.6m c. 12.8m, which represented $8.6m c. 6.0m in respect of capital expenditure already incurred throughout 2001, plus $10m c. 6.8m representing the net proceeds from sale-and-leaseback of the land and shell of the building.
To facilitate this transaction, the land and shell were purchased for $2.3m c. 1.5m.
This amount is included in the outstanding facility.
During 2002, no further draw downs were made from the facility, although interest of $1.7m 1.1m accrued during the year and has converted into the capital balance owing on the facility.
The financing has been reflected in the financial statements as a long-term creditor.
During 2002, interest was charged to the facility at 3% above the prime rate of Banc One Corporation, a USbased bank, resulting in an interest charge of 1.1m 2001 0.03m being added to the facility.
From January 2003, the interest percentage payable in respect of the facility has been fixed at 6.25% until the end of the life of the lease.
The repayment schedule for the lease financing requires that no interest or capital were repayable during 2002, interest only need be repaid in 2003 and capital and interest are repayable over 2004 to 2006.
The Group has an option to repurchase all of the facilitys assets from the end of 2003, and on each anniversary thereafter, for the capital balance outstanding at that time, plus any accrued but unpaid interest due at the time, plus a make-whole payment discounted to present value equal to the projected future interest stream payable to the end of the lease term.
At 31 December 2002, the balance on this facility was $22.5m 14.0m, resulting in $17.5m c. 10.9m not being used at that time 2001 $19.2m.

The sub-lease expires in September 2003, and provides that Medivir UK Limited will pay Acambis 0.3m per annum in operating lease rentals relating to land and buildings.
In September 1999, the Group entered a further sub-lease with Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in respect of 25% of the facility at 38 Sidney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.
This sub-lease expired in December 2002 at which point Acambis re-occupied all of this space.
b Capital commitments At the end of the year, capital commitments contracted but not provided for were 0.1m 2001 6.4m.
c Pension arrangements The Group provides pension benefits to all full-time employees on a defined contribution basis.
The Company operates a self-administered, Inland Revenue-approved pension scheme for UK Executive Directors.
Other employees may operate private personal pension schemes.
In the US the Group offers a 401k Savings and Retirement Plan for all employees, including Executive Directors.
The Group pension cost including 401k costs for the year was 0.5m 2001 0.2m.
At the year-end, the Group owed 0.2m 2001 0.01m to the pension schemes.
This amount is shown in the balance sheet under Creditors: amounts falling due within one year.
27 Related party transactions 7b Under the provisions of FRS 8, Related Party Disclosures, it is not necessary to disclose related party transactions between the Company, Acambis Research Limited and Acambis Inc. because they are eliminated on preparation of the Groups financial statements.
As described in note 14 d, the Group has an interest in the Joint Venture.
Since May 1999, Acambis has performed a pre-agreed work programme on behalf of the Joint Venture.
Costs incurred by the Group on behalf of the Joint Venture and corresponding turnover received from the Joint Venture have been included in the Groups financial statements.
For the year ended 31 December 2002, the Group has included turnover of 0.3m 2001 0.5m in respect of costs incurred in performing services for the Joint Venture within its Group financial statements.
50% of the loss incurred by Pasteur Mrieux-OraVax in 2002, amounting to 0.2m 2001 0.4m, is shown on the face of the Group profit and loss account on page 18.
At 31 December 2002, the amounts the Group owed to the Joint Venture amounted to nil 2001 0.5m.
Amounts owed by the Joint Venture to the Group at 31 December 2002 were nil 2001 nil.
In 2002, the Group took the view that, taking into account the increase in its shareholding in Acambis and the presence of a representative from Baxter on the Board, Baxters influence on Acambis became significant, and therefore Baxter is a related party.
Baxters subscriptions in the shares of the Company are set out in note C on page 21, and the Groups long-term lease-finance facility with Baxter is described within Financial liabilities in note 20.
The Group made sales to Baxter of 0.7m in 2002 2001 nil, of which 0.7m 2001 nil was unpaid at the year-end, and made purchases of goods and services from Baxter of 45.7m 2001 nil, of which 42.7m 2001 nil was unpaid at the year-end.
28 Post balance sheet events Under a prior agreement with BTG International Limited BTG, Acambis was required to pay to BTG an annual turnover tax of 2% of the Groups gross turnover on an ongoing basis.
Following a decision by the High Court of Justice Queens Bench Division in the UK in February 2003, it was confirmed that this turnover tax covers all subsidiaries of the Company.
This decision has no effect on the financial statements of the Group.
On 27 March 2003, Baxter International, Inc. accelerated its fourth and final subscription of equity shares from the original subscription date of no later than 1 June 2003.
These shares were traded from 27 March 2003.
This subscription of 4.6 million shares at a subscription amount of 7.0m increased Baxters shareholding in the Company to 20.6%.
37 38 NOTES TO GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2002 29 Reconciliation to US accounting principles Summary of significant differences between UK GAAP followed by the Group and US GAAP Compensation costs under variable The Groups financial statements have been prepared under UK GAAP, which differs in certain respects from US GAAP.
The principal differences between the Groups plan accounting for stock options accounting policies under UK GAAP and US GAAP are set out below.
and SAYE plan discount Under US GAAP, a company is Revenue recognition required to put a charge through its Revenues represent sales and income derived from product sales, licence fees, contract research fees and development milestone payments.
Under UK GAAP, these profit and loss account for share revenues are recognised using the accounting policies as set out in note 1.
The Directors have selected the accounting policies they believe to be the most appropriate options not yet exercised but that in the circumstances, as required by FRS 18 Accounting Policies.
In making this judgment, they have taken into account recent publications by the Accounting are likely to be exercised.
The Standards Board ASB, specifically the discussion paper entitled Revenue Recognition and the proposed additional application note to FRS 5, Substance of charge is calculated as the Transactions.
difference between the market value of the shares at the year-end For US purposes, the Group adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB 101 with effect from 1 January 2000. and the exercise price.
Licence fees Prior to 2001, under UK GAAP, certain licence fees were recognised when paid, where such payments were not refundable.
Following the Groups adoption of SAB101 under US GAAP, where licence fees are not refundable and are not creditable against associated R&D activities, these fees are considered inseparable from the associated R&D effort.
As such, those licence fees are deferred and recognised over the period of the licence term or over the period of the R&D agreement.
Multiple element arrangements In November 2001, Acambis was awarded a second contract by the CDC.
This contract is divided into two principal components: to manufacture 155 million doses of smallpox vaccine: and to take the vaccine through clinical trials to US Food and Drug Administration FDA licensure.
Under UK GAAP, this contract has been accounted for as a single-element arrangement.
Under US GAAP, the Group treats this contract as a multiple element arrangement resulting in a different allocation of revenue compared to the UK GAAP treatment.
The Group has determined the fair value of the development and manufacturing portions of the contract and has allocated the total contract value to the development and manufacturing using the relative fair value method as prescribed by Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No.
00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.
The development portion of the contract consists of the completion of Phase I II clinical trials, completion of Phase III clinical trials including completion and submission of a Biologics Licenses Application with the FDA and post FDA approval activities.
The manufacturing portion consists of the manufacture and delivery of smallpox vaccine to the CDC.
The Group recognises revenue for each significant development activity on a straight-line basis over the expected duration of each respective activity unrelated to the costs incurred over that period: this contrasts with the UK GAAP treatment, where revenues are recognised as costs are incurred, using the principles of long-term contract accounting.
The Group recognises revenue on the manufacturing portion of the contract as smallpox vaccine is delivered to the CDC and all risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the CDC.
Costs associated with expected re-labelling to be undertaken in the future are being accrued as smallpox vaccine is delivered to the CDC.
Costs and revenue associated with providing storage or vaccine disposal services are only included when, and if, it is deemed probable that such services will be performed.
Compensation costs under variable plan accounting for stock options and SAYE plan discount Acambis has granted stock options to employees that will vest upon the attainment of certain targets.
Under UK GAAP, there is no accounting for these grants after the initial grant date.
Under US GAAP, APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB25, the Company would be required to follow variable plan accounting for these grants and measure compensation expense as the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the stock during each accounting period over the vesting period of the options.
Increases in fair market value of the stock would result in a charge to operations and decreases in the fair market value of the stock would result in a credit to operations, subject to the cumulative amount previously expensed.
Under UK GAAP, Acambis has taken advantage of the exemption provided by UITF 17, not to recognise any compensation charge in respect of options granted under SAYE plans.
Under US GAAP, in accounting for new offers made since 24 January 2002, Acambis would follow the requirements of pronouncement EITF 00-23 Issues relating to the Accounting for Stock Compensation under APB25 and FIN44 Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation Number FIN 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, FIN44 which does not permit such an exemption in respect of plans with certain characteristics.
The compensation charge under US GAAP in respect of such plans would be calculated as the difference between the market price of the shares at the date of grant and the exercise price of the option and would be recorded on a straight-line basis over the savings period.
The table below shows the additional charge or credit that would have been made to the Group profit and loss account under US GAAP.
Year ended 31 December 2002 2001 2000 000 000 000 Charged to the Group profit and loss account 1,212 5,210 312 Provision against own shares held Under UK GAAP, own shares held by the Acambis Employees Trustees Limited are accounted for as fixed asset investments and provisions made against these investments to reduce them to the recoverable amount are charged in the profit and loss account.
Under US GAAP, own shares are recorded at cost, are not reviewed for impairment and are accounted for within shareholders equity.
Purchase price accounting for in-process R&D and goodwill amortisation During 1999, Acambis acquired Acambis Inc.
Under both UK GAAP and US GAAP, goodwill is identified as being the amount that the fair value of the consideration exceeds the fair value of assets acquired.
However, under UK GAAP no value is attributed to in-process R&D, which is not the case under US GAAP.
Under US GAAP, in accordance with APB Opinion No.
17, Intangible Assets, in-process R&D is separately identified and analysed to determine the fair market value at the date of acquisition.
In-process R&D is identified in accordance with the definition within Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No.
2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs.
Following identification of qualifying R&D projects, their value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in-process R&D into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value.
As a result of the valuation of in-process R&D under US GAAP, the fair value of assets acquired is different from that calculated under UK GAAP, resulting in differing values of goodwill.
The table below shows the difference in the goodwill calculation and the associated amortisation charge in the Group profit and loss account.
Under US GAAP, in-process R&D is written off to the profit and loss account when incurred.
Under UK GAAP, Acambis amortises goodwill on a straight-line basis over an estimate of the time the Group is expected to benefit from it.
Until 1 January 2002, this was also Acambis accounting policy under US GAAP.
Following the provisions of SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142, the carrying value of goodwill in US GAAP was frozen and became subject to annual impairment reviews.
The transitional impairment review carried out on adoption of SFAS 142 did not reveal any indication of impairment.
Year ended 31 December 2002 Year ended 31 December 2001 UK GAAP US GAAP UK GAAP US GAAP 000 000 000 000 Goodwill on acquisition included on balance sheet cost 18,055 6,155 18,055 6,155 Amortisation brought forward 3,210 1,094 2,006 684 Amortisation charged to Group profit and loss account for the year 1,204 - 1,204 410 Goodwill net book value 13,641 5,061 14,845 5,061 Capitalisation of interest Under UK GAAP, Acambis accounting policy is that interest is not capitalised.
US GAAP would require interest incurred as part of the cost of constructing fixed assets to be capitalised and amortised over the life of the asset.
39 40 NOTES TO GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2002 29 Reconciliation to US accounting principles continued Reconciliation of net loss from UK GAAP to US GAAP Based on the differences detailed above, the following table shows the reconciliation of the Groups net loss for the past three years: Year ended 31 December 2002 2001 2000 000 000 000 Net profit loss as reported under UK GAAP 9,575 12,427 11,074 Adjustments for: Revenue recognition 24,124 1,995 570 Compensation costs credit under variable plan accounting for stock options and SAYE plan discount 1,212 5,210 312 Provision against own shares held 420 -- Amortisation charge for goodwill 1,204 794 794 Capitalisation of interest 560 - - Net loss as reported under US GAAP before cumulative effect of accounting change 13,577 14,848 11,162 Cumulative effect of accounting change: revenue recognition - - 2,572 Net loss as reported under US GAAP after cumulative effect of accounting change 13,577 14,848 13,734 Loss per share under US GAAP Under US GAAP, the Group would compute loss per share under SFAS No.
Under SFAS 128, basic net loss per ordinary share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Under US GAAP, diluted net loss per ordinary share for Acambis is the same as basic net loss per ordinary share, as the effects of the Companys potential ordinary share equivalents are anti-dilutive.
Under UK GAAP the basis of calculation is the same.
Because the Group has recorded a net profit under UK GAAP, certain securities which are dilutive under UK GAAP are anti-dilutive under US GAAP.
The net loss per share under US GAAP is presented below: Year ended 31 December 2002 2001 2000 000 000 000 Basic loss per ordinary share in pence before cumulative effect of accounting change 14.1 16.3 14.0 Basic loss per share in pence of cumulative effect of accounting change - - 3.2 Basic loss per share in pence 14.1 16.3 17.2 Shares used in computing basic loss per ordinary share 96,101,507 91,027,463 79,638,484 Diluted loss per ordinary share in pence 14.1 16.3 17.2 Shares used in computing diluted loss per ordinary share 96,101,507 91,027,463 79,638,484 Anti-dilutive securities, not included above 3,100,226 2,294,366 1,565,251 Anti-dilutive securities represent stock options outstanding, which have not been included in the calculation of loss per ordinary share as the impact of including such shares in the calculation of loss per share would be anti-dilutive.
Income and expense transactions with the same party In accordance with EITF Issue 02-16, Accounting by a Reseller for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor, certain transactions with the same party, which are shown gross under UK GAAP, are netted under US GAAP.
These adjustments have no impact on net income.
The individual line items affected are cost of sales which under US GAAP in 2002 is 48.0m and R&D costs included within operating expenses 2002 21.5m.
Discontinued operations As discussed in note 4, the Group completed the disposal of its interest in its drug discovery business, Mimetrix, during 2000.
Under US GAAP, the operating results of discontinued operations should be reported separately in a single caption after income from continuing operations, net of income tax effects, for all periods presented.
This presentation difference has no impact on the net loss for the periods presented.
Reconciliation of shareholders equity from UK GAAP to US GAAP As at 31 December 2002 2001 2000 000 000 000 Shareholders equity as reported under UK GAAP 46,251 27,660 36,139 Goodwill 8,580 9,784 10,578 Revenue recognition cumulative 25,272 1,147 3,142 Capitalisation of interest 560 -- Reclassification of net book value of investment in Group shares 797 1,252 1,445 Shareholders equity as reported under US GAAP 12,162 15,477 20,974 Group statement of cash flows The Group statement of cash flows prepared under UK GAAP presents substantially the same information as that required under US GAAP by SFAS No.
These standards differ, however, with regard to classification of items within the statements and the definition of cash and cash equivalents.
Under UK GAAP, cash comprises only cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand.
Deposits are repayable on demand if they can be withdrawn at any time without notice and without penalty or if a maturity or period of notice of not more than 24 hours or one working day has been agreed.
Under US GAAP, cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments, with a maturity of three months or less at inception, that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates.
Under UK GAAP, cash flows are presented separately for operating activities, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investment, management of liquid resources and financing activities.
US GAAP requires only three categories of cash flow activity to be reported: operating, investing and financing.
Cash flows from taxation and returns on investments and servicing of finance under UK GAAP would, with the exception of dividends paid, be shown under operating activities under US GAAP.
The payment of dividends and the payment to acquire own shares treasury stock would be included as a financing activity under US GAAP.
Management of liquid resources under UK GAAP would be included as cash and cash equivalents under US GAAP to the extent that the amounts involved have a maturity of less than three months and are convertible into known amounts of cash.
Summary statements of cash flow presented under US GAAP are given below: Year ended 31 December 2002 2001 2000 000 000 000 Net cash used in operating activities 5,459 6,968 8,782 Net cash used in investing activities 11,460 5,803 4,488 Net cash provided by used in financing activities 7,740 16,987 12,819 Effect of foreign exchange on cash and cash equivalents 1,242 -- Decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents 10,421 15,822 451 Opening cash and cash equivalents 22,093 6,271 6,722 Closing cash and cash equivalents 11,672 22,093 6,271 Statement of other comprehensive income 2002 2001 2000 000 000 000 Net loss 13,577 14,848 13,734 Other comprehensive income: foreign currency translation adjustment net of tax 1,276 314 817 Total comprehensive income 12,301 15,162 14,551 41 42 NOTES TO GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2002 29 Reconciliation to US accounting principles continued Recently issued pronouncements In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No.
146, Accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities SFAS 146.
SFAS Further information required 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF 94-3, Liability recognition for certain employee by Form 20-F termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring.
SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with This section contains the an exit or disposal activity be recognised when the liability is incurred.
Under EITF 94-3, a liability for an exit cost was recognised at the date of the commitment to an information that the US Securities exit plan.
SFAS 146 states that a commitment to a plan, by itself, does not create an obligation that meets the definition of a liability.
Therefore, SFAS 146 eliminates the and Exchange Commission requires definition and requirement for recognition of exit costs in EITF 94-3.
It also established that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability.
SFAS 146 is in a Form 20-F that does not appear to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after 31 December 2002.
Management does not expect the adoption of SFAS 146 to have a material elsewhere in our Annual Report.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation Number FIN No.
45, Guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others FIN 45.
FIN 45 requires the guarantor to recognise, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee.
It also elaborates on the disclosure to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligation under certain guarantees that it has issued and to be made in regard of product warranties.
The initial recognition and movement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after 31 December 2002, while the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after 15 December 2002.
Management does not expect the adoption of FIN 45 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables Issue 00-21.
This addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue-generating activities.
Specifically, Issue 00-21 addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement.
The provisions of Issue 00-21 are effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after 15 June 2003, with early application permitted.
Management have applied the provisions of EITF 00-21 to existing multiple element arrangements.

FURTHER INFORMATION REQUIRED BY FORM 20-F unaudited Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 4b Overview The financial statements contained within this Annual Report and Form 20-F have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
A reconciliation to US GAAP is set out in note 29 to the financial statements.
The principal differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP accounting arise on revenue recognition timing differences which has resulted in lower revenue being recorded under US GAAP in 2002 which will reverse in 2003 and 2004, accounting for stock options and the treatment of goodwill.
These differences are described within note 29 to the financial statements.
Critical accounting policies The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of net assets at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period.
Critical accounting policies are those that have a significant impact on the Group's results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management.
For a full description of our accounting policies please refer to note 1.
Our critical accounting policies include the following: Revenue recognition Revenue on long-term contracts is recognised according to estimates by management of the progress of the contract and the estimated total costs.
This requires that the extent of progress towards completion of contracts may be estimated with reasonable certainty.
Revisions in these estimates may cause the Group's revenues to fluctuate from period to period.
The Group's US GAAP revenue recognition accounting policy for multiple element arrangements, which is described more fully on page 38, requires the determination of the fair value of the individual elements of multiple element arrangements and the allocation of the total contract value amongst the elements identified using the relative fair value method.
Under the Group's UK GAAP accounting policy, contracts are accounted for as long-term contracts and are only segmented into multiple elements where the Group is capable of attributing a reliable fair value to each element by reference to individual transactions which might be the case, for instance, where separate tenders were submitted for each element.
The Group therefore makes significant judgments in determining whether a particular multiple element arrangement is capable of segmentation under the requirements of US GAAP and following best practice under UK GAAP.
Where, under US GAAP, segmentation is required, significant assumptions are made in selecting appropriate similar contracts to provide evidence of the fair value of the individual elements.
Changes in estimates of fair value of elements in an arrangement would have a significant impact on the timing of revenue recognition.
Differences in revenue recognition policies under UK GAAP and US GAAP give rise to a significant reconciling adjustment.
The size and direction of this reconciling amount in the reconciliation of UK to US GAAP net income will vary considerably from period to period based on the nature of contract activity in the period.
Deferred tax The Group has significant brought forward operating losses in a particular tax jurisdiction, against which, at 31 December 2002, the Group has maintained a full valuation allowance.
In determining the appropriateness of this valuation allowance, estimates are made of the Group's ability to use these losses, based on the estimated taxable profit or loss in that jurisdiction, which include estimates of future revenues and costs, as well as the jurisdiction in which they will arise.
Revisions in these estimates may cause the valuation allowance recorded and the Group's tax charge to fluctuate from period to period.
Valuation of long-lived assets and goodwill Depreciation and amortisation rates are determined based on management estimates of the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned.
The most appropriate life is determined separately for each asset on acquisition, subject to prescribed ranges of asset lives, as disclosed in note 1 to the financial statements.
Changes to the useful lives selected could have a material impact on the Group's net profit.
The Group assesses the carrying value of long-lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable.
When we determine that the carrying value of long-lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable, we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model.
This review is based upon our projections of anticipated timing and amount of future cash flows and appropriate discount rates.
While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, such estimates and assumptions could differ materially from actual results and accordingly result in a material impact on the carrying value of long-lived assets and goodwill.
5a Results of operations 5d The information contained within the financial review on pages 14 and 15 covers the results for the year ended 31 December 2002 prepared under UK GAAP compared to the prior year ended 31 December 2001.
The following information compares the results under UK GAAP for the year ended 31 December 2001 to the prior year ended 31 December 2000, and the Groups financial position at 31 December 2002 and 2001.
2001 year versus 2000 year The financial results for the year 2000 include data for the three-month period ended 31 March 2000 for the discontinued operation of Mimetrix Limited.
Turnover for the year 2001 was 8.9m 2000 6.3m, which comprised R&D funding primarily from ongoing contracts with the CDC and Aventis Pasteur.
The increase in revenues reflects a full year of revenue receivable from the first contract with the CDC in 2001 compared to only three months in 2000.
5c Expenditure on R&D increased in 2001 to 17.7m 2000 12.7m.
There was an increase in the number of product programmes, each of which has continued to advance towards the next stage of development and or clinical trials.
Our share of the expenditure on the H. pylori joint venture with Aventis Pasteur was lower in 2001 at 0.4m 2000 2.1m, as expenditure on the project was largely restricted to continuing a number of small clinical trials.
43 44 FURTHER INFORMATION REQUIRED BY FORM 20-F unaudited Results of operations continued Administrative costs increased during 2001 to 3.5m 2000 2.9m, primarily as a result of expansion of the Companys activities, in particular the reactivation of the manufacturing facility.
Administrative costs include 1.2m 2000 1.2m of amortisation of the goodwill which arose as a result of the acquisition of Acambis Inc. in 1999.
Interest receivable decreased marginally to 0.9m in 2001 2000 1.0m, primarily as a result of lower rates of interest available in the period.
Interest payable of 0.2m 2000 0.2m, relating entirely to the Arilvax overdraft facility, remained constant.
During 2001, an exchange loss of 0.1m 2000 0.3m arose as a result of the revaluation of the amount outstanding under the US dollar-denominated Arilvax facility.
In accordance with FRS 11, Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill, during 2001 the Group recorded an exceptional loss of 0.4m 2000 0.7m relating to the impairment write-down of the investment held in Medivir AB, which the Group acquired on the sale of the Mimetrix business in 2000.
During 2001, the Group elected to claim an R&D tax credit of 0.1m 2000 nil in relation to qualifying R&D expenditure in the UK.
The net loss for the year increased to 12.4m 2000 11.1m, primarily as a result of increased R&D and operating costs at the new Massachusetts manufacturing facility, both of which were largely offset by increased turnover.
Liquidity and capital resources 4b 5b The Group had aggregate cash and liquid resources of 11.8m at 31 December 2002 2001 22.2m, a decrease of 10.4m since the start of the year 2001 increase of 1.1m.
During the year, Acambis received 7.7m 2001 4.3m from the issue of new shares, primarily being attributable to the net proceeds receivable from the third equity subscription for new shares by Baxter.
Cash used by operations during the year, principally to support R&D, was 6.2m 2001 8.0m.
During 2002, Acambis made additions of short leasehold land and buildings of 5.0m 2001 6.9m, 2000 0.2m, acquired 4.5m of laboratory and manufacturing equipment 2001 2.7m, 2000 0.1m and 1.2m of office equipment 2001 0.4m, 2000 0.1m.
Additions in 2002 and 2001 were primarily in relation to the reactivation of our manufacturing facility.
From incorporation through to 31 December 2002, Acambis has financed its operations primarily from equity issuances totalling 85.3m, licence fees and milestone payments totalling 3.1m, R&D contract fees and sales of product totalling 101.6m and government grants totalling 3.9m.
At 31 December 2002, Acambis held investments in Medivir AB market value at 31 December 2002 of 0.3m, 2001 0.4m and in Acambis ordinary shares through Acambis Employee Share Ownership Trust market value at 31 December 2002 of 1.6m, 2001 2.5m.
Under the terms of the strategic alliance set up with Baxter in 2000, the Group has received cash of 7.0m in 2002 2001 3.5m, 2000 10.4m in exchange for new shares in Acambis.
On 27 March 2003, the Group issued 4.6 million new shares in relation to the final subscription to Baxter.
At 31 December 2002, the balance on the Arilvax overdraft facility was 4.3m $7.0m 2001 4.8m, 2000 4.7m.
At 31 December 2002, the Group did not have any undrawn borrowing facilities in respect of this overdraft facility 2001 nil, 2000 nil.
Given certain circumstances, this facility which is fully described in note d on page 46, Evans Vaccines agreement, may be repayable within one year.
In December 2001, the Group secured lease financing for up to $40m c. 28m with Baxter in respect of Acambis manufacturing facility.
At 31 December 2002, the Group had an outstanding liability of 14.0m $22.5m under this financing facility 2001 14.3m, 2000 nil.
At 31 December 2002, the Group had $17.5m c. 10.9m undrawn borrowing facilities in respect of this financing facility 2001 13.2m, 2000 nil.
The repayment terms of this facility are described in note 18.
The Group does not have any other financial liabilities.
Since inception, Acambis cash expenditures have exceeded revenues on an annualised basis.
Acambis future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the expenditure required to maintain the manufacturing facility, the progress of R&D programmes, pre-clinical and clinical testing, the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals, the cost of filing, prosecuting and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights, competing technological and market developments, changes in Acambis existing research relationships, the ability of Acambis to establish collaborative arrangements, receipt of any licence fees and royalties and the acquisition of additional facilities and capital expenditure.
As a result of the $40m c. 28m lease-financing facility secured in December 2001 and the award of the second US Government smallpox vaccine contract in November 2001, Acambis believes that there will be sufficient cash to fund its operations through 2003.
Changes in R&D plans or other events affecting Acambis operations, however, may result in accelerated or unexpected expenditures.
If additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities, dilution to existing shareholders may result and future investors may be granted rights superior to those of existing shareholders.
5c Collaboration agreements 10c a US CDC agreements The Group has been awarded two distinct contracts Contract 1 and Contract 2 by the CDC to develop and manufacture smallpox vaccines for the purposes of countering the threat of bioterrorism.
Contract 1 This contract was awarded in September 2000, and incorporates two elements.
First, to develop a new smallpox vaccine and, second, to produce and maintain a stockpile of vaccine doses.
At the time of the initial award, the estimated value of the 20-year contract was $343m.
This value made certain assumptions concerning price per dose, the shelf-life of the vaccine and that a 40 milliondose stockpile of the vaccine would be produced and maintained for 20 years.
Following the terrorist events of 11 September 2001, the CDC issued a change order, increasing the number of doses to be delivered from 40 million to 54 million.
The Group is required to sustain a production capability throughout the 20-year life of the contract, both to replace outdated doses and to be able to respond to increased demand as required.
The exclusive commercial rights to the smallpox vaccine developed under this contract with the CDC are retained by Acambis.
During 2002, the Group recorded turnover of 17.7m 2001 5.7m, 2000 0.6m for R&D costs incurred by the Group and funded by the CDC.
Contract 2 In November 2001, Acambis was awarded a second contract by the CDC to develop, manufacture, deliver and store 155 million doses of smallpox vaccine.
The value of this contract, which carries a fixed price, is $428m c. 270m.
Contract 2 is divided into two principal components: funding to take the vaccine through clinical trials to US FDA licensure: and manufacture of the vaccine.
The funding for the R&D element will be received over 2002 and 2003, whereas the funding for the manufacture will be received on delivery of the vaccine, which started during 2002 and is continuing into 2003.
Turnover has been recorded in 2002 in relation to this contract of 58.2m 2001 nil, 2000 nil.
b Baxter agreements In December 2000, Acambis entered into the following series of agreements with Baxter: Baxter has invested 27.8m in new Acambis equity.
This subscription was payable in four instalments between December 2000 and, at the latest, June 2003 at an average price of 130p per share.
The first instalment of 10.4m was made in December 2000, the second instalment of 3.5m was made in June 2001 and the third instalment of 7.0m was made in June 2002.
The fourth and final instalment totalling 7.0m was made on 27 March 2003: Acambis has the exclusive rights to manufacture components of certain of Baxters vaccines at Acambis manufacturing facility: Acambis granted Baxter an option to be its marketing partner for the yellow fever vaccine, Arilvax, in the US subject to approval from PowderJect Pharmaceuticals plc PowderJect : and Baxter licensed to Acambis the rights to use Baxters novel Vero-cell technology in exchange for royalty payments to Baxter.
This currently applies to the production of Acambis ChimeriVax-JE, ChimeriVax-West Nile and smallpox vaccines.
Under the terms of the agreement entered into in December 2000, in 2002, the Group received income of 1.3m 2001 nil in relation to Baxters share of the commissioning of Acambis manufacturing plant.
This income has been netted off against R&D costs on the face of the profit and loss account.
No turnover was recorded in 2002 2001 nil, 2000 nil under this agreement.
In November 2001, Acambis entered into a sub-contract with Baxter for the purchase of crude bulk smallpox vaccine and the subsequent assembly of various components into multi-dose kits of smallpox vaccine.
In December 2001, Acambis entered into a long-term lease-finance facility with Baxter in respect of Acambis manufacturing plant.
Further details of this facility are described within Financial liabilities in note 20.
In December 2002, Acambis entered into a distribution, manufacturing and licence agreement with Baxter, giving Baxter exclusive distribution rights for ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine in all countries of the world excluding the US and the UK.
In 2002, turnover of 0.7m 2001 nil, 2000 nil was recorded under this agreement.
c Aventis Pasteur agreements H. pylori The arrangements relating to the Joint Venture, called Pasteur Mrieux-OraVax, are described in notes 14 d and 27.
The Groups share of the net liabilities of Pasteur Mrieux-OraVax at 31 December 2002 was 0.2m 2001 net assets of 0.07m, 2000 net liabilities of 0.04m.
During 2002, the Group recorded turnover of 0.3m 2001 0.5m, 2000 2.. 4m for R&D costs incurred by the Group and funded by Pasteur Mrieux-OraVax.
The Group will share any revenues from sales of the final product in equal proportions with Aventis Pasteur.
45 46 FURTHER INFORMATION REQUIRED BY FORM 20-F unaudited ChimeriVax-Dengue The Group has a licensing and collaboration agreement with Aventis Pasteur to employ the ChimeriVax technology to develop a vaccine against dengue fever.
Aventis Pasteur fully funds all R&D costs incurred on the project.
Previously, Aventis Pasteur also funded the Groups Japanese encephalitis project, the rights for which were returned to Acambis during 2000.
During 2002, the Group has recorded turnover of 3.3m 2001 2.6m, 2000 3.0m for R&D costs incurred by the Group and funded by Aventis Pasteur under this agreement.
The Group has the ability to receive clinical and regulatory milestones through to product licensure in addition to royalties on sales of the actual product.
d Evans Vaccines agreement In September 1999, the Group entered into an agreement with Medeva Pharma Limited to obtain regulatory approval in the US for Arilvax.
Medeva Pharma Limited assigned this agreement to Evans Vaccines Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PowderJect, in October 2000.
The Group is funding 100% of the costs of the clinical trials and regulatory submission.
As described in note 18, Creditors: amounts falling due within one year, the costs are being partly financed through an overdraft facility up to a maximum of $7m, being underwritten by PowderJect.
PowderJect has granted to Acambis 100% of the marketing rights to Arilvax in the US, whilst still retaining an option to buy back 50% of the profits from the US sales in return for refunding to the Group the costs the Group has incurred on the Arilvax programme.
No turnover was recorded in 2002 2001 nil, 1999 nil under this agreement.
10e UK tax consequences of owning Acambis shares Taxation of dividends There is no withholding tax on dividends paid by a UK company.
Under the provisions of the income tax convention currently in force between the UK and the US, a US holder who is an individual or a corporate portfolio holder, who does not own 10% or more of the Acambis shares a Corporate Portfolio Holder, will be entitled to receive a payment from the UK Inland Revenue equal to the tax credit in respect of the dividend the Tax Treaty Payment minus a withholding of 15% of the aggregate of the dividend and the tax credit one-ninth of the dividend, meaning that the amount of the withholding will effectively eliminate the amount of Tax Treaty Payment.
Thus, a US individual or US Corporate Portfolio Holder who is entitled to an 80 dividend paid by Acambis will receive 80.
UK taxation of capital gains A US holder who is not resident, or ordinarily resident, for tax purposes in the UK will not be liable for UK tax on capital gains on the disposal of Acambis shares unless the US holder carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency and the Acambis shares are or have been used by, held by, or acquired for use by or for the purposes of such trade, profession, vocation, branch or agent.
UK inheritance tax on estates and gifts The estate and gift tax convention in force between the US and the UK provides that the UK tax to which the convention applies is capital transfer tax and that it will also apply to identical or substantially similar taxes which are imposed subsequently.
Capital transfer tax in the UK has been replaced by inheritance tax.
It is understood that, in practice, the US tax authorities and the UK Inland Revenue apply the convention on the basis that inheritance tax has replaced capital transfer tax as the tax to which the convention now applies, although the convention has not been amended to that effect.
On the basis of that practice, Acambis shares held in the US by an individual who is domiciled for the purposes of the estate and gift tax convention in the US and is not for the purposes of the convention a national of the UK, will not be subject to inheritance tax on the individuals death or on a transfer of the Acambis shares during the individuals lifetime.
However, special rules apply in the case of Acambis shares held in trust or as part of the business property of a permanent establishment in the UK or related to the fixed base in the UK of a person providing independent personal services.
