Pension Costs The Group operates several pension schemes.
The principal schemes are the Halifax Retirement Fund and the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme together, the Schemes, which are funded schemes.
These Schemes cover 76 per cent of the Groups pensionable employees, and provide defined benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the Schemes are held in Trust Funds which are independent of the Groups own assets.
In determining the level of contributions required to be made to the Schemes and the relevant charges to the Groups profit and loss account, the Group has been advised by Watson Wyatt LLP, Actuaries and Consultants.
The most recently published formal valuation of the Halifax Retirement Fund took place as at 31 March 2000: a formal valuation of the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2001.
The financial assumptions are derived based upon the economic conditions prevailing at the date of valuation.
The different assumptions between the two Schemes are as a consequence of their differing valuation dates.
The main financial assumptions adopted for these calculations were as follows:- Bank of Scotland Halifax Retirement Fund 1976 Pension Scheme Rates per annum Rates per annum Future price inflation 3.00 per cent 2.50 per cent Return on new investments 7.25 per cent 6.60 per cent Return on existing investments 5.75 per cent 6.00 per cent 1 Increases in earnings 4.50 per cent 3.50 per cent 2 Increases in pensions 3.00 per cent 2.50 per cent Notes:- 1.
In addition to the general assumed rate of salary increases, there is a separate assumed salary scale of increases due to promotions and increasing seniority.
The pension increase is on the excess over the Guaranteed Minimum Pension.
The pension costs for accounting purposes have been calculated using the same assumptions as those adopted for the formal valuations.
The following disclosures are based on these assumptions using the projected unit method of valuation:- Bank of Scotland Halifax Retirement Fund 1976 Pension Scheme Effective date of valuation 31 3 2000 31 12 2001 Market value of assets 2,148m 1,409m Asset cover level 119 per cent 98 per cent Regular pension charge 16.75 per cent 15.90 per cent as a percentage of pensionable salaries HX027 74 113 AW v3 13 3 03 2:03 pm Page 77 77 HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2002 9.
Pension Costs continued The asset cover levels disclosed in the previous table represent the ratios of the respective Schemes assets to the value of the benefits that had accrued to members and pensioners at the valuation dates after allowing for expected future increases in earnings and pensions.
The regular pension charge for the Halifax Retirement Fund is inclusive of employee contributions which were increased from 3% to 4% of pensionable salaries from 1 May 2002.
These charges have been adjusted by spreading surplus assets or shortfalls in each of the Schemes over the average future working lifetimes of the memberships 15 years for the Halifax Retirement Fund and 16 years for the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme by fixed capital instalments plus interest on the reducing balances.
These elements, together with interest on the opening balance sheet positions result in a charge of 12 million 2001 15 million in respect of the Halifax Retirement Fund and 54 million 2001 30 million in respect of the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme.
Included within the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme charge is an exceptional charge of 1 million.
Contributions to the Schemes of 72 million were paid over the period.
As contributions differed from the amount charged in the Profit and Loss Account a pension prepayment of 35 million 2001 25 million in respect of the Halifax Retirement Fund and a provision of 82 million 2001 78 million for future contributions in respect of the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme is included in the Balance Sheet.
This leads to a net provision of 47 million 2001 53 million.
The Group currently contributes to the Halifax Retirement Fund at a rate of 4% of pensionable salaries, and to the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme at a rate of 16.6% of pensionable salaries.
The current pension cost for the Halifax Retirement Fund under SSAP 24 is likely to increase in 2003, when the next formal triennial valuation is performed, reflecting, inter alia, a deterioration in stock market conditions.
The Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme was closed to new members on 30 September 2002.
With effect from 1 October 2002 all new members of staff will be eligible to join The HBOS Group Money Purchase Scheme.
The pension costs charged in the Profit and Loss Account include 27 million 2001 28 million relating to schemes other than the Schemes.
These costs are net of an amount of 7 million in respect of The Equitable Pension and Life Assurance Scheme The Equitable Pension Scheme which The Equitable is obliged to reimburse to the Group.
Other Post-Retirement Benefits The Group also provides post-retirement health care benefits and concessionary rate mortgages for certain pensioners and dependent spouses.
An independent actuarial review as at 31 December 2002 estimated the present value of the accumulated other post-retirement benefit obligations at 38 million for the Group 2001 37 million.
The main additional financial assumption used was that over the long-term the rate of increase in health care costs would be 7.25% per annum, being 4.25% per annum higher than the rate of inflation.
The charge for the year ended 31 December 2002 for other post-retirement benefits was 2 million 2001 2 million.
Included in provisions for liabilities and charges is 35 million 2001 33 million which represents the accrued amount for other post-retirement benefits.
FRS 17 Under the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 the Group continues to account for retirement benefits in accordance with SSAP 24 as detailed above.
The following additional disclosures under FRS 17 are required by way of narrative only.
The actuarial valuations used in assessing the FRS 17 disclosures are:- the Halifax Retirement Fund valuation as at 31 March 2000 the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme valuation as at 31 December 2001 These are the principal schemes for the Group but additional FRS 17 disclosure has been provided for all other defined benefit schemes within the Group.
These are detailed below under the heading Other Schemes.
For the Schemes and Other Schemes, each actuarial valuation is updated by qualified actuaries, principally Watson Wyatt LLP, to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 and to assess the assets and liabilities of the schemes as at 31 December 2002.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2002.
The liabilities of the Schemes under FRS 17 were calculated using the Projected Unit method using the following financial assumptions:- Rates per annum Rates per annum 31 December 2001 31 December 2002 Future price inflation 2.5 per cent 2.4 per cent Discount rate 6.0 per cent 5.8 per cent 1 Increases in earnings 3.5 per cent 3.4 per cent 2 Increases in pensions 2.5 per cent 2.4 per cent Notes:- 1.
Pensions which are guaranteed to increase at a rate of 3.0 per cent per annum have been assumed to increase at 3.0 per cent.

Pension Costs continued The Schemes are closed to new entrants.
Under the Projected Unit method, the current service cost will increase as members of the Schemes approach retirement.
The liabilities of the Other Schemes under FRS 17 were calculated using the Projected Unit method using the following financial assumptions:- Rates per annum Rates per annum 31 December 2001 31 December 2002 Future price inflation 2.5 per cent 2.4 per cent Discount rate 6.0 per cent 5.8 per cent Increases in earnings 3.5 per cent 3.4 per cent Increases in pensions 2.5 per cent 2.4 per cent The above rates apply to all Other Schemes with the exception of the schemes within Bank of Scotland Ireland Ltd, which are not significant.
The assets of the Schemes and the expected rates of return were:- Long-term expected Value at Long-term expected Value at rate of return per annum 31 December 2001 rate of return per annum 31 December 2002 at 31 December 2001 million at 31 December 2002 million Equities 7.75 per cent 2,715 8.50 per cent 2,157 Bonds 5.25 per cent 305 5.00 per cent 269 Property 6.50 per cent 88 6.80 per cent 82 Cash 4.50 per cent 88 3.80 per cent 84 Total market value of assets 3,196 2,592 Present value of liabilities of the Schemes 3,194 3,546 Surplus Deficit in the Schemes 2 954 Deferred tax asset 286 Net pension asset liability 2 668 The assets of the Other Schemes and the expected rates of return were:- Long-term expected Value at Long-term expected Value at rate of return per annum 31 December 2001 rate of return per annum 31 December 2002 at 31 December 2001 million at 31 December 2002 million Equities 7.75 per cent 365 8.50 per cent 314 With-profits investments 6.25 per cent 114 5.80 per cent 79 Bonds 5.25 per cent 76 5.00 per cent 124 Property 6.50 per cent 13 6.80 per cent 19 Cash 4.50 per cent 12 3.80 per cent 33 Total market value of assets 580 569 Present value of liabilities of the Other Schemes 607 751 Deficit in the Other Schemes 27 182 Deferred tax asset 8 55 Net pension liability 19 127 The above rates apply to all Other Schemes with the exception of the schemes within Bank of Scotland Ireland Ltd, which are not significant.

At 31 December 2002, under FRS 17, a deficit of 51 million and a profit and loss charge of 14 million would arise.
The Equitable is, however, obliged to reimburse the Group for certain excess costs of funding this scheme.
The contributions to Other Schemes referred to above are those paid by the Group and do not take account of amounts to be reimbursed by The Equitable.
Other Post-Retirement Benefits An independent actuarial review as at 31 December 2002 estimated the present value of the accumulated other post-retirement benefit obligations under FRS 17 at 40 million 2001 40 million for the Group.
There are no assets backing these obligations, and hence the notional balance sheet provision under FRS 17 is also 40 million 2001 40 million.
The notional charge in relation to these benefits amounted to 3 million.
The main additional financial assumption used was that over the long-term the rate of increase in health care costs would be 5.8% per annum, which is in line with the discount rate.

Neither HBOS plc nor its subsidiary undertakings will support any losses that may be suffered by the noteholders in accordance with the terms of the notes.
When all liabilities to the noteholders have been discharged, any proceeds from assets in addition to the non-returnable amounts already received in the securitisation companies accrue to HBOS plc or its subsidiary undertakings.
Neither HBOS plc nor its subsidiary undertakings have the right or obligation to repurchase any securitised advance unless it has been in breach of warranty.
The HBOS Group undertakings and third parties have entered into a number of interest rate swaps with the securitisation undertakings, the intention of which is to swap all or part of the interest flows from customers into variable rate interest flows to match the variable rate interest payable to the noteholders.

Long-term Assurance Business The Group has now adopted the more generally accepted approach of using unsmoothed asset values for the purposes of determining the net present value of in-force business.
Previously, smoothed asset values were used.
The cumulative impact of this change of accounting policy relating to previous years has been recognised in the accounts as a prior year adjustment and accordingly, the prior year results have been restated.
The effect of this change of policy on this years results and the prior year comparative is disclosed below.
Revised Previous accounting basis accounting basis 2001 2002 Restated 2002 2001 m m m m Consolidated Profit and Loss Account:- Income from long-term assurance business 233 150 380 470 Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 2,909 2,292 3,056 2,612 Tax on profit on ordinary activities 835 663 869 755 Profit on ordinary activities after taxation 2,074 1,629 2,187 1,857 Consolidated Balance Sheet:- Long term assurance business attributable to shareholders 3,544 3,065 3,857 3,265 The balances shown under the previous accounting basis for 2002 are based on a risk discount rate of 9%.
The principal economic assumptions are reviewed annually and are as follows:- 2002 2001 % % Risk discount rate net of tax 8.5 9.4 Return on equities net of tax credits 7.5 7.5 Return on Gilts gross of tax 5.0 5.0 Expense inflation 3.0 3.0 In-force business is defined as all live policies where the first premium has been paid.
For traditional with profits business, the surplus attributable to the Group equates to one ninth of the bonuses declared in any year.
The level of assumed future bonuses is calculated by projecting the portfolio of with profits business forward and applying reversionary and terminal bonus rates so as to exhaust the projected surplus of assets attributable to with profit policyholders.
For all other business, the entire surplus is attributable to the Group.
The income from long-term assurance business is calculated as follows:- 2001 2002 Restated million million Closing value of Groups interest in long-term assurance business including minority interests 3,544 3,065 Opening value of Groups interest in long-term assurance business including minority interests 3,065 2,428 Increase in value of long-term assurance business 479 637 Transfers to long-term assurance business 309 254 Acquisitions Long-term assurance business of The Equitable Note 50 a 12 277 Long-term assurance business of St. Jamess Place Capital plc 21 Income after tax from long-term assurance business 182 127 Tax relating to long-term assurance business Note 10 51 23 Income before tax from long-term assurance business 233 150 HX027 74 113 AW v3 13 3 03 2:03 pm Page 91 91 HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2002 29.

Derivatives options and futures are used for efficient portfolio management of the long-term assurance business and to match obligations to policyholders.
These derivatives are included within investments above at market value.
Insurance companies and insurance groups report their income from long-term assurance business on the Modified Statutory Solvency Basis MSSB in accordance with the Statement of Recommended Practice issued by the Association of British Insurers which is only applicable to the accounts of such companies and groups.
Under this approach, the profit reported is the surplus or deficit calculated for statutory solvency purposes with prescribed adjustments to technical provisions and the deferral of certain costs of acquiring business.

Because of the conservative nature of the current solvency regulations, a major failing of MSSB is that new business is normally reported as a loss in the year of sale.
