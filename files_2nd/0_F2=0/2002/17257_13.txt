No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing property to its market value or on the sale of properties where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
Such tax would become payable only if the property were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief.
The total amount unprovided for is 8.0 million 2001: 6.2 million.
At present, it is not anticipated that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share of 49.96p is calculated on the profit of 288.2 million accruing to ordinary share capital and on a weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 577.1 million.
The earnings per share before exceptionals and goodwill amortisation of 54.58p is calculated on the profit of 314.9 million accruing to ordinary share capital.
The impact of all potentially dilutive share options on earnings per share would be to increase the weighted average number of shares in issue by 5.8 million and to reduce basic earnings per share by 0.50 pence.

Financial instruments The group held the following categories of financial instruments at 31 July 2002: Book value Fair value m m Financial instruments held to fund the groups operations Short-term borrowings 252.2 252.2 Loans and other borrowings payable after one year 507.6 507.6 Cash and deposits 204.9 204.9 Construction loans receivable 171.4 171.4 Construction loans payable 171.4 171.4 Current asset investments 9.3 9.3 Financial instruments held to manage the groups interest rate and currency profile Interest rate swaps 5.0 Short-term currency swaps 0.6 68 Wolseley plc Annual report and accounts 2002 Notes to the accounts year ended 31 July 2002 For the purpose of the previous table, the fair values of short-term borrowings, cash and deposits, construction loans payable and current asset investments, approximate to book value due to their short maturities.
The loans and other borrowings payable after one year generally attract variable interest rates based on 6 month LIBOR, thus the fair value of these instruments at 31 July 2002 also approximates to their book value.
The fair value of construction loans receivable approximates to book value as the interest rates attaching to these loans reflect a market risk premium.
Sterling cash and deposits are utilised to reduce currency borrowings through the use of short-term currency swaps.
To determine the fair value of currency and interest rate swaps for inclusion in the previous table, a calculation was made of the net gain or loss which would have arisen if these contracts had been terminated on 31 July 2002.
At 31 July 2002 unrecognised gains and losses on forward exchange contracts taken out as hedges of sales and purchase transactions were not significant.
The groups policy in respect of foreign currency and interest risk management and the related use of financial instruments are set out in the treasury section of the Operating and financial review on pages 25 to 27 and form part of these financial statements.
Short-term debtors and creditors arising directly from the groups operations are excluded from the above disclosures other than those relating to assets and liabilities by currency.
