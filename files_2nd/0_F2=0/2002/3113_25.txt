78 Celltech Annual Report 2002 Notes: i Revenue recognition Under UK GAAP, non-refundable licence fee revenue is recognised when earned.
Refundable licence fees are deferred until such time as they are no longer refundable, otherwise the individual elements such as milestones and R&D funding are accounted for separately based on the revenue recognition criteria set out in note 1 to the accounts.
US GAAP requires in most circumstances the deferral of non-refundable upfront licence fees and other income received under a contract where there is a continuing involvement with the licensed asset through collaboration or other arrangement.
ii Medeva goodwill adjustments Under US GAAP the time frame allowed to make adjustments to goodwill is one year from the date of acquisition, except for adjustments in respect of taxation when an indefinite period is available.
Under UK GAAP the time frame available extends to the first full reporting period after the reporting period in which the acquisition was made.
Thus a longer period to make goodwill adjustments is generally available under UK GAAP.
Consequently certain adjustments were booked to goodwill arising on the Medeva acquisition during 2001 for the purpose of the UK accounts.
These have flowed through the profit and loss account for US GAAP purposes during 2001 and 2002. iii Amortisation of goodwill and other intangibles Under US GAAP the merger between Celltech and Chiroscience failed to qualify as a pooling of interest and therefore additional goodwill and intangible assets were established on the US balance sheet.
In addition, amortisation is no longer automatically charged under SFAS 142 Goodwill and other intangible assets on goodwill.
Amortisation continues to be applied in the US on finite life intangibles whilst goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are tested for impairment annually.
iv Inventory adjustment The 2001 adjustment relates to the Thiemann acquisition and the 2000 adjustment to the Medeva acquisition.
Under UK GAAP, inventory is recognised at replacement cost.
Under US GAAP, inventory is recognised at selling price less an allowance for selling costs.
v Stock based compensation Under UK GAAP, no compensation expense is recorded in connection with the issue of share options to Group employees at market value.
Under US GAAP, APB 25, an annual compensation expense is imputed for variable stock option plans based on the excess of the then prevailing market price over grant price.
vi Unrealised gains on derivative financial instruments As described in note 1 to the accounts financial instruments the Group uses forward exchange contracts to match against forecast receipts and payments in foreign currency.
As the contracts are not matched to specific receivables or payables the gains or losses arising on the hedges are not recognised until such time as they are realised under UK GAAP.
SFAS 133 determines that under such circumstances recognition should be made of the gains or losses that have arisen in the profit and loss account.
The Group adopted SFAS 133 during 2001 and accordingly the adjustment recognised in that year takes into account the cumulative effect of this change in accounting policy.
vii Deferred taxation The Group adopted FRS 19 during 2001 resulting in prior year adjustments to goodwill and deferred taxation under UK GAAP.
Under US GAAP no deferred tax liability is recognised in a purchase business combination for which amortisation is not deductible for tax purposes.
Consequently the FRS 19 adjustments have been reversed.
viii Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP Under UK GAAP the Companys own shares held by the ESOP are recorded as fixed asset investments at cost.
Under US GAAP those shares not fully vested are regarded as treasury stock and recorded at cost as a deduction from shareholders equity.
ix Pensions other comprehensive income Under US GAAP, a minimum pension liability is recognised through other comprehensive income in certain circumstances when there is a deficit of plan assets relative to the projected benefits obligation.
Under UK GAAP, there is no such requirement.
