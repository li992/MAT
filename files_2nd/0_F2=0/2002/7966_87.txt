Aon Corporation Aon has made certain claims under an indemnity given in connection with the sale of Bain Hogg Limited in 1996 relating to liabilities in respect of advice given on the sale of pensions and related products, opt-outs and transfers by Bain Hogg Financial Services Limited and Gardner Mountain Financial Services Limited.
Aon may seek to make further claims in respect of such advice and related costs.
On the information currently available to the Company, it is not possible to assess fully the merits or value of claims under this indemnity.
The Directors have taken legal advice and are pursuing all options open to them to defend or minimise the claims.
In addition to the above, there were at 31 December 2002 other contingent liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business, including those in respect of disposed businesses.
The Directors have reviewed the above matters and have made certain provisions.
Having done so, the Directors consider, based on the information currently available, that they will not have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.
In September 2000, the European Parliament passed Directive 2000 53 EC which deals with the collection and disposal of vehicles at the end of their life.
The Directive includes a retrospective liability for vehicles put on the road prior to July 2002.
Member states were required to enact legislation by 21 April 2002.
To date, only Belgium has enacted legislation, although how this will work in practice is not yet clear.
None of the other member states which are core markets for the Group have enacted legislation.
Therefore, there are still a number of uncertainties surrounding the implementation of the Directive in our markets and it is unclear at present what financial effect, if any, it will have on the Group.
