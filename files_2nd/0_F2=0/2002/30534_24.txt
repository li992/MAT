Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies i Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared on the historical cost basis of accounting, modified to include the revaluation of fixed asset investments and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP dated December 1995.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
ii Valuation of fixed asset investments UK listed investments are valued according to the prices issued by the London Stock Exchange, being the closing mid-market prices for all investments other than FTSE 100 constituents and FTSE 100 reserve list constituents for which the last trade prices are used.
Overseas listed investments and investments which are quoted but are unlisted are valued at their closing middle market prices as issued by various sources.
Unquoted investments are valued by the directors based on a combination of factors relating to the investee companies, such as the cost of the investment, earnings multiples and net assets, less suitable discounts to provide for any lack of marketability.
iii Associated undertakings Where the Company holds investments representing more than 20% of a class of equity share capital, they are not accounted for as associated undertakings if, in the opinion of the directors, the Company does not exercise significant influence over the financial or operating policies of the investee companies.
iv Capital gains and losses Realised and unrealised capital gains and losses on investments, together with exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in other reserves.
v Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are taken to the revenue account on an ex-dividend basis and net of related tax credit.
Income from fixed interest debt securities is recognised on a time apportionment basis and, if material, so as to reflect the effective yield on these securities.
Bank deposit interest is accounted for on an accruals basis.
vi Expenses and finance costs All expenses and finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis.
In accordance with the Boards expectation, over the long term, that investment returns will be attributable 75% to capital gains and 25% to revenue, the Company charges to capital 75% of the finance costs and management fees.
All other expenses are charged to revenue.
Expenses which are incidental to the purchase or sale of a fixed asset investment are included in the cost or deducted from the proceeds of sale of the investment.
Any performance fees payable are allocated wholly to capital, reflecting the fact that they are calculated by reference to capital performance only.
Details of the performance fee arrangements are given in the Report of the Directors.
vii Deferred taxation Financial Reporting Standard 19 has been adopted for the year ended 31 December 2002.
No restatement of prior period comparatives is required.
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date, other than those differences regarded as permanent.
Any liability to deferred tax is provided at the average rate of tax expected to apply.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted to reflect the time value of money.
viii Allocation of tax relief With effect from 1 January 2002, the tax relief available to the Company on its management, administrative and finance costs is allocated between revenue and capital according to the marginal basis whereby revenue expenses are matched first against taxable income arising in the revenue account: the effect of this is that in the year ended 31 December 2002 all the tax relief was allocated to revenue.
In 2001 the tax relief was allocated according to the proportional basis.
Had the comparative figures been calculated on the same basis, the revenue return for the year ended 31 December 2001 would have been 8.77p rather than 8.40p.
ix Foreign currency Transactions denominated in overseas currencies during the year are translated into sterling at the appropriate daily exchange rate.
Assets and liabilities denominated in overseas currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling on that date.
In the case of forward exchange contracts entered into to hedge fluctuating exchange rates on foreign currency assets or liabilities, the difference between the value at the contracted forward rate and the forward rate ruling at the balance sheet date is included as a debtor or provided for as a creditor and included within other reserves.
34 1 Accounting policies continued x Financial instruments Derivative instruments may be utilised by the Company.
A derivative instrument is considered to be used for hedging purposes when it alters the market risk profile of an existing underlying exposure of the Company.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under Financial Reporting Standard 13 and excluded short-term debtors and creditors from disclosures under financial instruments where allowed see note 15 on pages 39 to 41.

15 Financial instruments i Management of risk The Companys financial instruments comprise: equity shares that are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective as set out on page 1: debenture stock, secured bonds, preference shares, term loans and bank overdrafts, the main purpose of which is to raise finance for the Companys operations: and cash and short-term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the Companys operations.
Derivative transactions which the Company may enter into comprise forward exchange contracts the purpose of which is to manage currency risks arising from the Companys investing activities and quoted options on shares held within the portfolio, or on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio the purpose of which is to provide protection against falls in the capital values of the holdings.
The Company may also write options on shares represented in the portfolio where such options are priced attractively relative to the portfolio managers longer term expectations for the relevant share prices.
39 Notes to the Accounts continued 15 Financial instruments continued The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are due to fluctuations in market prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained constant throughout the year under review.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about the future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys operations.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and movements in exchange rates.
It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular country or sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets and stock selection are other factors which act to reduce market price risk.
The portfolio managers actively monitor market prices throughout the year and report to the Board, which meets regularly in order to consider investment strategy.
Foreign currency risk The Companys total return and net assets can be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because a portion of the Companys assets and revenue are denominated in currencies other than sterling.
The international spread of investments acts to reduce this risk.
Borrowings in foreign currencies are limited to levels appropriate to the asset exposure to those currencies.
Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through its debenture stock, secured bonds, preference shares and term loans as well as bank overdrafts and any retained revenues arising from operations.
The Company borrows, in sterling or in foreign currencies, at both fixed and floating rates of interest.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure that gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these limits on a regular basis.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
The maturity of the Companys existing borrowings is set out in paragraph iii on page 41.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of loan and overdraft facilities.
Credit risk The Company places funds with authorised deposit takers from time to time and is therefore potentially at risk from the failure of any such institution of which it is a creditor.
The Company expects to place any deposits on a short term basis only.
The Company lends securities from its portfolio, within limits set by the Board.
It receives collateral to cover the securities lent, usually, in respect of UK securities, in the form of Crest DBVs.
This collateral is subject to concentration limits, to a margin and to regular revaluation.
ii Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets The majority of the Companys financial assets are equity shares and other investments which neither pay interest nor have a stated maturity date.
Financial liabilities The interest rate profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 31 December 2002 was: 2002 2002 2002 2001 2001 2001 Fixed rate Weighted Period for which Fixed rate Weighted Period for which financial average interest rate financial average interest rate liabilities interest rate is fixed liabilities interest rate is fixed 000 % years 000 % years Sterling preference shares 2,555 3.2 2,555 3.2 Sterling debenture stock 46,000 8.5 13.75 46,000 8.5 14.75 Sterling secured bonds 98,176 6.228 22.96 98,097 6.228 23.96 cccc 146,731 146,652 mmmm 40 15 Financial instruments continued iii Maturity profile of the Companys financial liabilities All of the Companys financial liabilities at 31 December 2002 mature in more than five years.
