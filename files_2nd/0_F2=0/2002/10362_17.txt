The Group investments comprise investments in US and European Technology Funds and warrants in WebMD Corporation formerly Healtheon WebMD.
The investments in US and European Technology Funds are denominated in US dollars and Euros, are non-interest bearing and are focused on investing in start-up and early-stage companies in the Information Technology sector.
No market exists for trading in these funds and they are held for long-term growth.
In January 2000, Misys Physician Systems entered into a five year strategic alliance with WebMD to provide internet-based practice management and clinical services to physicians in the US.
As part of this arrangement, and separate to the commercial terms thereof, Misys Physician Systems received the right to warrants for up to 4.4 million shares of WebMD common stock, contingent on certain performance requirements, vesting over a four year period.
In January 2002 all the earlier agreements were terminated by mutual consent and commuted into a new three year Transaction Processing Agreement and related Warrant Agreement over 2 million warrants, with no performance criteria, vesting over a three year period.

This was partly used to renance existing indebtedness, with the balance available to finance future corporate activity.
The five year Eurobond is a 750m, xed rate bond issued by Misys International Finance Limited and listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
The bond bears interest at 6.37%, but the net funding raised has been converted into oating rate US dollar denominated debt through a series of interest rate and currency swaps.
J P Morgan Europe Limited contracted to subscribe on maturity of the bond or on its earlier redemption up to 750m for an issue of up to 750 million 1 preference shares by Misys International Finance Limited.
J P Morgan Europe Limited has sold its rights and obligations with regards to these preference shares to Interval Limited, a Company that is independent of the Group.
Misys International SA, a wholly owned subsidiary within the Group, paid 370m as an initial payment to Cordon Limited a wholly owned subsidiary of Interval Limited.
This gure represents the discounted price which will be supplemented by a further payment of 232m in December 2006, for the rights to the preference shares noted above.
Misys Finance Limited, also a wholly owned subsidiary within the Group, currently has a balance of 130m deposited with Interval Limited at an interest rate of 4.54%.
This may be recalled at any time upon giving up to 13 days notice.
The Group has the ability to insist on a net settlement of the rights and obligations arising out of the above transactions.
There are no circumstances under which the Group would be obligated to redeem the bonds without being able to i offset the payment of 370m for the preference shares and ii recover the 130m deposit.
Accordingly the constituent elements of the above transactions have been offset in the Group balance sheet.
Similarly, as discussed in note 6, the constituent elements have been offset in the profit and loss account.
62 Misys Annual Report 2002 Issue costs of 7.7m were included in the original carrying value of the debt.
The amounts in the balance sheet have been stated net of unamortised issue costs of 3.9m.
Finance costs are allocated to the profit and loss account over the term of the facility at a constant rate on the carrying value of the net debt.
The bonds are guaranteed by Misys plc and other companies within the Group.
In addition, Misys plc has an undrawn revolving credit facility of $150m.
This was renewed on 11 June 2002 with a maximum maturity of two years.
The Group is subject to certain financial covenants on its bank borrowings: these include a minimum ratio of operating profit before depreciation and goodwill amortisation to net interest, and a minimum ratio of operating profit before depreciation and goodwill amortisation to net debt.

Therefore, the goodwill originally arising on the acquisition, which was capitalised, has been adjusted by $5.2m 3.6m.
Further adjustments of 1.2m have been made for other previous acquisitions.
The property provisions comprise the net present value of the estimated future costs of vacant and sub-let properties and the excess over market value for occupied properties of subsidiaries acquired in previous years.
The provisions will be utilised on average over the next 10 years.
The IFA networks provisions relate to the costs associated with the FSAVC and pensions review processes, which are expected to be completed within two years.
Provision has been made based on the average values of redress payments, together with expected administrative costs and external fees.
These amounts are partly recoverable and are shown gross of the recoverable element, with the corresponding entry in debtors.
A provision is also made for the expected value of the commissions reclaimable by product providers in respect of policies which may be cancelled during their indemnity period.
Included in other provisions are amounts primarily in respect of litigation and non-property related onerous contracts.
28 deferred taxation Deferred tax is now stated on a full provisioning basis in accordance with FRS 19 Deferred Tax.
The comparative information has been restated for this change in accounting policy.
Previously deferred tax was provided only to the extent that it was probable that a liability would crystallise in accordance with SSAP 15 Accounting for Deferred Tax.
The adoption of FRS 19 has not had an impact on the Group profit and loss accounts presented, but, as a result of the restatement, the reported net liabilities at 31 May 2001 have decreased by 4.3m due to the recognition of deferred tax assets.
The deferred tax assets at 31 May 2002 were 8.9m, compared to nil under the previous policy.
com 63 notes to the financial statements continued Deferred tax recognised is as follows: all gures in millions Provided At 1 June 2000 as previously stated Prior year adjustment for FRS 19 4.3 At 1 June 2000 as restated 4.3 Charge to profit and loss account note 7 Deferred tax provided at 31 May 2001 4.3 Credit to profit and loss account note 7 0.5 Movements originating on acquisition 4.1 Deferred tax asset at 31 May 2002 8.9 Losses 5.0 Other timing differences 3.9 Deferred tax asset at 31 May 2002 8.9 A deferred tax asset of 5.0m has been recognised in respect of carried forward losses which, on the basis of the latest forecasts, are more likely than not to be utilised within the next three years.
Other losses of 9.9m 2001 : 13.1m have not been recognised.
Deferred tax assets on Other Timing Differences of 7.9m 2001 : 9.3m and Accelerated Capital Allowances of 2.4m 2001 : 1.3m have not been recognised as it is likely that they will increase available losses.
29 pension schemes The Group operates a number of dened contribution pension schemes covering the majority of its employees.
The costs of these pension schemes 13.0m 2001 : 8.2m are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
In addition, the Group operates a funded dened benefit pension scheme for a small group of UK employees, totalling 32, which is a closed scheme, as well as a number of other smaller dened benefit arrangements.
Under SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs 0.4m 2001 : 0.4m has been charged to the profit and loss account in the period and a provision of 0.7m 2001 : 1.1m recognised as at 31 May 2002.
These amounts are assessed in accordance with independent professionally qualied actuaries.
The assumptions used in the 1999 actuarial valuation were a rate of increase in members salaries of 5.5% and a rate of increase in pensions of 3.0%.
This valuation showed a level of funding of 90%.
Additional contributions are being made to rectify the deficit, as recognised on the balance sheet.
In November 2000, the Accounting Standards Board issued FRS 17 Retirement Benets which will not be mandatory for the Group until the year ended 31 May 2004, at the earliest.
However, the FRS has an extended transitional period during which certain disclosures are required in the notes to the financial statements.
The following disclosures are relevant for the year ended 31 May 2002 in relation to the Groups dened benefit pension arrangements.
The UK pension schemes assets are held separately from the assets of the Group and are independently administered by Trustees.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 May 1999 and updated to 31 May 2002 by a qualied independent actuary.

Included in the oating rate liabilities are nil 2001 : nil and $nil 2001 : $nil drawn down under the revolving credit facility.
Fixed rate liabilities comprise convertible loan notes, other loans, interest-bearing contingent consideration, property provision and finance leases.
The liabilities on which no interest is paid comprise non-interest bearing contingent consideration.
The oating rate debt that is denominated in US dollars bears interest at a margin over US LIBOR.
As a protection against adverse interest rate movements the Group has bought interest rate caps that will protect the Group, until March 2004, from the effect of an increase in US LIBOR above 6.5%.
These financial liabilities are disclosed in notes 24, 26 and 27.
Details of the Groups undrawn borrowing facilities at 31 May 2002 are given in note 26.
FINANCIAL ASSETS Financial assets comprise cash deposits and xed asset investments.
Cash which bears interest at nominal rates comprises 41.3m 2001 : 16.6m denominated in sterling, 12.5m 2001 : 14.8m in US dollars, 1.3m 2001 : 8.8m in euros and 15.0m 2001 : 9.8m in other currencies.
Cash deposits of 24.3m 2001 : 36.6m denominated in sterling, bear interest at rates based on LIBOR.
All cash and deposits are available on demand.
Fixed asset investments of 2.2m 2001 : 1.5m comprise contractual rights to receive financial assets from participating in US and European Technology Funds which are non-interest bearing and warrants in WebMD Corporation.
Full details of these assets are given in note 19.
FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Set out on the next page is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of the Groups financial instruments.
The fair value is dened as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidated sale, excluding accrued interest.
Market values, where available, have been used.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash ows at prevailing interest and exchange rates with the exception of convertible loan notes and xed asset investments.
Short-term financial instruments are assumed to have a fair value equal to book value.
The book value is the amount recorded in the balance sheet.
66 Misys Annual Report 2002 Fair values for convertible loan notes have been based on the share price of the Company at 31 May 2002 of 223p.
Forward foreign currency contracts have been fair valued, based on the market price of comparable derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
No market exists for trading in the US and European Technology Funds in which the Group participates and future cash ows cannot be predicted.
As a result, a fair value cannot be established and therefore it has been assumed that their fair value is equal to book value.
The fair value of the WebMD Corporation warrants has been established using the Black-Scholes model.

CURRENCY EXPOSURES To ensure compliance with the treasury policy, as explained in the Financial Review, the Groups policy is to hedge currency exposures using forward foreign currency contracts.
All the material assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operation involved are hedged using forward foreign currency contracts, with the exception of foreign currency borrowings treated as a hedge against foreign net investments, and the initial payment of 370m made by Misys International SA MISA to Cordon Limited note 26, the functional currency of MISA being US dollars.
Therefore, the Group has no material currency exposures requiring disclosure.
FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
All the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged transactions.
The table below shows the extent to which the Group has off-balance sheet unrecognised and on-balance sheet deferred gains and losses in respect of cross currency and interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and forward foreign currency contracts used as hedges at the end of the year.
It also shows the amount of such gains and losses which have been included in the profit and loss account for the year and those which are expected to be included in next years or later profit and loss accounts.
Under the Groups accounting policy, foreign currency assets and liabilities which are hedged using forward foreign currency contracts are translated at the forward contract rate inherent in the contracts.
Consequently, the carrying value of the relevant asset or liability effectively includes the gain or loss on the hedging instrument.
Such gains and losses are treated as deferred for the purpose of the table below.

com 67 notes to the financial statements continued 31 contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities which are quantiable comprise property rental guarantees arising in the normal course of business, amounting to 9.7m 2001 : 10.2m.
The Company has entered into a netting arrangement with its bankers, under which the Companys liabilities may be offset by the funds of other Group undertakings.
The Directors are of the opinion that this arrangement does not have a material impact on the results and financial position of the Company.
Within the Financial Services Division, the regulatory requirements governing the IFA network business receive significant attention.
Compliance with these regulations is subject to a process of ongoing review and appraisal by both ourselves and the Financial Services Authority FSA.
As disclosed in 2001, one member of a particular network is the subject of a specic review, following a request by the FSA.
An initial review has been performed on a sample of cases and the findings are currently being discussed with the FSA.
Following the conclusion of these discussions, a structure and methodology to be used in performing the review will be agreed.
It is not possible at this stage to quantify what, if any, liability may arise from this review.
Accordingly, no provision has been made within these Financial Statements for the cost of potential redress or regulatory action.
The Board believes that if a liability does arise, insurance cover may be available to offset some of the liability.

PRIOR PERIOD ADJUSTMENT FOLLOWING ADOPTION OF FRS 18 ACCOUNTING POLICIES The adoption of FRS 18, which requires that the most appropriate accounting policies are selected, has resulted in a change of accounting policy for goodwill.
Goodwill that had previously been capitalised or written off to reserves was translated at the rate ruling on the date of acquisition.
Under the new policy, goodwill has been denominated in the functional currency of the operating business to which it relates and is retranslated as part of the retranslation of the balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries.
The Directors have made the change because they believe that it is more appropriate to treat goodwill as a foreign currency asset that is part of the net assets of the foreign investment.
The change has not had a material effect on the Group profit and loss accounts or net liabilities presented.
Accumulated goodwill written off to the profit and loss reserves at 31 May 2001 of 967.0m has increased by 110.9m but, as a result of the change in accounting policy, is offset by equal and opposite foreign exchange gains booked directly to the profit and loss reserves.
The goodwill written off to reserves at 31 May 2002 was 1,058.9m, compared with 967.0m under the previous accounting policy.
As a result of the retranslation, the goodwill written off to reserves was reduced by 19.0m in the year with the equal and opposite gain in profit and loss reserves.
