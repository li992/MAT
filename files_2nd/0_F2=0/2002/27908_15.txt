PENSIONS During the year further provisions of Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits FRS 17 came into force.
This standard will require assets or liabilities arising from the Groups defined benefit pension scheme to be evaluated and accounted for in the primary financial statements on a new basis with effect from the Groups financial year ending 30 September 2005.
This implementation date was originally to have been 30 September 2003, but the standard was revised by the Accounting Standards Board during the year.
As a transitional measure, the standard requires that various information relating to the pension asset or liability calculated on the new basis is disclosed by way of memorandum in the notes to the accounts.
These disclosures are given at a below.
The Standard provides 39 that the asset or liability recognised in the accounts at 30 September 2002 should continue to be calculated according to Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension Costs SSAP 24.
Disclosures relating to this calculation are given at b below.
The pension scheme asset calculated in accordance with SSAP 24 and recognised in the balance sheet of the Group at 30 September 2002 was 0.1m 2001: 0.1m and the liability at that date calculated in accordance with FRS 17 was 4.4m 2001: 0.9m.
The difference of 4.5m 2001: 1.0m relates to the differing bases of calculation.

The most recent actuarial valuation of the Group Pension Scheme was completed as at 31 March 2001 using the projected unit method, at which date the market value of the assets was 14.4m.
The principal assumptions used in the latest valuation were that the annual pre-retirement return on investment used would be 6% on accumulated assets, 6.5% on future contributions, while in valuing past service benefits a return on investment of 5.5% would be used.
The annual rate of increase in salaries was assumed to be 3.5%.
The valuation revealed that the actuarial value of assets was sufficient to cover 115% of the statutory minimum liabilities in accordance with the Pensions Act 1995.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED In previous years the Group had raised subordinated bank loans secured against various of its securitised portfolios.
These loans were secured on the assets within the portfolio concerned, but were subordinated to the asset backed loan notes.
Interest was payable on these loans at a rate of 1.25% above LIBOR.
The portfolios concerned were refinanced during the year and the loans repaid.
Included within bank loans at 30 September 2002 is nil 2001 : 12.2m in respect of such loans.
Assets are typically securitised within twelve months of origination.
Until that point new loans are funded using a 450.0m 2001: 400.0m committed sterling facility provided to Paragon Second Funding Limited by a consortium of banks.
332.7m 2001: 181.9m is included in bank loans in respect of drawings on this facility.
This facility is secured on all the assets of Paragon Second Funding Limited, Paragon Car Finance Limited and Paragon Personal Finance Limited.
As with the asset backed loan notes, repayments of this facility are restricted to the amount of principal cash realised from the funded assets.
The present facility replaced an earlier facility which ceased to be available for further drawings during the year.
This new facility remains available for further drawings until 28 February 2005 and although it expires in 2047 it is likely that substantial repayments will be made within the next five years.
In addition to these borrowings the Group has a committed corporate syndicated sterling bank facility of 180.0m 2001: 160.0m, used to provide working capital for the Group.
Included in bank loans are drawings of 114.5m 2001: 158.9m made by Paragon Finance PLC under this facility.
This facility reduces by instalments on 30 September 2003 and every six months thereafter until final repayment which is due on 31 March 2005.
The facility is secured on all the assets of the Company and of Paragon Finance PLC.
Interest on the bank facilities is payable at various rates between 0.33% and 1.15% above LIBOR.
The undrawn amounts on the two bank facilities at 30 September 2002 and 30 September 2001 are set out below.

The securitisation process and the terms of the Paragon Second Funding Limited loan facility effectively remove any liquidity risk from the funding of the Groups loan assets.
It remains to ensure that sufficient funding is available to provide capital support for new loans and working capital for the Group.
This responsibility rests with the Asset and Liability Committee which sets liquidity policy and uses detailed cash flow projections to ensure that an adequate level of liquidity is available at all times.

The rates of interest payable on the loan facilities and on asset backed loan notes issued in the securitisation process are reset quarterly on the basis of LIBOR.
The interest rates charged on the Groups variable rate loan assets are determined by reference to, inter alia, the Groups funding costs and the rates being charged on similar products in the market.
Generally this ensures the matching of changes in interest rates on the Groups loan assets and borrowings and any exposure arising on the interest rate resets is relatively short term.
Forward rate agreements are used to hedge against any perceived risk of temporary increases in LIBOR rates at month ends.
In part, the Groups interest rate hedging objectives are achieved by the controlled mismatching of the dates on which instruments mature, redeem or have their interest rates reset.
The table overleaf summarises these repricing mismatches.
For the purposes of the table, loan assets, borrowings and derivatives are allocated to time bands by reference to the earlier of the next contractual interest rate repricing date and the maturity dates.
For those fixed rate loan assets where the customer has contracted to make regular repayments of both capital and interest, the assets have been allocated across the time bands in the table by reference to the contracted repayments.
The analysis takes no account of early terminations which are likely to occur in practice.
In determining the amount of hedging required, the Group makes assumptions about the level of regular capital repayments and early terminations of its loan assets.
The actual interest rate sensitivity will therefore be determined by reference to subsequent customer and management decisions and is expected to be less sensitive than shown.
The table includes short term creditors and debtors.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The Asset and Liability Committee monitors the interest rate risk exposure on the Groups loan assets and asset backed loan notes and ensures compliance with the requirements of the trustees in respect of the Groups securitisations.
All derivative contracts are accounted for as hedges.
Changes in the fair value of instruments used as hedges are not recognised in the financial statements until the hedged position matures.

As a condition of the issue of these notes, interest rate and currency swaps were put in place for the duration of the borrowing having the effect of converting the liability to a LIBOR linked floating rate sterling borrowing.
As a result the Group has no material exposure to foreign currency risk.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Fair values have been determined for all derivatives, listed securities and any other financial assets and liabilities for which an active and liquid market exists.
The fair values of cash at bank and in hand, bank loans and overdrafts and asset backed loan notes are not materially different from their book values because all the assets mature within three months of the year end and the interest rates charged on financial liabilities reset on a quarterly basis.
