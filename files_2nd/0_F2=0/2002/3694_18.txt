The full impact on reserves is detailed in note 22.
The effect of the adoption of FRS 19 on the tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2002 is nil 2001 nil.
Excluding the goodwill amortisation of 12.7m 2001 11.9m and the prior year tax credit of 4.5m 2001 0.6m, the effective rate for the year would be 28.9% 2001 28.5%.
This adjusted tax charge is lower than the prevailing rates because part of the goodwill charge is an allowable expense for tax purposes and also because of the tax deduction on the contribution to the Qualifying Employee Share Trust, which is described in more detail in note 14 to the financial statements.
In 2002 agreement was received from the Inland Revenue concerning a previously outstanding matter for which the group had not taken benefit.
The tax assessed for the year is different to the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% 2001 30%.
The differences are explained below: 2002 2001 m m Profit on ordinary activities before tax 99.4 87.5 Profit on ordinary activities multiplied by standard rate in the UK 30% 2001 30% 29.8 26.2 Effects of: Tax disallowed items primarily goodwill amortisation 2.1 2.4 Capital allowances for year in excess of depreciation 6.2 2.6 Other timing differences 1.6 6.8 Overseas tax rates higher than UK rates 1.6 0.3 Expenditure qualifying for additional R&D tax deduction 0.8 Contribution to the QUEST 0.3 0.6 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of prior years 1.5 0.5 Current tax charge for the year 23.1 23.6 Factors that may affect future tax charges: The groups effective rate of current tax is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK primarily because of timing differences arising on fixed assets.
Based on present capital investment plans the group expects that this will remain broadly unchanged in the foreseeable future.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing property to its market value.
Also, no deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures as no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.

For fully diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The group has two categories: i those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys ordinary shares during the year, and ii shares contingently allocated to directors under the Cobham Long Term Incentive Plan.
The calculation of fully diluted earnings per share has been based on 71.2m 2001 59.6m being the profit after taxation, minority interests and preference dividend and on the weighted average number of the dilutive potential ordinary shares excluding the weighted effect of the 229,350 which were issued to the QUEST on 17 December 2002 being 101,875,012 2001 101,433,396.
In addition to the information required by FRS 14, the directors believe that it is helpful to calculate an underlying earnings per share figure.
The earnings per share on an underlying basis has been based on 87.1m 2001 75.6m, being the profit after taxation, minority interest and preference dividend, adjusted by the exclusion of amortisation of goodwill, integration costs and on the weighted average number of ordinary shares excluding the weighted effect of the 229,350 which were issued to the QUEST on 17 December 2002 in issue during the year, being 101,113,784 2001 100,288,474.

The principal UK scheme is valued by an independent qualified actuary every three years.
The most recent valuation of the scheme was at 1 April 2001 using the attained age funding method.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the valuation were that the long term annual rate of return would be 7.0%, dividend growth would be 4.25% per annum and the average annual increase to pensionable salaries and price inflation would be 5.0% and 2.5% respectively.
The market value of the assets of this scheme as at the date of the valuation was 150.6m.
The actuarial value of the assets at the valuation date was sufficient to cover 106% of the liabilities that have accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The next triennial valuation of the scheme is due to take place in 2004.
The scheme comprises both defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
From 1 January 2003, new employees may only join the defined contribution scheme.
The actuarial method used to determine the pension cost in the financial statements for the scheme is the attained age method.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted to determine the pension cost were that the long term annual rate of return would be 7.5%, dividend growth would be 4.75% per annum, the average increase in pensionable salaries would be 4.5% per annum and increases to pensions in payment would be 2.5% per annum or in accordance with the rules.
The pension charge for the year in respect of defined benefit schemes was 5.9m 2001 3.8m.
This included 0.8m 2001 2.5m in respect of experience surpluses that are being recognised over future service periods.
The cumulative amount by which the main UK schemes have been funded in excess of the SSAP 24 charge is carried as a prepayment in the balance sheet see note 16.
The main overseas schemes are in the USA and were assessed by qualified actuaries as at 1 January 2001.
The actuarial value of the assets of the schemes was sufficient to cover 106% of the liabilities that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The policy is to make contributions equal to or greater than the minimum based on USA pension law.
FRS 17 disclosures The transitional disclosure requirements of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits are given below.
The group operates a number of defined benefit schemes, including the Cobham Pension Plan CPP.

The QUEST was established during 2001 to acquire new shares in the company for the benefit of employees and directors of the group.
On 17 December 2002, the company provided 2.3m for this purpose of which 0.9m was by way of gift and 1.4m was by way of loan.
On the same date, the QUEST subscribed at market value for 229,350 of the companys ordinary shares.
The shares rank pari passu in all respects with the existing ordinary shares.
They will be transferred to employees and directors in satisfaction of options granted to them under the Cobham Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
The cost of the gift has been transferred by the company directly to the profit and loss account reserve.
The excess of the subscription price over the nominal value of the shares issued, which amounts to 2.3m, has been taken to the share premium account.
The shares held by the QUEST at 31 December 2002 have been included in the group balance sheet, as investment in own shares, at a value of 1.4m, which is equivalent to the amounts receivable from employees on exercise of their options.
The disposal of 1.4m relates to the sums received by the QUEST on the exercise of share options by participants in the above-mentioned scheme: the number of shares involved was 318,813.
The market value of the shares at 31 December 2002 was 2.4m.
Under the terms of the trust deed, dividends have been waived on the shares held by the QUEST and all costs relating to the above scheme are dealt with in the consolidated profit and loss account as they accrue.

The numerical disclosures are set out in notes 31 to 34.
The group has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments not to provide numerical disclosures in relation to short term debtors and creditors, other than currency risk disclosures.
Financial instruments The group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The group does not use complex derivative financial instruments.
Where it does use financial instruments these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal operations and to raise finance for the groups operations.
The groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and various items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The group also uses forward foreign currency contracts to manage transactional currency risks arising from the groups operations and interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risks.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the group in the area of financial instruments.
It is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The policies have remained unchanged throughout the year.
Foreign currency risk The group, which is based in the UK and reports in sterling, has significant investment in overseas operations in the USA, with further investments in other EU countries, Australia, Canada, South Africa and Asia.
As a result, the groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
The groups policy is to reduce, or eliminate where practicable, both structural and transactional foreign exchange risk.
Where significant, currency denominated net assets are partially hedged by currency borrowings.
Currency exposures are reviewed regularly and all significant foreign exchange transactions are approved by the parent company.
The pound US dollar exchange rate is the most important as far as Cobham is concerned, particularly given the level of US dollars which the subsidiaries expect to receive from their normal business activities.
In addition to the longer term borrowing structure, a number of financial instruments are used to manage the foreign exchange position, such as forward contracts.
The most significant of these instruments is a foreign exchange contract, which was entered into in 1997, whereby the group has agreed to swap dollars for sterling at a rate of 1 : US$1.6263 over the period to 2012 with US$95m of this commitment being outstanding at 31 December 2002.
Approximately US$13m of the commitment exists in 2003, US$53m from 2004 to 2007 with the balance of US$29m over the remaining five years.
It is the groups current belief that the net dollar receipts from its subsidiaries will exceed the level of the outstanding commitment.
The group also has transactional currency exposures.
Such exposures arise from sales and purchases by operating units in currencies other than the units functional currency.
The groups policy is to minimise trading in subsidiaries non operating currencies.
However, where this is impractical the group will seek to reduce its exposure through the use of forward contracts.
The group does not hedge balance sheet and profit and loss translation exposures.
Generally, borrowings are arranged in local currencies to provide a natural hedge against overseas assets.
Interest rate risk The group has various long and short term borrowings principally in sterling and US dollars at fixed and floating rates of interest.
The group is continually monitoring its exposure to movements in interest rates in order to bring greater stability and certainty with respect to borrowing costs.
Group policy is to assess borrowings with regard to fixed or variable rates of interest depending on prevailing market conditions, including instances where interest rate swaps are used.
Surplus funds are placed on short term deposit.
These deposits have floating rates of interest, and thus there is some modest exposure to interest rates.
Liquidity risk The group has a strong cash flow and where practicable the funds generated by operating companies are managed on a regional basis.
For short term working capital purposes in the UK, most operating companies utilise local bank facilities within an overall group arrangement.
In the USA a central treasury function is maintained which all US subsidiaries use.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
As regards liquidity, the groups policy has throughout the year been to maintain a mix of short, medium and long term borrowings with their lenders.
The private placement of Cobham guaranteed senior notes which raised US$225m in October 2002 enabled the group to reduce short term borrowings and increase long term borrowings.
Short term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities.
Details of the year end position, which is in accordance with this policy, are given in note 33.
It is, in addition, the groups policy to maintain undrawn committed borrowing facilities in order to provide flexibility in the management of the groups liquidity: details are also given in note 33.
80 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 31 Foreign Currency Risk The table below shows the extent to which group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currency.
Foreign exchange differences on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account of the group companies and the group.

Hedges of foreign currency transactions As described above, it is the groups policy to partially hedge foreign currency denominated net assets by currency borrowings.
As these are not formally matched, the group recognises all gains and losses on these in the period they are incurred.
As at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001 the group had no unrecognised or deferred gains or losses on forward contracts.

Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale, and excludes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
For floating rate loans, fair values closely approximate to cost.
