CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Risk assessment: continued All business units are required to undertake a risk profiling exercise to formally review their principal areas of risk so that all major risks are reviewed at all levels across the Group.
This formal system is based on the annual submission of risk assessment reviews from each business unit for the measurement and assessment of risk areas, together with the controls embedded in the business processes to mitigate such risks.
This review is ongoing and is being extended to acquired businesses to ensure the Group continues to have clear and consistent procedures for monitoring, updating and implementing appropriate controls to minimise the risk exposure so identified.
The Audit Committee has delegated responsibility for considering Group-wide operational, financial and compliance risks on a regular basis.
Regular reporting by the Control and Compliance function supports the Audit Committee and the Board in assessing the effectiveness of internal controls at each business unit, through a programme of regular reviews.
In this way, it seeks to minimise the risks identified and satisfies itself that the levels of retained risk are acceptable to the Group.
Control environment and control activities: The Group consists of a number of manufacturing and trading operations each with its own management and control structures which satisfy the Groups accounting policies and local control responsibilities.
The Board has revised the organisational structure to ensure that, for the enlarged Group, clearly defined lines of responsibility, delegation of authority and segregation of duties, with staff of the necessary calibre to fulfil their allotted roles, remain in place.
These procedures for delegated authority ensure that decisions, significant either because of the value or the impact on other parts of the Group, are taken at an appropriate level.
The full Board has formally adopted a schedule of matters of a strategic, financial, operational or compliance nature which are required to be brought to it for decision.
Imperial Tobacco Group has a framework of policies and procedures laid down by the Board and personnel are required to comply with these procedures.
In addition it should be noted that Reemtsma also has a similar framework of procedures to which its employees are required to comply.
Following the acquisition, these existing policies and procedures which cover key issues such as authorisation levels, segregation of duties, ethical compliance matters and legislation, physical and data security as well as regulatory, governance, and health, safety and environmental issues are being integrated and consolidated.
The Group has an established and consistent methodology for identifying and ranking business risks and has implemented appropriate strategies to deal with each significant risk that has been identified.
These strategies include not only internal controls but other approaches such as insurance and dual sourcing of supplies.
This methodology is reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure it continues to accurately reflect the relevant risks and takes into account necessary movements in the Groups risk profile consequent upon changes in the business operations.
There are well-defined procedures for appraisal, approval, control and review of capital and strategic expenditure including acquisitions.
The Groups treasury function operates within the defined policy designed to control the Groups financing arrangements and to minimise its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks through specialised treasury instruments.
Information and communication: Operating companies are required to produce detailed operating budgets prior to the start of each financial year, which are reviewed for robustness and realism.
A comprehensive system of budgetary controls including monthly and regular periodic performance reviews for each business unit are in place to ensure that major variances are promptly and thoroughly investigated.
These reviews are conducted at a detailed level within each business unit and at a high level by the Executive Directors.
On a monthly basis, the achievement of business objectives, both financial and non-financial, is assessed using a range of key performance indicators.
These indicators are reviewed to ensure that they remain relevant and reliable.
Monitoring: A range of procedures is used to review the risk profile and monitor the effective application of internal control in the Group.
These include self assessment of controls and annual certification of compliance with the Groups financial and operational procedures by the managing director or senior executive of each business unit including compliance with environmental, health and safety and business conduct standards together with independent reviews by the Control and Compliance function.
The Control and Compliance functions responsibilities include reporting to the Audit Committee on the effectiveness of internal control systems, focusing on those areas with the greatest perceived risk to the Group.
The compliance programme is designed to review controls across key areas of risk over a three-year cycle.
Follow-up procedures ensure there is an appropriate response to recommendations for enhancement to risk controls.. 37 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The Audit Committee confirms it has reviewed and reported to the Board on the system of internal control for the year ended 28 September 2002.
Through the procedural and reporting framework for monitoring business risks and controls, as set out above, and review of the Groups financial statements, it is satisfied there is sufficient information to enable it to review the effectiveness of the Groups system of internal control.
Going concern The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to meets its operational needs for the foreseeable future and accordingly they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Pension fund Imperial Tobacco Group PLCs main pension fund, the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund, is not controlled by the Board, but by Trustees, consisting of five nominees from the Company, one member chosen by employees and two by current and deferred pensioners.
The Trustees look after the assets of the pension fund, which are held separately from those of the Company and are managed by independent fund managers.
The Pension scheme funds can only be used in accordance with its rules and for no other purpose.
Communication with shareholders Communication with all shareholders is given a high priority and a number of methods are used to promote greater understanding and dialogue with investment audiences.
The Groups Annual Review, a summary financial statement, provides shareholders with the material information concerning Imperial Tobacco Group in a form more readily assimilated than the full Annual Report and Accounts.
Shareholders can also request the full report and Form 20-F. At the half year an Interim Report is published.
All of these documents are available on-line through the Imperial Tobacco website www.
com, together with all announcements, investor presentations and share price information.
During the year shareholders are kept informed of the progress of the Group through trading statements and other announcements of significant developments that are released through the London Stock Exchange and other news services.
There is regular dialogue with institutional shareholders and participation in sector conferences.
Additionally, there is an opportunity at the Annual General Meeting for individual shareholders to question the Chairman and the chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees.
It is the Companys practice to make arrangements to send the Annual Report and Accounts to shareholders at least 20 working days prior to the Annual General Meeting.
The Company indicates the level of proxy votes lodged in respect of each resolution proposed at its Annual General Meeting following each vote on a show of hands.
Statement of Directors responsibilities Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at the balance sheet date and of the profit or loss and the cash flows of the Group for that period.
The Directors consider that suitable accounting policies have been used and applied consistently.
They also confirm that reasonable judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 28 September 2002 and that applicable Accounting Standards have been followed.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Groups website.
Information published on the Internet is accessible in many countries with different legal requirements.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement of Auditors responsibilities Imperial Tobacco Group PLCs Registered Auditors, , are responsible for forming an independent opinion on the accounts of the Group as presented by the Directors, and for reporting their opinion to shareholders.
Their report is set out on page 47.. 38 REMUNERATION REPORT Remuneration Committee Although the Board considers itself ultimately responsible for the framework and cost of executive remuneration, it has delegated responsibility for determining the remuneration levels and conditions of service of Executive Directors of the Company and senior executives of the Group to the Remuneration Committee.
The Committees approach is fully consistent with the Groups overall philosophy that all employees should be competitively rewarded to attract and retain their valued skills in the business as well as supporting corporate strategy, by directly aligning executive management with the Groups strategic business goals.
The members of the Committee are Mr I J G Napier chairman, Mr D C Bonham, Mr S Huismans and the recently appointed Dr P H Jungels, each being an independent Non-Executive Director of the Company and having no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
The Committee, which was established in 1996 and operates under clear written terms of reference, confirms formally that its constitution and operation comply with the principles set out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance and has applied the principles in Section 1 of that Code throughout the year.
Remuneration strategy Imperial Tobacco Group PLC operates in an increasingly competitive international environment.
For the Group to continue to compete successfully, it is essential that the level of remuneration and benefits offered achieves the objectives of attracting, developing, retaining and motivating the necessary high quality pool of talented employees, at all levels, across the Group.
The Group therefore sets out to provide competitive remuneration to all its employees, appropriate to the business environment in those countries in which it operates.
As the Group continues to develop internationally and integrate acquisitions such as the Reemtsma business, it is having increasing regard to the need to relocate employees from country to country as the requirements of the business dictate and develop its remuneration arrangements accordingly.
The remuneration strategy is therefore designed not only to align with the Groups fundamental values of fairness, competitiveness and equity but also to support the Groups corporate strategy, as a significant contributor to competitive advantage.
A cohesive reward structure with a timely pay review process, consistently applied to all employees and well communicated to ensure each element of the package is understood with links to corporate performance recognised is seen as critical in ensuring all employees can associate with and buy into the attainment of the Groups strategic goals.
The Group also seeks to align the interests of shareholders and employees at all levels by giving employees opportunities and encouragement to build up a shareholding interest in the Group.
Through a series of share plan initiatives, under the UK Sharesave Scheme, the International Sharesave Plan and Share Matching arrangements, the majority of employees of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, excluding Reemtsma, now have a shareholding interest.
Employees within the Reemtsma group of companies will be invited to participate in share plans at the earliest opportunity.
Executive remuneration policy The remuneration package for Executive Directors and senior executives, as determined by the Remuneration Committee, is intended to attract and retain high quality executives, induce loyalty and motivate them to achieve a high level of corporate performance in line with the best interests of shareholders, while not being excessive.
The package is also in line with the Groups overall policy on pay and benefits.
The remuneration package for each senior executive is set by the Committee after taking advice principally from external sources including remuneration consultants, mainly Towers Perrin, who were appointed by the Committee, together with internal sources, including the Company Secretary and Group Compensation and Benefits Manager.
It combines short-term and long-term rewards, including performance-related elements that take into account individual, business unit and corporate performance.
The main components are base salary, an annual cash bonus, a Share Matching Scheme, a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and pension benefits as detailed below.
Unless stated otherwise the policy is expected to remain unchanged for the financial year ending 30 September 2003 and subsequent years.
To align further the interests of directors and shareholders, the directors remuneration package is weighted towards performance-related elements including an annual cash bonus which maximises at two thirds of salary and an LTIP award of three-quarters of salary.
Directors can also invest up to their gross bonus in a Share Matching Scheme where lodged shares are matched 1:1 over a three-year period.
As the Group extends its business internationally, it takes account of market practices outside the UK where the scope of a particular executives role warrants this approach.
Base salary Base salary is reviewed annually and is determined by reference to individual responsibilities, performance and external market data.
Therefore it is set to reflect the experience, responsibility, effectiveness and market value of the executive.. 39 REMUNERATION REPORT Annual cash bonus Executive Directors can earn bonuses, of up to two-thirds of base salary, by reference to performance against financial targets determined by the Committee.
These annual bonuses do not form part of pensionable earnings.
During the period under review, bonus targets related wholly to the achievement of Group profit objectives.
Performance in the year has resulted in bonuses as detailed in the table on page 42 being awarded.
A cash bonus was also earned by other senior executives for achieving performance targets for the year to 28 September 2002.
Under the Share Matching Scheme, Executive Directors and management may elect to invest any proportion of their gross bonus in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares to be held by the Employee Benefit Trusts.
Provided that the shares lodged are left in the Trust for three years, the participant will receive the original shares plus additional shares equal in number to the original shares.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP Each year since demerger in 1996, annual awards, worth 75% of basic salary, have been made to Executive Directors under the LTIP.
The awards, which vest three years after grant, are subject to the satisfaction of an applicable performance criterion, as set out below, over a threeyear performance period.
It is anticipated that a further conditional award worth 75% of basic salary will be made during November 2002.
The performance criterion, imposed on all awards made under the LTIP until November 2000, is based on a sliding scale depending on total shareholder return achieved over the period of the award.
No vesting of the award occurs unless the Companys total shareholder return exceeds that of 50% of the companies constituting the FTSE 100 Index.
At this performance threshold 30% of the provisional award vests.
If the return exceeds 80% of the Index, the award vests in full.
Between these thresholds the award vests on a straight line basis.
On vesting a participant is granted a nil cost option to acquire the relevant number of shares.
The option may be exercised at any time up to the seventh anniversary of its date of grant.
The Committee recognises that it is never easy to set meaningful long-term performance targets in a rapidly changing business environment and in the context of volatile stock markets.
The dramatic fall in the FTSE 100 index between December 2000 and September 2002 has seen returns drop significantly.
Some companies in the upper quartile have negative returns.
This raises the possibility of some executives in companies with performance criteria based on relative total shareholder return receiving maximum awards under long-term incentive plans while shareholders have lost money.
The Committee therefore regularly reviews the appropriateness of the performance conditions under the LTIP to ensure they remain demanding, yet realistic, and effectively incentivise participants to perform at the highest level.
In December 2000, in consultation with Towers Perrin, it was decided that total shareholder return no longer represented the most appropriate performance criterion for measuring future performance.
For the November 2000 and future awards, the Committee decided to replace total shareholder return with earnings per share EPS growth as the new performance criterion.
This is seen as enhancing the incentive effect of the Plan by focusing on the financial performance of the business, over which Directors and executives have power to influence, rather than linking awards to a volatile share price unduly influenced by short-term sector sentiment.
The Committee nevertheless retains absolute discretion to ensure that the EPS performance criterion fully reflects the underlying performance of the Group before any awards vest, including maintenance of long-term return on capital employed.
Awards vest on a sliding scale depending on average real growth in EPS after adjusting for inflation over the period of the award.
No vesting occurs unless the Companys average real EPS growth is positive.
Full vesting occurs if real EPS growth is equal to, or exceeds 10%.
Between these two points the awards vests on a straight line basis e. g. 50% vesting where the average real EPS growth per annum is equal to 5%.
There is no opportunity to re-test if the performance criteria are not achieved.
Share Matching Scheme SMS In January 1997, employees were encouraged to acquire and retain Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares, when they were offered an opportunity to purchase up to 3,000 worth of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC shares and lodge them with the Employee Benefit Trust under a Share Matching Scheme.
Provided that the shares were left in the Trust, the lodged shares were matched with additional shares on a sliding scale up to a maximum of 50% when the Scheme matured in January 2002.
Employees purchasing 3,000 shares in 1997 would have increased the value of their investment by over two and a half times to 10,670 by the addition of the matched shares and share price increases, valued on the day of vesting.
To encourage employees further to acquire and retain a shareholding, the initiative was repeated in 2002 to mark the centenary of the founding of The Imperial Tobacco Company of Great Britain and Ireland Limited.
All employees of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries employed on 10 December 2001, the date of the centenary, were invited to purchase up to 3,000 worth of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares and lodge them with the Employee Benefit Trust.
Provided these shares are left in the Trust, the lodged shares will be matched on a sliding scale from 20% for one years retention to a maximum of 100% if they are retained for five years.
As detailed under Annual cash bonus above, the Scheme also allows Executive Directors and management to take their bonus in shares which are matched over a three-year period.
The matching ratio for bonuses earned in the 1996 97 financial year was 1:2.
For subsequent years this ratio has been enhanced to 1:1 to further encourage Directors and managers to build a meaningful shareholding in the Group.. 40 REMUNERATION REPORT Executive share retention To ensure the interests of management remain aligned with those of shareholders, Executive Directors and senior executives are required to meet minimum shareholding guidelines by building a stake in the Group to a minimum value broadly equivalent to twice their base salary.
At a more junior level executives are expected to invest at a level equivalent to their base salary.
Effects of the rights issue To take account of the effects of the rights issue approved on 8 April 2002, adjustments were made to awards under Groups share plans.
In respect of the Share Matching Scheme, the Trustee sold sufficient rights nil paid to enable the balance of the rights to be taken up, using the proceeds of the sale.
The newly acquired shares were allocated pro-rata to the relevant participants and will be released on the same basis as the awards to which they relate.
In the case of savings-related Sharesave Schemes and the LTIP, the Board adjusted the number of shares under option, or subject to awards also in the case of the savings-related Sharesave Schemes the price at which the shares may be acquired was adjusted.
These adjustments, in line with scheme rules, have been approved by the Groups Auditors and, where appropriate, the Inland Revenue.
Benefits The principal taxable benefits for Executive Directors are the provision of cars, health insurance, a tobacco allowance and subscriptions.
Service contracts Each of the Executive Directors employment agreements is terminable by either party giving 52 weeks notice.
There are no predetermined provisions for compensation on termination within Executive Directors service agreements, which exceed one years emoluments.
In respect of Mr M A Hussler the Remuneration Committee has exceptionally agreed that the requisite notice period at the commencement of his appointment shall be 104 weeks.
This is reducing at the rate of two weeks per calendar month until such time as the notice period shall reach 52 weeks in July 2004.
The initial longer notice period on first appointment was deemed essential to retain his services, which involved him in international relocation and foregoing the five-year fixed-term contract he enjoyed within the Reemtsma group of companies.
This run-down arrangement also matches the notice period arrangements granted to Imperial Tobacco Group Directors upon listing in 1996.
Under the rules of the LTIP and Share Matching Scheme outstanding awards vest on termination on a time-related pro-rata basis.
If however the termination is by resignation or dismissal for misconduct the award lapses.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company, however the terms of their appointments are reviewed annually.
Remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors Fees for Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole with regard to market practice within the restrictions contained in the Articles of Association.
The Non-Executive Directors do not take part in discussions on their own remuneration.
They receive no other material pay or benefits with the exception of reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with their Directorship of the Company and do not participate in the Companys share schemes, bonus schemes or incentive plans and are not eligible for pension scheme membership.
To align further the interest of the Non-Executive Directors with those of shareholders it was agreed that a proportion of their fees be applied, after tax, to purchase shares in the Group.
These shares are to be held by a nominee during the term of each Non-Executive Directorship.
Mr S Huismans and Mr L W Staby are also members of Supervisory Boards within the Reemtsma group for which they receive additional remuneration, in line with normal practice for Supervisory Board members.
Remuneration arrangements for former Director Following his retirement in May 2000, Mr S T Painter entered into a consultancy agreement with Imperial Tobacco Limited, the Groups principal operating company.
The agreement, as amended in October 2001, runs for four years to June 2004.
Under the terms of the agreement he provides consultancy services as required and receives fees at a day rate of 1,000 with a minimum fee based on 100 days services for each 12 month period ending on 30 June.
Mr S T Painter is also entitled to reimbursement for the use of his car under the provisions of the Inland Revenue Fixed Profit Car Scheme.
Mr S T Painter is also a member of Supervisory Boards within the Reemtsma group for which he receives additional remuneration.. 41 REMUNERATION REPORT DIRECTORS EMOLUMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 SEPTEMBER 2002 2002 2001 000 000 Executive Directors Salary 1,021 1,075 Benefits 26 33 Bonus 680 716 1 LTIP annual vesting 649 848 1 LTIP vesting on retirement 376 2 SMS vesting 839 109 3,591 2,781 Non-Executive Directors Fees 362 352 Benefits 4 2 Reemtsma Supervisory Boards 10 376 354 Total emoluments of Directors 3,967 3,135 Former Director Consultancy fees to former Director 128 94 Reemtsma Supervisory Boards 5 133 94 Total emoluments of Directors and former Director 4,100 3,229 1 Value of LTIP shares vesting on maturity or retirement, if earlier, based on the closing share price on the day of vesting.

Share options The Company does not operate an executive share option scheme, although Executive Directors are eligible to participate in Imperial Tobacco Group PLCs savings-related Sharesave Scheme.
Under this Scheme, options are granted at a discount of up to 20% of the closing mid-market price on the day prior to invitation, to participants who have contracted to save up to 250 per month over a period of three or five years.. 43 REMUNERATION REPORT Executive Directors share options Exercise Market price Range of exercisable Gains on price at rebased dates of exercise Balance Granted Exercised Rights date of Balance where options during 2 at during during issue exercise at appropriate held at the year 2001 1 30 9 01 the year the year adjustment 28 9 02 28 9 02 000 000 G Davis 3,532 3,532 11.40 2.93 1 3 2002 31 8 2002 30 1,911 373 2,284 3.02 1 7 2003 31 12 2003 1,205 1,205 8.24 1 8 2007 31 1 2008 5,443 1,205 3,532 373 3,489 30 R Dyrbus 1,345 265 1,610 3.61 1 8 2003 31 1 2004 670 132 802 4.83 1 8 2004 31 1 2005 2,015 397 2,412 5 C A C Inston 3,532 3,532 2.93 1 3 2002 31 8 2003 1,911 1,911 3.61 1 7 2003 31 12 2003 5,443 5,443 1 Or date of retirement if earlier 2 Gains made on exercise, calculated as the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the date of exercise.

However, based on the total shareholder return to the end of the financial year, the Group ranked first in the FTSE Index therefore 100% of the award would vest.
For illustrative purposes only, the share price on 20 November 2002, being the latest practicable date prior to publication, was 9.89 valuing the awards as follows: Award vesting Award vesting Award lapsing No.

of shares which options granted 000 G Davis 63,226 625 R Dyrbus 37,152 367 The value of any awards vesting in January 2003 could vary significantly from the above due to share price movements.
The Remuneration Committee regards the November 2000 November 2003 and the November 2001 November 2004 awards to be too distant from maturity to be included in the value projected above.
However, in respect of these awards, adjusted earnings per share have grown by more than 10% in real terms in the financial year and therefore, if this performance were to be maintained over the relevant performance periods both awards would vest.
The total shareholder return for these performance periods ranked the Group in second and first places in the FTSE Index respectively therefore if total shareholder return had remained the performance criterion full vesting would also have occured.
In respect of annual bonuses earned in 2000 2001, the Executive Directors elected to take the majority of their bonus in the form of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares to be held by the Employee Benefit Trust under the Scheme.
These will be matched with additional shares: equal in number to the original shares provided they are left in the Trust for three years.
These additional shares are shown within contingent rights above.
In respect of Directors holding office at the year end, there have been no further changes since 28 September 2002.
The Companys middle market share price at the close of business on 27 September 2002 was 10.02 and the range of the middle market prices during the year were 6.86 8.20 unadjusted for the rights issue to 11.60.. 45 REMUNERATION REPORT Employee Benefit Trusts The Imperial Tobacco Group Employee and Executive Benefit Trust and the Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2001 Employee Benefit Trust have been established to acquire ordinary shares in the Company, by subscription or purchase, from funds provided by the Group to satisfy rights to shares arising on the exercise of share options and on the vesting of the share matching and performance-related share awards.
As potential beneficiaries of the Employee and Executive Benefit Trust, each of the Executive Directors is deemed to have a contingent interest in the 607,644 ordinary shares of the Company held by that Trust at 28 September 2002.
Normally the Employee and Executive Benefit Trust is funded to purchase shares sufficient to cover its potential liabilities while the 2001 Employee Benefit Trust makes periodic purchases in the market in order to satisfy its liabilities.
Directors pensions The Executive Directors are all members of the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund, the principal defined benefit scheme operated by the Group.
For members who joined prior to 1 April 2002 the fund is non-contributory and fully funded with a normal retirement age of 60.
The fund allows members to achieve the maximum pension of two-thirds of their salary at normal retirement age after 32 years service.
For members joining on or after 1 April 2002 New Members, including Mr M A Hussler, employee contributions of 5% of pensionable salary are payable, the normal retirement age is 65 and maximum pension is achieved after 40 years service.
Pension commutation to enable participants to receive a lump sum on retirement is permitted within Inland Revenue limits.
For death before retirement, a capital sum equal to four times salary is payable together with a spouses pension of two-thirds half for New Members of the members expected pension at retirement.
For death in retirement, a spouses pension of two-thirds half for New Members of the members pre-commutation pension is payable.
Dependant children will also receive allowances.
Other than for New Members, whose pensions after retirement increase by the lesser of 5% and the increase in the general index of retail prices RPI pensions increase by the lesser of 10% and the increase in RPI, together with an option under the rules to surrender part of a pension for pension increases in line with the general index of retail prices of up to 15%.
All Executive Directors earn benefits on the standard scale with a normal retirement age of 60 except Mr M A Hussler, whose normal retirement age is 63.
In addition to the pension arrangement above, the Remuneration Committee has decided that Mr M A Hussler will receive a similar benefit to that which he would have received had he remained in his former Reemtsma plan.
Under his former, non-contributory, plan he would have received 42% of his final salary upon retirement at age 63.
Upon retirement Mr M A Hussler will receive his accrued pension from the Reemtsma plan and the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund.
The Company has undertaken to provide for any shortfall between the pensions payable from the above plans and the agreed benefit.
The Company has been advised by its actuary that the estimated actuarial present value of this shortfall will be in the order of 1.3m in respect of Mr M A Husslers future service.

Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors The Directors responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and Accounting Standards are set out in the Statement of Directors responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements, United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Report of the Directors is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law or the Listing Rules regarding Directors remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
The other information comprises the Chairmans statement, operating and financial review, operating environment, the corporate governance statement and the remuneration report.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Companys compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the Boards statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys or Groups corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the United Kingdom Auditing Practices Board and with the Auditing Standards generally accepted in the United States.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit work so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
United Kingdom opinion In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 28 September 2002 and of the profit and cash flows of the Group for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
United States opinion In our opinion the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group at 28 September 2002 and 29 September 2001 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended 28 September 2002, 29 September 2001 and 23 September 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom.
These principles differ in certain respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The effect of the differences in the determination of net income, shareholders equity and cash flows is shown in note 29 to the financial statements.

50 ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounts have been prepared in accordance with Accounting Standards currently applicable in the United Kingdom.
The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, are set out below.
Basis of accounting The accounts have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts incorporate the audited accounts of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC and all its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of businesses are included from the effective date of acquisition and businesses sold are included up to the date of disposal.
The principal operating subsidiary undertakings are listed on pages 91 and 92.
US filing and corresponding amounts The financial statements incorporate the financial information required to satisfy the Companys US Form 20-F filing requirements which includes three year profit and loss account and cash flow statement information.
Intangible fixed assets goodwill Businesses acquired have been dealt with in the consolidated accounts using acquisition accounting.
Upon the acquisition of a business, the fair values that reflect the condition at the date of acquisition are attributed to the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Adjustments are also made to bring the accounting policies of the businesses acquired into alignment with those of the Group.
Where the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is treated as goodwill.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions made on or after 27 September 1998 is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life, a period not exceeding 20 years.
Previously all goodwill was written off against reserves in the period of acquisition.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a previously acquired business, the profit or loss on disposal is determined after including the attributable amount of purchased goodwill previously written off to reserves.
Intangible fixed assets trade marks and licences Trade marks and licences are included at cost and depreciated in annual equal instalments over a period which does not exceed 20 years.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are shown at cost less depreciation.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Depreciation of other fixed assets is calculated to write off their cost less residual values over their expected useful lives as follows: Freehold and leasehold buildings up to 50 years straight line General plant and equipment 2 to 24 years straight line reducing balance Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years straight line Impairment of fixed assets The carrying value of fixed assets is subject to periodic review and any impairment is charged to the profit and loss account.
Capitalisation of interest Interest incurred on borrowings for the financing of long-term capital projects is capitalised at the weighted average cost of the related borrowings up to the date of completion of the project.
Stocks Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
Cost includes an addition for overheads where appropriate.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided in full on all material timing differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is considered more likely than not.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities have not been discounted.
Turnover Turnover represents the amount charged to customers in respect of goods supplied, exclusive of VAT but inclusive of excise duty.. 51 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Research and development Expenditure on research and development is written off in the period in which it is incurred.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction, or where forward cover contracts have been arranged, at the contracted rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, where a contracted rate does not apply, are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date and any exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
The profit and loss accounts of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average rate of exchange ruling during the year.
The balance sheets of the overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Differences between the profit and loss accounts translated at average rates and at balance sheet rates are shown as a movement in reserves and in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The Groups significant overseas equity investments are hedged by borrowings in the currencies in which those assets are denominated.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of the overseas net investments, including goodwill, less exchange differences on the borrowings, to the extent that they finance those investments, are taken to reserves through the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Other exchange gains and losses are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
Instruments qualify for hedge accounting where the underlying asset or liability has characteristics which can be directly related to the instrument transacted.
The gains and losses on those instruments, qualifying for hedge accounting, are recognised in the financial statements over the life of the transaction.
All current derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting under UK GAAP.
The Group excludes all short-term debtors and creditors from its derivatives and financial instrument disclosures other than those on currency risks relating to monetary assets and liabilities.
Pension costs The cost of providing pensions is charged to the profit and loss account over employees service lives.
Variances arising from actuarial valuations are charged or credited to profit over the estimated remaining service lives of the employees, to the extent that any resulting credit does not exceed the regular cost.
Interest Interest payable and receivable is recognised in the profit and loss account on an accruals basis, subject to interest capitalised in respect of capital projects.
Derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps, are used to reduce exposure to interest rate movements on a proportion of floating rate debt.
Hedge accounting is applied to these transactions and as a result the interest differentials under these transactions are recognised in the financial statements by adjustment of interest payable and receivable over the life of the transactions.. 52 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 Segmental information The Group is engaged in only one class of business: the manufacture, marketing and distribution of tobacco products and tobacco-related accessories.
The geographical analysis has been amended to reflect more appropriately, in the opinion of the Directors, the activities of the enlarged Group.
The effect of the changes is to split what was previously International, into Germany, Other Western Europe and Rest of the World.
The comparatives have been adjusted to reflect both the new segments and a more appropriate ongoing basis of overhead allocation.

This incurred one-off facility arrangement fees of 45m which have been fully expensed in the period as exceptional finance charges, partially offset by a 12m foreign exchange gain resulting from hedging arrangements to exchange the sterling equity issuance into euros.. 56 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 6Taxation Analysis of charge in the year In s million 2002 2001 2000 Current tax UK Corporation tax at 30.0% 2001: 30.0%: 2000: 30.0% 98 96 95 Adjustments to current tax in respect of prior years 1 4 5 97 92 90 Overseas Current 70 43 32 Total current tax 167 135 122 Deferred tax Origination and reversal of timing differences 27 45 27 45 Total tax charge 140 139 127 The tax charge includes tax relief on exceptional items of 37m.
Factors affecting the current tax charge for the year Pre-goodwill amortisation, the tax assessed for the year at 27.7% is lower than the standard higher rate of corporation tax in the UK 30.0%.
Post-goodwill amortisation, the effective tax rate exceeded 30.0% and the differences are explained below: In s million 2002 2001 2000 Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 423 494 450 Profit on ordinary activities multiplied by standard rate of corporation tax in 127 148 135 the UK of 30.0% 2001: 30.0%: 2000: 30.0% Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1 23 Non-deductible goodwill 25 2 Lower tax rates on overseas earnings 12 8 10 Current deferred tax 27 4 5 Other 1 5 1 Total current tax 167 135 122 Factors that may affect future tax charges No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains rolled over into replacement assets.
Such tax would become payable only if the assets were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief.
The total amount unprovided is 6m and it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, as no dividends have been declared.
The Group does not intend to remit dividends in future but if it were to there would be an immaterial tax charge as a result.. 57 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 7 Dividends on ordinary shares In s million 2002 2001 2000 Interim 10.0p Restated: 2001: 9.0p: 2000: 8.4p 62 56 52 Proposed final 23.0p Restated: 2001: 19.8p: 2000: 18.0p 167 122 111 229 178 163 Comparative dividend per ordinary share figures and the interim dividend per share for 2002 have been adjusted for the bonus element of the two for five discounted rights issue approved on 8 April 2002.

Previously, adjusted earnings per share had been calculated using earnings before amortisation of the intangible assets acquired in Australia and New Zealand in September 1999, and the purchase of the EFKA group, the Baelen group, Tobaccor and Mayfair vending business assets in 2001.

i Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its borrowings and surplus cash.
In order to manage interest rate risk, the Group maintains both fixed and floating rate debt and uses derivatives, including interest rate and cross currency swaps, to vary the mix.
The following table analyses the currency and interest composition of the Groups financial liabilities at the balance sheet date.

The majority of bank borrowings bear interest at rates fixed in advance for periods of one month and three months by reference to LIBOR in the case of sterling and Australian dollar borrowings and EURIBOR in the case of euro borrowings.
The capital market issuance in place at the year end bear interest post interest and currency swaps at rates fixed in advance for six months by reference to LIBOR in the case of the US dollar bond and three months by reference to EURIBOR in the case of the sterling and euro bonds.
The figures shown in the tables above take into account various interest rate and currency swaps.
Hence the US dollar denominated bond issued in 1999 is shown within the sterling balance, and the sterling bond issued in 2002 is shown in the euro balance.
The fixed rate financial liabilities do not take into account the forward start swaps, which become effective after the balance sheet date.. 63 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 15 Borrowings and financial instruments continued ii Currency risk disclosure The Group is exposed to the translation of the results of overseas subsidiaries into sterling, as well as the impact of trading transactions in foreign currencies.
On significant acquisitions of overseas companies, borrowings are raised in the local currency to minimise the translation risk.
For transaction risk, where necessary, forward foreign exchange deals are entered into to hedge a proportion of the forecast foreign currency cashflows.
At the year end, 32.6m notional of forward foreign exchange deals were outstanding 2001: nil.

The provision covers committed costs which are expected to be incurred by the end of 2003.
Unfunded pension obligations relate to pension schemes in Europe.
The Groups main pension schemes are held in separately administered funds and are described in note 23.
Other provisions principally relate to a long-term marketing contract which will be utilised by October 2006.
The amounts provided for deferred taxation and the amounts unprovided were as follows: Provided Unprovided In s million 2002 2001 2002 2001 Excess of capital allowances 96 13 Chargeable gains on property 4 6 5 Short-term timing differences 37 1 1 1 Other 3 59 16 8 4 17 Called up share capital In s million 2002 2001 Authorised 1,000,000,000 ordinary shares of 10p each 100 100 Issued and fully paid 729,200,921 ordinary shares of 10p each 2001: 520,857,801 73 52 The Companys two for five discounted rights issue approved on 8 April 2002 created a total of 208,343,120 ordinary shares of 10p each issued at 480p per share.
In respect of the Share Matching Scheme, the Trustees sold sufficient rights nil paid to enable the balance of the rights to be taken up.
In the case of the Sharesave and LTIP Schemes the number of shares under option, or subject to awards, were adjusted.
In the case of the Sharesave Scheme the option price was also adjusted.. 72 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 18 Share options continued UK Sharesave Scheme Under the terms of the Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Sharesave Scheme the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company to UK employees who enter into an Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn SAYE savings contract.
The price at which options may be offered is up to 20% less than the mid-market price of an Imperial Tobacco Group PLC share on the London Stock Exchange on the day prior to the invitation.
The options may normally be exercised during the period of six months after the expiry of the SAYE contract, either three or five years after entering the Scheme.
International Sharesave Plan Under the Plan the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares or American Depositary Shares ADSs in the Company to non-UK employees who enter into a savings contract.
The price at which options may be offered varies depending on local laws, but for ordinary shares will not be less than 80% of the mid-market price of an Imperial Tobacco Group PLC share on the London Stock Exchange on the day prior to invitation.
In respect of ADSs the price will not be less than 80% of the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on the same day.
Options may normally be exercised during the six months after expiry of the savings contract, three years after entering the Plan.
Long-Term Incentive Plan In respect of the performance period ending in December 2001, the Companys total shareholder return ranked the Company between 14th and 15th position in the FTSE 100 Index, exceeding the bottom 85 companies in the Index and therefore the award vested in full on 9 January 2002.
In respect of the December 1999 December 2002 award, the extent of vesting cannot be determined until the end of the performance period.
However, based on the total shareholder return to the end of the financial year, full vesting would occur.
Share Matching Scheme The Share Matching Scheme is designed to encourage employees to acquire and retain Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares.
In January 1997, employees of the Group were given the opportunity to purchase up to 3,000 worth of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares and lodge them with the Employee Benefit Trust under a share matching arrangement.
Provided that the shares were left in the Trust, the lodged shares were matched with additional shares on a sliding scale ranging from 10% for one years retention, up to a maximum of 50% for five years retention.
For Executive Directors and selected management, individuals may elect to invest any proportion of their gross bonus in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares to be held by the Employee Benefit Trusts.
Provided that the shares elected for are left in the Trusts for three years, and the individual remains in employment with the Group, the participant would receive the original shares plus additional shares.
For subsequent years this ratio has been enhanced to 1:1 to further encourage Directors and managers to build a meaningful shareholding in the Group.
To encourage employees further to acquire and retain a shareholding, there was an initiative in 2002 to mark the centenary of the founding of The Imperial Tobacco Company of Great Britain and Ireland Limited.
Employee Share Ownership Trusts ESOT The Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Employee and Executive Benefit Trust and the Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2001 Employee Benefit Trust have been established to acquire ordinary shares in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, by subscription or purchase, from funds provided by the Group to satisfy rights to shares arising on the exercise of share options and on the vesting of the share matching and performance-related share awards.
At 28 September 2002, the Trusts held 3.9m 2001: 3.7m ordinary shares, with a nominal value of 385,342, all acquired in the open market at a cost of 26.7m 2001: 18.4m.
These were financed by a gift of 1.7m and an interest free loan of 25m.
None of the ESOT shares have been allocated to employees or Directors as at 28 September 2002.
All finance costs and administration expenses connected with the ESOT are charged to the profit and loss account as they accrue.
The cost of the shares is being amortised over the performance period of the associated schemes.
The Trusts have waived their rights to dividends and the shares held by the Trusts are excluded from the calculation of basic earnings per share.. 73 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 19 Reserves Share premium Profit and In s million account loss account As at 23 September 2000 1,331 Profit for the year 172 Goodwill exchange movements 17 Other net exchange movements 4 Taxation debit on unhedged borrowings 2 As at 29 September 2001 1,174 Premium on rights issue shares 979 Issue costs of rights issue 15 Profit for the year 43 Goodwill exchange movements 10 Other net exchange movements 10 Taxation credit on unhedged borrowings 2 As at 28 September 2002 964 1,129 The cumulative amount of goodwill written off against the Groups reserves, net of goodwill relating to undertakings disposed of, is 2,354m 2001: 2,344m.
