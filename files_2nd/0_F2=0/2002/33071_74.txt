The directors are long serving Unilever executives who can reasonably expect, subject to satisfactory performance, to be employed by Unilever until retirement.
The Committee takes the view that the entitlement by the directors to the security of twelve months notice of termination of employment is in line both with the practice of many comparable companies and the entitlement of other senior executives within Unilever.
The directors have service contracts with both NV and PLC.
The service contracts provide for 12 months notice of termination on the part of each company.
NV and PLC may, if they choose, pay to the director a sum equal to 12 months salary in lieu of notice.
The Remuneration Committees aim is always to deal fairly with cases of termination whilst taking a robust line in minimising any compensation.
The Remuneration Committee has given due consideration to the recommendations contained in the Combined Code regarding inclusion of explicit provisions in directors service contracts for compensation commitments in the event of early termination.
The Committee will continue to keep under review its current practice, which is not to include such provisions in order to enable it to respond appropriately to particular circumstances.
In both 2002 and 2001, all eight directors served for the whole of the year.
In 2001, two other directors served for only part of the year.
