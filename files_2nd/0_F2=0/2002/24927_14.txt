HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements 1 Basis of preparation a The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain investments and land and buildings, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the special provisions of Part VII Chapter II of the UK Companies Act 1985 the Act relating to banking groups.
The consolidated financial statements comply with Schedule 9 and the financial statements of HSBC Holdings comply with Schedule 4 to the Act.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Act, no profit and loss account is presented for HSBC Holdings.
HSBC has adopted the provisions of the UK Financial Reporting Standard FRS FRS 19 Deferred Tax with effect from 1 January 2002, and the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 Retirement benefits, which require additional disclosures only.
For a discussion of the impact of the adoption of FRS 19 see Note 1 e below.
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Statements of Recommended Accounting Practice SORPs issued by the British Bankers Association BBA and Irish Bankers Federation IBF and with the SORP Accounting issues in the asset finance and leasing industry issued by the Finance & Leasing Association FLA.
The SORP issued by the Association of British Insurers ABI Accounting for insurance business contains recommendations on accounting for insurance business for insurance companies and insurance groups.
HSBC is primarily a banking group, rather than an insurance group, and, consistent with previously established practice for such groups preparing consolidated financial statements complying with Schedule 9 to the Act, values its long-term assurance businesses using the Embedded Value method.
This method includes a prudent valuation of the discounted future earnings expected to emerge from business currently in force, taking into account factors such as recent experience and general economic conditions, together with the surplus retained in the long-term assurance funds.
b The preparation of financial information requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future conditions.
In this connection, management believes that the critical accounting policies are those in relation to provisions for bad and doubtful debts, goodwill impairment, and the valuation of unquoted and illiquid debt and equity securities.
Application of these policies and the key estimates and assumptions used are described in the Financial Review section on pages 96 to 98 under the heading Critical Accounting Policies.
c The consolidated financial statements of HSBC comprise the financial statements of HSBC Holdings and its subsidiary undertakings.
Financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are made up to 31 December.
In the case of the principal banking and insurance subsidiaries of HSBC Bank Argentina, whose financial statements are made up to 30 June annually to comply with local regulations, HSBC uses audited interim financial statements, drawn up to 31 December annually.
The consolidated financial statements include the attributable share of the results and reserves of joint ventures and associates, based on financial statements made up to dates not earlier than six months prior to 31 December.
All significant intra-HSBC transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
d HSBCs financial statements are prepared in accordance with UK generally accepted accounting principles UK GAAP, which differ in certain respects from US generally accepted accounting principles US GAAP.
For a discussion of significant differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP and a reconciliation to US GAAP of certain amounts see Note 50.
In addition, certain disclosures in the Notes on the Financial Statements have been made to comply with US reporting requirements.
e The adoption of FRS 19 has required a change in the method of accounting for deferred tax.
Deferred tax is now recognised in full, subject to recoverability of deferred tax assets.
Previously, deferred tax assets and liabilities were recognised only to the extent they were expected to crystallise.
As deferred tax liabilities have generally been fully provided, the main impact of the change in method for HSBC has been the recognition of deferred tax assets previously not recognised.
The change in accounting policy has been reflected by way of a prior period adjustment.
The comparative figures have been restated as follows: 195 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued Profit and loss account tax on profit on ordinary activities HSBC HSBC Holdings Figures in US$m 2001 2000 2001 2000 Under previous policy............................... 1,574 2,238 183 227 Adoption of FRS 19.................................. 414 171 112 191 Under new policy...................................... 1,988 2,409 71 36 The effect on the results for the current period of the adoption of FRS 19 is immaterial.

The increase in HSBCs tax charge for 2000 as restated can be explained as follows: reversal of a benefit taken in 2000 under SSAP 15 in respect of the utilisation of a provision for additional UK tax on remittances from overseas, such provisions not being allowable under FRS19: and reduction in the deferred tax asset under FRS19 relating to general bad debt provisions in line with the reduction in the underlying general provisions.
The increase in HSBC Holdings tax charge for 2001 as restated can be explained as follows: reversal of a benefit taken in 2001 under SSAP15 in respect of the utilisation and release of a provision for additional UK tax on remittances from overseas, such provisions not being permissible under FRS19.
The increase in HSBC Holdings tax charge for 2000 as restated can be explained as follows: reversal of a benefit taken in 2000 under SSAP15 in respect of the utilisation and release of a provision for additional UK tax on remittances from overseas, such provisions not being permissible under FRS19: and reduction in the deferred tax asset under FRS19 relating to various provisions.
2 Principal accounting policies a Income recognition Interest income is recognised in the profit and loss account as it accrues, except in the case of doubtful debts Note 2 b.
Fee and commission income is accounted for in the period when receivable, except where it is charged to cover the costs of a continuing service to, or risk borne for, the customer, or is interest in nature.
In these cases, it is recognised on an appropriate basis over the relevant period.
b Loans and advances and doubtful debts It is HSBCs policy that each operating company will make provisions for bad and doubtful debts promptly where required and on a prudent and consistent basis.
Loans are designated as non-performing as soon as management has doubts as to the ultimate collectibility of principal or interest or when contractual payments of principal or interest are 90 days overdue.
When a loan is designated as non-performing, interest will be suspended see below and a specific provision raised if required.
However, the suspension of interest may exceptionally be deferred for up to 12 months past due in the following situations: where cash collateral is held covering the total of principal and interest due and the right of set-off is legally sound: or where the value of net realisable tangible security is considered more than sufficient to cover the full repayment of all principal and interest due and credit approval has been given to the rolling-up or capitalisation of interest payments.
There are two basic types of provision, specific and general, each of which is considered in terms of the charge and the amount outstanding.
197 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued Specific provisions Specific provisions represent the quantification of actual and expected losses from identified accounts and are deducted from loans and advances in the balance sheet.
Other than where provisions on smaller balance homogenous loans are assessed on a portfolio basis, the amount of specific provision raised is assessed on a case by case basis.
The amount of specific provision raised is HSBCs conservative estimate of the amount needed to reduce the carrying value of the asset to the expected ultimate net realisable value, and in reaching a decision consideration is given, among other things, to the following factors: the financial standing of the customer, including a realistic assessment of the likelihood of repayment of the loan within an acceptable period and the extent of HSBCs other commitments to the same customer: the realisable value of any security for the loan: the costs associated with obtaining repayment and realisation of the security: and if loans are not in local currency, the ability of the borrower to obtain the relevant foreign currency.
Where specific provisions are raised on a portfolio basis, the level of provisioning takes into account managements assessment of the portfolio's structure, past and expected credit losses, business and economic conditions, and any other relevant factors.
The principal portfolios evaluated on this basis are credit cards and other consumer lending products.
General provisions General provisions augment specific provisions and provide cover for loans which are impaired at the balance sheet date but which will not be identified as such until some time in the future.
HSBC requires operating companies to maintain a general provision which is determined taking into account the structure and risk characteristics of each companys loan portfolio.
Historical levels of latent risk are regularly reviewed by each operating company to determine that the level of general provisioning continues to be appropriate.
Where entities operate in a significantly higher risk environment, an increased level of general provisioning will apply taking into account local market conditions and economic and political factors.
General provisions are deducted from loans and advances to customers in the balance sheet.
Loans on which interest is being suspended Provided that there is a realistic prospect of interest being paid at some future date, interest on non-performing loans is charged to the customers account.
However, the interest is not credited to the profit and loss account but to an interest suspense account in the balance sheet which is netted against the relevant loan.
On receipt of cash other than from the realisation of security, suspended interest is recovered and taken to the profit and loss account.
A specific provision of the same amount as the interest receipt is then raised against the principal balance.
Amounts received from the realisation of security are applied to the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, with any surplus used to recover any specific provisions and then suspended interest.
Non-accrual loans Where the probability of receiving interest payments is remote, interest is no longer accrued and any suspended interest balance is written off.
Loans are not reclassified as accruing until interest and principal payments are up-to-date and future payments are reasonably assured.
Loan write-offs Loans and suspended interest are written off, either partially or in full, when there is no prospect of recovery of these amounts.
Assets acquired in exchange for advances Assets acquired in exchange for advances in order to achieve an orderly realisation continue to be reported as 198 advances.
The asset acquired is recorded at the carrying value of the advance disposed of at the date of the exchange and provisions are based on any subsequent deterioration in its value.
c Treasury bills, debt securities and equity shares Treasury bills, debt securities and equity shares intended to be held on a continuing basis are disclosed as investment securities and are included in the balance sheet at cost less provision for any permanent diminution in value.
Where dated investment securities have been purchased at a premium or discount, these premiums and discounts are amortised through the profit and loss account over the period from the date of purchase to the date of maturity so as to give a constant rate of return.
If the maturity is at the borrowers option within a specified range of years, the maturity date which gives the more conservative result is adopted.
These securities are included in the balance sheet at cost adjusted for the amortisation of premiums and discounts arising on acquisition.
The amortisation of premiums and discounts is included in Interest receivable.
Any profit or loss on realisation of these securities is recognised in the profit and loss account as it arises and included in Gains on disposal of investments.
Other treasury bills, debt securities, equity shares and short positions in securities are included in the balance sheet at market value.
Changes in the market value of such assets and liabilities are recognised in the profit and loss account as Dealing profits as they arise.
For liquid portfolios market values are determined by reference to independently sourced mid-market prices.
In certain less liquid portfolios securities are valued by reference to bid or offer prices as appropriate.
Where independent prices are not available, market values may be determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate adjusted for the credit risk of the counterparty.
In addition, adjustments are made for illiquid positions where appropriate.
Where securities are sold subject to a commitment to repurchase them at a predetermined price, they remain on the balance sheet and a liability is recorded in respect of the consideration received.
Conversely, securities purchased under analogous commitments to resell are not recognised on the balance sheet and the consideration paid is recorded in Loans and advances to banks or Loans and advances to customers.
d Subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures, associates and other participating interests i HSBC Holdings investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at net asset values, including attributable goodwill.
Changes in net assets of subsidiary undertakings are accounted for as movements in the revaluation reserve.
ii Interests in joint ventures are stated at HSBCs share of gross assets, including attributable goodwill, less HSBCs share of gross liabilities.
iii Interests in associates are stated at HSBCs share of net assets, including attributable goodwill.
iv Other participating interests are investments in the shares of undertakings which are held on a long-term basis for the purpose of securing a contribution to HSBCs business, other than subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures or associates.
Other participating interests are stated at cost less any permanent diminution in value.
v Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures or associates when the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair value of HSBCs share of separable net assets acquired.
Negative goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates when the fair value of HSBCs share of separable net assets acquired exceeds the cost of acquisition.
For acquisitions made on or after 1 January 1998, goodwill is included in the balance sheet in Intangible fixed assets in respect of subsidiary undertakings, in Interests in joint ventures in respect of joint ventures and in Interests in associates in respect of associates.
Capitalised goodwill is amortised over its estimated life on a straightline basis.
For acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998, goodwill was charged against reserves in the year of acquisition.
Capitalised goodwill is tested for impairment when necessary by comparing the present value of the expected future cash flows from an entity with the carrying value of its net assets, including 199 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued attributable goodwill.
Negative goodwill is credited in the profit and loss account in the periods expected to be benefited.
At the date of disposal of subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures or associates, any unamortised goodwill or goodwill charged directly to reserves is included in HSBCs share of net assets of the undertaking in the calculation of the gain or loss on disposal of the undertaking.
e Tangible fixed assets i Land and buildings are stated at valuation or cost less depreciation calculated to write off the assets over their estimated useful lives as follows: freehold land and land held on leases with more than 50 years to expiry are not depreciated: land held on leases with 50 years or less to expiry is depreciated over the unexpired terms of the leases: and buildings and improvements thereto are depreciated on cost or valuation at the greater of 2% per annum on the straight-line basis or over the unexpired terms of the leases or over the remaining useful lives.
ii Equipment, fixtures and fittings are stated at cost less depreciation calculated on the straight-line basis to write off the assets over their estimated useful lives, which are generally between 5 years and 20 years.
iii HSBC holds certain properties as investments.
No depreciation is provided in respect of such properties other than leaseholds with 20 years or less to expiry.
Investment properties are included in the balance sheet at their open market value and the aggregate surplus or deficit, where material, is transferred to the investment property revaluation reserve.
f Finance and operating leases i Assets leased to customers under agreements which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards associated with ownership, other than legal title, are classified as finance leases.
Where HSBC is a lessor under finance leases the amounts due under the leases, after deduction of unearned charges, are included in Loans and advances to banks or Loans and advances to customers.
Finance charges receivable are recognised over the periods of the leases so as to give a constant rate of return on the net cash investment in the leases, taking into account tax payments and receipts associated with the leases.
ii Where HSBC is a lessee under finance leases the leased assets are capitalised and included in Equipment, fixtures and fittings and the corresponding liability to the lessor is included in Other liabilities.
Finance charges payable are recognised over the periods of the leases based on the interest rates implicit in the leases.
iii All other leases are classified as operating leases and, where HSBC is the lessor, are included in Tangible fixed assets.
The residual values of equipment on operating leases are regularly monitored.
Provision is made to the extent that the carrying value of equipment is impaired through residual values not being fully recoverable.
Rentals payable and receivable under operating leases are accounted for on the straight-line basis over the periods of the leases and are included in Administrative expenses and Other operating income respectively.
g Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in full on timing differences between the accounting and taxation treatment of income and expenditure, subject to assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
h Pension and other post-retirement benefits HSBC operates a number of pension and other post-retirement benefit schemes throughout the world.
200 For UK defined benefit schemes annual contributions are made, on the advice of qualified actuaries, for funding of retirement benefits in order to build up reserves for each scheme member during the employees working life and used to pay a pension to the employee or dependant after retirement.
The costs of providing these benefits are charged to the profit and loss account on a regular basis.
Arrangements for staff retirement benefits in overseas locations vary from country to country and are made in accordance with local regulations and custom.
The pension cost of the major overseas schemes is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries so as to recognise the cost of pensions on a systematic basis over employees service lives.
Since 1 January 1993, the cost of providing post-retirement health-care benefits, which is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries, has been recognised on a systematic basis over employees' service lives.
At 1 January 1993, there was an accumulated obligation in respect of these benefits relating to current and retired employees which is being charged to the profit and loss account in equal instalments over 20 years.
i Foreign currencies i Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into US dollars at the rates of exchange ruling at the year-end.
The results of branches, subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates not reporting in US dollars are translated into US dollars at the average rates of exchange for the year.
Further information on the translation of assets and liabilities in Argentina is set out in Note 6. ii Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of opening foreign currency net investments and the related cost of hedging and exchange differences arising from retranslation of the result for the year from the average rate to the exchange rate ruling at the year-end are accounted for in reserves.
iii Other exchange differences are recognised in the profit and loss account.
j Off-balance-sheet financial instruments Off-balance-sheet financial instruments comprise futures, forward, swap and option transactions undertaken by HSBC in the foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and credit derivative markets.
Netting is applied where a legal right of set-off exists.
Mark-to-market assets and liabilities are presented gross, with netting shown separately.
Accounting for these instruments is dependent upon whether the transactions are undertaken for trading or nontrading purposes.
Trading transactions Trading transactions include transactions undertaken for market-making, to service customers needs and for proprietary purposes, as well as any related hedges.
Transactions undertaken for trading purposes are marked-to-market and the net present value of any gain or loss arising is recognised in the profit and loss account as Dealing profits, after appropriate deferrals for unearned credit margin and future servicing costs.
Off-balance-sheet trading transactions are valued by reference to an independent liquid price where this is available.
For those transactions where there are no readily quoted prices, which predominantly relates to over the counter transactions, market values are determined by reference to independently sourced rates, using valuation models.
Adjustments are made for illiquid positions where appropriate.
Assets, including gains, resulting from off-balance-sheet exchange rate, interest rate, equities and credit derivative contracts which are marked-to-market are included in Other assets.
Liabilities, including losses, resulting from such contracts, are included in Other liabilities.
201 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued Non-trading transactions Non-trading transactions are those which are held for hedging purposes as part of HSBCs risk management strategy against assets, liabilities, positions or cash flows measured on an accruals basis.
Non-trading transactions include qualifying hedges and positions that synthetically alter the characteristics of specified financial instruments.
Non-trading transactions are accounted for on an equivalent basis to the underlying assets, liabilities or net positions.
Any profit or loss arising is recognised on the same basis as that arising from the related assets, liabilities or positions.
To qualify as a hedge, a derivative must effectively reduce the price or interest rate risk of the asset, liability or anticipated transaction to which it is linked and be designated as a hedge at inception of the derivative contract.
Accordingly, changes in the market value of the derivative must be highly correlated with changes in the market value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract.
If these criteria are met, the derivative is accounted for on the same basis as the underlying hedged item.
Derivatives used for hedging purposes include swaps, forwards and futures.
Interest rate swaps are also used to alter synthetically the interest rate characteristics of financial instruments.
In order to qualify for synthetic alteration, a derivative instrument must be linked to specific individual, or pools of similar, assets or liabilities by the notional principal and interest rate risks of the associated instruments, and must achieve a result that is consistent with defined risk management objectives.
If these criteria are met, accruals based accounting is applied, i. e. income or expense is recognised and accrued to the next settlement date in accordance with the contractual terms of the agreement.
Any gain or loss arising on the termination of a qualifying derivative is deferred and amortised to earnings over the original life of the terminated contract.
Where the underlying asset, liability or position is sold or terminated, the qualifying derivative is immediately marked-to-market and any profit or loss arising is taken to the profit and loss account.
k Long-term assurance business The value placed on HSBCs interest in long-term assurance business includes a prudent valuation of the discounted future earnings expected to emerge from business currently in force, taking into account factors such as recent experience and general economic conditions, together with the surplus retained in the long-term assurance funds.
These are determined annually in consultation with independent actuaries and are included in Other assets.
Changes in the value placed on HSBCs interest in long-term assurance business are calculated on a post-tax basis and reported in the profit and loss account as part of Other operating income after adjusting for taxation.
Long-term assurance assets and liabilities attributable to policyholders are recognised in HSBCs accounts in Other assets and Other liabilities.
Figures for 2001 and 2000 have been restated to reflect this change b Retirement benefits HSBC has continued to account for pensions in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs and the disclosures given in i are those required by that standard.
FRS 17 Retirement benefits was issued in November 2000.
Prior to full implementation, which has been deferred until accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005, phased transitional 203 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued disclosures are required from 31 December 2001.
These disclosures, to the extent not given in i, are set out in ii.
i HSBC Pension Schemes HSBC operates some 169 pension schemes throughout the world, covering 91% of HSBCs employees, with a total pension cost of US$558 million 2001: US$572 million: 2000: US$422 million:, of which US$316 million 2001: US$349 million: 2000: US$210 million relates to overseas schemes.
Of the overseas schemes, US$43 million 2001: US$31 million: 2000:US$30 million has been determined in accordance with best practice and regulations in the United States and Canada.
The majority of the schemes are funded defined benefit schemes, which cover 53% of HSBCs employees, with assets, in the case of most of the larger schemes, held in trust or similar funds separate from HSBC.
The pension cost relating to these schemes was US$406 million 2001: US$428 million: 2000: US$341 million which is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
The schemes are reviewed at least on a triennial basis or in accordance with local practice and regulations.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligations of HSBCs pension schemes vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which they are situated.
In the United Kingdom, the HSBC Bank UK Pension Scheme covers employees of HSBC Bank plc and certain other employees of HSBC.
This scheme comprises a funded defined benefit scheme the principal scheme and a defined contribution scheme which was established on 1 July 1996 for new employees.
The actuarial valuation as at 31 December 2002 is currently in the course of preparation based on the circumstances as at that date.
The latest valuation of the principal scheme was made at 31 December 1999 by C G Singer, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, of Watson Wyatt Partners.
At that date, the market value of the principal scheme's assets was US$10,888 million.
The actuarial value of the assets represented 104 % of the benefits accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings, and the resulting surplus amounted to US$346 million.
The method adopted for this valuation was the projected unit method and the main assumptions used were a long-term investment return of 6.85% per annum, salary increases of 4.0% per annum, equity dividend increases and rental growth of 3.5% per annum, and post-retirement pension increases of 2.5% per annum.
Following an interim review, HSBC decided to increase contributions from 16.9% to 20.0% of pensionable salaries with effect from 1 August 2002, until completion of the actuarial valuation as at 31 December 2002.
HSBC has given preliminary consideration to its funding strategy in advance of knowing the results of the 2002 triennial valuation.
The funding policy itself is reviewed on a systematic basis in consultation with the independent Scheme Actuary in order to ensure that the funding contributions from the sponsoring employers are appropriate to meet the liabilities of the Scheme over the long term.
Full valuation calculations are currently in hand but HSBC anticipates there will be a shortfall of at least US$800 million on the funding basis which will be adopted for the Scheme.
HSBC has therefore decided to pay this amount into the Scheme this amount has been paid since the year end.
Further contributions to the Scheme will be assessed after considering the advice of the independent Scheme Actuary and taking into account long-term rates of returns on the underlying investments assessed with an appropriate degree of prudence.
In Hong Kong, the HSBC Group Hong Kong Local Staff Retirement Benefit Scheme covers employees of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited and certain other employees of HSBC.
The scheme comprises a funded defined benefit scheme which is a lump sum scheme and a defined contribution scheme.
The latter was established on 1 January 1999 for new employees.
The latest valuation of the defined benefit scheme was made at 31 December 2002 and was performed by E Chiu, Fellow of the Society of Actuaries of the United States of America, of HSBC Life International Limited, a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings.
At that date, the market value of the defined benefit schemes assets was 204 US$794 million.
On an ongoing basis, the actuarial value of the schemes assets represented 111% of the benefits accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in salaries, and the resulting surplus amounted to US$81 million.
On a wind-up basis, the actuarial value of the schemes assets represents 114% of the members vested benefits, based on current salaries, and the resulting surplus amounted to US$100 million.
The actuarial method used was the projected unit credit method and the main assumptions used in this valuation were a long-term investment return of 5.5% per annum and salary increases of 4.5% per annum.
In the United States, the HSBC Bank USA Pension Plan the principal scheme covers employees of HSBC Bank USA and certain other employees of HSBC.
The latest valuation of the principal scheme was made at 1 January 2002 by R G Gendron and K G Leister, Fellows of the Society of Actuaries, of Hewitt Associates LLC.
At that date, the market value of the principal schemes assets was US$772 million.
The actuarial value of the assets represented 92% of the benefits accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings, and the resulting deficit amounted to US$67 million.
This deficit was eliminated by means of contributions made to the scheme in 2002.
The method employed for this valuation was the projected unit credit method and the main assumptions used were a discount rate of 7.25% per annum and average salary increases of 4.0% per annum.
The HSBC Bank UK Pension Scheme, The HSBC Group Hong Kong Local Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme and the HSBC Bank USA Pension Plan cover 37% 2001: 42%, 2000: 45% of HSBCs employees.
The pension cost for defined contribution schemes, which cover 38% 2001: 41%: 2000: 24% of HSBCs employees, was US$152 million 2001: US$144 million: 2000: US$81 million.
402 Net unprovided pension liability.......... 167 Of the deficit in other schemes, US$832 million relates to schemes in deficit and US$113 million relates to schemes in surplus.
Of the schemes in deficit, US$442 million relates to unfunded pension schemes in respect of which a provision, net of deferred tax, of US$402 million has been made.
In relation to main schemes, there is a surplus of US$86 million in HSBC Group Hong Kong Local Staff Retirement Benefit Scheme and a deficit of US$79 million in HSBC Bank USA Pension Plan.
The net pension liability will have a consequent effect on reserves when FRS17 is fully implemented.
206 The defined benefit section of the HSBC Bank UK Pension Scheme and the HSBC Group Hong Kong Local Staff Retirement Benefit Scheme are closed to new entrants.
For these schemes the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement under the projected unit credit method.
Of the schemes in deficit, US$565 million relates to unfunded pension schemes in respect of which a provision, net of deferred tax, of US$356 million has been made.
In relation to main schemes, there is a surplus of US$17 million in HSBC Group Hong Kong Local Staff Retirement Benefit Scheme and a deficit of US$48 million in HSBC Bank USA Pension Plan.
HSBC Holdings is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of this scheme attributable to its employees.
iii Post-retirement healthcare benefits HSBC also provides post-retirement healthcare benefits under schemes, mainly in the United Kingdom and also in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Brazil.
The charge relating to these schemes is US$54 million for the year 2001: US$39 million: 2000:US$42 million.
The schemes are unfunded, except for the scheme in Mexico which had assets of US$13 million at 31 December 2002 comprising US$2 million in equities, US$6 million in bonds and US$5 million in cash.
The latest full actuarial valuations of the liability were carried out at dates between 31 December 1999 and 31 December 2002 by independent qualified actuaries and have been updated to 31 December 2002 as necessary.
This latest actuarial review in accordance with FRS 17 estimated the present value of the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation at US$491 million 2001: US$404 million: 2000: US$411 million, of which US$366 million 2001: US$269 million: 2000: US$253 million has been provided and US$13million is held in assets in the funded scheme in Mexico.
The actuarial assumptions used to estimate this obligation vary according to the claims experience and economic conditions of the countries in which the schemes are situated.
For the UK schemes, the main financial assumptions used at 31 December 208 2002 were price inflation of 2.5% per annum 2001: 2.5%, health-care claims cost escalation of 7.5% per annum 2001: 7.5% and a discount rate of 5.6% per annum 2001: 5.9%.
Under FRS 17, the deferred tax asset related to the unprovided liability of US$112 million 2001: US$135 million would be US$38 million 2001: US$47 million.
The provision as at 31 December 2002 in respect of unfunded pension obligations to former Directors amounted to US$6,942,000 2001: US$6,281,000: 2000: US$6,535,000.
During the year, aggregate contributions to pension schemes in respect of Directors were US$1,592,024 2001: US$1,462,000: 2000: US$798,000.
Discretionary bonuses for Directors are based on a combination of individual and corporate performance and are determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The cost of the conditional awards under the Restricted Share Plan is recognised through an annual charge based on the likely level of vesting of shares, apportioned over the period of service to which the award relates.
Details of Directors remuneration, share options and conditional awards under the Restricted Share Plan are included in the Report of the Directors on pages 165 to 167 and Directors Remuneration Report on pages 170 to 186.

6 Loss from foreign currency redenomination in Argentina The losses in 2002 reflect the further impact of the pesification at the start of the year including revisions to government decrees, renegotiation of banking contracts and payments to certain customers who had obtained court orders requiring HSBC to repay their deposits historically denominated in US dollars at current market rates rather than the pesification rate specified by the Argentine Government.
The loss of US$520 million in 2001 arose on the redenomination by the Argentine Government of certain in-country US dollar assets and liabilities into pesos at various mandatory but different rates of exchange.

c Acquisitions HSBC made the following acquisitions of subsidiary undertakings or business operations in 2002, which were accounted for on an acquisition basis: i.
On 28 June 2002, HSBC increased its stake in Merrill Lynch HSBC from 50% to 100% for nil consideration.
Negative goodwill of US$82 million arose on this acquisition.
Prior to becoming a subsidiary undertaking, HSBCs 50% interest in MLHSBC was accounted for as a joint venture.
In accordance with FRS 2 Accounting for subsidiary undertakings, and in order to give a true and fair view, negative goodwill on the acquisition in June has been calculated as that arising on the later acquisition of shares, being the difference between the fair value of consideration paid and the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities attributable to the further 50% interest purchased.
This represents a departure from the method required by Schedule 4A to the Act, under which goodwill is calculated as the difference between total consideration paid and the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities on the date that MLHSBC became a subsidiary undertaking.
The method required by the Act would not give a true and fair view because it would result in the Groups share of MLHSBCs retained losses, during the period that it was a joint venture, being reclassified as goodwill.
The effect of this departure is to reduce positive goodwill by US$89 million, recognise negative goodwill of US$82 million, and reduce retained profits by US$171 million.
On 1 July 2002, CCF, a 99.9 per cent owned subsidiary of HSBC, acquired the business in respect of 11 branches of Banques Worms for a cash consideration of US$10 million.

Accounting policy alignments reflecting: introduction of HSBCs criteria for raising provisions against doubtful loans: introduction of HSBCs policy in relation to the depreciation of fixed assets: and HSBCs criteria for recognising deferred tax.
The geographical analysis of deposits is based on the location of the office in which the deposits are recorded and excludes balances with HSBC companies.

This is the result of an actuarial calculation extrapolated from a sample of cases and the timing of the expenditure depends on settlement of the individual claims.
This caption also includes US$17 million in connection with the Princeton Notes matter 2001: US$665 million.
On 10 January 2002, US$569 million was paid out as settlement in connection with this matter.

ii Labour, civil and fiscal litigation provisions in HSBC Bank Brasil S. A.
- Banco Mltiplo of US$135 million 2001: US$230 million.
This relates to labour and overtime litigation claims brought by employees after leaving the bank.

Timing of settlement of these potential claims is uncertain.
The bonds may be redeemed in April 2013 at par and redemption has also been allowed from April 1998, subject to the prior consent of the Financial Services Authority, for an amount based on the redemption yields of the relevant benchmark treasury stocks.
2 The interest margin on the Subordinated Step-up coupon floating rate notes 2010 increases by 0.5 per cent from April 2005.
The notes are repayable from their step up date at the option of the borrower, subject to the prior consent of the Financial Services Authority.
3 The interest payable ceases to be collared from November 2003 and becomes payable at a floating rate plus margin.
The notes are repayable in November 2003 at the option of the borrower, subject to the prior consent of the Financial Services Authority.
Thereafter, the rate per annum is the sum of the gross redemption yield of the then prevailing five-year UK gilt plus 1.70 per cent.
The notes are repayable at the option of the borrower in June 2012, subject to the prior consent of the Financial Services Authority.

5 The interest rate on the 8.625 per cent Step-up undated subordinated notes changes in December 2007 to become, for each successive five year period, the rate per annum which is the sum of the yield on the then five year benchmark UK gilt plus 1.87 per cent.
Subordinated loan capital is repayable at par on maturity, but some is repayable prior to maturity at the option of the borrower, generally with the consent of the Financial Services Authority, in certain cases at a premium over par.
Interest rates on the floating rate loan capital are related to interbank offered rates.
On the remaining subordinated loan capital, interest is payable at fixed rates up to 9.875%.
2 The preferred stock is redeemable, at the option of HSBC USA Inc. in whole or in part on or after 1 July 1999 at par.

Step-up Perpetual Preferred Securities The four issues of Non-cumulative Step-up Perpetual Preferred Securities were issued by Jersey limited partnerships and are guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, by HSBC Holdings.
The proceeds of the issues were on-lent to HSBC Holdings by the limited partnerships by issue of subordinated notes.
The Preferred Securities qualify as innovative tier 1 capital for HSBC.
The Preferred Securities, together with the guarantee, are intended to provide investors with rights to income and capital distributions and distributions upon liquidation of HSBC Holdings that are equivalent to the rights they would have had if they had purchased non-cumulative perpetual preference shares of HSBC Holdings.
The Preferred Securities are perpetual, but redeemable in 2010, 2030, 2015 and 2012, respectively, at the option of the general partners of the limited partnerships.
If not redeemed the distributions payable step-up and become floating rate.
There are limitations on the payment of distributions if prohibited under UK banking regulations or other requirements, if a payment would cause a breach of HSBCs capital adequacy requirements, or if HSBC Holdings has insufficient distributable reserves as defined.
HSBC Holdings has covenanted that if it has been prevented under certain circumstances from paying distributions on the Preferred Securities in full, it will not pay dividends or other distributions in respect of its ordinary shares, or 248 effect repurchase or redemption of its ordinary shares, until after a distribution has been paid in full.
If i HSBCs total capital ratio falls below the regulatory minimum ratio required, or ii in view of the deteriorating financial condition of HSBC Holdings, the Directors expect i to occur in the near term, then the Preferred Securities will be substituted by Preference Shares of HSBC Holdings having economic terms which are in all material respects equivalent to those of the Preferred Securities and the guarantee taken together.
35 Called up share capital Authorised: The authorised ordinary share capital of HSBC Holdings at 31 December 2002 was US$7,500 million, 2001: US$7,500 million: 2000: US$5,250 million divided into 15,000 million 2001: 15,000 million: 2000: 10,500 million ordinary shares of US$0.50 each, and 301,500 2001: 301,500: 2000: 301,500 divided into 301,500 non-voting deferred shares of 1 each.

Many of HSBCs banking subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates operate under local regulatory jurisdictions which could potentially restrict the amount of reserves which can be remitted to HSBC Holdings plc in order to maintain local regulatory capital ratios.
In addition, the remittance of reserves may result in further taxation liabilities.
In 1999, HSBC established a qualifying employee share ownership trust QUEST to operate in conjunction with the Savings-Related Share Option Plan by acquiring shares in HSBC Holdings and using them to satisfy share options.
255 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued During 2002, the HSBC QUEST has subscribed at market value for 6,147,311 ordinary shares at a total cost of US$68 million 2001: US$39 million.

38 Financial instruments a Derivatives Off-balance-sheet financial instruments, commonly referred to as derivatives, are contracts the characteristics of which are derived from those of the underlying assets, interest and exchange rates or indices.
They include futures, forwards, swap and options transactions in the foreign exchange, interest rate and equity markets.
Transactions are negotiated directly with customers, with HSBC acting as a counterparty, or can be dealt through exchanges.
Nature and terms of derivatives The following outlines the nature and terms of the most common types of derivatives used by HSBC.
Exchange rate contracts Forward foreign exchange contracts are agreements to buy or sell fixed amounts of currency at agreed rates of exchange on a specified future date.
257 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued Cross currency swaps are agreements that involve the exchange of interest payments in one specified currency for interest payments in another specified currency for a specified period, based on an underlying amount.
The agreement may additionally involve the exchange and, on maturity of the swap, re-exchange of the principal amount.
Currency futures are typically exchange-traded agreements to buy or sell standard amounts of a specified currency at an agreed exchange rate on a standard future date.
Currency options give the buyer on payment of a premium the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell specified amounts of currency at agreed rates of exchange on or before a specified future date.
Interest rate contracts Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of interest rate obligations with a counterparty for a specified period without exchanging the underlying or notional principal.
HSBC may enter a swap transaction either as an intermediary or as a direct counterparty.
Interest rate futures are typically exchange-traded agreements to buy or sell a standard amount of a specified fixed income security or time deposit at an agreed interest rate on a standard future date.
Forward rate agreements give the buyer the ability to determine the underlying rate of interest for a specified period commencing on a specified future date the settlement date.
There is no exchange of principal and settlement is effected on the settlement date.
The settlement amount is calculated by reference to the difference between the contract rate and the market rate prevailing on the settlement date.
Interest rate options give the buyer on payment of a premium the right, but not the obligation, to fix the rate of interest on a future deposit or loan, for a specified period and commencing on a specified future date.
Interest rate caps and floors give the buyer the ability to fix the maximum or minimum rate of interest.
There is no facility to deposit or draw down funds: instead the writer pays to the buyer the amount by which the market rate exceeds or is less than the cap rate or the floor rate respectively.
A combination of an interest rate cap and floor is known as an interest rate collar.
Equities contracts Equities options give the buyer on payment of a premium the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specified amount of equities or a basket of equities in the form of published indices.
Equities futures are typically exchange-traded agreements to buy or sell a standard quantity of a specific equity at a future date, at a price decided at the time the contract is made, and may be settled in cash or through delivery.
Credit derivatives In addition to the above, HSBC selectively uses credit derivative contracts.
Credit derivatives are off-balancesheet financial instruments that typically permit one party to transfer the credit risk of a reference asset to another party without actually selling the asset.
Credit derivative contracts are included in the following tables within other exchange rate contracts.
Uses of derivatives Users of derivatives typically want to convert an unwanted risk generated by their business to a more acceptable risk, or cash.
Derivatives provide an effective tool for companies to manage the financial risks associated with their business and, as a consequence, there has been a significant growth in derivatives transactions in recent years.
HSBC, through the dealing operations of its subsidiaries, acts as an intermediary between a broad range of users, structuring deals to produce risk management products to suit individual customer needs.
As a result, HSBC can accumulate significant open positions in derivatives portfolios.
These positions are managed 258 constantly to ensure that they are within acceptable risk levels, with offsetting deals being undertaken to achieve this where necessary.
As well as acting as a dealer, HSBC also uses derivatives principally interest rate swaps in the management of its own asset and liability portfolios and structural positions.
Risks associated with derivatives Derivative instruments are subject to both market risk and credit risk.
Market risk The market risk associated with derivatives can be significant since large positions can be accumulated with a substantially smaller initial outlay than required in cash markets.
Recognising this, only certain offices within major subsidiaries with sufficient derivative product expertise and appropriate control systems are authorised to trade derivative products.
The management of market risk arising from derivatives business is monitored by Traded Markets Development and Risk, an independent unit within the Corporate Investment Banking and Markets operation, in combination with market risks arising from on-balance-sheet instruments Note 40. Credit risk Unlike assets recorded on the balance sheet, where the credit risk is typically the full amount of the principal value, together with any unrealised interest accrued or mark-to-market gain Note 14, the credit risk relative to a derivative is principally the replacement cost of any contract with a positive mark-to-market gain and an estimate for the potential future change in value, reflecting the volatilities affecting the contract.
Credit risk on contracts having a negative mark-to-market value is restricted to the potential future change in value.
Credit risk on derivatives is, therefore, small in relation to a comparable balance sheet risk.
In addition, credit exposure with individual counterparties can be reduced by the receipt of collateral and close-out netting agreements which allow for positive and negative mark-to-market values on different transactions to be offset and settled by a single payment in the event of default by either party.
Such agreements are enforceable in the jurisdictions of the major market makers and HSBC has executed close-out netting agreements with the majority of its counterparties, notwithstanding the fact that HSBC deals only with the most creditworthy counterparties.
Derivatives used for trading purposes The following tables summarise the contract amount, replacement cost, mark-to-market values and average mark-to-market values of third party and internal trading derivatives by product type.
The replacement cost shown is the positive mark-to-market value and represents the accounting loss HSBC would incur if the counterparty to a derivative contract failed to perform according to the terms of the contract and the collateral, if any, for the amount due proved to be of no value.
The notional or contractual amounts of these instruments indicate the volume of transactions outstanding at the balance sheet date: they do not represent amounts at risk.
Because all derivative instruments used for trading purposes are marked to market, carrying values are equal to mark-to-market values.
Mark-to-market values are determined by reference to market rates prevailing on the date of valuation or by discounting future cash flows and include netted internal positions, except where otherwise indicated.
These amounts represent mainly credit default protection products bought or sold.
Internal positions are integral to HSBCs asset and liability management and are included within analyses of non-trading positions in the tables below.
The following table summarises the contract amount and replacement cost of derivatives used for risk management purposes by product type.
The replacement cost shown represents the accounting loss HSBC would incur if the counterparty to a derivative contract failed to perform according to the terms of the contract and the collateral, if any, for the amount due proved to be of no value.
Mark-to-market values for assets and liabilities arising from derivatives held for nontrading purposes are determined in the same way as those set out for trading derivatives above, including internal positions.

The following table analyses the replacement cost of all third party exchange rate, interest rate and equities contracts with positive mark-to-market gains by maturity, and by category of counterparty including netting where available at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001.
The table shows that the replacement cost of derivatives is predominantly with banks and under five years.
The following maturity profile of the notional principal values of third party derivative contracts outstanding as at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001 shows that the majority of contracts are executed over the counter and mature within one year.
Where market prices are not available, values have been estimated using quoted prices for financial instruments with similar characteristics, or otherwise using a suitable valuation technique where practicable to do so.
263 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued The valuation techniques used are: Treasury bills and other eligible bills Mark-to-market value approximates to carrying value because these are mainly short-term in maturity with a carrying value not materially different from mark-to-market value.
Loans and advances to banks and customers For variable rate loans and advances with no significant change in credit risk, the carrying value is considered to represent mark-to-market value.
The mark-to-market values of other loans and advances are estimated by discounting future cash flows using market interest rates.
Debt securities and equity shares Listed securities are valued at middle-market prices and unlisted securities at managements valuation which takes into consideration future earnings streams, valuations of equivalent quoted securities and other relevant techniques.
Debt securities in issue, short positions in securities, subordinated liabilities and non-equity minority interests Mark-to-market values are estimated using quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Deposits by banks and customer accounts Deposits by banks and customer accounts which mature or reprice after six months are grouped by residual maturity.
Fair value is estimated using discounted cash flows, applying either market rates, where applicable, or current rates offered for deposits of similar repricing maturities.
c Gains and losses on hedges Unrecognised gains and losses Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are recognised in line with the underlying items which are being hedged.
The unrecognised gains on instruments used for hedging as at 31 December 2002 were US$4,302 million 2001: US$3,137 million and the unrecognised losses were US$3,261 million 2001: US$2,506 million.
Unrecognised gains of US$1,683 million and unrecognised losses of US$1,389 million are expected to be recognised in 2003.
Of the gains and losses included in the profit and loss account in 2002, US$1,217 million gains and US$983 million losses were unrecognised at 1 January 2002. d Liquidity management HSBCs liquidity management process is discussed in the Financial Review section on pages 133 to 135 from the paragraph under the heading Liquidity management to the bullet point maintenance of liquidity contingency plans.

The credit equivalent amounts are calculated for the purposes of deriving the risk-weighted amounts.
These are assessed in accordance with the Financial Services Authoritys guidelines which implement the 1988 Basel Capital Accord on capital adequacy and depend on the status of the counterparty and the maturity characteristics.
Contingent liabilities and commitments are credit-related instruments which include acceptances, letters of credit, guarantees and commitments to extend credit.
The contractual amounts represent the amounts at risk should the contract be fully drawn upon and the client default.
Since a significant portion of guarantees and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total of the contract amounts is not representative of future liquidity requirements.
Guarantees HSBC provides guarantees and similar undertakings, both on behalf of third party customers and on behalf of other entities within the HSBC Group.
These guarantees are generally provided in the normal course of HSBCs banking business.
The accepted instrument is then sold into the market on a discounted basis.
Financial guarantees include undertakings to stand behind the obligations of customers or other HSBC entities and to undertake these obligations if the other entity fails to do so.
Intra-group items of this type will also include guarantees of a capital nature, given to another HSBC entity and intended to be considered as capital by the relevant regulatory authority.
Standby letters of credit which are financial guarantees are irrevocable obligations to pay a third party where a customer fails to repay an outstanding commitment.
Other direct credit substitutes include re-insurance letters of credit and trade-related letters of credit which have been issued without provision for the issuing entity to retain title to the underlying shipment.
Performance bonds, bid bonds, standby letters of credit and other transaction related guarantees are undertakings where the requirement to make payment under the guarantee depends on the outcome of a future event, which is independent of the creditworthiness of the customer.
Approximately two thirds of the above guarantees have terms of less than one year.
Guarantees with a term of more than one year will be subject to HSBCs annual credit review process.
Where HSBC has given a guarantee on behalf of a customer, HSBC will have the right to recover from that customer any amounts paid under the guarantee.
At 31 December 2002, HSBC held collateral amounted to some US$9.4 billion which could be used to recover amounts paid under the above guarantees.
The above maximum amounts payable reflect HSBCs maximum exposure under a large number of individual guarantee undertakings.
The risks and exposures arising from guarantees are captured and managed in accordance with HSBCs overall credit risk management policies and procedures.
In general, HSBC recognises fee income in respect of guarantee exposures over the period for which the risk is borne.
Where such income is received in advance, it is initially recorded as deferred income and is recognised as income in the profit and loss account over the period of the guarantee.
The current carrying amount of these liabilities reflects HSBCs best estimate of the amount which will be required to settle its obligation under guarantees which it has given.
A liability is recognised only where HSBC considers that it is more likely than not that an obligation exists under the guarantees.
266 At 31 December 2002, HSBC had established the following provisions in respect of its obligations under outstanding guarantees: US$m Acceptances and endorsements...................................................................................... 37 Guarantees and items pledged as collateral security...................................................... 106 Other items..................................................................................................................... 32 HSBC believes that the fair value of its liabilities under other guarantees for which no provision has been established is equal to the amount of deferred income received but not yet recognised for such guarantees.
40 Market risk management HSBCs market risk management process is discussed in the Financial Review section on pages 135 to 139 from the paragraph under the heading Market risk management to the paragraph ended impact of extreme events on the market risk exposures of HSBC.
a Trading VAR VAR is a technique that estimates the potential losses that could occur on risk positions taken due to movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence.
Trading VAR for HSBC for 2002 was: At Minimum Maximum Average 31 December During the during the for the 2002 year year year US$m US$m US$m US$m Total trading activities.................................. 71.6 66.7 130.0 93.9 Foreign exchange trading positions.............. 12.9 2.4 47.0 21.0 Interest rate trading positions........................ 63.2 60.2 120.9 82.4 Equities trading positions.............................. 27.1 20.4 40.6 29.0 267 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued Trading VAR for HSBC for 2001 was: At Minimum Maximum Average 31 December During the during the for the 2001 year year year US$m US$m US$m US$m Total trading activities.................................. 122.0 60.8 173.4 102.2 Foreign exchange trading positions.............. 13.3 1.8 50.6 22.1 Interest rate trading positions........................ 111.7 48.1 160.2 86.7 Equities trading positions.............................. 45.5 27.4 79.6 41.9 b Interest rate sensitivity gap table In accordance with FRS 13, the table below discloses the mismatching of the dates on which interest receivable on assets and interest payable on liabilities are next reset to market rate on a contractual basis or, if earlier, the dates on which the instruments mature.
Actual reset dates may differ from contractual dates owing to prepayments and the exercise of options.
In addition, contractual terms may not be representative of the behaviour of assets and liabilities.
For these reasons, HSBC manages its interest rate risk on a different basis from that presented below, taking into account the behavioural characteristics of the relevant assets and liabilities.
Although a positive gap position tends to benefit net interest income in a rising interest rate environment, the actual effect will depend on a number of factors, including the extent to which repayments are made earlier or later than the contracted date and variations in interest rates within re-pricing periods and among currencies.
Similarly, a negative interest rate sensitivity gap exists where more liabilities than assets re-price during a given period.
In this case, a negative gap position tends to benefit net interest income in a declining interest rate environment, but again the actual effect will depend on the same factors as for positive interest rate gaps, as described above.
Gains or losses on structural foreign currency exposures are taken to reserves.
HSBCs management of structural foreign currency exposures is discussed in the Financial Review section on pages 137 and 138.
This is not done on a line-by-line basis, as it cannot be determined without unreasonable expense.
43 Analysis of cash HSBC is required to make deposits with central banks as a result of government regulations in the territories in which it operates.
As at 31 December 2002, these amounted to US$2,154 million 2001: US$2,030 million: 2000: US$1,604 million.
None of these proceedings is regarded as material litigation.
Turnover of nonbanking businesses is included in other operating income.
The allocation of earnings reflects the benefit of shareholders funds to the extent that these are actually allocated to businesses in the segment by way of intra-HSBC capital and funding structures.
Common costs are included in segments on the basis of the actual recharges made.
a By geographical region Geographical information has been classified by the location of the principal operations of the subsidiary undertaking, or in the case of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, HSBC Bank plc, HSBC Bank Middle East and HSBC Bank USA operations, by the location of the branch responsible for reporting the results or for advancing the funds.
Due to the nature of HSBCs structure, the analysis of profits and net assets shown below includes intra-HSBC items between geographical regions.
The Rest of AsiaPacific geographical segment includes the Middle East, India and Australasia.
The geographical analysis has been realigned to reflect this fact by the reclassification of Mexico and Panama to North America, from South America formerly described as Latin America.

b By Line of Business HSBCs operations include a number of support services and head office functions.
The costs of these functions are allocated to business lines, where it is appropriate, on a systematic and consistent basis.
In addition, there are a number of income and expense items between lines of business and the following profits analysis includes amounts within each line of business and then eliminates any duplication in a separate column.
During 2002, HSBC has amended the management responsibility for a limited number of businesses.
The principal change aligns private banking in the United States with international private banking.
The analysis for 2001 and 2000 has been restated to reflect the new structure.
Total assets and net assets split by line of business are disclosed for 2002 and 2001.
Total assets and net assets by line of business were not presented for 2000 and as a result the underlying information was not available without undue cost.
Profit on ordinary activities before tax includes profit arising on intra-HSBC transactions of US$406 million 2001: US$488 million: 2000: US$492 million.
48 Related party transactions a Transactions, arrangements and agreements involving Directors and others Particulars of transactions, arrangements and agreements entered into by subsidiary undertakings of HSBC Holdings with Directors and connected persons and companies controlled by them and with officers of HSBC Holdings disclosed pursuant to section 232 of the Companies Act 1985 are as follows: 2002 2001 Number US$m Number US$m Directors and connected persons and companies controlled by them: Loans and credit card transactions including US$367,665 in credit card transactions 2001: US$259,172 and US$14,538,793 in guarantees 2001: US$34,541,955...... 145 931 150 716 Officers: Loans and credit card transactions including US$169,025 in credit card transactions 2001: US$149,753 and US$nil in guarantees 2001: US$nil................................. 28 18 27 13 Particulars of Directors transactions are recorded in a register held at the Registered Office of HSBC Holdings which is available for inspection by members for 15 days prior to the HSBC Holdings Annual General Meeting and at the Annual General Meeting itself.

HSBCs pension funds had deposits of US$252 million 2001: US$275 million with banking subsidiaries within HSBC.
49 UK and Hong Kong accounting requirements The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK accounting requirements: there would be no material differences had they been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Accounting Standards, except as set out below.
The presentation of the cash flow statement is in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 1 revised 1996 Cash Flow Statements rather than Hong Kong Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 15 Cash Flow Statements.
In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 11 Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill, no charge has been made in the profit and loss account in respect of those decreases in the valuation of HSBC properties that do not represent impairments.
If HSBC had prepared its financial statements under Hong Kong Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 17 Property, plant and equipment, there would have been a net charge to the profit and loss account of US$94 million 2001: US$39 million in respect of valuations below depreciated historical cost of which a credit of US$2 million 2001: US$1 million relates to minority interests.
In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 19 Deferred Tax, HSBC has recognised deferred tax in full on timing differences between the accounting and taxation treatment of income and expenditure, subject to recoverability of deferred tax assets.
If HSBC had prepared its financial statements in accordance with Hong Kong Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 12 Income Taxes revised August 2002 it would have recognised additional deferred tax assets and liabilities, resulting in an increase in reserves at 31 December 2002 of US$119 million at 31 December 2001 : US$114 million, and an increase in the charge to the profit and loss account in respect of tax on profit on ordinary activities of US$22 million 2001 : US$188 million.
If HSBC had prepared its financial statements under Hong Kong Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Investments in Securities, US$1,253 million 2001: US$860 million would have been credited to reserves in respect of changes in the fair value of its investment securities.
In accordance with UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 17 Post balance sheet events, HSBC has recorded dividends declared after the period end in the period to which they relate.
If HSBC had prepared its financial statements in accordance with Hong Kong Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 9 Events after the balance sheet date, dividends would be recorded in the period in which they are declared and there would have been an increase in reserves at 31 December 2002 of US$3,069 million at 31 December 2001: US$2,700 million.
HSBC Holdings has recorded its investment in HSBC undertakings at net asset value, including attributable goodwill.
If HSBC Holdings had prepared its individual financial statements in accordance with Hong Kong Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 32 Consolidated Financial Statements and Accounting for Investments in Subsidiaries and elected to record its investment in HSBC undertakings at cost, less provisions for any 284 impairment, there would have been a reduction in the reserves of HSBC Holdings at 31 December 2002 of US$13,906 million at 31 December 2001: US$8,962 million.
There would have been no impact on the consolidated financial statements of HSBC.
HSBC applies UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for pension costs to defined benefit schemes, which requires that the cost of providing pensions be recognised on a systematic and rational basis over the period during which benefit is gained from the employees services.
If HSBC had prepared its financial statements under Hong Kong Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 34 Employee benefits a defined benefit pension liability of US$4,023 million would have been recognised in the balance sheet at 31 December 2002 at 31 December 2001: US$2,149 million.
There would have been an additional charge to the profit and loss account in 2002 of US$7 million.
The 2001 figures have been calculated by reference to UK GAAP figures restated to reflect the adoption of UK Financial Reporting Standard 19 Deferred tax, details of which are set out in Note 1 on the Financial Statements on pages 195 to 197.
50 Differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP The consolidated financial statements of HSBC are prepared in accordance with UK generally accepted accounting principles GAAP which differ in certain significant respects from US GAAP.
The following is a summary of the significant differences applicable to HSBC: UK GAAP US GAAP Leasing Finance lease income is recognised so as to give a Unearned income on finance leases is taken to income constant rate of return on the net cash investment in the at a rate calculated to give a constant rate of return on lease, taking into account tax payments and receipts the investment in the lease, but no account is taken of associated with the lease.

In common with many other UK companies, HSBC elected not to reinstate such goodwill.
HSBC considered whether reinstatement would materially assist the understanding of readers of its accounts who were already familiar with UK GAAP and decided that it would not.
287 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued UK GAAP US GAAP Goodwill continued Goodwill included in the balance sheet is tested for impairment when necessary by comparing the recoverable amount of an entity with the carrying value of its net assets, including attributable goodwill.
The recoverable amount of an entity is the higher of its value in use, generally the present value of the expected future cash flows from the entity, and its net realisable value.
At the date of disposal of subsidiary undertakings, associates or joint ventures, any unamortised goodwill or goodwill charged directly against reserves is included in HSBCs share of total net assets of the undertaking in the calculation of the profit on disposal of the undertaking.

To the extent that such an asset is recognised there is a commensurate reduction in the amount of recorded goodwill.

For reverse repos, where the transferee has the right to sell or repledge the collateral, the transferee should not recognise the pledged asset but should disclose the fair value of the collateral and if the transferee sells collateral pledged to it, the proceeds from the sale and the transferees obligation to return the collateral should be recognised.

292 The following tables summarise the significant adjustments to consolidated net income and shareholders equity which would result from the application of US GAAP.
Net liabilities arising due to repo transactions of US$8,271 million 2001: US$7,113 million and US$13,126 million 2001: US$9,769 million are included in Deposits by banks and Customer accounts respectively.
Average repo liabilities during the year were US$19,624 million 2001: US$23,850 million.
The maximum quarter-end repo liability outstanding during the year was US$21,688 million 2001: US$24,901 million.
HSBC enters into repo and reverse repo transactions which are accounted for as secured borrowings.
Under SFAS 140, securities pledged as collateral whereby the counterparty has the right to sell or repledge the collateral would be reclassified within Debt securities and equity shares and Treasury bills and other eligible bills as encumbered.
As at 31 December 2002, the impact on Debt securities and equity shares and Treasury bills and other eligible bills would be to reclassify securities amounting to US$20,061 million as encumbered 2001: US$28,973 million.
As at 31 December 2002, collateral received under reverse repo transactions where HSBC has the right to sell or repledge the security obtained amounted to US$27,439 million gross 2001: US$35,820 million.
As at 31 December 2002, approximately US$15 billion of the collateral obtained from reverse repo transactions had been sold or pledged by HSBC in connection with repo transactions and securities sold not yet purchased 2001: approximately US$34 billion.
HSBC also enters into stock lending and borrowing transactions for which either cash or other securities may be received in exchange.
At 31 December 2002, stock lending transactions where the securities lent are subject to sale or repledge amounted to US$5,050 million 2001: US$3,966 million.
At 31 December 2002, stock borrowing transactions where the securities borrowed are subject to sale or repledge amounted to US$4,643 million 2001: US$2,972 million.
a Debt swaps Under UK GAAP, assets acquired in exchange for advances in order to achieve an orderly realisation are included at the net book value of the advance disposed of at the date of exchange, with any provision having been duly updated.
Under SFAS 15, such assets are included at the fair value at the date of acquisition.
Under US GAAP, as the Group disposed of its remaining debt swaps accounted for under SFAS 15 during 2001 there is no adjustment to shareholders funds at 31 December 2002 2001: nil.
Profit before tax would increase by US$ nil 2001: US$4 million: 2000: US$97 million to show such assets at their fair value at the date of acquisition.
b Shareholders interest in the long-term assurance fund Under UK GAAP, the value of the shareholders interest in the in-force life assurance and fund pensions policies of the long-term assurance fund are valued at the net present value of the profits inherent in such policies.
The net present value of such profits is not recognised under US GAAP.
US GAAP requires the application of different accounting treatments in a number of areas of accounting for the long-term assurance fund.
In particular, the accounting treatment of assets which are held-to-maturity, the definition and amortisation of deferred acquisition costs and the methodology for determining actuarial reserves vary between US and UK GAAP.
US GAAP profits in respect of the shareholders interest in the long-term assurance fund would have been some US$6 million lower 2001: US$152 million: 2000: US$140 million than those under UK GAAP.
Shareholders equity would be US$875 million 2001: US$798 million lower under US GAAP.
The smaller adjustment to US GAAP profits in 2002, compared with that in 2001, mainly reflects lower UK GAAP profits, where despite an increase in new business income, the growth in the present value of in-force policies has been inhibited by weak markets.
This adjustment also reduces other assets by US$875 million 2001: US$798 million under US GAAP.
c Pension costs For the purpose of the above reconciliations, the provisions of SFAS 87 Employers Accounting for Pensions have been applied to HSBCs main pension plans, which make up approximately 94% of all HSBCs schemes in terms of plan assets.
For non-US schemes, HSBC has applied SFAS 87 Employers Accounting for Pensions 295 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued with effect from 30 June 1992 as it was not feasible to apply it as of January 1989, the date specified in the standard.
The projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets at 30 June 1992 for the HSBC Bank UK Pension Scheme has been recognised as a liability under the purchase accounting requirements of APB 16 Business Combinations.
For other pension plans, the excess of the projected benefit obligation over plan assets at 30 June 1992 is recognised as a charge to pension expense over 15 years.
The projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets at 28 July 2000 for Crdit Commercial fide France was recognised as a liability under the purchase accounting adjustments of APB 16 Business Combinations.
Where the accumulated benefit obligation on a pension plan the value of the benefits accrued based on employee service up to the balance sheet date exceeds the fair value of plan assets, the employer recognises an additional minimum pension liability equal to this excess, so long as the excess is greater than any accrual which has already been established for unfunded pension costs.
At the same time, an intangible asset is established equal to the lower of the liability recognised for the unfunded benefit obligation and the amount of any unrecognised prior service cost.
At 31 December 2002, HSBC recognised an additional minimum pension liability of US$1,175 million in respect of its unfunded accumulated benefit obligations.
This liability is partially offset by an intangible asset of US$16 million.
The net impact of these items, after taking account of relevant tax assets of US$335 million, is to reduce the Groups shareholders equity under US GAAP by US$824 million.
In 2002, plans with an aggregate accumulated benefit obligation of US$12,776 million 2001: US$11,406 million and assets with an aggregate fair value of US$9,743 2001: US$10,508 million had an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets.
Plans with an aggregate projected benefit obligation of US$14,752 million 2001: US$13,225 million and assets with an aggregate fair value of US$10,989 million 2001: US$11,282 million had a projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets.
Plan assets are invested primarily in equities, fixed interest securities and property.
The disclosure requirements are only applicable to options and other awards granted from 1 January 1995 onwards and, in the initial phase-in period, the amounts reported will not be representative of the effect on reported net income for future years.
The SFAS 123 charge for the fair value of options granted since 1 January 1997 is US$240 million 2001: US$316 million: 2000: US$234 million.
The Executive Share Option Scheme, Group Share Option Plan, Savings-Related Share Option Scheme and Restricted Share Plan fall within the scope of SFAS 123.
The disclosures of options outstanding only relate to those granted from 1995 onwards.
Analysis of the movement in the number and weighted average exercise price of options is set out below.
Executive Share Option Scheme The Executive Share Option Scheme is a long-term incentive scheme available to certain HSBC employees with grants usually made each year.
Options are granted at market value and are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to vesting conditions.
No further grants will be made under the Scheme following the adoption of the Group Share Option Plan in 2000.

The number of options, weighted average exercise price, and the weighted average remaining contractual life for options outstanding at the balance sheet date, analysed by exercise price range, are below.
None of these options were exercisable at 31 December 2002, 2001 or 2000.
The options are exercisable within six months following either the third or the fifth anniversary of the commencement of the savings contract depending on conditions set at grant.
The exercise price is at a 20 per cent 2001: 20 per cent: 2000: 15 per cent discount to the market value at the date of grant.
The weighted average fair value of options granted in the year as at the date of grant was US$3.58 2001: US$3.68: 2000: US$4.31.
The number of options, weighted average exercise price, and the weighted average remaining contractual life for options outstanding at the balance sheet date, analysed by exercise price range, are as follows: 2002 2001 2000 Exercise price range..................... 1.81 - 4.00 4.01 - 6.75 1.81 - 4.00 4.01 - 6.52 1.81 - 4.00 4.01 - 6.52 Number 000................................... 2,382 119,138 3,411 127,039 15,470 105,842 Weighted average exercise price.. 3.78 6.02 3.62 5.81 3.16 5.56 Weighted average remaining contractual life years...................... 0.65 2.02 1.16 2.47 0.68 3.28 Of which exercisable: Number 000................................... -312 999 - 543 - Weighted average exercise price.. - 4.52 3.23 - 1.81 - Fair values of share options, measured at the date of grant of the option, are calculated at the date of grant using a binomial model which produces similar results to the Black-Scholes model.
The fair values calculated are inherently subjective and uncertain due to the assumptions made and the limitations of the model used.
The significant weighted average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the options granted in 2002 are as follows: 3 year Savings- 5 year SavingsGroup Share Related Share Related Share Option Plan Option Schemes Option Schemes Risk-free interest rate %............... 5.6 5.47 5.6 Expected life years....................... 5.3 3.3 5.3 Expected volatility %................... 25 30 30 300 CCF CCF granted share purchase and subscription offers to certain executives of CCF, directors and officers, as well as to certain senior executives of subsidiaries.
Options granted between 1994 and 1999 vested upon announcement of HSBCs intent to acquire CCF and were therefore included in the valuation of CCF.
CCF granted 909,000 options in 2000 after the public announcement of the acquisition and these options did not vest as a result of the change in control.
The options were subject to continued employment and vested on 1 January 2002.
The CCF shares obtained on exercise of the options are exchangeable for HSBCs ordinary shares of US$0.50 each in the same ratio as the Exchange Offer for Crdit Commercial fide France shares 13 ordinary shares of US$0.50 for each CCF share.
Options are granted at market value and are exercisable within 10 years of the vesting date.

Restricted Share Plan Conditional awards under the Restricted Share Plan Conditional awards under the Restricted Share Plan have been in operation since 1996.
It is intended to align the interests of executives to the creation of shareholder value.
This is achieved by setting certain Total Shareholder Return targets which must normally be attained in order for the awards to vest.
The weighted average remaining vesting period as at 31 December 2002 was 2.98 years 2001: 3.29 years: 2000: 3.25 years.
The 2003 conditional awards from the Restricted Share Plan in respect of 2002 will have an aggregate value at the date of award of US$18.4 million 2002 awards in respect of 2001: US$15.2 million.
301 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued Other awards made under the Restricted Share Plan Other awards are made to key employees under the Restricted Share Plan as part of their annual bonus.
The awards vest from one to three years from the date of award.
The weighted average remaining vesting period as at 31 December 2002 was 1.41 years 2001: 1.25 years: 2000: 2.35 years.
e Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiary or associated undertakings when the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair value of HSBCs share of separable net assets acquired.
Under UK GAAP, for acquisitions made on or after 1 January 1998, goodwill is included in the balance sheet in Intangible fixed assets in respect of subsidiary undertakings, in Interests in associates in respect of associates and in Interests in joint ventures in respect of joint ventures.
Capitalised goodwill is amortised over its estimated life on a straight-line basis.
Under US GAAP, goodwill on acquisitions made before 1 July 2001, including those made before 1 January 1998, would have been capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life.
Goodwill on acquisitions made after 1 July 2001 is capitalised but not amortised, and is subject to annual impairment testing.
Goodwill on acquisitions made before 1 July 2001 ceased to be amortised on 1 January 2002 and is subject to annual impairment testing.
At 31 December 2002, the cost of goodwill acquired on a US GAAP basis was US$23,781 million 2001: US$20,172 million, 2000: US$20,559 million and accumulated amortised goodwill was US$3,649 million 2001: US$3,319 million: 2000: US$2,441 million.
The following table shows changes in the carrying value of goodwill during the year: Rest of Hong AsiaNorth South Europe Kong Pacific America America Total At 1 January 2002...... 13,313 4 367 2,927 242 16,853 Additions.................... 73 6 5 1,676 - 1,760 Write down................. - - - - 31 31 Disposals.................... 56 - 1 2 1 58 Exchange and other movements................. 1,720 8 7 49 78 1,608 At 31 December 2002 15,050 18 380 4,552 132 20,132 Goodwill amounting to US$31 million was written off in the year in respect of the HSBCs operations in Argentina.
The weighted-average amortisation period for these assets is 20 years and there is no significant residual value.
No other significant intangible assets would have been recognised for US GAAP purposes on business acquisitions during 2002.
No amortisation had been charged on these assets at 31 December 2002.
The intangible asset amortisation expense for 2003 to 2007 is estimated to be US$11 million per year.
f Internal software costs Under UK GAAP, costs of software developed for internal use are generally expensed as they are incurred.
Under US GAAP, costs incurred in the application development stage of internal software must be capitalised as part of intangible assets and amortised over their estimated useful life.
HSBC recognises an adjustment in calculating its US GAAP net income, reflecting the impact of current year software development costs capitalised under US GAAP, offset by the US GAAP amortisation of these and previous years costs and by any provisions for impairment of these capitalised costs.
com, Inc. has been engaged, in development activities to provide a global website and web hosting services to HSBC companies.
A provision of US$35 million was made in 2002 2001: US$50 million for impairment against the US GAAP capitalised amount of development costs.
As at 31 December 2002, capitalised amounts in respect of hsbc.
g Purchase accounting adjustments Under UK GAAP, certain costs which relate to either post-acquisition management decisions or decisions made prior to the acquisition are required to be expensed to the profit and loss account and cannot be capitalised as goodwill.
h Accruals accounted derivatives Under UK GAAP, internal derivatives used to hedge banking book transactions may be accruals accounted but, under US GAAP, all derivatives are held at fair value.
With the exception of certain subsidiaries in North America, HSBC has not elected to satisfy the more prescriptive hedge documentation requirements of SFAS 133 in respect of external derivative contracts.
At 1 January 2001 contracts which had previously qualified as fair value hedges under US GAAP were marked to market with a corresponding revaluation of the hedged item.
There was no material ineffectiveness of these hedges and therefore no adjustment was required to US GAAP reported income.
There were no significant contracts at 1 January 2001 which had previously qualified as cash flow hedges under US GAAP.
303 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued Since 1 January 2001 further contracts which qualify as fair value hedges under SFAS 133 have been entered into by HSBCs North American subsidiaries.
These are used to hedge the risk associated with the risk free component of the value of certain fixed rate investment securities.
As above, since there was no material ineffectiveness of these hedges no adjustment is required to US GAAP reported net income.
In addition, since 1 January 2001 certain contracts which qualify as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133 have been entered into by HSBC Bank USA.
These contracts are used to hedge the forecast repricing of certain deposit liabilities.
The adjustment to US GAAP reported equity of such hedges at 31 December 2002 was to increase equity by US$42 million 2001: reduction in equity US$38 million.
All other UK GAAP hedging derivatives have been marked to market for US GAAP purposes, giving rise to the increase in US reported net income of US$221 million 2001: US$280 million: 2000: US$116 million.
The principal impact of applying SFAS133 is to reduce other assets by US$3,114 million 2001: US$2,150 million and reduce other liabilities by US$3,896 million 2001: US$2,636 million.
i Foreign exchange gains on available-for-sale securities Within individual legal entities HSBC holds securities in a number of different currencies which are classified as available-for-sale.
For example, within the private bank in Switzerland which has the US dollar as its reporting currency, the Group holds Euro-denominated bonds which are funded in Euros and Swiss Franc securities funded in Swiss Francs.
No foreign exchange exposure arises from this because, although the value of the assets in US dollar terms changes according to the exchange rate, there is an identical offsetting change in the US dollar value of the related funding.
Under UK GAAP both the assets and the liabilities are translated at closing exchange rates and the differences between historical book value and current value are reflected in foreign exchange dealing profits.
This reflects the economic substance of holding currency assets financed by currency liabilities.
However, under US accounting rules, the change in value of the investments classified as available-for-sale is taken directly to reserves whereas the offsetting change in US dollar terms of the borrowing is taken to earnings.
This leads to an accounting result, which does not reflect either the underlying risk position or the economics of the transactions.
It is also a situation that will reverse on maturity of the asset or earlier sale.
A similar difference arises where foreign currency exposure on foreign currency assets is covered using forward contracts, but where HSBC does not manage these hedges to conform with the detailed US designation requirements.
The result of this is that for 2002 HSBC's US GAAP profits are reduced by some US$2,197 million 2001: increase of US$ 312 million compared to its UK GAAP profits.
However, future periods will report an increase in US GAAP profits.
There is no difference in shareholders equity between UK GAAP and US GAAP as a result of this item.
The change in the size and direction of the adjustment between 2001 and 2002 mainly reflects the exchange rate movements in each year.
2001 saw the principal other currencies in which HSBCs holdings of available-forsale securities are denominated weaken against the US dollar by between 2 and 14 per cent.
This movement reversed in 2002 as these currencies strengthened by between 10 and 17 per cent against the US dollar.
j Investment securities Under UK GAAP, debt securities and equity shares intended to be held on a continuing basis are classified as investment securities and are included in the balance sheet at cost less provision for any permanent diminution in value.
Other participating interests are accounted for on the same basis.
Where dated investment securities have been purchased at a premium or discount, these premiums and discounts are amortised through the profit and loss account over the period from the date of purchase to the date of maturity and included in interest 304 income.
These securities are included in the balance sheet at cost adjusted for the amortisation of premium and discounts arising on acquisition.
Other debt securities and equity shares are included in the balance sheet at market value.
Changes in the market value of such assets are recognised in the profit and loss account as Dealing profits as they arise.
Debt securities and listed equity shares which were acquired in exchange for advances in order to achieve an orderly realisation continue to be reported as advances under UK GAAP.
Under SFAS 115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, all the above debt securities and equity shares, with the exception of equity investments without a readily determinable market value, are classified and disclosed within one of the following three categories: held-to-maturity: available-forsale: or trading.
Held-to-maturity securities are measured at amortised cost less provision for any other-thantemporary declines in value.
Available-for-sale securities are measured at fair value with unrealised holding gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported net of applicable taxes and minority interests in a separate component of shareholders funds.
Provisions for other-than-temporary declines in value of available-for-sale securities are recognised in earnings.
Under US GAAP, HSBCs investment securities, other participating interests and debt securities and equity shares with a readily determinable market value acquired in exchange for advances are classified as availablefor-sale securities, except for certain securities held by RNYC at acquisition, which were classified as held-tomaturity.
All other debt and equity shares are categorised as trading securities.
US$393 million 2001: US$442 million, 2000: US$270 million of net gains were reclassified out of OCI and recognised as part of income for the year.
Upon adoption of SFAS 133 in 2001, HSBC transferred US$190 million of securities previously classified as held-to-maturity to securities available-for-sale.
The reclassification resulted in a net of tax cumulative effect adjustment loss of US$11 million.
Under the provisions of SFAS 133, such a reclassification does not call into question HSBCs interest to hold current or future debt securities to their maturity.
At the same date, HSBC transferred US$1,042 million of securities from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity.
During 2002, HSBC recorded net losses under US GAAP of US$308 million 2001 US$104 million: 2000: US$25 million in respect of diminutions in value of available-for-sale securities which were considered to be other than temporary.
These losses were treated as realised items and included in net income.
Available-for-sale The following table provides an analysis of available-for-sale securities under US GAAP.
The principal impact of the adjustment described below is to increase the carrying value of investment securities under US GAAP by US$2,047 million in 2002 2001: US$1,230 million.

HSBC recognised these losses through its income statement in 2001: these amounted to US$520 million.
Following pesification, HSBC Argentinas balance sheet primarily reflected Argentine peso assets more than fully funded by Argentine peso liabilities and this represents HSBCs ongoing business in Argentina.
On top of this HSBC Argentina had residual external US dollar liabilities which essentially represented a portion of the loss recognised in 2001.
Under UK GAAP these US dollar liabilities, as they are no longer funding the ongoing business, are treated as a separate operation with the US dollar as the unit of account.
To date, these liabilities have been settled as they fall due by the Group outside Argentina.
As HSBC prepares its accounts in US dollars no further translation effect arises.
Under US GAAP this accounting treatment is not possible and the US dollar liabilities are treated as part of the Argentine operation which accounts in Argentine pesos.
As a result, as the Argentine peso weakens, the US dollar denominated liabilities generate a substantial loss in Argentine pesos which is reflected in US GAAP income.
However, as HSBC accounts in US dollars and economically there is no change in the amount of US dollars owing an exactly offsetting gain is reflected in the US GAAP accounts in shareholders equity.

A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if, based on available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realised.
m Loans and advances SFAS 114 Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan as amended by SFAS No.
118 Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan Income Recognition and Disclosures is effective for accounting periods 307 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued beginning after 15 December 1994.
SFAS 114 addresses accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan by specifying how allowances for credit losses for certain loans should be determined.
A loan is impaired when it is probable that the creditor will be unable to collect all amounts in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
Impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective rate or, as an expedient, at the fair value of the loans collateral.
Leases, smaller-balance homogeneous loans and debt securities are excluded from the scope of SFAS 114.
At 31 December 2002, HSBC estimated that the difference between the carrying value of its loan portfolio on the basis of SFAS 114 and its value in HSBCs UK GAAP financial statements was such that no adjustment to net income or shareholders equity was required.
Impaired loans are those reported by HSBC as non-performing: the value of such loans at 31 December 2002 amounted to US$10,520 million 2001: US$9,658 million.
Of this total, loans which were included within the scope of SFAS 114 and for which a provision has been established amounted to US$8,294 million 2001: US$8,085 million.
The impairment reserve in respect of these loans estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 114 was US$4,868 million 2001: US$4,441 million.
During the year ended 31 December 2002, impaired loans, including those excluded from SFAS 114, averaged US$9,153 million 2001: US$9,617 million and interest income recognised on these loans was US$258 million 2001: US$261 million: 2000: US$324 million.
n Fair value of financial instruments SFAS 107 Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments requires disclosure of the estimated fair values of certain financial instruments, both on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet, where it is practicable to do so.
Where possible, fair values have been estimated using market prices for the financial instruments.
Where market prices are not available, fair values have been estimated using quoted prices for financial instruments with similar characteristics, or otherwise using a suitable valuation technique where practicable to do so.
The fair value information presented represents HSBCs best estimate of those values and may be subject to certain assumptions and limitations.
The fair values presented in the table on page 310 are at a specific date and may be significantly different from the amounts which will actually be paid or received on the maturity or settlement date.
In many cases, the estimated fair values could not be realised immediately and accordingly do not represent the value of these financial instruments to HSBC as a going concern.
HSBC has excluded the fair value of intangible assets, such as values placed on its portfolio of core deposits, credit card relationships and customer goodwill, as these are not considered to constitute financial instruments for the purposes of SFAS 107.
HSBC believes such items to be significant and essential to the overall evaluation of HSBCs worth.
In view of the above, comparisons of fair values between financial institutions may not be meaningful and users are advised to exercise caution when using this data.
Financial instruments for which fair value is equal to carrying value The following table lists those financial instruments, within the scope of SFAS 107, where carrying value is an approximation of fair value because they are either i carried at market value or ii short term in nature or reprice frequently.
By definition, the fair value of trading account assets and liabilities, including derivative instruments, equals carrying value.
Carrying values of these instruments are presented on the balance sheets and related notes on pages 191 to 313.
308 Assets Liabilities Cash and balances at central banks Deposits by banks repayable on demand or that mature reprice within six months Items in the course of collection Customer accounts repayable on demand or that mature reprice within six months Hong Kong SAR Government certificates of Hong Kong SAR currency notes in circulation indebtedness Trading debt securities and equity shares Short positions in treasury bills, debt securities and equity shares Treasury bills and other eligible bills Items in the course of transmission Other assets Other liabilities Prepayments and accrued income Accruals and deferred income Off-balance-sheet trading instruments Provisions for liabilities and charges Off-balance-sheet trading instruments In addition, the fair value of non-derivative off balance sheet financial instruments is the same as their carrying value under US GAAP.
Other financial instruments The fair value of other financial instruments within the scope of SFAS 107 is set out in the table below.
The valuation technique adopted for each major category is discussed below: Loans and advances to banks and customers For personal and commercial loans and advances which mature or reprice after six months, fair value is principally estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows including interest at contractual rates.
Performing loans are grouped, to the extent possible, into homogenous pools segregated by maturity and the coupon rates of the loans within each pool.
In general, cash flows are discounted using current market rates for instruments with similar maturity, repricing and credit risk characteristics.
The fair value for residential mortgages may be treated differently where there is an established market value for asset-backed securities, such as in the United States.
In such situations, the fair value is estimated by reference to quoted market prices for loans with similar characteristics and maturities.
For non-performing uncollateralised commercial loans, an estimate is made of the time period to realise these cash flows and the fair value is estimated by discounting these cash flows at a risk-free rate of interest.
For nonperforming commercial loans where collateral exists, the fair value is the lesser of the carrying value of the loans, net of specific provisions, or the fair value of the collateral, discounted where appropriate.
General provisions are deducted from the fair values of these non-performing loans.
Debt securities and equity shares held for investment purposes, and other participating interests Listed investment securities are valued at middle market prices and unlisted investment securities at managements valuation which takes into consideration future earnings streams, valuations of equivalent quoted securities and other relevant techniques.
Fair value is estimated using discounted cash flows, applying either market rates, where applicable, or current rates offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
309 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued Debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities Fair value is estimated using quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The following table presents the carrying value and fair value for those financial instruments whose fair value is derived using these various estimation techniques: 2002 2001 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair value value value value US$m US$m US$m US$m Assets Loans and advances to banks and customers.. 447,840 449,968 413,290 415,664 Debt securities non-trading.......................... 107,900 109,897 93,293 94,314 Equity shares non-trading............................ 4,756 5,239 4,755 5,294 Other participating interests............................ 651 747 120 172 Liabilities Deposits by banks and customer accounts...... 548,371 548,302 503,631 503,725 Debt securities in issue................................... 34,965 35,297 27,098 26,635 Subordinated liabilities................................... 18,371 19,613 15,480 15,799 Non-equity minority interests......................... 4,431 4,420 4,291 4,221 The fair value of derivative financial instruments is the same as their carrying value under US GAAP.
o Earnings per share Basic earnings per share under US GAAP, SFAS 128 Earnings per share, is calculated by dividing net income of US$4,900 million 2001: US$4,911 million: 2000: US$6,236 million by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue in 2002 of 9,339 million 2001: 9,237 million: 2000: 8,777 million.
Diluted earnings per share under US GAAP is calculated by dividing net income, which requires no adjustment for the effects of dilutive ordinary potential shares, by the weighted average number of shares outstanding plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares in 2002 of 9,436 million 2001: 9,336 million: 2000: 8,865 million, as shown in Note 11. p Variable interest entities Application of FIN 46 In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No.
46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.
Variable Interest Entities VIEs are entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.
VIEs are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary.
The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests.
FIN 46 also requires new disclosures about VIEs.
HSBC implemented FIN 46 for VIEs created after 31 January 2003 on 1 February 2003 with regards to its US reporting requirements and is evaluating the impact that the provisions of FIN 46 will have on the US GAAP information within its consolidated financial statements.
310 Nature, purpose and activities of VIEs with which HSBC is involved HSBC makes limited use of VIE structures in its business and principally engages in these transactions to facilitate client needs.
Any use by HSBC of a VIE structure in a business transaction is commercially driven.
Utilisation of a VIE occurs only after careful consideration has been given to the most appropriate structure needed to achieve HSBCs control and risk allocation objectives and to ensure the most efficient structure from a taxation and regulatory perspective.
Business activities within HSBC where VIEs are utilised primarily include asset-backed commercial paper conduits, securitisation vehicles, and public and private sector infrastructure related projects and funds.
HSBC currently consolidates entities in which it has a controlling financial interest in accordance with UK GAAP.
HSBCs interests in entities that may be deemed to be VIEs will change over time as a result of ongoing commercial activities and it is possible that such entities may be consolidated and deconsolidated at various points in time.
As a result, the accounting treatment of HSBCs variable interests included below may not be the same at 31 December 2003.
VIEs where HSBC is the primary beneficiary At 31 December 2002, the aggregate size of VIEs where HSBC believe that it is the primary beneficiary is analysed as follows: Activity Size Carrying amount US$ m US$ m Asset-backed commercial paper conduits.................... 2,015 2,015 Securitisation vehicles.................................................. 2,949 2,949 4,964 4,964 The third party liabilities of these entities are supported by the collateral held by the issuing VIEs.
At 31 December 2002, HSBC consolidated all VIEs where it was the primary beneficiary, although one entity Clover is included under the linked presentation method, as explained in Note 16.
VIEs where HSBC is not the primary beneficiary At 31 December 2002, the aggregate size of VIEs where HSBC does not believe that it is the primary beneficiary, but has a significant involvement is analysed as follows: HSBC maximum Size exposure to loss Activity US$ m US$ m Asset-backed commercial paper conduits.................... 1,250 685 Securitisation vehicles.................................................. 1,010 519 Public and private sector infrastructure projects and funds.......................................................................... 4,217 433 6,477 1,637 In the case of the commercial paper conduits and securitisation vehicles, HSBCs exposure to loss generally arises through back-up liquidity facility commitments.
In the case of infrastructure projects, HSBCs exposure to loss generally arises through on-balance sheet financing of these projects.
q Consolidated cash flow statement HSBC prepares its cash flow statement in accordance with the UK Financial Reporting Standard 1 Revised 1996 Cash flow statements.
Its objectives and principles are similar to those set out in SFAS 95 Statement of cash flows, as amended by SFAS 104 Statement of cash flows Net reporting of certain cash receipts and cash 311 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued payments and classification of cash flows from hedging transactions.
FRS 1 Revised defines cash as cash and balances at central banks and advances to banks payable on demand.
Under US GAAP, Cash equivalents are defined as short-term highly liquid investments that are both: convertible to known amounts of cash: and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of fluctuations in interest rates.
The other principal differences between US and UK GAAP are in respect of classification.
Under UK GAAP, HSBC presents its cash flows by: a Operating activities: b Dividends received from associates: c Returns on investments and servicing of finance: d Taxation: e Capital expenditure and financial investments: f Acquisitions and disposals: g Equity dividends paid: and h Financing.
Under US GAAP, only three categories are required.
These are: a Operating: b Investing: and c Financing.
