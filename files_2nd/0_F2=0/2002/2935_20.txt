Carillion plc Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Principal accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements except as noted below.
During the year, the Group adopted Financial Reporting Standard FRS 19 Deferred tax and Urgent Issues Task Force UITF abstract 34 Pre-contract costs.
The impact of the changes in accounting policies on the current and preceding years financial statements arising from the adoption of FRS 19 and UITF 34 is disclosed in Note 31.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of certain tangible fixed assets comprising land and buildings, and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December 2002.
Unless otherwise stated the acquisition method of accounting has been applied.
Under this method acquired subsidiaries are included from the date of acquisition.
Disposals are accounted for up to the date control passes to a third party.
A joint venture is an undertaking in which the Group has a long term interest and over which it exercises joint control.
The Groups share of the profits less losses of joint ventures is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest in their net assets other than goodwill is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
Where a Group company is party to a joint arrangement that is not an entity, that company accounts directly for its share of the income and expenditure, assets, liabilities and cash flows.
Such arrangements are reported in the consolidated financial statements on the same basis.
Fixed asset investments In the Companys financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost, less provision for any impairment.
Company shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP Trust are included in both the Group and Company financial statements as a fixed asset investment until such time as the interest in the shares is transferred unconditionally to the employees.
The purchase costs of the shares are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the costs over the relevant performance period of the plans.
Costs of administering the trust are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions, being the difference between the fair value of the purchase consideration and the fair value of the identifiable net assets of an acquired company or business, including an interest in a joint venture, is capitalised and amortised in equal annual instalments over its useful economic life.
Prior to 1 January 1998, goodwill was written off to reserves on acquisition.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets, this treatment has continued to be applied for those years.
Any such goodwill previously written off to reserves is included in the calculation of any profit or loss on disposal in respect of businesses subsequently disposed of or terminated.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 51 Carillion plc Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1.
Principal accounting policies continued Long term contract balances Amounts recoverable on contracts, which are included in debtors, are stated at cost plus attributable profit less any foreseeable losses.
Payments received on account of contracts are deducted from amounts recoverable on contracts in debtors or long term contract balances in stock.
Where such amounts have been received and exceed amounts recoverable the net amounts are included in creditors.
Profit recognition Profit on long term contracts is calculated in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
In determining the attributable profit on contracts to a particular accounting period the Group utilises estimation techniques.
The principal estimation technique used is the preparation of profit and cash flow forecasts on a contract by contract basis which enables an assessment to be made of the final out turn on each contract.
Profit is then recognised when the outcome of the contract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty and is attributed in line with the degree of completion of each contract.
The result for each year includes settlement of claims on contracts completed in prior years.
In preparing contract forecasts, a prudent and reasonable evaluation of claims is included in the assessment of the final out turn.
Property development profits are recognised on contractual completion.
Group turnover Group turnover represents the net amount receivable, excluding value added tax, for goods and services supplied to external customers.
In respect of long term contracting activities, turnover reflects the value of work executed during each year.
It also includes the Groups proportion of work carried out under joint arrangements during the year.
Stocks Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Tangible fixed assets The Group has continued to follow the transitional provisions of FRS 15 Tangible fixed assets to retain the book value of freehold land and buildings, which were last revalued in 1985.
Depreciation is based on historical cost or revaluation, less the estimated residual values, and the estimated economic lives of the assets concerned.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other tangible assets are depreciated in equal annual instalments over the period of their estimated economic lives, which are principally as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Long leasehold land and buildings 50 years Short leasehold land and buildings Period of lease Plant, machinery and vehicles 3-10 years Leased assets Operating lease rental charges are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the life of each lease.
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are included in tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the contract term or their useful life.
The capital element of outstanding finance leases and hire purchase contracts is included in creditors.
The finance charge element of rentals is charged to the profit and loss account at a constant periodic rate of charge on the outstanding obligations.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the result for each year and takes into account deferred taxation, calculated in accordance with the requirements of FRS 19 Deferred tax.
Deferred tax assets or liabilities, which arise from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in the tax computation, are calculated on a non-discounted full provision basis.
This policy reflects a change from previous years, where deferred tax assets or liabilities were only recognised on a partial provision basis.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 52 Carillion plc Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling and recorded using the contracted exchange rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the relevant balance sheet date and the gains and losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
The profit and loss accounts and balance sheets of overseas undertakings and joint ventures are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year.
Gains or losses arising on the translation of the opening net assets of such overseas undertakings are taken to reserves together with exchange differences on related foreign currency hedges.
Share incentive schemes Where share incentives are granted with an exercise price of less than the market price at the date of grant the difference is charged to the profit and loss account over the period to the exercisable date of the incentives.
Due regard is made to the likelihood of the stipulated performance criteria being attained with the charge being amended accordingly.
No cost is recognised in respect of SAYE schemes that are offered on similar terms to all or substantially all employees as permitted by UITF 17 Employee Share Schemes.
The purchase cost of ESOP shares see Note 15 is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost over the relevant performance period of the plans to which the trust relates.
The ESOP trust is regarded as a quasi subsidiary under FRS 5 and its assets, liabilities and results are consolidated into the financial statements of both the Company and the Group.
Pensions Regular pension costs in respect of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes are established in accordance with the recommendations of independent actuaries and are charged to the profit and loss account based on the expected pension costs over the employees service lives with the Group.
Current actuarial surpluses or deficits are amortised over the average expected remaining service lives of current employees on a systematic basis.
The difference between the amounts charged or credited to the profit and loss account and the contributions made to the pension schemes is included within debtors or creditors as appropriate.
Contributions to the Groups defined contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
The Group continues to follow the transitional provisions as permitted by FRS 17 Retirement benefits at 31 December 2002 which are disclosed in Note 30.
Bid costs The Group has adopted UITF 34 Pre-contract costs which came into effect during the year.
The abstract addresses the accounting treatment of pre-contract costs and represents best practice in accounting for these costs.
Following adoption of the abstract, pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred until the Group is appointed preferred bidder.
Provided the contract is expected to generate sufficient net cash inflows to enable recovery and the award of the contract is virtually certain, pre-contract costs incurred post the appointment as preferred bidder are included in stocks.
Where pre-contract bid costs are reimbursed at financial close, the proceeds are initially applied against the asset included in stocks.
Any excess recoveries are carried forward as deferred income and released to profit over the period of the contract to which the pre-contract costs relate.
This policy reflects a change from previous years when the Group, once it had been selected as preferred bidder for a project and where in the opinion of the Directors the project was reasonably certain to achieve its financial close in the next twelve months, recognised the costs estimated to be refunded on completion in stocks.
Interest Interest is written off to the profit and loss account as incurred by all subsidiaries in the Group.
Interest incurred on borrowings within the Groups joint ventures relating to the construction of assets in PPP projects is capitalised until the relevant assets are brought into operational use.

Taxation a Analysis of taxation charge in year 2001 2002 as restated m m UK taxation: Corporation tax 9.7 2.4 Adjustment in respect of previous periods 1.3 1.3 Attributable taxation of joint ventures 1.9 5.4 Overseas taxation: Current year 1.1 0.9 Adjustment in respect of previous periods 0.2 0.1 Total current taxation 13.8 7.5 Deferred taxation: Origination and reversal of timing differences 0.2 0.4 Adjustment in respect of previous periods 0.7 2.2 Total deferred taxation 0.9 2.6 Total taxation on profit on ordinary activities 12.9 10.1 The tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2001 has been restated following adoption by the Group of FRS 19 Deferred tax and UITF 34 Pre-contract costs as disclosed in Note 31. b Reconciliation of current taxation charge The UK standard rate of corporation tax for the year is 30% 2001: 30%.
The actual tax rate differs from the standard rate for the reasons set out below: 2001 2002 as restated m m Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 42.2 34.7 Taxation on profit on ordinary activities at UK standard rate of corporation tax of 30% 2001: 30% 12.7 10.4 Permanent differences 2.6 1.2 Other timing differences 0.2 0.4 Other timing differences not recognised 0.7 2.8 Overseas profits not taxable 0.5 0.2 Utilisation of overseas losses not previously recognised 1.0 0.1 Capital items not taxable 0.1 1.2 Amortisation of own shares 1.0 0.6 Amortisation of goodwill 0.7 0.2 Adjustment in respect of previous periods 1.1 1.2 Current taxation charge for the year 13.8 7.5 c Factors that may affect future tax charges The Group has brought forward tax losses in excess of 100m which have not yet been fully agreed by the Inland Revenue.
In accordance with FRS 19, a deferred tax asset, valued in excess of 30m, has not been recognised in respect of these losses due to the lack of certainty regarding quantum and timing of future years taxable profits in the companies involved.
In the event that such profits are realised this may result in the Group tax rate being lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK.
The tax rate in the joint venture companies in which the Group has PPP investments is likely to be greater than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK.
This is generally due to capital expenditure not qualifying for tax relief.
As the PPP element of the Groups profit before taxation increases in future years it will have the effect of increasing the Groups tax rate above the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK.

Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 64 Carillion plc 21.
Financial instruments and risk management The main purpose of the Groups financial instruments is to provide finance for its operations.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, include bank loans and overdrafts, cash and short term deposits.
In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade debtors and trade creditors, arise directly from the Groups operations.
The Groups derivative transactions relate to forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Groups policies with regard to financial instruments have remained unchanged throughout the year.
The Groups treasury department manages the main financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board.
These are discussed in detail below and in the Financial Review on pages 28 to 30 and are designed to reduce the financial risks affecting the Group.
The Groups treasury department does not enter into speculative financial transactions.
The Groups main financial risks are funding and liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.
Funding and Liquidity The financial assets and liabilities of the Group may be summarised as follows: 2002 2001 Weighted Weighted average average period until period until maturity of maturity of Assets Liabilities liabilities Assets Liabilities liabilities m m years m m years Nil coupon: Sterling 2.9 9.6 1.8 7.6 5.8 1.9 Canadian dollars 5.3 0.1 1.5 7.3 0.4 1.5 Euro currencies 0.4 0.3 Other 2.6 1.7 1.5 2.6 2.4 1.5 11.2 11.4 1.8 17.8 8.6 1.8 Floating rate: Sterling 50.4 50.5 55.5 17.1 Canadian dollars 8.3 16.5 13.1 17.2 Euro currencies 19.5 12.7 11.9 8.6 Other 6.8 0.1 13.9 85.0 79.8 94.4 42.9 Fixed rate: Sterling 7.1 6.5 Euro currencies 0.2 0.2 Other 0.1 0.2 7.4 6.9 Total 96.2 98.6 112.2 58.4 Summary by currency Sterling 53.3 67.2 63.1 29.4 Canadian dollars 13.6 16.6 20.4 17.6 Euro currencies 19.9 12.9 12.2 8.8 Other 9.4 1.9 16.5 2.6 Total 96.2 98.6 112.2 58.4 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 65 Carillion plc Notes to the Financial Statements continued 21.
Financial instruments continued The Groups financial assets, which exclude short term debtors and pension prepayments, consist primarily of cash at bank and on deposit, which earn interest at money market related rates.
The financial assets on which no interest is earned are primarily trade debtors and amounts recoverable on contracts, which are expected to be received in more than one year.
The Groups financial liabilities, which exclude short term creditors and deferred income relating to PPP bid cost recoveries, are set out above.
No interest rate swaps or caps have been entered into by the Group.
Floating rate financial liabilities comprise bank borrowings that bear interest based upon money market or base rate related interest rates.
Fixed rate financial liabilities comprise finance lease and hire purchase contract liabilities.
The Groups consolidated cash position at the balance sheet date is not representative of the position at other times of the year.
Whilst material working capital movements and the resultant cash flows are a significant feature of the Groups cash profile throughout the year, a number of factors combine to exaggerate the year end position.
Such factors include a reduction in the demand for working capital over the extended holiday period, shorter daylight and therefore working hours and a traditional industry focus on the settlement of contractual claims.
Interest Rate Risk The Groups debt is predominantly short term and related to working capital movements.
No interest rate hedging is currently undertaken.
Currency Exposure The Group has small and infrequent transactional currency exposures.
Group policy requires net exposures to be hedged using forward contracts or currency options as soon as a contractual commitment is made.
The Groups policy on hedging currency net assets is to hedge, where practical, at least 50% of the net asset value of overseas investments where such net assets exceed 10m equivalent.
This hedging is currently achieved through currency borrowings and forward contracts.
There were no material unrecognised gains or losses on instruments used for exchange rate hedging either during or at the end of the year.
The Groups currency exposures are: Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities US Dollars Euro Danish Kr Other Total Functional currency of Group operation m m m m m At 31 December 2002 Sterling 0.2 1.4 1.8 3.4 Other 1.3 0.6 1.9 Total 1.3 0.2 1.4 2.4 5.3 At 31 December 2001 Sterling 0.1 0.6 7.3 1.0 6.8 Other 7.3 7.3 Total 7.2 0.6 7.3 1.0 14.1 At 31 December 2002 the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts in place for the sale of US$17.3m which acts as a hedge for assets denominated in currencies linked to the US dollar.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 66 Carillion plc The maturity profile of the financial liabilities, other than short term creditors such as trade creditors, accruals and deferred income relating to PPP bid cost recoveries, is as follows: Other Finance financial Group Overdrafts Loans leases liabilities Total m m m m m At 31 December 2002 More than five years 1.6 0.2 1.8 Between two and five years 61.5 2.2 2.6 66.3 Between one and two years 1.5 8.6 10.1 More than one year 61.5 5.3 11.4 78.2 Less than one year 18.3 2.1 20.4 18.3 61.5 7.4 11.4 98.6 At 31 December 2001 Between two and five years 2.8 2.5 5.3 Between one and two years 1.8 6.1 7.9 More than one year 4.6 8.6 13.2 Less than one year 25.7 17.2 2.3 45.2 25.7 17.2 6.9 8.6 58.4 In addition, there were the following undrawn facilities, with an average maturity of 1 year and 10 months in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met: 2002 2001 m m Expiring in one year or less but extendible by one year at the Groups option 7.5 96.8 Expiring in one year or less but extendible by two years at the Groups option 16.0 43.5 Expiring between two and five years 83.5 107.0 140.3 Credit Risk and Exposures The Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.
Credit exposures on financial instruments arise through short term deposits and foreign exchange hedging.
Such transactions are executed only with highly credit rated, authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly.
Fair Values The book and fair values of the Groups financial instruments at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001 are not materially different.

Acquisitions and disposals a Acquisitions On 6 September 2002, the Group acquired a portfolio of facilities management contracts from Citex Management Services Limited.
The total consideration of 8.9m was satisfied in cash and includes costs of 0.5m that were associated with the acquisition.
The acquisition did not give rise to the transfer of any fixed assets or working capital to the Group and therefore the consideration paid of 8.9m represents goodwill.
The goodwill is being amortised over six years as disclosed in Note 12.
The Group made equity investments amounting to 0.1m see Note 14 in joint venture companies during the year.

Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 72 Carillion plc 30.
Pension arrangements Carillion operates a number of pension schemes in the United Kingdom for eligible employees.
The main defined benefit schemes are: The Carillion Staff Pension Scheme The Carillion B Pension Scheme The Carillion Public Sector Pension Scheme Shared Cost Sections of the Railways Pension Scheme Carillion Staff and B Pension Schemes Actuarial valuations of the above schemes were undertaken by Carillions independent actuaries as at 31 March 2000.
The projected unit method was used and the key actuarial assumptions were: % per annum Staff Scheme B Scheme Long term rate of investment return 6.0 6.0 General salary and wage inflation 5.0 6.0 Pension increase rate 3.0 3.0 The market value of the schemes assets at this date were 443m and 114m, the value of which represented approximately 127% and 140% of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date, after allowing for assumed future increases in earnings.
Having kept the funding position under regular review and in the light of the prevailing downturn in investment markets, the Group recommenced its contributions to the schemes in December 2002.
The contributions paid during 2002 were 1.1m 2001: nil in respect of the Carillion Staff Pension Scheme and 0.1m 2001: nil in respect of the Carillion B Pension Scheme.
A full valuation of the schemes as at 31 December 2002 is under way.
Carillion Public Sector Pension Scheme This scheme was established to accept transfers from public sector schemes where the Group tenders for public sector outsourcing or PPP contracts.
It is generally a condition of such tenders that the contractor must offer pension arrangements for the employees concerned which are broadly comparable to those provided in the public sector.
The last formal valuation was carried out by independent actuaries as at 31 December 2000.
The attained age method was used and the key actuarial assumptions were: Long term rate of investment return 7% Increases to pensionable salaries 5% Real investment return above pay increases 2% Real investment return above price inflation 4% Increases to pensions in payment in excess of GMPs 3% Price inflation 3% Real pension increases above price inflation 0% At 31 December 2000 the market value of the schemes assets was 65.2m, which represented approximately 135% of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date, after allowing for assumed future increases in earnings.
The employer contributes to this scheme at the rate of 14% of pensionable salaries.
The contributions paid during 2002 were 2.0m 2001: 1.9m.
A full valuation of the scheme as at 31 December 2002 is under way.
Shared Cost Sections of the Railways Pension Scheme Employees of GTRM and Centrac who were previously employees of British Rail have pension provision via Shared Cost Sections of the Railways Pension Scheme.
The Railways Pension Scheme is an industry-wide scheme administered by Pensions Management Limited on behalf of the Railways Pension Trustee Company Limited.
Shared cost arrangements are such that the employer and members share the cost of future service liabilities on a 60 40 split respectively and any surplus emerging over time is dealt with on a similar basis.
The current funding rate of these Shared Cost Sections is 12.5%, split 7.5% and 5% between the employer and scheme members respectively.
This is a reduced rate and is being subsidised by existing surpluses in the Shared Cost Section.
This approach is in common with the majority of the Shared Cost Sections of the Railways Pension Scheme.
The contributions paid by the employer during 2002 were 4.2m 2001: 0.8m for GTRM and 0.1m 2001: 0.1m for Centrac.
Independent actuaries appointed by the Railways Pension Trustee Company Limited carried out a formal valuation of the Railways Pension Scheme at 31 December 2001 using the projected unit method for GTRM and the attained age method for Centrac.
Both valuations were carried out on a market value basis using the following key financial assumptions: % per annum GTRM Centrac Return on investments 5.61 5.53 Pay inflation 4.00 4.00 Promotional salary scale 0.75 0.75 Increases in pensions and State basic pension increases 2.50 2.50 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 73 Carillion plc Notes to the Financial Statements continued 30.
Pension arrangements continued The value of the assets of the GTRM section at the valuation date was 263.4m.
This represented 108% of the past service liabilities taking account of future salary increases and the value of reserves.
The value of the assets of the Centrac section at the valuation date was 26.1m.
This represented 115% of the past service liabilities taking account of future salary increases and the value of reserves.
The next full valuation is due as at 31 December 2004.
Other UK and overseas schemes The Group also operates two UK defined contribution schemes, the Carillion Operatives Retirement Plan and the Carillion Services Retirement Plan, both of which are closed to new entrants and are in the process of being merged within a single trust.
Benefits similar to those previously offered through these arrangements are now provided via stakeholder pension schemes.
For construction operatives, the stakeholder pension operated by the Building and Civil Engineering Trustee Limited is used.
Employees may participate on a minimal level but for those who are prepared to commit to a percentage of salary, the Company will match an employee contribution rate of 2% of earnings up to the upper earnings limit each year for the first five years of membership and 3% thereafter.
Death in service lump sum benefits are provided in addition.
Employees of Carillion Services who are not eligible for other Carillion schemes are invited to participate in the Carillion Stakeholder Plus managed by Merrill Lynch Investment Management.
Employees contribute 5% and the employer 6.5% of basic salaries.
Membership of the Carillion Stakeholder on a non-contributory basis by the employer is open to any Carillion employee subject to the requirements of the Inland Revenue on concurrent membership of pension schemes.
The Carillion Group operates a defined benefit scheme for employees of Carillion Canada Inc which is managed locally, and also provides other post retirement benefits for senior Canadian employees on a defined contribution basis.
Contributions during 2002 were 0.3m 2001: 0.3m in respect of UK defined contribution schemes, nil 2001: nil in respect of the Canada defined benefit scheme and 0.8m 2001: nil in respect of other post retirement benefits for senior Canadian employees.
SSAP 24 pension costs Statement of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs requires that the cost of providing pensions is recognised over the period benefiting from the employees services, with any differences between the charge to the profit and loss account and the contributions paid to the schemes being shown as an asset or liability on the balance sheet.
The pension cost has been assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the assumptions below: % per annum Staff B Scheme Public Sector GTRM Centrac Return on investments 7.5 7.5 7.5 7.5 7.5 Pay inflation 4.2 5.2 4.2 4.2 4.2 Pension increase rate 2.5 3.0 3.0 2.5 2.5 Variations in cost have been spread over the estimated average remaining working lifetime of the members of each scheme.
In addition to the contributions paid in the year, the SSAP 24 adjustment to the pension prepayments in respect of the Staff, B and Public Sector schemes during the year under review was an increase of 1.2m 2001: nil.
In addition to the contributions paid in the year, the SSAP 24 adjustment to the pension prepayments in respect of the Shared Cost Sections of the Railways Pension Scheme was a reduction of 0.8m 2001: 0.7m in respect of GTRM and nil 2001: 0.3m in respect of Centrac.
Based on the actuarial valuations dated 31 March 2000 and under the provisions of SSAP 24, the Group could have taken a credit to the profit and loss account for the current year in respect of the Staff, B and Public Sector schemes.
However, having taken actuarial advice following the fall in equity markets since the last full valuation, the Directors decided not to take a credit to the profit and loss account for the year ended 31 December 2002.
An interim valuation of the Staff and B schemes was undertaken at 31 March 2002 using broadly similar assumptions to the 31 March 2000 valuation.
The results of this valuation indicated that the current employer contribution holiday could continue and that a nil profit and loss charge for the year ended 31 December 2002 is still appropriate.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits Group Whilst the Group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24, under FRS 17 Retirement benefits the following transitional disclosures are required.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 74 Carillion plc The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuary in providing the FRS 17 position were: % per annum 31 December 2002 31 December 2001 UK Canada UK Canada Rate of increase in salaries 3.58 3.50 3.75 3.75 Rate of increase in pensions 2.33 2.50 2.50 2.50 Inflation rate 2.33 2.50 2.50 2.50 Discount rate 5.50 6.25 5.80 5.80 The market values of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term, may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present values of the schemes liabilities are calculated by reference to the investment return on Grade AA corporate bonds.
The assumptions used do not necessarily represent the investment return that may be achieved.

Hence, as permitted by FRS 17, the schemes will be accounted for by the Company as if the schemes were defined contribution schemes when the accounting standard is fully adopted.
