In accordance with the concession granted under the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of The BOC Group plc has not been presented separately in these financial statements.
There were no material differences between reported profits and losses and historical cost profits and losses on ordinary activities before tax for 2002, 2001 and 2000.
Profit attributable to the parent company includes dividends received from subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, often through intermediate holding companies.
These dividends may include the distribution of earnings of previous periods.
As a result, the relationship of profit between parent, subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates may show fluctuations from year to year.
