Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2002 1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
The particular accounting policies adopted are described below.
These policies have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year with the exception of the policy for deferred tax, which has been amended to reflect adoption of Financial Reporting Standard FRS Number 19 Deferred Taxation which became applicable during the year.
No adjustments arose as a result of the adoption of FRS 19 and there was no significant impact on the current or prior year reported results.
Accounting convention The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Waste Recycling Group plc and all its subsidiaries made up to 31 December 2002.
Acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, a separate profit and loss account for the Company has not been presented.
The profit for the financial year of the Company amounted to 8,548,000 2001 9,132,000.
Goodwill Purchased goodwill and goodwill arising on consolidation, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired, is capitalised and is written off on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life up to a maximum of 20 years.
The Directors regard 20 years as a reasonable maximum for the estimated useful life of goodwill.
As a matter of accounting policy, goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to the implementation of FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets, has been eliminated against reserves.
Amounts will be charged or credited to the profit and loss account on subsequent disposal of the business to which it relates.
Turnover Turnover represents sales of goods and services including landfill tax but excluding value added tax.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost.
Depreciation is provided on tangible fixed assets in use at rates calculated to write off the cost less residual value of each asset as follows: Freehold buildings over 25 to 50 years Landfill sites, leasehold properties and licence agreements over the expected life of each site Leased assets over the term of the lease Plant and equipment over 3 to 20 years Motor vehicles over 4 years No depreciation is provided for on freehold land.
Expenditure on landfill sites includes engineering costs.
Elements of these costs are classified according to their expected economic life and depreciated accordingly in proportion to the rate that waste is deposited.
All other assets are depreciated on a straight line basis.
Capital instruments Capital instruments are recorded at the fair value of the consideration received less issue costs in accordance with FRS 4 Capital Instruments.
The difference between the net proceeds of the issue and the total amounts of payments that the issuer may be required to make is recorded as a finance cost of the instrument and written off over the life of the instrument.
Waste Recycling Group plc - Annual Report 2002 29 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Financial instruments Derivative instruments utilised by the Group are interest rate swaps, caps and collars.
The Group does not enter into speculative derivative contracts.
All such instruments are used for hedging purposes to alter the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure of the Group in line with the Groups risk management policies.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of these instruments are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the contracts.
Investments Investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Pension costs Contributions in respect of the Groups defined contribution pension scheme are charged to the profit and loss account for the year in which they are payable to the scheme.
Certain employees of the Group are members of the LAWDCs pension scheme in which the Group is a participating employer.
This scheme provides benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees estimated working lives with the Group.
The Group also contributes to personal pension schemes of employees who are not members of the LAWDCs pension scheme or the Groups defined contribution pension schemes.
These contributions are charged to the profit and loss account for the year in which they are payable.
Restoration and after-care costs Full provision is made for the net present value NPV of the Groups minimum unavoidable costs, in respect of restoration liabilities at the Groups landfill sites, which have been capitalised in tangible fixed assets.
The Group continues to provide for all after-care costs over the life of its landfill sites, based on the volumes of waste deposited in the year, since liabilities in relation to these costs arise as waste is deposited.
All long-term provisions for restoration and after-care costs are calculated based on the NPV of estimated future costs.
Current cost estimates are inflated at 3 percent.
The effect of the unwinding of the discount element on existing provisions is reflected as a financial item.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments In respect of each finance lease the cost of the asset is capitalised and the cost, less residual value of the asset, is depreciated over the term of the lease.
Rentals payable are apportioned between finance charges and leasing commitments.
The total finance charge is allocated to accounting periods over the term of the lease at a constant periodic rate of charge on the remaining leasing commitments for each accounting period.
All other leases are operating leases and the relevant annual rentals are charged to profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
TURNOVER AND PROFITS All turnover and profits were generated in the United Kingdom principally from receiving, processing, recycling and disposing of waste materials, the generation of electricity from landfill gas and quarrying which the Directors consider to be a single business segment.
All net assets are applied in this business segment and are based in the United Kingdom.

PENSION SCHEMES The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes on behalf of two Executive Directors and all eligible employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
Following the acquisition of Integrated Waste Management IWM in 2001, the Company has taken responsibility for IWMs section of the Scheme.
The Group contributes to this scheme, which provides benefits based on final pensionable pay, contributions being charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
The contributions are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
The most recent actuarial report on the LAWDCs Pension Scheme was prepared as at 31 March 2000.
This set out recommended contribution rates based on certain assumptions, the most significant of which related to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in earnings and pensions.
It was assumed that the differential of investment returns over earnings increases would be 1.75% per annum and that present and future pensions would increase at the rate of 3% per annum.
The actuarial value of the schemes assets at 31 March 2000 was 55,291,000 10,512,000 being attributable to the Group.
The Groups section had an average funding level of 106% on the minimum funding requirement basis.
Contributions over the year ending 31 December 2002 were paid by members at 3.75%, 5% or 6% of Pensionable Pay per annum depending on benefit category.
The Company contributed at 14.75% of Pensionable Pay for the period up to 31 March 2002 and 16% thereafter.
There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions at either the beginning or end of the year.
The contributions under these schemes amounted to: 2002 2001 000 000 Defined contribution schemes 286 260 Defined benefit schemes 784 728 1,070 988 As required by SSAP 24, the figures included in the accounts in respect of the company pension scheme are based on an actuarial valuation carried out at 31 March 2000.
This does not take into account any impact of the fall in general stock market values since that date.
Any such impact will be reflected in the next SSAP 24 triennial valuation as at 31 March 2003 based upon which subsequent pension costs will be determined until the adoption of FRS 17.
In accordance with the requirements of FRS 17, a qualified independent actuary has derived the valuation of liabilities detailed below by projecting forward the position from 31 March 2000 to 31 December 2002.
In calculating the liabilities, the following financial assumptions have been used: 2002 2001 % per annum % per annum Discount rate 5.5 6.0 Pensionable Pay growth 3.3 3.5 Price inflation 2.3 2.5 Increases to pensions in payment 2.3 2.5 Deferred pensions are revalued to retirement age in line with the RPI assumption of 2.3% per annum unless otherwise prescribed by statutory requirements or the Scheme rules.
