7 PENSION SCHEME The company maintains a defined contribution scheme, which is open to all new employees, a Greene King defined benefit scheme which closed to new entrants on 2 May 1997 and a Morland defined benefit scheme for former Morland employees which was closed to new entrants on 12 December 2000.
Member funds for the defined contribution scheme are held and administered by the Prudential Assurance Company.
Member funds for the defined benefit schemes are held in separate funds independently of the group's finances and are administered by pension trustees.
An actuarial valuation of the Greene King defined benefit scheme was carried out by Watson Wyatt as at 5 April 2000.
The principal assumptions were that retail price inflation would be 3 per cent per annum, pension increases would be in line with price inflation, real salary growth would be 1.75 per cent per annum and the real investment return would be 3 per cent per annum.
At that date the market value of the scheme's assets was 83.6 million.
Assets represented 89 per cent of the value of benefits that had accrued to members to that date, and the shortfall in value is being funded by increased contributions from the company.
An actuarial valuation of the Morland defined benefit scheme was carried out as at 1 October 2000 using similar assumptions.
The market value of the assets of the scheme was 17.3 million which represented 122 per cent of the accrued member benefits.
For FRS 17 purposes, the most recent valuations have been updated to 4 May 2002, using the principal assumptions that price inflation would be 2.50 per cent per annum, pension increases would be in line with price inflation, real salary growth would be 1.75 per cent per annum and the discount rate would be 5.75 per cent per annum.
