118 Additional information for US investors Unilever Group Unilevers consolidated accounts are prepared in accordance with accounting principles which differ in some respects from those applicable in the United States.
The following is a summary of the effect on the Groups net profit, combined earnings per share and capital and reserves of the application of United States generally accepted accounting principles US GAAP.

The aggregate amounts included in the consolidated Unilever Group capital and reserves under Unilever accounting principles in respect of cumulative currency translation adjustments are as follows: million million million 2002 2001 2000 Balance 1 January 4 745 3 669 3 411 Arising during the year 1 517 1 076 258 Balance 31 December 6 262 4 745 3 669 The aggregate amounts of foreign currency transaction gains and losses charged in the consolidated profit and loss account are: 84 30 8 The consolidated accounts of the Unilever Group have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles which differ in certain respects from those generally accepted in the United States US GAAP.
The principal differences are set out below.
profit or loss on disposal of businesses Unilever calculates profit or loss on sale of businesses after writing back any goodwill previously written off directly to reserves as a movement in profit retained.
Under US GAAP the profit or loss on disposal of the businesses is stated net of the relevant unamortised goodwill included on the balance sheet and the cumulative currency retranslation differences recognised through the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Under UK GAAP, gains on the partial disposal of group companies involving non-monetary consideration are recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Under US GAAP, these gains are recorded in the profit and loss account.
Goodwill and other intangibles Under UK and Netherlands GAAP, goodwill being the difference between the fair value of consideration paid for new interests in group companies, joint ventures and associated companies and the fair value of the Groups share of their net assets at the date of acquisition and identiable intangible assets purchased after 1 January 1998 are capitalised and amortised in operating profit over the period of their expected useful life, up to a maximum of 20 years.
Periods in excess of five years are used only where the directors are satisfied that the life of these assets will clearly exceed that period.
Goodwill and intangible assets purchased prior to 1 January 1998 were written off in the year of acquisition as a movement in profits retained.
On disposal of a business acquired prior to 1 January 1998, purchased goodwill written off on acquisition is reinstated in arriving at the profit or loss on disposal.
Under US GAAP prior to 1 January 2002, purchased goodwill and identiable intangibles were capitalised and amortised over their useful lives.
From 1 January 2002, under SFAS 142, the amortisation of goodwill and identiable intangibles that have indefinite useful lives ceased.
Intangible assets that have nite useful lives continue to be amortised over their useful lives.
Unilever Annual Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 120 Additional information for US investors Unilever Group Goodwill and identiable intangible assets that have indefinite lives are assessed annually for impairment.
Within six months of the initial application of SFAS 142, management completed an impairment assessment and have concluded that there is no impairment of goodwill or identiable intangible assets with indefinite lives.
An analysis of goodwill by reporting segment is given below: Spreads Health & Home care and Savoury and and cooking wellness and Ice cream and professional Other million dressings products beverages frozen foods cleaning Personal care operations Total As at 1 January 2002 16 620 212 1 685 1 135 733 633 21 018 Currency retranslation 2 540 32 255 171 112 97 3 207 Acquisitions disposals 126 100 36 17 168 26 31 As at 31 December 2002 14 206 280 1 394 947 453 562 17 842 Had the Group accounted for its goodwill and identiable intangible assets that have indefinite lives under SFAS 142 for the years ending 31 December 2001 and 2000, the impact on reported results would have been as follows: million million 2001 2000 Net income under US GAAP 1 506 1 266 Amortisation, net of tax: Goodwill 1 266 624 Intangibles 404 141 Adjusted net income under US GAAP 3 176 2 031 Adjusted net income per share 3.18 2.01 Adjusted diluted net income per share 3.09 1.96 indefinite lived intangible assets principally comprise trademarks and have a net book value of 6 726 million as at 31 December 2002.
Finite lived intangible assets principally comprise technologies and have a net book value of 567 million, net of accumulated amortisation of 72 million, as at 31 December 2002.
Amortisation expense recorded in the year in respect of nite lived intangible assets was 36 million.
This expense is not expected to change materially over the next five years.
Restructuring costs Under Unilevers accounting policy certain restructuring costs relating to employee terminations are recognised when a restructuring plan has been announced.
Under US GAAP, additional criteria must be met before such charges are recognised.
Interest Unilever treats all interest costs as a charge to the profit and loss account in the current period.
Under US GAAP interest incurred during the construction periods of tangible xed assets is capitalised and depreciated over the life of the assets.
Derivative financial instruments Transition adjustment Unilever applied the provisions of SFAS 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in this divergence statement as from 1 January 2001.
In accordance with the transition provisions of SFAS 133, an adjustment of 6 million net of tax of 3 million was recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to recognise the fair value of all the Groups derivative financial instruments and hedge items under US GAAP.
In addition, Unilever recorded a one-time unrealised loss of 85 million net of tax of 37 million to consolidated other comprehensive income under US GAAP.
During the year ended 31 December 2002, a reclassication of derivative losses from other comprehensive income to net income of 40 million was recorded as a result of the underlying hedged transactions which impacted earnings.
Hedging policy Unilevers accounting policies in respect of derivative financial instruments are described in the accounting information and policies on page 68.
Unilever has not designated any of its derivative instruments as qualifying hedge instruments under SFAS 133 and, accordingly, this divergence statement assumes that derivative financial instruments are valued at fair value and that changes in their value are reected in earnings.
Unilever Annual Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Financial Statements Additional information for US investors 121 Unilever Group Pensions Under Unilevers accounting policy the expected costs of providing retirement pensions are charged to the profit and loss account over the periods benefiting from the employees services.
Variations from expected cost are similarly spread.
Under US GAAP, pension costs and liabilities are calculated in accordance with SFAS 87, which requires the use of a prescribed actuarial method and a prescribed set of measurement principles.
Under US GAAP an additional minimum liability is recognised and a charge made to other comprehensive income when the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets to the extent that this amount is not covered by the net liability recognised in the balance sheet.
With effect from 1 January 2002, and for the purposes of determining the expected return on plan assets, Unilever changed the method of valuing its pension plan assets from a market related value calculated by smoothing gains and losses over a five year period to an actual fair value at the balance sheet date.
Management believe that the actual fair value methodology provides a better representation of the financial position and results of Unilevers pension plans.
The impact of this change in methodology on reported results under US GAAP is given in the table below: million million 2001 2000 Net income under US GAAP 1 506 1 266 Change in basis of expected return on plan assets calculation 86 210 Adjusted net income under US GAAP 1 592 1 476 Euro per 0.51 Euro cents per 1.4p 2001 2000 2001 2000 Adjusted net income per share 1.57 1.45 23.52 21.71 Adjusted diluted net income per share 1.52 1.41 22.89 21.18 As required under US APB 20 for a change in accounting policy, a cumulative effect adjustment has been calculated to record the impact of the change as if the fair value methodology had been the accounting policy from the initial adoption of SFAS 87 by Unilever.
The cumulative effect adjustment net of tax is 522 million in 2002.
Investments Unilever accounts for current investments, which are liquid funds temporarily invested, at their market value, which is consistent with UK GAAP.
Unilever accounts for changes in the market value of current investments as interest receivable in the profit and loss account for the year.
Under US GAAP, such current asset investments are classied as available for sale securities and changes in market values, which represent unrealised gains or losses, are excluded from earnings and taken to stockholders equity.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the market values of securities available for sale are not material.
Unilever accounts for xed investments other than in joint ventures and associates at cost less any amounts written off to reect a permanent impairment.
Under US GAAP such investments are held at fair value.
The difference is not material.
Dividends The proposed final ordinary dividends are provided for in the Unilever accounts in the financial year to which they relate.
Under US GAAP such dividends are not provided for until they become irrevocable.
Deferred taxation Unilever has restated its deferred tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2000, and its deferred tax balances as at 31 December 2001 to comply with the new UK accounting standard FRS 19, as described in note 18 on page 94.
Under FRS 19, deferred tax is not recognised on fair value adjustments made to assets acquired: under US GAAP, deferred tax is recorded on all fair value adjustments.
Also, as described on page 94, FRS 19 has changed the treatment of deferred tax on tax-deductible goodwill previously written off to reserves.
Such goodwill is reinstated, net of amortisation, under US GAAP, and the tax effect of such restatement has been adjusted accordingly.
Unilever Annual Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 122 Additional information for US investors Unilever Group Classication differences between UK and US GAAP Revenue recognition Under US GAAP, certain sales incentive expenses which have been included in operating costs under Unilevers accounting would be deducted from turnover.
The decrease in turnover for the years to 31 December 2002, 2001 and 2000 is 1 337 million, 1 279 million and 1 237 million respectively.
There is no impact on Unilevers net profit.
Cash ow statement Under US GAAP, various items would be reclassied within the consolidated cash ow statement.
In particular, interest received, interest paid and taxation would be part of net cash ow from operating activities, and dividends paid would be included within net cash ow from nancing.
In addition, under US GAAP, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and current investments with an original maturity at the date of investment of less than three months.
Under Unilevers presentation, cash includes only cash in hand or available on demand less bank overdrafts.
Movements in those current investments which are included under the heading of cash and cash equivalents under US GAAP form part of the movement entitled Management of liquid resources in the cash ow statements.
At 31 December 2002, the balance of such investments was 45 million 2001: 9 million: 2000: 58 million.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements In August 2001, FASB issued SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.
This statement is effective from January 2003 and requires obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset to be recorded as a liability upon acquisition of the asset.
SFAS 143 would not have a material impact on Unilevers financial position or results of operations.
In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
This standard will require Unilever to recognise certain costs associated with disposal activities when they are incurred, rather than at the date of a commitment to a disposal plan.
SFAS 146 is effective for disposal activities initiated after 31 December 2002.
Given the nature of disposal plans, it is not possible to determine in advance the impact it might have on Unilevers financial position at a particular date or Unilevers results of operations for a particular period in the future.
For 2002, the impact is shown against restructuring costs in the US GAAP reconciliation statements on pages 118 and 119.
In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an Amendment of SFAS No.
This standard provides two additional transition methods for companies electing to adopt the fair value accounting provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, but does not change the fair value measurement principles of SFAS 123.
When Unilever adopts the fair value method for accounting for stock options, we expect to use full retrospective restatement.
The impact of this is shown in the table on page 104.
In November 2002, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No.
45 FIN 45, Guarantors and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Direct Guarantees.
Under this interpretation, a guarantor must recognise the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing a guarantee.
The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modied after 31 December 2002.
FIN 45 is not expected to have a material impact on Unilevers financial position or results of operations.
In January 2003, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No.
46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.
Under this interpretation, certain entities known as variable interest entities must be consolidated by the primary beneciary of the entity.
The measurement principles of this interpretation will be effective for Unilevers 2003 financial statements.
FIN 46 is not expected to have any impact on Unilevers financial position or results of operations.
