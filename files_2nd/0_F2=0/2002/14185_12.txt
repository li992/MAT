Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc 25 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31 December 2002 1 Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP.
The particular accounting policies adopted by the directors, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year, are described below.
a Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year.
c Acquisitions and disposals On the acquisition of a business, including an interest in an associated undertaking, fair values are attributed to the Groups share of net separable assets.
Where the cost of the acquisition exceeds the fair values attributable to such net assets, the diference is treated as purchased goodwill and capitalised in the balance sheet in the year of acquisition.
Prior to the implementation of FRS 10 in the year ended 31 December 1998, purchased goodwill was written off directly to reserves and has not been reinstated.
The profit or loss on the disposal of a previously acquired business includes the attributable amount of any purchased goodwill relating to that business not previously charged through the profit and loss account.
The results and cash flows relating to a business are included in the consolidated profit and loss account and the consolidated cash flow statement from the date of acquisition up to the date of disposal.
d Intangible assets goodwill For the acquisition of a business, including an interest in an associated undertaking, purchased goodwill is capitalised in the year in which it arises and amortised over its estimated useful economic life up to a maximum of 20 years.
The directors regard 20 years as a reasonable maximum for the estimated useful economic life of goodwill since it is difficult to make projections exceeding this period.
Provision is made for any impairment.
The asset is deemed to be impaired to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
The impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Capitalised purchased goodwill in respect of subsidiaries is included within intangible assets.
Capitalised purchased goodwill relating to associates is included within the carrying value of the associate.
Goodwill which arose on the acquisition of a business, prior to the implementation of FRS 10 which was written off to the profit and loss reserve as a matter of accounting policy, remains eliminated in that reserve and will be charged or credited in the profit and loss account as appropriate on the subsequent disposal of the business to which it relates.
e Intangible assets intellectual property Intellectual property, including trademarks, for products with an immediate defined revenue stream and acquired for valuable consideration, are capitalised and amortised in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful life of the product generally not exceeding 20 years.
Intellectual property with no defined revenue stream is written off on acquisition.
f Tangible assets Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
All other tangible fixed assets are shown at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset over its estimated useful life at the following annual rates: Freehold buildings 2-5% per annum Office furniture and fittings 10-25% per annum Equipment and other 10-25% per annum g Investments Except as stated below, investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.
In the consolidated accounts, shares in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the Groups share of pre-tax profits and attributable taxation of the joint ventures based on audited financial statements for the financial year.
In the consolidated balance sheet, the investment in joint ventures is shown at the Groups share of the net assets of the joint ventures.
In the Company balance sheet, for investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, advantage has not been taken of this relief and the share premium of the shares issued has been included in the cost.
Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
h Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition is based on purchase costs calculated on a first-in, first-out basis, including transport.
Net realisable value is based on estimated normal selling price less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
26 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31 December 2002 1 Accounting policies continued i Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
j Turnover The Group recognises turnover when: there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement: delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered: the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable: and collectibility is reasonably assured.
Revenues are stated net of VAT and similar taxes, trade discounts and intra-Group transactions.
The principal components of the Groups turnover and their respective accounting treatments are set out below.
Product sales are recognised net upon shipment to customers.
Provisions for certain rebates, product returns and discounts to customers are provided for as reductions to net turnover in the same period as the related sales are recorded.
Licensing and development fees represent revenues derived from licence agreements and from collaborative research and development arrangements.
Initial licence fees are not considered to be separable from the associated research and development activities, even where such fees are nonrefundable and not creditable against research and development services to be rendered.
Initial licence fees are deferred and recognised over the period of the licence term or the period of the associated research and development agreement.
In circumstances where initial licence fees are not for a defined period, revenues are deferred and recognised over the period to the expiration of the relevant patent to which the licence relates.
During the term of certain research and development agreements, the Group receives non-refundable milestones as certain technical targets are achieved.
Revenue is recognised on achievement of milestones.
The Group also receives non-refundable clinical milestones when certain targets are achieved during the clinical phases of development, such as the submission of clinical data to a regulatory authority.
These clinical milestones are recognised when receivable.
If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.
Royalty income relating to licensed technology is recognised when earned.
No revenue is recognised for consideration, the value or receipt of which is dependent on future events, future performance, or refund obligations.
k Research and development Research and development expenditure includes funded and unfunded expenditure and is written off in the period in which it is incurred.
l Pensions The Group contributes to personal defined contribution pension plans of employees.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account as they become payable.
Differences between contributions payable and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
m Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates ruling at that date.
With the exception of US dollar balances, which are taken directly to reserves, these translation differences are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the opening net assets and on foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they hedge the Groups investments in such operations, are taken directly to reserves.
All other exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account.
n Leases Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised at their fair value on the inception of the leases and depreciated over the shorter of the period of lease and the useful economic lives of the assets.
The finance charges are allocated over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding and are charged to the profit and loss account.
Operating lease rentals are charged to profit and loss in equal amounts over the lease term.
Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc 27 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31 December 2002 1 Accounting policies continued o Finance costs Finance costs of debt are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
p Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in the period.
Convertible debt is treated as a liability as long as there is no genuine commercial possibility that the option to issue ordinary shares or American Depository Shares will be exercised.
No gain or loss is recognised on conversion.
q Government grants Government grants in respect of funded research and development expenditure are credited to the profit and loss account as the related expenditure is incurred.
r Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
For a forward foreign exchange contract to be treated as a hedge the instrument must be related to actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or to a probable commitment.
It must involve the same currency or similar currencies as the hedged item and must also reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Groups operations.
Gains and losses arising on these contracts are deferred and recognised in the profit and loss account, or as adjustments to the carrying amount of fixed assets, only when the hedged transaction has itself been reflected in the Groups accounts.
For an interest rate swap to be treated as a hedge the instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities or a probable commitment and must change the nature of the interest rate by converting a fixed rate to a variable rate or vice versa.
Interest differentials under these swaps are recognised by adjusting net interest payable over the periods of the contracts.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, for example because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss recognised at that time.
s Employee share schemes In accordance with UITF Abstract 17 Employee share schemes, the cost of awards to employees that take the form of shares or rights to shares is recognised as a charge in the profit and loss account.
The amount recognised, which is the difference between the market value at date of grant and the underlying share and any exercise price, is charged to the profit and loss account over the period the shares are vested, with a corresponding credit to reserves.
t Related party transactions In accordance with the exemptions in FRS 8 Related party disclosures, transactions between Group companies have not been disclosed since Group accounts are prepared and include the results of all subsidiary undertakings.
u Significant accounting estimates Sales deductions primarily consist of statutory rebates to state Medicaid agencies, contractual rebates with health-maintenance organisations, product returns, and trade discounts.
Provisions for rebates are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales with estimates of future utilisation derived from historical trends.
Provisions for product returns and trade discounts to customers are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales with estimates based upon past activity levels and duration of time in the processing of deductions.

As provided by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no profit and loss account is presented in respect of the Company.
32 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31 December 2002 9 Loss earnings per share Loss earnings per share EPS has been calculated by dividing the loss profit on ordinary activities after taxation for each period by the weighted average number of shares in issue during those periods.
The weighted average number of shares used in calculating diluted earnings per share has been adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
No such amounts were included in the weighted average number of shares in 2002 as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive in a loss making period.
The $400 million convertible loan note is excluded from the calculation of weighted average number of shares for diluted earnings per share in 2002 and 2001 as it was not dilutive.
The zero coupon convertible loan note included in 2001 has no impact on the numerator for diluted earnings per share.
Basic and diluted 2002 2001 000 000 Loss profit for the financial year 588,399 35,709 The weighted average number of shares used in each year are as follows: 2002 2001 Number Number Total for basic EPS 500,687,594 412,183,058 Conversion of convertible debt 289,101 Exercise of share options 6,270,923 Exercise of warrants 919,029 Total for diluted EPS 500,687,594 419,662,111 10 Intangible assets intellectual property Group Company 000 000 Cost As at 1 January 2002 321,756 10,068 Additions 15,470 13,600 Transfer to goodwill note 11 2,755 Disposals 49,115 Foreign exchange 24,408 As at 31 December 2002 260,948 23,668 Amortisation As at 1 January 2002 61,906 933 Charge for the year 15,466 1,345 Impairment 17,464 Disposals 11,442 Foreign exchange 5,850 As at 31 December 2002 77,544 2,278 Net book value As at 31 December 2001 259,850 9,135 As at 31 December 2002 183,404 21,390 During the second quarter of 2002, and included within additions for the year, the Group purchased SOLARAZE for 13.6 million.

Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc 41 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31 December 2002 21 Creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year continued Subject to the conditions below, borrowings are repayable as follows: Group Company 2002 2001 2002 2001 Notes 000 000 000 000 Convertible loan notes: i Between one and two years 243,547 Between two and five years 268,178 Bank loans: ii Between one and two years 389 1,705 Between two and five years 389 Obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts: Between one and two years 158 36 After five years 3,599 248,082 269,883 36 i $400 million 2% guaranteed convertible loan notes 2011 The $400 million of guaranteed convertible loan notes due 2011, were issued on 15 August 2001 by Shire Finance Limited the Issuer, a wholly owned subsidiary.
The notes bear interest of 2% per annum, paid semi-annually in arrears.
The convertible notes are guaranteed by Shire and are convertible into redeemable preference shares of the Issuer which upon issuance will be immediately exchanged for either i Shire common shares or ii Shire ADSs, or iii at the Issuers option, a cash amount based upon the London Stock Exchange volume-weighted average prices of common shares on the fourth through eighth business days following conversion.
At the choice of investors, each $1,000 of nominal value notes can be converted into 49.62 Shire common shares subject to adjustment or 16.54 Shire ADSs subject to adjustment at any time up to 21 August 2011.
Alternatively, investors can choose to receive repayment of the nominal principal in cash either at the maturity date of 21 August 2011 or by exercising a put option on any of the three put dates being 21 August 2004, 21 August 2006 and 21 August 2008.
At the option of the Company, repayment can be made in the form of Shire common shares or ADSs.
The number of common shares that a note holder would receive would be based on the notional principal of the notes divided by 95% of the London Stock Exchange volume-weighted average price of common shares on the five trading days after the Company gives notice of the exercise of its option.
Such notice will be on or before the tenth business day preceding the repayment put date.
On or after 21 August 2004, the Company may redeem, for cash, all or part of the notes provided the ordinary share price has exceeded $26.20 sterling equivalent at the time for 20 of the 30 consecutive dealing days in the period prior to redemption.
The decision as to whether a note holder would exercise a put option will depend on a number of factors particularly the price of Shire shares at the put date and the likelihood of Shires share price exceeding the conversion threshold price.
The conversion threshold price is 12.52 for ordinary shares.
If the price of Shire ordinary shares at the first put date of 21 August 2004 remains at a level similar to the year end price of 3.97, it is quite possible that note holders will choose to exercise their put options.
The Group currently has adequate resources from which it could satisfy repayment of the entire convertible debt principal of $400 million.
ii Canadian federal and provincial government loan The Group has a Canadian federal and provincial government loan outstanding of 1.2 million CAN$5.0 million.
This facility is non-interest bearing and is repayable in annual instalments of 0.5 million CAN$1.2 million commencing in May 2002.

26 Guarantees, commitments and contingencies a Operating leases The Group leases property, computer and office equipment and motor vehicles on short-term leases.
The rents payable under property leases are subject to renegotiation at various intervals specified in the leases.
The Group pays for substantially all of the insurance, maintenance and repair of these assets.
The minimum annual rentals under the foregoing leases are as follows: 2002 2001 Land and Motor Land and Motor buildings Equipment vehicles buildings Equipment vehicles Group 000 000 000 000 000 000 Operating leases which expire: within 1 year 179 333 50 768 4 120 within 2 5 years 1,263 1,827 902 522 725 2,277 after 5 years 245 1 1,687 2,161 952 1,290 729 2,397 2002 2001 Land and Motor Land and Motor buildings Equipment vehicles buildings Equipment vehicles Company 000 000 000 000 000 000 Operating leases which expire: within 1 year 22 145 within 2 5 years 145 89 114 after 5 years 145 111 145 114 50 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31 December 2002 26 Guarantees, commitments and contingencies continued b Capital commitments i Interests in companies and partnerships The Company has undertaken to subscribe for interests in companies and partnerships for amounts totalling 23,905,000.
As at 31 December 2002 an amount of 17,028,000 has been subscribed.
Shire is, therefore, committed to investing a further 6,877,000.
Further information regarding these interests can be found in note 13 a. ii Fluviral The Company has a ten-year contract with the Canadian government to assure a state of readiness in the case of an influenza pandemic worldwide epidemic and to manufacture influenza vaccine for all Canadian citizens in such an event.
Under the contract, Shire Biologics will also supply the Government of Canada with a substantial proportion of its annual influenza vaccine requirements over the ten-year period.
Subject to mutual agreement, the contract can be renewed for a further period of between one and ten years from 2011.
The concept of a state of readiness against an influenza pandemic requires the development of sufficient infrastructure and capacity in Canada to provide 100% of domestic vaccine needs in the event of an influenza pandemic.
Canada would require 32 million doses of single strain monovalent flu vaccine within a production period of 16 weeks.
Shire Biologics has therefore begun to expand its current production capacity in order to meet this objective within a five-year period.
A performance bond equal to 10% of the minimum estimated contract value in any year would become payable to the Canadian government if contracted penalty clauses were triggered.
Shire Biologics is committed to investing 11.5 million in the construction of a new global vaccine research centre in Laval, Canada.
The completion of this project is planned for mid 2004.
Under the Technology Partnerships Canada TPC agreement, Shire could be eligible for a government investment of approximately 2.2 million.
c Contingent liabilities Shire is involved in various legal proceedings considered typical to its business, including those set out below.
Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the legal proceedings referred to below, Shire believes that they will not have a materially adverse effect on the Groups financial position.
i Phentermine Shire US, Inc. Shire US is a defendant in 11 lawsuits still pending, in both US federal and state courts, which seek damages for, among other things, personal injury arising from phentermine products supplied for the treatment of obesity by Shire US and several other pharmaceutical companies.
Shire US, formerly known as Shire Richwood Inc. has been sued as a manufacturer and distributor of phentermine, an anorectic used in the short-term treatment of obesity and one of the products addressed by the lawsuits.
The suits relate to phentermine either alone or together with fenfluramine or dexenfluramine.
The lawsuits generally allege the following claims: the defendants marketed phentermine and other products for the treatment of obesity and misled users about the products and territory dangers associated with them: the defendants failed adequately to test phentermine individually and when taken in combination with the other drugs: and the defendants knew or should have known about the negative effects of the drugs and should have informed the public about such risks and or failed to provide appropriate warning labels.
Shire US had been named as a defendant in a total of 3,804 such phentermine lawsuits, in respect of which Shire US has been dismissed as a defendant in 3,756 cases.
Shire US is awaiting the furtherance of proceedings in the remaining 37 lawsuits.
Shire US became involved with phentermine through its acquisition of certain assets of Rexar Pharmacol Corporation Rexar in January 1994.
In addition to Shire US potentially incurring liability as a result of its own production of Oby-Cap, a phentermine product, the plaintiffs may additionally seek to impose liability on Shire US as successor to Rexar.
Shire US intends vigorously to defend all the lawsuits and pursue all available reasonable defences.
Shire US denies liability on a number of grounds including lack of scientific evidence that phentermine, properly described, causes the alleged side effects and that Shire US did not promote phentermine for long-term combined use as part of the fen phen diet.
Accordingly, Shire US intends to defend vigorously any and all claims made against the Group in respect of phentermine.
Legal expenses have been paid by Eon Labs Manufacturing Inc. Eon, the supplier to Shire US, or Eons insurance carriers but such insurance is now exhausted.
Eon has agreed to defend and indemnify Shire US in this litigation pursuant to an agreement dated 30 November 2000 made between Eon and Shire US.
At the present stage of litigation, Shire is unable to estimate the level of future legal costs after taking into account any available product liability insurance and enforceable indemnities.
To the extent that any legal costs are not covered by insurance or available indemnities, these will be expensed as incurred.
It is not possible at this time to determine the legal outcome or financial implications of any of these claims.
ii ADDERALL Shires extended release once daily version of ADDERALL, ADDERALL XR, is covered by US patent no.
In January 2003 Shire received a Paragraph IV notice from Barr alleging that this patent is invalid and not infringed by Barrs extended release mixed amphetamine salt product which is the subject of a Barr pending Abbreviated New Drug Application ANDA application.
On 24 February 2003 Shire Laboratories Inc. filed suit against Barr in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York for infringement of the 819 Patent with respect to this ANDA.
The Hatch-Waxman Act provides for an automatic stay of up to 30 months of FDA approval for Barrs ANDA to market its generic version of ADDERALL XR to allow the Court to resolve the patent infringement lawsuit.
However, there can be no assurance that the Group will be successful in the suit.
In the event that the Group does not prevail, then Barr could be in a position to market its extended release mixed amphetamine salt product upon FDA final approval of its ANDA application.
This may have a material adverse impact on the Groups results and financial position.
In the event that the Group does not prevail in the suit, a generic version of ADDERALL XR could not be launched before October 2004, the current expiry of the existing Hatch-Waxman exclusivity.
Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc 51 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31 December 2002 26 Guarantees, commitments and contingencies continued In November 2002 Shire received approval from the FDA for a new formulation of ADDERALL which is patent protected.
In January 2003 Shire received a Paragraph IV notice from Barr alleging that this patent is invalid and not infringed by Barrs 7.5mg, 12.5mg and 15mg mixed amphetamine salt products.
The Company has taken no action with respect to this notice and Barr announced in March 2003 that it has now received FDA approval and 180 days exclusivity for these strengths.
The Company received a second Paragraph IV notice in March 2003 from another generic alleging that this patent is invalid and is not infringed by its products, which are the subject of a pending ANDA.
The Company has taken no action and this company will be able to market its product upon FDA approval of its ANDA application, subject to Barrs exclusivity period for the above doses.
The sales of any generic versions of ADDERALL may have a material adverse impact on the Companys results and financial position.
Shire filed a Complaint against Barr on 30 April 2002 in the District Court of New Jersey.
In the Complaint, Shire requested a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent Barr from marketing a mixed amphetamine salt product in a trade dress similar to that of ADDERALL.
Shire requested that Barr recall all such products and also asked for damages.
An order denying the preliminary injunction was issued on 26 August 2002.
Shire filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on 16 September 2002 appealing the denial of Shires motion for a preliminary injunction.
iii Emory Shire BioChem was involved in worldwide patent disputes with Emory University Emory relating to lamivudine wherein Shire BioChem opposed certain patents and patent applications of Emory and wherein Emory opposed certain patents and patent applications of Shire BioChem.
Pursuant to a global Settlement Agreement, finalised in May 2002, Emory has granted Shire and GSK an exclusive licence under Emorys patent rights for lamivudine.
The Settlement Agreement provides for the resolution of all worldwide patent disputes between the parties relating to lamivudine and FTC, including pending opposition and revocation proceedings in Europe, South Korea and Australia.
The settlement involves a small royalty payment on worldwide sales of lamivudine and a licence under Shires FTC patent rights, in consideration for the settlement of all claims against Shire and GSK relating to lamivudine.
Shire BioChem was also involved in worldwide patent disputes with Emory and the University of Georgia Research Foundation Georgia relating to certain dioxolane nucleoside analogues.
Shire BioChem opposed certain patents and patent applications of Emory and Georgia and Emory opposed a European patent of Shire BioChem.
Pursuant to global Settlement and License Agreements finalised in August 2002 by Shire BioChem, Shire Pharmaceuticals Group, Georgia and Triangle Pharmaceuticals Inc. Triangle, Shire will grant an exclusive royalty bearing licence to Emory, sub licensable to Triangle, for certain dioxolane nucleoside analogues, including diamino purine dioxolane DAPD.
Emory, Georgia and Triangle will grant an exclusive royalty bearing licence to Shire for certain dioxolane nucleosides, including SPD756.
The compounds the subject of these licenses are in development.
A royalty will be payable by Shire upon commercialisation of SPD756.
The Settlement and License Agreements provide for the resolution of all worldwide patent disputes relating to the licensed patents.
iv In addition, the Company is involved in other claims and lawsuits in the normal course of business.
27 Pension arrangements The Group has a number of defined contribution retirement plans that together cover substantially all employees.
The Company contribution is fixed as a set percentage of employees pay.
The pension cost charge for the defined contribution schemes for the year was 4,702,000 2001: 3,123,000.
The closing creditor in respect of pension premiums at 31 December 2002 is 306,000 31 December 2001: 521,000.
The defined benefit plan operated by the Group was a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP for certain US employees of the acquired company, Roberts, who met certain age and service requirements.
The plan was discontinued in 2000 and there were no contributions payable in respect of the years 2002 and 2001.
The Group paid a lump sum of 11.3 million $18 million into the SERP, which was accounted for as a fair value adjustment on the acquisition of Roberts to make good the deficit on this scheme at the time of acquisition.
This lump sum payment has led to the Group having no future liability under the SERP, which has been closed to new members with contributions no longer payable by existing members.
The asset and liability of 7.5 million and 5.2 million respectively are shown in notes 18 and 21 respectively.

Equally challenging is the increased level of competition, including that which comes from new products that are not based on innovative research and development.
A constant element in this changing and challenging environment is Shires determination to succeed.
This has been evident from the very early days of Shire, when it set its sights on becoming one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the specialist marketplace.
By focusing on and leveraging areas of key strength, Shire is well positioned to build on its success in the face of ever-present challenges, bringing important new medicines to patients in key markets worldwide and continuing to grow its business.
Shire has built franchises in the therapeutic areas of central nervous system disorders, gastrointestinal, oncology and anti-infectives.
These are areas where significant medical needs remain unmet, and where Shire has developed important expertise both in the market and in research and development.
The strength and effectiveness of Shires sales and marketing organisation is well recognised and has been an important component of the Companys growth.
Relationships with Shires target group of specialist physicians will continue to be strengthened as the Company launches additional new products over the coming months and years.
Targeting an R&D investment of 18-20% of revenues, Shire now has one of the largest R&D portfolios among pharmaceutical companies of a similar size.
Efforts to broaden this portfolio further are constantly underway through two avenues: internally via lead optimisation, biologics research and drug delivery: externally via in-licensing and targeted mergers & acquisitions.
Each of these elements allows Shire to overcome challenges in the changing pharmaceutical industry while capitalising on the many opportunities.
With a sales and marketing focus, supported by broad R&D capabilities and a promising project portfolio, Shire is very well positioned for its emergence as a strong global pharmaceutical company.

Pressure on the global pharmaceutical industry was increased by several aggressive launches of generic drugs.
In addition, an ever-increasing population of ageing patients and inadequate third-party reimbursement schedules continued to exert price pressure on healthcare providers.
Maximising returns in the face of these pressures will require pharmaceutical companies to deploy resources effectively to drive the discovery, development and marketing of novel drugs.
Shire is particularly well placed to deal with such challenges.
The Executive, Rolf drove Shires formidable success and growth.
He Company has always maintained a substantial research and development presided over the listing of the Companys shares in 1996, over six R&D programme to create a sizeable portfolio of new therapies.
significant mergers and acquisitions, the broadening of the Companys Building from its position as an international pharmaceutical company sales and marketing infrastructure, and the development of a number targeting specialist doctors, Shire is emerging as a global pharmaceutical of successful products through the Companys extensive R&D pipeline.
Today the Company not only in-licenses projects for internal Today Shire is the third largest pharmaceutical company in the UK and development, but also has the technological capabilities to discover and is the US market leader in the ADHD field.

In March 2003, Shire took a major step towards the next stage of its In 2002, following six major mergers and acquisitions during the growth by choosing Matthew Emmens as Chief Executive.
Matthew has past eight years, Shire acquired the US specialty pharmaceutical a strong track record of success over a pharmaceutical career spanning manufacturing facility of Atlantic Pharmaceutical Services Inc. APS, nearly 30 years.
He was a founder of the Astra Merck Inc. joint venture, and more recently, the rights to METHYPATCH methylphenidate and later its President and Chief Executive.

Shires strong investment in R&D will continue to The Board support the future growth of Shire, with a total of four further projects It is with much regret that we report the passing of Dr Bernard Canavan, scheduled to move into phase III development this year.
We have all the former President of Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc. a member of Shires witnessed the dramatic growth of Shire over the last few years and I believe Board of Directors and Chairman of our Audit Committee.
Dr Canavan we can look forward to even more opportunities in the years ahead.
His guidance and dedication to the Shire Board will be greatly missed.
In October 2002, we announced that Rolf Stahel, our Chief Executive, Dr James Cavanaugh Chairman would be stepping down in 2003.
During his nine years as Chief Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc 3 Chief Executives review During 2002, for the first time in Shires history, the Company faced generic competition to one of its key products, ADDERALL, an immediate-release ADHD drug.
For many successful pharmaceutical companies, it is accepted that such an event can have a significant negative impact on a companys financial performance.
I am pleased to say that Shires ADDERALL franchise remained the US ADHD market leader and our US sales and marketing team was able to grow our ADHD franchise by 22% despite this challenge.
The conversion of patients from immediate-release ADDERALL to to R&D risk management by weighting our portfolio of projects towards our new product, ADDERALL XR, has been a great success, with those projects viewed as low to medium risk.

The Hon James Grant 10.05.03 3 months The Remuneration Committees policy is and has been that executive Mr Nordmann 22.12.03 3 months directors service contracts should be for a rolling term, subject at any Mr Veilleux 10.05.03 3 months time to a 12-month notice period from the Company.
In the event of termination for cause no such notice period would apply.

In accordance with policy, the revised contracts Grant, who is a partner of a Canadian law firm with which the Group allow the Company, at its discretion, to pay up to a maximum of incurred professional fees during the year, are given in note 20 to the 12 months salary, 12 months maximum annual bonus, 12 months consolidated financial statements on page 73. pension contribution and up to 12 months of the actual cost to the employee of the other contractual benefits to which the director is entitled, in the event of termination, as payment in lieu of notice.
The Committee takes the view that this approach will enable contractual termination to be managed fairly and appropriately taking into account individual circumstances.
As part of its review and in light of growing business uncertainty in the pharmaceutical sector, the Remuneration Committee also decided that it would be in shareholders interests to provide in the directors service contracts that, in the event of a change of control of the Company and the termination, other than for cause, by the Company of an executive directors employment within 12 months thereof, the executive in such circumstances would be entitled to receive 24 months salary and 24 months bonus, inclusive of all other benefits.
Executive directors would not be entitled, in addition, to any other severance arrangements.
The Committee takes the view that this level of enhanced compensation is in the interests of shareholders on the grounds that it both reduces the potential for insecurity and enhances levels of commitment.

Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc 45 Dir Directors r ectors remuneration r emuneration report eport Notes i These options have been granted over shares in Shire Holdings Limited, a previous holding company of the Group.
The exercise of these options is not subject to any performance criteria and results in the option holder receiving ordinary shares in the Company.
ii Options granted under the Executive Scheme are subject to performance criteria and cannot be exercised in full, unless the Companys share price increases at a compound rate of at least 20.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period.
If the Companys share price increases at a compound rate of 14.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period, 60% of the options may be exercised.
If these conditions are not met after the initial three years, they are thereafter tested quarterly by reference to share price growth over the extended period.
If the share price does not meet these conditions at any time, none of the options will become exercisable.
iii Options granted under the Sharesave Scheme are granted with an exercise price equal to 80% of the mid-market price on the day before invitations are issued to employees.
Employees may enter into three or five-year savings contracts.
The exercise of options under this Scheme is not subject to any performance criteria.
iv These options have been granted over shares in Shire Laboratories Inc. SLI, formerly Pharmavene Inc. a US company acquired by the Group on 23 March 1997.
Exercise of these options results in the option holder receiving ordinary shares in the Company.
As a result of the acquisition of SLI, and in accordance with the terms of the original SLI Plan, all options granted under that plan became immediately capable of exercise and were not subject to performance criteria.
v These options have been granted over shares in Roberts Pharmaceutical Corporation, a US company acquired by the Group on 23 December 1999.
As a result of the acquisition of Roberts, and in accordance with the terms of the original Roberts Plan, all options granted under that plan became immediately capable of exercise and were not subject to any performance criteria.
vi Options granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme following the Companys 2000 Annual General Meeting are subject to performance criteria and cannot be exercised in full, unless the Companys share price increases at a compound rate of at least 20.5% per annum over a minimum three-year period.
If the Companys share price increases at a compound rate of at least 14.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period, 60% of the options will be exercisable.
If these conditions are not met after the initial three-year measurement period, they will thereafter be tested quarterly by reference to compound annual share price growth over an extended period.
If the share price does not meet these conditions at any time, none of these options will become exercisable.
At the Annual General Meeting of the Company, held on 5 June 2001, a resolution was passed to permit the grant of options under the 2000 Executive Scheme to be made subject to performance criteria being satisfied prior to the date of grant.
Subsequent to the passing of this resolution options have been granted based on performance criteria being satisfied before grant, namely that the Companys share price had increased by an annualised compound rate of 20.5% over a minimum three-year period.
During 2002, the performance criteria were again reviewed to ensure the criteria reflected the market in which the Company operates.
Given the Companys development it was felt appropriate that an EPS based measure should be adopted in place of share price growth targets.
Therefore option grants made after July 2002 will only become exercisable in full if the Companys EPS growth exceeds the RPI over a three-year period for the following tranches of grants: Options with a grant value of up to 100% of salary RPI plus 3% directors, RPI plus 5% Between 101% and 200% of salary RPI plus 5% Between 201% and 300% of salary RPI plus 7% Over 301% of salary RPI plus 9% The adoption of the new criteria applies to all options granted from August 2002 onwards.
vii Following the acquisition of BioChem Pharma, Inc. on 11 May 2001, the BioChem Plan was amended such that options over BioChems common stock became options over ordinary shares of the Company.
All BioChem options, which were not already exercisable, vested and became exercisable as a result of the acquisition and were not subject to any performance conditions.
It is intended that no further options will be granted under the BioChem Plan.
viii Under the Stock Purchase Plan options are granted with an exercise price equal to 85% of the fair market value of a share on the enrolment date the first day of the offering period or the exercise date the last day of the offering period, whichever is the lower.
The offering period is for 27 months.
The exercise of options under this plan is not subject to any performance condition.
The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 December 2002 was 3.975 and the range during the year was 8.835 to 3.755.
Performance conditions attaching to awards made under the Long Term Incentive Plan are detailed on page 39.

During 2002, certain requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act came into force in the US.
In line with these requirements, the Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director have formally certified that the Annual Report has been prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles and fairly represents the financial condition and results of the Company.
ii Internal control In applying the principle that the Board should maintain a sound system of internal control to safeguard shareholders investment and the Companys assets and in accordance with the Turnbull Committees guidance on internal control, the directors recognise that they have overall responsibility for the Companys system of internal control and for regularly reviewing its effectiveness.
The directors believe that the Company has applied this principle during the year under review and up to the date of signing these accounts.
However, there are limitations in any system of internal control and accordingly even the most effective system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance.
Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Company has an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks that it faces.
This process has been in operation throughout the period under review and up to the date of the signing of the accounts.
In particular, the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee and the Board have reviewed the schedule of risks faced by the Company.
This includes analysis of the impact of the operation of key risks and the action being taken to avoid or reduce each risk.
In particular, the schedule of risks allocates responsibility for management of each key risk to senior executives.

Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc 55 Notes to the consolidated financial statements In thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 1 Description of operations Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Shire, and subsidiaries collectively, the Company is an emerging global international pharmaceutical company with a strategic focus on four therapeutic areas: central nervous system disorders, gastro intestinal, oncology and anti-infectives.
The Companys strategy is further supported by three technology platforms: advanced drug delivery, lead optimisation for small molecules, and biologics.
Shire has sales and marketing subsidiaries with a portfolio of products targeting the US, Canada, the UK, the Republic of Ireland, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.
Shire also covers other significant pharmaceutical markets indirectly through distributors.
The business is operated and managed within three individual operating segments: US, International, and Global Research and Development.
Within these segments, revenues are derived primarily from three sources: sales of products by Shires own sales and marketing operations, royalties where Shire has out-licensed to third parties and licensing and development fees.
The Company has a particular interest in innovative therapies that are prescribed by specialist doctors as opposed to primary care physicians.
The Company follows two main approaches: firstly to start projects in-house through research and advanced drug delivery, and secondly to in-license projects and products on reasonable commercial terms, and then to develop them and launch them.
To complete its geographic coverage of the key world pharmaceutical markets, Shire intends to build a presence in Japan in the future.
The Companys principal products include: in the US, ADDERALL XR and ADDERALL for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD : AGRYLIN for the treatment of elevated blood platelets: PENTASA for the treatment of ulcerative colitis: CARBATROL for the treatment of epilepsy: and PROAMATINE for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension.
In addition, the Company receives royalties on sales of REMINYL for the treatment of Alzheimers disease, marketed by Johnson & Johnson, and on EPIVIR, COMBIVIR and TRIZIVIR for the treatment of HIV AIDS and EPIVIR-HBV for the treatment of hepatitis B, each marketed by GlaxoSmithKline GSK : in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, the CALCICHEW range, used primarily as adjuncts in the treatment of osteoporosis, and REMINYL, which was launched in September 2000 and is co-promoted by Janssen-Cilag: in Canada, 3TC for the treatment of HIV AIDS, COMBIVIR and HEPTOVIR all marketed in partnership with GSK : AMATINE : and FLUVIRAL S F, a vaccine for the prevention of influenza: and in the Rest of the World, royalties on the sales of ZEFFIX for the treatment of hepatitis B, marketed by GSK, and royalties on sales of REMINYL marketed by Johnson & Johnson.
In addition, the Company has a number of products in late stage development including FOSRENOL for the treatment of high blood phosphate levels associated with kidney failure and TROXATYL for the treatment of leukaemia and pancreatic cancer.
The Company submitted the first regulatory submission for FOSRENOL under the European Mutual Recognition procedure on 13 March 2001 and a New Drug Application with the US FDA on 30 April 2002.
Registered trademark of Johnson & Johnson.
Registered trademark of GlaxoSmithKline Unless otherwise indicated, all product names set out in this document are trademarks of Shire or companies within the Shire Group, many of which are the subject of trade mark registrations in certain territories.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies a Basis of preparation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Shire and all of its subsidiary undertakings after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.
b Use of estimates in financial statements The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are primarily made in relation to provisions for product returns, litigation and sales deductions.
c Revenue recognition The Company recognises revenue when: there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement: delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered: the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable: and collectibility is reasonably assured.
56 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements In thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued The Companys principal revenue streams and their respective accounting treatments are discussed below: i Product sales Revenue for the sales of products is recognised upon shipment to customers.
Provisions for certain rebates, product returns and discounts to customers are provided for as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales are recorded.
Approximately $17.0 million of ADDERALL XR product launch shipments made in the last quarter of 2001 were not recognised as product revenue until the first quarter of 2002, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, as these sales had not been realised and earned at 31 December 2001. ii Licensing and development fees Licensing and development fees represent revenues derived from licence agreements and from collaborative research and development arrangements.
Initial licence fees are thus deferred and recognised over the period of the licence term, or the period of the associated research and development agreement.
During the term of certain research and development agreements, the Company receives non-refundable milestones as certain technical targets are achieved.
Revenues are recognised on achievement of milestones.
The Company also receives non-refundable clinical milestones when certain targets are achieved during the clinical phases of development, such as the submission of clinical data to a regulatory authority.
These clinical milestones are recognised when received.
iii Royalty income Royalty income relating to licensed technology is recognised when earned.
Where applicable, all revenues are stated net of value added tax and similar taxes, trade discounts and intercompany transactions.
d Research and development Research and development expenditures include funded and unfunded expenditures and are charged to operations in the period in which the expense is incurred.
e Leased assets The costs of operating leases are charged to operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if rental payments are not made on such a basis.
Assets acquired under capital leases are included in the balance sheet as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease or their useful lives.
The capital elements of future lease payments are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to operations over the period of the leases to produce a level yield on the balance of the capital lease obligation.
f Pensions The Group contributes to personal defined contribution pension plans of employees.
Contributions are charged to the statement of operations as they become payable.
Details relating to these contributions and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP operated by the Group are given in note 25. g Finance costs of debt Finance costs of debt are recorded as a deferred asset and then amortised to the statement of operations over the term of the debt, using the effective interest method.
Deferred financing costs relating to debt extinguishments are written off to the statement of operations in that period.
h Income taxes The Company provides for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Accounting Standards SFAS No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS No.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided for differences between the carrying amounts in the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
Income tax expense is computed as the tax payable or refundable for the period, plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realised.
i Earnings per share Earnings per share EPS is computed in accordance with SFAS No.
128, Earnings per Share SFAS No.
Basic EPS is computed by dividing consolidated net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is computed by dividing consolidated net income available to common shareholders by the sum of the weighted average number of shares outstanding and the weighted average number of all potentially dilutive common shares.
Such potentially dilutive common shares are excluded when the effect would be to increase earnings per share or reduce a loss per share.
j Advertising expense The Company expenses the cost of advertising as incurred.
Advertising costs amounted to $45.6 million, $21.8 million and $6.6 million for the years ended 31 December 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively.
Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc 57 Notes to the consolidated financial statements In thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued k Foreign currency The functional currency of each of Shires subsidiaries is the local currency.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Transaction gains and losses are recognised in arriving at operating income.
The results of overseas operations, whose functional currencies are not US dollars, are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The cumulative effect of exchange rate movements is included in a separate component of other comprehensive income.
Foreign currency exchange transaction gains and losses on an after-tax basis included in consolidated net income in the years ended 31 December 2002, 2001 and 2000, pursuant to SFAS No.
52, Foreign Currency Translation SFAS No.
52, amounted to a $0.3 million loss, $0.5 million loss and $2.1 million gain, respectively.
l Employee stock plans SFAS No.
123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation SFAS No.
123, prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all stock-based compensation plans, including employee stock options.
123, Shire has chosen to continue to account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic-value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB No.
Accordingly, compensation cost of stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of Shires stock at the measurement date over the option exercise price and is charged to operations over the vesting period.
For fixed plans, the measurement date is the grant date.
For plans where the measurement date occurs after the grant date, referred to as variable plans, the compensation cost is re-measured on the basis of the current market value of the Companys stock at the end of each reporting period.
Shire recognises compensation expense for variable plans with performance conditions if achievement of those conditions becomes probable.
The Companys basis for electing accounting treatment under APB No.
25 is principally due to the satisfactory incorporation of the dilutive effect of these shares in the reported earnings per share calculation and the presence of pro forma supplemental disclosure of the estimated fair value methodology prescribed by SFAS No.
148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure.
At 31 December 2002, the Company has nine stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.
2002 2001 2000 Year ended 31 December $000 $000 $000 Net income As reported 250,569 38,759 211,727 Pro forma 226,319 8,791 227,018 Income per share As reported basic 50.0 7.9 43.8 As reported diluted 49.0 7.7 42.8 Pro forma basic 45.2 1.8 47.0 Pro forma diluted 44.4 1.7 45.9 m Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are defined as short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less.
n Marketable securities Marketable securities consist of commercial paper and institutional and managed cash funds.
In accordance with SFAS No.
115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities SFAS No.
115, and based on the Companys intentions regarding these instruments, the Company has classified all marketable securities as held-to-maturity and has accounted for these investments at amortised cost.
Institutional and managed cash funds are short-term money market instruments, including bank and building society term deposits from a variety of companies with strong credit ratings.
o Inventories Inventories, consisting primarily of finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
p Investments The Company has certain investments in equity securities.
Investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives the Company the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control over, the investee.
Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the Company has an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee between 20% and 50%, although other factors, such as representation on the investees Board of Directors and the impact of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate.
58 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements In thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Under the equity method of accounting, the Company records its investments in equity-method investees on the consolidated balance sheet as Investments and its share of the investees earnings or losses together with other-than-temporary impairments in value as Equity in earnings of equity method investees on the consolidated statement of operations.
All other equity investments, which consist of investments for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the cost method or at fair value.
Investments in private companies are carried at cost, less provisions for other than temporary impairment in value.
For public companies that have readily determinable fair values, the Company classifies its equity investments as available-forsale and, accordingly, records these investments at their fair values with unrealised gains and losses included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of any related tax effect.
Realised gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in other expense income, net see note 24.
The cost of securities sold is based on the  method.
Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included as interest income.
q Goodwill and other intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised.
Periods ending on or before 31 December 2001 For periods ending on or before 31 December 2001 goodwill recognised in respect of each significant business combination was amortised over a period of 5 to 30 years weighted average 19 years on a straight-line basis depending on the nature of the goodwill, and was evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate, in managements judgement, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
Impairments of goodwill were recognised if expected undiscounted cash flows were not sufficient to recover the goodwill.
If a material impairment was identified, goodwill was written down to its estimated fair value.
Fair value was determined based on the present value of expected net cash flows to be generated by the business, discounted using a rate commensurate with the risks involved.
Periods commencing 1 January 2002 Effective 1 January 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS No.
The statement directs that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinate lives will not be amortised but rather will be tested at least annually for impairment.
Intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortised over their useful lives, but without the constraint of an arbitrary ceiling.
Going forward, the Company will carry out an annual impairment review of goodwill as of 30 September date unless any events occur which trigger the need for an earlier impairment review.
ii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets, which comprise intellectual property including trademarks for products with an immediate defined revenue stream and acquired for valued consideration, are recorded at cost and amortised in equal annual installments over the estimated useful life of the related product which range from 5 to 40 years weighted average 23 years.
Intellectual property with no defined revenue stream, where the related product has not yet completed the necessary approval process, is written off to operations on acquisition.
The following factors are considered in estimating the useful lives.
Where an intangible asset is a composite of a number of factors, the period of amortisation is determined from considering these factors together: regulatory and legal provisions, including the regulatory approval and review process, patent issues and actions by government agencies: the effects of obsolescence, changes in demand, competing products and other economic factors, including the development of competing drugs that are more effective clinically or economically: and actions of competitors, suppliers, regulatory agencies or others that may eliminate current competitive advantages.
r Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Cost of significant assets includes capitalised interest incurred during the construction period.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset over its estimated useful life as follows: Buildings 20 to 50 years Office furniture, fittings and equipment 4 to 10 years Warehouse, laboratory and manufacturing equipment 4 to 10 years The cost of land is not depreciated.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.
The costs of major renewals and improvements are capitalised.
At the time property, plant and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts.
The profit or loss on such disposition is reflected in operating income.
Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc 59 Notes to the consolidated financial statements In thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued s Impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill and investments The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets other than goodwill and investments in accordance with SFAS No.
144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS No.
Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets may not be recoverable, the Company compares undiscounted net cash estimated to be generated by those assets to the carrying amounts of those assets.
When these undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, the Company records impairment losses to write the asset down to its estimated fair market value.
This is usually calculated by reference to discounted estimated cash flows.
t Concentration of credit risk Revenues are mainly derived from agreements with major pharmaceutical companies and relationships with pharmaceutical wholesale distributors and retail pharmacy chains.
Significant customers are disclosed in note 22.
Such clients have significant cash resources and therefore any credit risk associated with these transactions is considered minimal.
Excess cash is invested in bank and building society term deposits and commercial paper from a variety of companies with strong credit ratings.
These investments typically bear minimal credit risk.
A significant proportion of revenue is derived from the sale of ADDERALL XR and ADDERALL.
During 2002 and 2001 sales of these products were $427.7 million and $350.3 million respectively, representing 41% of total revenues in both years.
As a result, factors affecting the sale or production of ADDERALL XR and ADDERALL would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.
u Reclassifications Certain amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation.
v New accounting pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No.
143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS No.
143 requires that the fair value of a liability for asset retirement obligations be recognised in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made.
The associated asset retirement costs are capitalised as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset.
143 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after 15 June 2002.
The Company has assessed the potential impact of the adoption of SFAS No.
143 and concluded that there is no impact.
In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No.
145, Rescission of FASB Statements No.
4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No.
13 and Technical Corrections SFAS No.
The principal change is that gains or losses from extinguishment of debt which are classified as extraordinary items by SFAS No.
4 will no longer be classified as such.
The provisions of SFAS No.
145 are effective for fiscal years beginning after 15 May 2002 although early application of the Statement related to the rescission of SFAS No.
The Company plans to adopt SFAS No.
145 for its fiscal year ending 31 December 2003.
When adopted, prior extraordinary items related to the extinguishment of debt will need to be reclassified.
The potential impact of the adoption of SFAS No.
145 will be to reclassify $2.6 million from extraordinary items to income expense.
In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No.
146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities SFAS No.
146, which addresses accounting and processing for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit and Activity Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring Issue 94-3.
146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal liability be recognised when the liability is incurred.
Under Issue 94-3, a liability for an exit cost was recognised at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan.
146, fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability.
146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after 31 December 2002, with early application encouraged.
We do no expect the adoption of SFAS No.
146 to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation FIN No.
45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others FIN 45.
This interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued.
It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognise, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee.
The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for interim and annual periods after 15 December 2002.
The initial recognition and initial measurement requirements of FIN 45 are effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after 31 December 2002.
We are assessing, but at this point do not believe the adoption of the recognition and initial measurement requirements of FIN 45 will have a material impact on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No.
46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of APB No.
This interpretation requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.
FIN 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after 31 January 2003.
For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to 1 February 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after 15 June 2003.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of FIN 46 will have on its results of operations and financial condition.
w Statutory accounts The consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2002 and 2001 and for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2002 do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 240 of the UK Companies Act 1985.
Statutory accounts prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom for the years ended 31 December 2001 and 2000 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales.
The auditors report on those accounts was unqualified.
60 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements In thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 3 Business combinations and reorganisations Year ended 31 December 2002 a Atlantic Pharmaceutical Services Inc. acquisition On 27 September 2002, the Company completed its acquisition of Atlantic Pharmaceutical Services Inc. APS from Niro Inc. for cash consideration of $17.3 million, including $0.3 million costs of acquisition.
This transaction provided the Company with an in-house facility in which to manufacture several key US products.
The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method and goodwill of $10.2 million was recorded.
The results of operations of APS have been included in the consolidated results of the Company since the date of acquisition.
The purchase price of $17.3 million was allocated as follows: Fair value $000 Total current assets 3,188 Property, plant and equipment, net 11,620 Current installments of long-term debt 216 Accounts payable 1,367 Long-term debt, excluding current instalments 6,050 Net assets acquired 7,175 Goodwill 10,175 17,350 Represented by: Purchase consideration 17,000 Acquisition fees 350 17,350 The pro forma effect in 2002 and 2001 of the APS acquisition if acquired on 1 January 2002 and 1 January 2001 respectively would have resulted in revenues, income before extraordinary items, net income and earnings per share data as follows: 2002 2001 Year ended 31 December $000 $000 Revenues 1,042,748 861,660 Income before extraordinary items 248,983 41,428 Net income 248,983 38,824 Earnings per share basic 49.7 7.9 Earnings per share diluted 48.7 7.7 b Divestment of OTC products division On 27 December 2002, the Company completed its divestment of a group of non-strategic US products, known collectively as the Over-TheCounter OTC products.
The Company received sale proceeds of $71.0 million and recorded a gain on disposal of $2.1 million.
In addition, there are potential warranties of up to $7.0 million in respect of the divestment, of which the Company has provided what it deems necessary at this stage.
Further details of this discontinued operation are provided in note 5 below.
Year ended 31 December 2001 a BioChem merger On 11 May 2001, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of BioChem Pharma, Inc. BioChem, an international specialty pharmaceutical company based in Laval, Canada.
The merger was achieved through an exchange of shares.
Shire issued 179,447,629 common shares and 17,292,149 exchangeable shares in order to effect the business combination.
Each exchangeable share is equivalent to three common shares and is exchangeable into common shares or ADSs at a rate of one exchangeable share for three common shares or one exchangeable share for one ADS, at any time at the request of the holder.
Holders of exchangeable shares are entitled to the dividend and other rights that are economically equivalent to those of common shares.
Exchangeable shares are included in deriving the Companys weighted average number of shares for both basic and diluted earnings per share see note 20 because they will become and are equivalent to common shares.
This transaction was accounted for by the pooling-of-interests method in accordance with APB No.
Consequently, the consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to the merger.
Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc 61 Notes to the consolidated financial statements In thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 3 Business combinations and reorganisations continued Details of the results of operations of BioChem for the period before the merger was consummated, which is the period from 1 January 2001 to 11 May 2001, that are included in the combined net income of the Company are as follows: $000 Revenue 51,592 Net income 23,003 Other changes in shareholders equity: Issue of common shares on exercise of stock options 2,170 The revenues and earnings previously reported by the Company for the year ended 31 December 2000 can be reconciled to the combined amounts presented herein as follows: Revenue Net income $000 $000 As previously reported 517,608 76,171 BioChem pooled results 198,478 174,346 Accounting policy alignment see note 4 44,976 38,790 As restated for BioChem 671,110 211,727 Discontinued operations see note 5 23,456 As reported 647,654 211,727 b Dispositions During 2001, the Company recorded a $8.1 million loss on the sale of its manufacturing facility in Toronto, Canada.
As a result of the merger with BioChem, the decision was made to close the Toronto facility and to eliminate duplicate positions across the combined organisation.
The Companys existing Canadian sales and marketing operations in Toronto were combined with those of BioChem in Laval.
During the third quarter of 2001, the Company disposed of certain non-strategic products for net proceeds of approximately $4.5 million.
A loss on disposition of $2.1 million was recorded in operations.
4 Accounting policy alignment In 1998, BioChem spun off its investments in CliniChem to its shareholders.
In connection with this spin-off, BioChem retained rights in CliniChem, including the option to reacquire all shares in CliniChem at any time.
Under EITF 99-16, this transaction would result in CliniChem continuing to be consolidated by BioChem, as BioChem would have significant continuing involvement in the operation of CliniChem.
However, at the time that CliniChem was spun off, EITF 99-16 had not been issued and BioChem elected to fide-consolidate CliniChem, an acceptable accounting principle at that time.
The management of Shire believes that its accounting policies would have required Shire to continue to consolidate CliniChem, also an acceptable accounting alternative at the date of the spin-off and a policy that conforms with the later guidance issued under EITF 99-16.
The effect of this accounting policy alignment is to reduce the net income from continuing operations previously reported by BioChem now included in the pooled financial statements for 2000 by $38.8 million.
On 15 December 2000 BioChem reacquired CliniChem.
This acquisition has been reflected in the accompanying financial statements using purchase accounting.
5 Discontinued operations In December 1999 the Company acquired a group of products, collectively referred to as the OTC portfolio, through its merger with Roberts Pharmaceutical Corporation Roberts.
The OTC portfolio consisted of non-prescription laxatives and dietary supplements sold by the Companys US operating segment.
As a specialty pharmaceuticals company that focuses on prescription only products, this part of the business was not considered to be a core part of Shires long-term strategy and hence the decision was made to divest the OTC portfolio in December 2002.
On 27 December 2002, the Company completed its divestment of the OTC business.
The historical consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the OTC business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.
Operating results of the discontinued operations are summarised below.
The amounts include income tax provisions based on the stand-alone results of the OTC business.
There have been no allocations of general and administrative corporate costs or interest expense related to corporate credit facilities to the discontinued operation.
As the OTC business functioned within Shire US, which itself essentially functions as an independent entity, no corporate costs were eliminated upon discontinuance of the operation.
Within Shire US, the OTC business had few dedicated resources.
All of the products were manufactured and packaged by third-party contract manufacturers.
The products were distributed through a shared warehouse facility and sold through a small sales team.

In March 1997, we entered into an agreement to make an investment of CAN$30.0 million in the GeneChem Technologies Venture Fund L. P. a venture capital fund sponsored by our subsidiary, GeneChem Financial Corporation.
This CAN$100.0 million fund invests in advanced academic research projects and early-stage private or public companies in the area of genomics and related technologies for human application.
As of 31 December 2002, we have invested CAN$27.0 million in the GeneChem Technologies Venture Fund L. P. and we are, therefore, committed to investing a further $1.9 million CAN$3.0 million into this fund.
In September 2000, we entered into an agreement to invest CAN$15.0 million in the GeneChem Therapeutics Venture Fund L. P. which invests in genomics companies focusing on cancer and infectious diseases.
As of 31 December 2002, we have committed to invest a further $4.3 million CAN$6.8 million in the GeneChem Therapeutics Venture Fund L. P. The manager and general partners of these funds are fully-owned subsidiaries of the Company.
These funds have not been consolidated because the operational substance of the funds is such that the other partners have the ability to veto investment decisions.
ii EGS healthcare funds In November 2000, we entered into an agreement to invest up to $10.0 million in various EGS healthcare funds.
As of 31 December 2002, we have invested $5.1 million in EGS healthcare funds and we are, therefore, committed to invest a further $4.9 million into these funds.
b Investments in public companies During the year ended 31 December 2002, there were no new investments in public companies.
In July 2002, the Companys $11.1 million preference share investment in Immunogen Inc. was converted into a common stock holding.
During the year, the Company wrote down the cost of investments in public companies by $1.4 million due to other-than-temporary impairments.
This expense is included within non-operating other expense income, net see note 24. c Equity method investments The Company has accounted for its commercialisation partnership with GSK through which the products 3TC and ZEFFIX are marketed in Canada using the equity method of accounting.
The Companys share of the partnership is included within Equity in earnings of equity method investees and the related equity investment of $2.9 million is included above.
In September 2002, the Company sold the net assets of its CADx group of companies, to Qualia Computing Inc. in exchange for shares in a newly formed joint venture.
The common stock of the joint venture, Qualia Computing Inc. is 50% owned by Shire.
The initial value of the investment was equal to the book value of assets sold, therefore, no gain or loss was recognised.
The Company has applied the equity method of accounting as the Company owns but does not exercise control over its 50% share of the joint venture.
As a result, the Companys investment is valued at cost, adjusted for its share of the earnings or losses of the joint venture.
The Companys share of the partnership is included within Equity in earnings of equity method investees and the related equity investment of $7.7 million is included above.
There is no significant difference between the amount at which the investment is carried and the amount of the underlying equity in net assets of the joint venture.

Acquisitions of other intangible assets primarily related to SOLARAZE.
The Company acquired the exclusive rights to manufacture, distribute and sell SOLARAZE for the treatment of actinic keratosis from SkyePharma PLC.
In May 2002, the Company paid $18.9 million 12.9 million in respect of certain European territories, followed in December 2002 by a further $1.2 million 0.7 million in respect of the rights for Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and certain other countries in the Pacific Rim.
Amortisation charged for the years ended 31 December 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $23.5 million, $31.4 million and $27.3 million respectively.
Goodwill was no longer amortised with effect from 1 January 2002 following the implementation of SFAS No.
142 As described in note 2, the Company adopted SFAS No.
A transitional assessment of goodwill impairment as of 1 January 2002 was completed by 30 June 2002.
Management concluded that the fair value of the Companys individual reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the net assets including goodwill, and hence this process did not result in any impairment to be recorded on adoption of SFAS No.
The Company completed a second goodwill impairment review as of 30 September 2002 and found that no adjusting entries were necessary.
A reconciliation table is provided below to exclude the effect of goodwill amortisation in accordance with the transitional disclosures relating to SFAS No.
Results for the year ended 31 December 2002 have been prepared in accordance with SFAS No.

The useful economic lives of all intangible assets that continue to be amortised under SFAS No.
Management estimates that the annual amortisation charges in respect of intangible fixed assets held at 31 December 2002 will be approximately $13.2 million for each of the five years to 31 December 2007.
Estimated amortisation expense can be affected by various factors including future acquisitions and disposals of product rights.

Further details in respect of the convertible notes are presented below.
68 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements In thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 16 Long-term debt continued i Convertible notes due 2011 The $400.0 million of guaranteed convertible notes due 2011 were issued in August 2001 by Shire Finance Limited the Issuer, a wholly owned subsidiary.
On or after 21 August 2004, the Company may redeem, for cash, all or part of the notes providing the ordinary share price has exceeded $26.20 sterling equivalent at the time for 20 of the 30 consecutive dealing days in the period prior to redemption.
The decision as to whether a note holder should exercise a put option will depend on a number of factors particularly the price of Shire stock at the put date and the likelihood of the Companys stock price exceeding the conversion threshold price.
The conversion threshold price is equivalent to $20.15 or 12.52 at the closing exchange rate for 2002 for Shire common shares and $60.46 for Shire ADSs.
If the price of Shire common shares at the first put date of 21 August 2004 remains at a level similar to the year-end price of 3.97 $18.89 for Shire ADSs it is quite possible that note holders will choose to exercise their put options.
The Company currently has adequate resources from which it could satisfy repayment of the entire convertible debt principal of $400.0 million.
The interest expense recorded in the year ended 31 December 2002 was $8.0 million 2001: $2.9 million.
ii Unsecured convertible zero coupon loan notes The Company financed the purchase of intellectual property relating to the manufacture of ADDERALL from Arenol Corporation by a total of $11.8 million in loan notes.
On 5 March 1999 the Company issued a $5.8 million principal amount unsecured convertible zero coupon loan note due 30 July 2001 the First Loan Note and a $6.0 million principal amount unsecured convertible zero coupon loan note due 30 July 2004 the Second Loan Note.
Both loan notes were in the name of the parent company, Shire.
The agreement provided for the cancellation of certain specified amounts of the aggregate principal amount of the First Loan Note and of such amounts of the Second Loan Note on certain dates to the extent of certain indemnified losses or, to the extent that such amounts of the First Loan Note or the Second Loan Note together the Loan Notes were not so cancelled, for their conversion into common shares.
The number of common shares was calculated by dividing the amount not cancelled by the lower of 3.565 approximately $5.75 and the midweek closing price of the common shares on the London Stock Exchange on the relevant date.
Translation from pounds sterling to US dollars was made using the exchange rate on the relevant date.
The Company has issued common shares to Arenol Corporation or its nominee broker, as set out in the table below, in consideration of the conversion of each of the Loan Notes.
As at 31 December 2002 there is no liability remaining.

This facility is non-interestbearing and is repayable in annual instalments of $0.6 million CAN$1.0 million.
iv Bank term loans The Company had a bank term loan at 31 December 2001 bearing interest at the lenders prime rate, which was secured by a charge on land and buildings.
The final payment in respect of this loan was made in May 2002.

Certain estimates and judgements were required to develop the fair value amounts.
The fair value amounts shown below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realise upon disposition nor do they indicate the Companys intent or ability to dispose of the financial instrument.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of financial instrument: Marketable securities the carrying value of marketable securities approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these investments.
Investments non-current investments with readily determinable market values are marked to market.
Long-term debt the fair value of long-term debt is estimated based on the discounted future cash flows using currently available interest rates or, where the debt instrument is traded, by reference to the market price.
70 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements In thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 18 Financial instruments continued The carrying amounts and corresponding fair values of financial instruments at 31 December 2002 and 2001 were as follows: Carrying amount Fair value $000 $000 31 December 2002 Financial assets: Commercial paper 87,843 87,843 Institutional and managed cash funds 228,283 228,283 Investments 14,129 14,129 Financial liabilities: Long-term debt 408,190 376,883 31 December 2001 Financial assets: Commercial paper 246,174 246,174 Institutional and managed cash funds 477,737 477,737 Investments 13,855 13,855 Financial liabilities: Long-term debt 406,806 394,206 19 Leases and other commitments a Leases The Company leases facilities, motor vehicles and certain office equipment under operating leases.
The Companys commitments under the noncancellable portion of all operating leases for the next five years and thereafter as of 31 December 2002 are as follows: 31 December 2002 $000 2003 7,215 2004 7,887 2005 5,855 2006 4,085 2007 3,038 Thereafter 12,805 40,885 Lease and rental expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations amounted to $6.7 million, $6.1 million and $4.3 million for the fiscal years ended 31 December 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively.
b Contingent liabilities i Commitments The Company has undertaken to subscribe to interests in companies and partnerships for amounts totalling $38.1 million 31 December 2001: $37.7 million.
As at 31 December 2002 an amount of $20.3 million 31 December 2001: $20.1 million has been subscribed.
ii FLUVIRAL The Company signed a ten-year contract with the Government of Canada in 2001 to assure a state of readiness in the case of an influenza pandemic worldwide epidemic and to provide influenza vaccine for all Canadian citizens in such an event.
Canada would require 32 million doses of single-strain monovalent flu vaccine within a production period of 16 weeks.
Shire Biologics has therefore begun to expand its production capacity in order to meet this objective within a five-year period.
Shire Biologics is committed to CAN$18 million approximately $11.3 million of capital expenditure on immoveables for the purpose of achieving the level of pandemic readiness required.
In addition, a performance bond equal to 10% of the minimum estimated contract value in any year, which for 2002 2003 will be CAN$19.2 million approximately $12 million, would become payable to the Government of Canada if contracted penalty clauses were triggered.
Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc 71 Notes to the consolidated financial statements In thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 19 Leases and other commitments continued c Legal proceedings i General Shire accounts for litigation losses in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
5, Accounting for Contingencies SFAS No.
5, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses when management is able reasonably to estimate the loss.
Where the estimated loss lies within a range and no particular amount within that range is a better estimate than any other amount the minimum amount is recorded.
In other cases managements best estimate of the loss is recorded.
These estimates are developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are refined each accounting period, in light of additional information being known.
In instances where Shire is unable to develop a best estimate of loss, no litigation loss is recorded at that time.
As information becomes known a loss provision is set up when a best estimate can be made.
The best estimates are reviewed quarterly and the estimates are changed when expectations are revised.
ii Phentermine Shire US Inc. SUS is a defendant in 11 lawsuits still pending in both US federal and state courts which seek damages for, among other things, personal injury arising from phentermine products supplied for the treatment of obesity by SUS and several other pharmaceutical companies.
SUS, formerly known as Shire Richwood Inc. has been sued as a manufacturer and distributor of phentermine, an anorectic used in the short-term treatment of obesity and one of the products addressed by the lawsuits.
The lawsuits generally allege the following claims: the defendants marketed phentermine and other products for the treatment of obesity and misled users about the products and dangers associated with them: the defendants failed adequately to test phentermine individually and when taken in combination with the other drugs: and the defendants knew or should have known about the negative effects of the drugs and should have informed the public about such risks and or failed to provide appropriate warning labels.
SUS has been named as a defendant in a total of 3,804 such phentermine lawsuits, in respect of which SUS has been dismissed as a defendant in 3,756 cases.
Shire is awaiting the furtherance of proceedings in the remaining 37 law suits.
SUS became involved with phentermine through its acquisition of certain assets of Rexar Pharmacal Corporation Rexar in January 1994.
In addition to SUS potentially incurring liability as a result of its own production of Oby-Cap, a phentermine product, the plaintiffs may additionally seek to impose liability on SUS as successor to Rexar.
SUS intends vigorously to defend all the lawsuits and pursue all available reasonable defences.
SUS denies liability on a number of grounds including lack of scientific evidence that phentermine, properly prescribed, causes the alleged side effects and that SUS did not promote phentermine for long-term combined use as part of the fen phen diet.
Accordingly, SUS intends to defend vigorously any and all claims made against the Group in respect of phentermine and believes that liability is neither probable nor quantifiable at this stage of litigation.
Legal expenses have been paid by Eon Labs Manufacturing Inc. Eon, the supplier to SUS, or Eons insurance carriers but such insurance is now exhausted.
Eon has agreed to defend and indemnify SUS in this litigation pursuant to an agreement dated 30 November 2000 between Eon and SUS.
iii ADDERALL Shires extended-release once-daily version of ADDERALL, ADDERALL XR, is covered by US patent No.
However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in the suit.
In the event that the Company does not prevail, then Barr could be in a position to market its extended-release mixed amphetamine salt product upon FDA final approval of its ANDA application.
This may have a material adverse impact on the Companys results and financial position.
In the event that the Company does not prevail in the suit, a generic version of ADDERALL XR could not be launched before October 2004, the current expiry of the existing Hatch-Waxman exclusivity.
In November 2002 Shire received approval from the FDA for a new formulation of ADDERALL which is patent protected.
In January 2003 Shire received a Paragraph IV notice from Barr alleging that this patent is invalid and not infringed by Barrs 7.5mg and 15mg mixed amphetamine salt products.

The asset impairments and restructuring charges included an impairment charge of $20.9 million to adjust intangible asset values, primarily trademark and patent costs but also an element of product rights, to their estimated fair value.
These charges are consistent with the Companys accounting policy to review periodically the carrying value of the intangibles and evaluate whether there has been any impairment in the value of those intangibles as compared with estimated undiscounted future cash flows relating to those intangibles.
There was also a total of $8.8 million recorded in respect of employee-related costs, as a result of employee terminations related to the closure of the Toronto facility and the elimination of duplicate positions across the combined organisation.
Shires existing Canadian sales and marketing operations in Toronto have been combined with those of BioChem in Laval.
A total of 57 employees were identified to be terminated.
As of 31 December 2001 all of the planned terminations were completed.
The Company incurred a loss on the sale of a duplicated facility in Toronto, Canada, of $8.1 million.
b Product disposals During the third quarter of 2001, Shire disposed of certain non-strategic products for net proceeds of approximately $4.5 million, recording a loss on disposition of $2.1 million.
Year ended 31 December 2000 As a result of the merger with BioChem, the Company incurred a charge of $26.9 million relating to the acquisition of in-process research and development in accordance with SFAS No.

These charges are consistent with the Companys policy to provide for other-than-temporary impairments in investment by reference to the fair value of the investment using established financial methodologies.
The main components of other income in the year ended 31 December 2000 was a $104.0 million gain resulting from the sale of long-term investments, primarily in respect of North American Vaccine, Inc. a publicly traded biotechnology company listed on the American Stock Exchange.
Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc 77 Notes to the consolidated financial statements In thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 25 Retirement benefits a Personal defined contribution pension plans The Company makes contributions to defined contribution retirement plans that together cover substantially all employees within the Group.
For the defined contribution retirement plans, the level of Company contribution is fixed at a set percentage of employees pay.
Company contributions to personal defined contribution pension plans totalled $6.8 million, $4.9 million and $2.6 million for the years ended 31 December 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively, and were charged to operations as they became payable.
b Defined benefit pension plan Roberts, a company with whom the Company merged in December 1999, operated a defined SERP for certain US employees, which was established in 1998.
This plan was available to former employees of Roberts who met certain age and service requirements.
As part of the restructuring of the Group following the Roberts merger, the SERP was closed to new members and contributions ceased being paid into the plan for existing members.
As part of this arrangement, the Company paid a lump sum contribution into the plan of $18.0 million, the result of which is that the Company has no future contributions under the plan.
In accordance with EITF 97-14, the asset and liability of $12.1 million and $8.4 million respectively are shown on the balance sheet within the categories Other non-current assets and Other non-current liabilities.

The valuation allowance relates to the deferred tax assets arising from overseas tax operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards, which have no expiration date.
In addition, capital loss carryforwards can only be offset against capital gains.
As of 31 December 2002, based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are anticipated to reverse, and prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realise the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the valuation allowances.
The Company recognises a deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when the Company expects that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner, such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments.
The Company does not, however, provide for income taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain other subsidiaries located outside the UK where, in managements opinion, such earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in these operations, will be remitted in a tax-free liquidation, or will be remitted as dividends with taxes substantially offset by foreign tax credits.
