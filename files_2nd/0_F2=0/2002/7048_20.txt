The group has no significant transactional currency exposures in its day-to-day business.
Hedges As explained in the Financial Review on pages 26 to 29, the groups policy is to hedge the following exposures: interest rate risk using currency swaps, interest rate swaps and interest rate options foreign exchange risk using forward foreign currency contracts, foreign exchange options and currency swaps.
The effects of any interest rate hedges are recognised over the life of the hedge.
Foreign exchange hedges are evaluated against the closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the resultant gain or loss is matched with that of the underlying asset or liability in the accounts.
As a result, the unrecognised gain or loss is a function of market rates at the balance sheet date and is not indicative of gains or losses which will be recognised in future accounting periods.

For long-term, traded xed rate financial liabilities, fair value is assessed by reference to the latest market price.
For currency swaps and interest rate swaps, fair value is estimated as the net present value of the future cash ows as implied by current yield curves.
Interest rate options are valued at market price.
Foreign exchange contracts, being generally short term in nature, are valued against the spot exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Of the derivative financial instruments held to hedge the interest rate and currency prole of financial assets, at the balance sheet date the cumulative aggregate unrecognised gains and losses on interest rate swaps and options is 58.5m 36.5m and on currency swaps 1.3m 16.1m.
Subject to future movements in the yield curve these gains will be recognised over the residual life of each swap or option.
On this basis 9.6m of gains will be recognised in the next accounting period.
Total gains and losses of 36.4m 18.5m were recognised in the period ended December 31, 2002 that related to unrecognised gains and losses at the start of the period.

62 Notes to the accounts 17 Provisions for liabilities and charges continued Environmental and reclamation provisions have been established to cover those situations where the group has either a legal or constructive obligation to remedy known exposures.
Reclamation provisions are expected to be utilised over the life of the relevant quarry.
Legal and insurance and other provisions relate to acquisitions, disposals and rationalisations both established on acquisitions and provided for in current and prior years.
Legal and insurance, environmental and other provisions are expected to be utilised on a reducing basis over the next five years, depending in each case on the nature of the underlying obligation.
The above provisions include 146.7m at December 31, 2002 in respect of the cost of resolving current and probable future claims against US subsidiaries for asbestos until 2010.
The opening balance has been restated so that the environmental provisions are now stated gross of amounts recoverable from insurers, as required by Financial Reporting Standard 12 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.

18 Koppers liabilities Koppers environmental obligations and related costs relate to the former US chemical operations disposed of by Beazer PLC prior to its acquisition by Hanson in 1991.
Beazer and certain of its subsidiaries remain contractually and statutorily liable for certain environmental costs relating to these discontinued operations.
During 1998 an agreement was signed under which the funding and risk of the environmental liabilities were underwritten by subsidiaries of two re-insurance companies, Centre Solutions and Swiss Re.
A one-off premium and related transaction costs totalling $275.0m was paid providing insurance cover of $800.0m in perpetuity after payment by the group of the first $100.0m of remediation costs arising since January 1, 1998.
The discounted liability is now recognised in provisions and a corresponding asset representing the amounts receivable is shown in prepayments.
These costs are payable, on a reducing basis.
The Koppers amounts due from insurers, as shown in prepayments, and liabilities transferred to insurers, as shown in provision for liabilities and charges, are as follows: m At January 1, 2002 205.8 Increase in prepayment liability due to unwinding of discount 16.0 Increase in prepayment liability due to reappraisal of liabilities 36.5 Decrease in prepayment liability due to settlements 38.1 Exchange movements 20.7 At December 31, 2002 199.5 The matched increase in the asset liability during 2002 recognises the possibility of increased claims in future years.
The insurance agreement provides cover in excess of projected liabilities.

Fair value adjustments were made to the book value of the assets and liabilities of the above acquisitions to adjust, where applicable, the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities.
There were no material adjustments to bring book values into alignment with Hanson accounting policies.
The above gures reect a preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration to the net assets and liabilities of acquisitions made during the year.
The preliminary allocation will be reviewed based on additional information up to December 31, 2003.
The directors do not believe that any net adjustments resulting from such review would have a material adverse effect on Hanson.
For the year prior to the acquisition, the acquired companies reported a post-tax profit of 10.2m.

At December 31, 2002, in addition to those issued by banks identied under note 16, Hanson has provided third parties with guarantees and performance bonds amounting to 155.4m 176.3m.
These relate to the trading activities of current subsidiaries 145.4m and former subsidiaries 10.0m.
Existing and former subsidiaries, including subsidiaries not transferred pursuant to the demergers of US Industries, Inc in 1995, Imperial Tobacco Group PLC and Millennium Chemicals Inc in 1996 and The Energy Group PLC in 1997 the Demergers, have engaged in businesses and activities, unrelated to the businesses and activities presently being carried on by the Company, which give rise to bodily injury and property damage claims concerning environmental and health issues.
Claims and lawsuits have been led against these subsidiaries, either directly or as a result of indemnity obligations, relating to products incorporating asbestos, coal by-products and chemicals, in particular for the wood treating industry.
With regard to asbestos claims, various of the Companys US subsidiaries are defendants, typically with many other companies, in a number of lawsuits led in certain state and federal courts by claimants who allege that they have suffered bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products, the manufacture of which by such subsidiaries ceased, depending on the subsidiary involved, between 1973 and 1984.
The products include coke oven batteries, roong products, electrostatic precipitators, hot top rings, gun plastic cement, wallboard joint compounds and textured paints.
Each of the Companys relevant US subsidiaries, together with its insurance carriers and outside counsel, review each asbestos claim that is pursued by the claimants.
In many cases the claimants are unable to demonstrate that any injury they have suffered resulted from exposure to the subsidiarys products, in which case their claim is generally dismissed without payment.
In those cases where a compensatable disease, exposure to the subsidiarys products and causation can be established, the subsidiary generally settles for amounts that reect the type of disease, the seriousness of the injury, the age of the claimant, the particular jurisdiction of the claim and the number and solvency of the other defendants.
Notes to the accounts 65 Notes to the accounts continued for the 12 months ended December 31, 2002 22 Contingent liabilities continued Set out in tabular form below is certain information regarding asbestos claims against the Companys US subsidiaries the numbers are approximate only : 2002 2001 New claimants 32,200 21,700 Resolutions 18,200 3,100 Outstanding claimants 81,500 67,500 Gross cost of resolution US$37.3m US$26.8m Less insurance recoveries US$ 33.2m US$ 25.8m Net cost before tax US$4.1m US$1.0m Average gross cost per resolution US$2,049 US$8,645 Of the claimants whose cases were resolved during this period, approximately 70% were dismissed without payment.
The aggregate amounts paid in settlement and average settlement payments in any given period, together with related defence costs, have uctuated widely and are expected to continue to uctuate widely depending on the nature of the claims resolved, including the proportion which are mass claims, disease mix, number of other defendants and jurisdiction of claim.
The Company estimates that the gross liability for the cost of resolving current and probable future asbestos claims against its US subsidiaries until 2010 will be approximately $235m, including defence costs, but before tax benefit and not discounted to present value.
At the year end net provisions totalling $123m were in place to cover these estimated costs, after taking into account expected insurance recoveries of approximately $112m.
In establishing the provisions, other assumptions have been made as to the number, disease mix and location of future claims, trends in dismissal rates, settlement and defence costs, resolution of all existing claims and time scale of resolution of new claims five years after receipt and the continued solvency of co-defendants.
In light of the significant uncertainty associated with asbestos claims, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provisions for the cost of resolving asbestos claims until 2010 will be an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred and as a result the provisions will be subject to potential revision from time to time as additional information becomes available and developments occur.
Most of the subsidiaries involved with asbestos claims have separate agreements with their insurance carriers regarding the defence and settlement of asbestos claims, the terms of which vary for each such subsidiary.
These insurance arrangements have resulted in the insurance companies having met substantially all of the amounts such subsidiaries have paid to date in settlements and defence costs.
The Company assumes that the amounts received from its insurers will decline signicantly over time.
One of the Companys subsidiaries is involved in litigation proceedings in California with its insurers, with a view to establishing whether or not substantially all of the primary cover available to that subsidiary has been exhausted and, to the extent that such cover has been exhausted, the amount of excess cover that is available to it.
The Company does not believe that adequate information currently exists to allow it to estimate reasonably the amount of liability and costs associated with asbestos claims that its relevant US subsidiaries expect to resolve after 2010, even though the Company expects claims will continue to be asserted against its subsidiaries, the resolution of which will take place after 2010.
Factors which could cause actual results to differ from such estimates and expectations include: i adverse trends in the ultimate number of asbestos claims led against the Companys US subsidiaries: ii increases in the cost of resolving current and future asbestos claims as a result of adverse trends relating to settlement costs, dismissal rates, legal fees and or judgment sizes: iii decreases in the amount of insurance available to cover asbestos claims as a result of adverse changes in the interpretation of insurance policies or the insolvency of insurers: iv the emergence of new trends or legal theories that enlarge the scope of potential claimants: v the impact of bankruptcies of other companies whose share of liability may be imposed on the Companys US subsidiaries under certain state liability laws: vi the unpredictable aspects of the US litigation process: vii adverse changes in the mix of asbestos-related diseases with respect to which asbestos claims are made against the Companys US subsidiaries, and viii potential legislative changes.
In light of such factors, the liability of the Companys US subsidiaries for resolving asbestos claims may be materially different from current estimates and the impact of such claims, both before and after 2010, might have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash ow.
However, assuming that current trends continue, the Company does not expect that the liability and costs associated with its asbestos claims will have such a material adverse effect and, even assuming a material deterioration in current trends, on the evidence available to it the Company does not expect that such claims would impact the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.
In addition to US asbestos claims, the Companys former and existing subsidiaries are subject from time to time to bodily injury and property damage claims and lawsuits, both on an individual and class action basis, either directly or as a result of indemnity obligations.
Such claims and lawsuits relate primarily to former US chemical products and operations, in particular those relating to the wood treating and coal tar derivative industries: products and operations which are unrelated to the Companys present business and activities.
In such cases where one of the Companys subsidiaries is involved, there are often several potential defendants named in the claim or lawsuit.
66 Notes to the accounts 22 Contingent liabilities continued Since the Demergers no settlements have been paid by, or judgments rendered against, any of the Companys subsidiaries which have had or could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash ow in connection with any such claims or lawsuits.
In a number of instances, the claim or lawsuit against the subsidiary has not been pursued and has been dismissed.
With respect to those claims or lawsuits that have been or are being pursued, the subsidiary concerned generally believes itself to have had or to have meritorious defences and such claims and lawsuits have been and are being vigorously defended.
Insurance issues do arise on these claims and lawsuits, both in terms of settlement and defence coverage, the outcome of which can be uncertain.
In certain instances no insurance coverage may be available to the relevant subsidiary.
The insurance cover referred to in note 18 relating to the Koppers environmental obligations does not apply to the bodily injury claims and lawsuits described in this note, although it will address certain of the property damage claims.
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are also the subject of a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and disposals which are unrelated to bodily injury or property damage claims.
The Company does not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash ow.
However, in light of the uncertainties involved in any litigation and in particular in the USA, where there is the added potential for punitive damage awards, there can be no guarantee that a settlement might have to be made by, or an unfavourable judgment may be rendered against, the Company or one of its subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash ow in connection with the above mentioned non-asbestos claims and lawsuits.
In connection with the Demergers, each of the four companies into which the Company demerged its respective businesses agreed to indemnify the Company against, among other things, the past, present and future obligations and liabilities of the businesses transferred to it on its respective demerger while the Company agreed to indemnify each of these companies against, among other things, the past, present and future obligations and liabilities of all other businesses owned or previously owned by the Company including the businesses transferred to the other demerged companies.
Neither the Company nor any of its existing subsidiaries has incurred any liability in respect of a claim that related to the abovementioned businesses demerged by the Company, any such liability being borne by the relevant demerged company without liability to the Company or any of its existing subsidiaries.
The Energy Group PLC, one of the demerged companies, was acquired by TXU Corp. in 1988.
In November 2002, TXU Corp. announced that several of TXU Corps UK subsidiaries had been placed under the administration process in the UK.
Following this on December 30, 2002, The Energy Group PLC now known as Energy Holdings No 3 Limited was put into liquidation due to its insolvency.
The Energy Group PLC itself will therefore be unable to full its indemnification obligations to the Company and its existing subsidiaries if and when required.
The Company is, however, not aware of any claims against it or its subsidiaries that would give rise to an indemnity obligation on the part of The Energy Group PLC.

Hanson has several dened benefit pension plans, the principal ones being in the USA and the UK, which cover a majority of employees.
The benets of these plans are based primarily on years of credited service and final average pensionable pay as dened under the respective plan provisions.
Employee contributions, which are at rates set according to the rules, vary between nil and 6% of pensionable pay.
In relation to US funds, the company funding policy is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, plus such additional amounts as the Company may determine to be appropriate from time to time.
In relation to UK funds, the Companys funding policy is to ensure that assets are always sufficient to cover accrued service liabilities with projection of future pay increases.
In relation to overseas, other than US plans, the Companys policy is to determine contributions in accordance with best local practice.
Hanson also sponsors dened contribution plans and participates in several multi-employer plans, which provide dened benets to the Companys union employees.
Contributions relating to dened contribution plans are made based upon the respective plans provisions and contributions relating to multi-employer plans are based on negotiated collective bargaining agreements.
The total cost of all pensions to the group in the year ended December 31, 2002 was 5.1m 10.8m of which 2.7m 4.4m relates to plans outside the UK.
The pension cost relating to UK funds is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualied actuaries using, in general, the projected unit method.
The latest actuarial assessments of the principal funds have all been within the last three years.
Past service surpluses and deficits are amortised as a level percentage of pensionable pay over the average future working lifetimes of the members.
A complete valuation of each US fund is undertaken by independent qualied actuaries every year.
Pension costs for such plans are charged based upon actuarial calculations determined in accordance with required accounting standards.
Costs relating to dened contribution plans are recognised based upon the respective plans provisions.
The assumptions used for the most recent actuarial valuations carried out as at January 1, 2002 for the US plans and during 2001 for the principal UK plan are set out below and form the basis of the 2002 profit and loss account charge.
United United Kingdom States % pa % pa Rate of general increase in salaries 4.10 4.25 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.50 Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 5.30 6.75 Expected return on assets 9.00 At the dates of the latest actuarial valuations of the dened benefit schemes which were within the group at December 31, 2002, the market values of the assets of the schemes amounted to approximately 1.6bn.
The assessed value of these assets represented approximately 102% of the liabilities for benets that had accrued to members, allowing for expected future increases in salaries.
Hanson also provides post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benets, mainly in the US, under plans to certain groups of its retired and active employees.
Hanson conforms with the provisions of the Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 6 Accounting for Post-Retirement Benets other than Pensions UITF6, which requires accrual of these costs over the period during which employees become eligible for such benets.
At December 31, 2002 the accumulated post-retirement medical benefit obligation, as assessed by independent qualied actuaries, for retirees and currently active employees is approximately 82.4m 86.0m.
In addition, at December 31, 2002 the group had related post-retirement obligations in respect of deferred actuarial variations, calculated in accordance with the requirements of SSAP24, of 24.4m 37.5m, and other unfunded post-retirement obligations of 22.5m 31.8m.
The 2002 expense has been accrued based upon actuarial calculations determined in accordance with required accounting standards.
This resulted in the recognition of service costs for benets earned during the 12 month period of approximately 1.0m 1.1m.
The actuarial assumptions used to estimate the obligations vary according to the claims experience and economic conditions relevant to each plan.
It has been assumed that the annual per capita cost of benets will increase by 10% per annum depending on claims experience and economic conditions relevant to each plan.
This rate is assumed to decrease by 1% a year to 5%.
The weighted average discount rate used in determining the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation was 6.75% at December 31, 2002 and 7.25% at December 31, 2001.

The date of the most recent actuarial valuation of the principal UK plan is January 1, 2001.
The date of the most recent valuations of the US plans is January 1, 2002.
Qualied independent actuaries have updated these valuations to December 31, 2002, in order to calculate the funded status of the plans as at the year end.
The major assumptions used to determine the liabilities on a FRS17 basis for the significant dened benefit plans as at December 31, 2002 are set out below: 2002 2002 2001 2001 United United United United Kingdom States Kingdom States % pa % pa % pa % pa Rate of general increase in salaries 4.50 4.25 4.50 4.25 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.50 2.50 Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 5.50 6.75 5.80 7.25 Ination assumption 2.50 3.50 2.50 3.50 The expected rates of returns and market values of the assets of the principal dened benefit plans were as follows: 2002 2002 2001 2001 United Kingdom United States United Kingdom United States Expected Expected Expected Expected long-term Market long-term Market long-term Market long-term Market rate of return value rate of return value rate of return value rate of return value Restated Market value of assets %m % m %m % m Equities 7.5 421.2 10.0 255.6 8.4 751.6 10.0 371.0 Bonds 4.6 588.1 6.5 199.9 5.2 319.4 7.0 211.4 Other 4.0 36.9 5.0 3.0 4.0 90.1 5.0 22.5 Total 5.7 1,046.2 8.4 458.5 7.3 1,161.1 8.8 604.9 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,146.3 537.8 989.3 558.0 deficit surplus in the plans 100.1 79.3 171.8 46.9 Surplus restriction 9.3 Pension deficit asset before deferred tax 100.1 79.3 162.5 46.9 Deferred tax 30.0 30.9 48.7 16.4 Net pension deficit asset 70.1 48.4 113.8 30.5 Asset return assumptions have been reduced at the end of 2002 as compared to 2001, reecting a generally less optimistic outlook for investment returns over the medium term.
The return assumptions for the UK have been determined by reference to market values.
The return assumptions for the US have been determined by reference to the historic investment performance of those plans adjusted for the less optimistic outlook.
Return assumptions for all plans are subject to periodic review.
The 2001 comparatives have been restated to incorporate the assets and liabilities of certain plans relating to discontinued operations.
In addition, the post-retirement medical benets in the USA give rise to a FRS17 liability before deferred tax of 82.4m 86.0m and after deferred tax of 50.3m 55.9m.

In addition, contributions of 5.2m 5.3m were made to dened contribution plans and 6.3m 6.8m to multi-employer plans.
The multi-employer plans have been treated as dened contribution plans for FRS17 purposes since it is not possible for Hanson to identify its share of the assets of the plans.
The amounts that would have been charged to the consolidated profit and loss account and consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses under FRS17 for the year ended December 31, 2002 are set out below: United United Kingdom States Total m m m Analysis of amount charged to operating profit Current service cost 26.9 9.3 36.2 Past service cost Curtailment settlement cost Total operating charge 26.9 9.3 36.2 In addition, contributions of 12.2m were made to other pension plans, nearly all of which are dened contribution in nature.
