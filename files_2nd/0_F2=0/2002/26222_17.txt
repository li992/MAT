The convertible bonds may be redeemed in 2005, and thereafter at the option of the Company, at par, provided the price exceeds 120% of the conversion price.
A coupon of 2.75% per annum is paid semi-annually and the bonds convert into ordinary shares of the Company at 184p per share restated for the Rights Issue.
The bonds would, if converted, give rise to the issue of 285,326,086 new ordinary shares representing approximately 4.4% of the current issued share capital.
The convertible bonds are included in the financial statements at an amount equal to the net proceeds after expenses.
The difference between this amount and the face value is amortised at a constant rate over the term of the convertible bonds assuming no conversion and is included in the profit and loss account as interest expense.
The carrying amount of the convertible bonds will equal the face amount at the maturity date.
In the event of conversion, any unamortised costs relating to the converted bonds will reduce the amount credited to the share premium account.
Employee share ownership trust The Company has an employee share ownership trust ESOT which purchases ordinary shares in the Company in the market and holds such shares for delivery to employees under the various employee share schemes.
Instead of using shares purchased in the market by the ESOT, the Company may issue new shares.
During 2002 0.7m shares were provided by the ESOT to employees to settle allocations due under the 1999 SBP and PSP releases and to trustees under the Companys share schemes for 2001.
As at 31 December 2002, after adjusting for the Rights Issue, the ESOT held 13.7m shares acquired at a cost of 12.6m and with a market value of 13.1m, of which 1.0m were purchased at market rates throughout 2002.
The ESOTs investments are included at cost in the consolidated balance sheet within Other financial investments.
The cost of shares acquired by the ESOT is being nanced by an interest free loan from the Company.
The ESOT has waived its rights to the dividends payable on the shares it holds.

ii The maturity prole above is calculated on the basis that a facility to renance a maturing loan should not be recognised unless the facility and loan are related.
If renancing under the Groups committed facilities were recognised, then 145m of the amount shown as repayable within one year would be reclassied as repayable after more than one year.
Analysis by currency After taking into account interest rate and currency swaps, the Groups borrowings as at 31 December 2002 were as follows: Floating Fixed borrowings borrowings Total m m m Sterling 342 1,113 1,455 United States dollar 120 0 120 Euro 13 0 13 Other 1 0 1 476 1,113 1,589 The xed borrowings of 1,113m had a weighted average interest rate of 4.38% for a weighted average period of 19 years.
