Given existing plans the company would expect capital investment to continue at around this level for the foreseeable future.
The current level of investment has ensured that capital allowance claims have exceeded depreciation: while this will continue, the company would expect the excess of capital allowances over depreciation to diminish over time.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing properties to their market value.
Such tax would become payable only if the properties were sold without it being possible to claim roll-over relief.
The total amount unprovided for is 6 million.
At present it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.

All UK committed loan facilities are at floating rates based on LIBOR.
The company has entered into swap agreements which fix 85 million of these borrowings at rates between 6.5% and 7.4% excluding bank margin with an effective weighted average interest rate excluding bank margin of 7.08% 2001: 7.13%.
At the balance sheet date, 105 million was drawn down under the revolving-loan facilities, with interest rates set for periods of between one week and six months, at which point monies are repaid and, if appropriate, redrawn.
The undrawn facility expires in more than two years.
In addition to the UK facilities, in September 1999, the company issued $140 million unsecured US senior notes due in 2009, carrying a fixed rate of interest of 8.48%.

In respect of the NDSO scheme, both basic and super options can be granted.
Basic options are exercisable three years after they have been granted and only if the companys normalised earnings per share excluding exceptional items over any three-year period have exceeded the growth in the RPI by an average of at least 3% per annum.
Super options are exercisable after five years and only if the companys normalised earnings per share excluding exceptional items over any five-year period have exceeded the growth in the RPI by an average of at least 7.5% per annum.
