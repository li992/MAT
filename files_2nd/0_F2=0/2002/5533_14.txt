NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS at 30 September 2002 1 Accounting Policies Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified to include the revaluation of properties and have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
Prior year adjustment From 1 October 2001 the Group has adopted FRS 19: Deferred Tax which requires full provision to be made for deferred tax arising from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in the tax computation.
In adopting FRS 19, the Group has chosen not to discount deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The comparative figures for 2001 have been restated to reflect the impact of FRS 19.
Consequently, shareholders funds for the Group have been reduced by 26.7 million to reflect the recognition of the net provision of deferred tax, net of a reduction in current taxation liabilities of 9.2 million to avoid the double recognition of certain potential tax liabilities now included within the deferred tax provision.
The impact of FRS 19 has also been to increase the tax charge and reduce the profit after tax by 5.9m for the current financial year.
The restated comparatives for the prior year have the effect of increasing the tax charge by 4.5m and reducing the profit after tax by the same amount.
Last years deferred tax liability has been restated as 35.9m from nil as originally reported.
The impact on reserves at 1 October 2000 is 22.2m and the impact on the Profit and Loss Account for the year ended 30 September 2001 is 4.5m.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of Enterprise Inns plc and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 30 September each year.
No profit and loss account is presented for Enterprise Inns plc as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
The Group profit and loss account and cash flow statement include the results and cash flows of each acquisition from the date on which control passes to the Group.
Undertakings, other than subsidiary undertakings, in which the Group has an investment and over which it is in a position to exercise a significant influence are treated as associated undertakings.
The Group accounts include the appropriate share of Warwickshire Hotels Limited and The Unique Pub Company Limited previously Coinmajor Limited results and reserves.
Interest rate swaps The Groups criteria for accounting for interest rate swaps as hedges are: The instrument must be related to an asset or a liability: and It must change the character of the interest rate by converting a variable rate to a fixed rate or vice versa.
Interest differentials are recognised by accruing with net interest payable.
Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value or shown on the Group balance sheet at the year end.
If they are terminated early, the gain loss is spread over the remaining maturity of the original instrument.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of consideration over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 October 1998 was written off against reserves.
Goodwill previously eliminated against reserves has not been reinstated on implementation of FRS 10.
Positive goodwill arising on acquisitions since 1 October 1998 is capitalised, classified as an asset on the Balance Sheet and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life up to a presumed maximum of 20 years.
It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If a subsidiary is subsequently sold, any goodwill arising on acquisition that was written off directly to reserves or that has not been amortised through the Profit and Loss Account is taken into account in determining the profit or loss on disposal.
26 ENTERPRISE INNS ANNUAL REPORT 2002 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS at 30 September 2002 Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Expenditure on additions and improvements to tangible fixed assets is capitalised as the expenditure is incurred.
Substantially all of the Groups licensed estate are valued each year reflecting their trading potential on an existing use basis.
Surpluses arising from the professional valuation of the licensed estate are taken direct to the revaluation reserve.
Valuation surpluses realised on sale are transferred from the revaluation reserve to the profit and loss account reserve.
Any deficit arising from the professional valuation of properties is taken direct to the revaluation reserve until the carrying amount reaches historical cost and, thereafter, to the extent that the value in use can be demonstrated to be higher than valuation.
Any other deficit arising is charged to the profit and loss account.
It is the Companys policy to maintain the properties comprising the licensed estate in such a condition that the residual values of the properties, based on prices prevailing at the time of acquisition or subsequent revaluation, are at least equal to their book values.
Having regard to this, it is the opinion of the directors that depreciation of any such property as required by the Companies Act 1985 and generally accepted accounting practice would not be material.
An annual impairment review is carried out on such properties.
Short leasehold properties, defined as properties with 50 years or less of the lease remaining unexpired, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the unexpired lease term.
Depreciation is provided on all other categories of tangible fixed assets over 3 to 5 years on a straight-line basis.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Assets held for resale Assets held for resale are stated at the lower of cost incurred and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred on disposal.
Deferred taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
FRS 19 Deferred Taxation was issued on 7 December 2000 and is mandatory for years ending on or after 23 January 2002.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date, with the following exceptions: Provision is made for gains on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets only where, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding commitment to dispose of the replacement assets with no likely subsequent rollover or available capital losses.
Provision is made for deferred tax on gains on revalued fixed assets only where there is a commitment to dispose of the revalued assets and the attributable gain can neither be rolled over or eliminated by capital losses.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Pensions The Group makes contributions to employees own pension plans in accordance with the terms of their contracts of employment.

It is also expected that the agreement of the tax computations for certain prior years will result in a release of amounts previously provided and therefore a one-off reduction in the overall tax charge.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on the revaluation of fixed assets or on the sale of properties where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
Such tax would become payable only if the property were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief.
The total amount not provided for is 8.5m 2001 8.5m.
At present, it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
11 Profit attributable to members of the parent company The profit after tax dealt with in the accounts of the parent company was 34.0m 2001 22.4m restated for FRS 19 Deferred Tax.
