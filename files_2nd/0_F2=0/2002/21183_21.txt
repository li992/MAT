Awards vest on the third anniversary of their grant.
The CGNU Integration Incentive Plan relates to the merger of CGU and Norwich Union, and was approved by shareholders at the 2001 Annual General Meeting.
The Plan had two parts a share award aimed at incentivising management to exceed the estimated annualised cost savings to result from integrating the businesses, and a cash-based award aimed at focusing management on the operating performance of the Group or Business Unit as appropriate during the integration process.
The performance conditions relating to both parts of the plan were achieved.
Details are as follows: Share award The performance condition attaching to this part of the plan was to exceed the estimated annualised cost savings of 275 million, which was announced to the market in August 2000, by at least 10%.
The actual annualised cost saving achieved was 317 million whilst the additional one-off cost which arose from generating the increased annualised cost savings was within the target.
As a result of the performance condition being met, the shares referred to in the above table, which were awarded in September 2000, vested in March 2002.
