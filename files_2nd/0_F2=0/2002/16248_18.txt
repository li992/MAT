For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The group has three categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys ordinary shares during the year, those shares which may be issued under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and shares attributable to convertible debt.
No adjustment has been made for the dilutive impact in 2002 as this would decrease reported loss per share.
The impact of dilutive securities in 2002 would be to decrease the loss by 4.1m for convertible debt 2001: 7.6m and to increase weighted average shares by 0.7m shares for employee share options 2001: 1.2m and 43.1m shares for convertible debt 2001: 23.7m.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Objectives, policies and procedures The groups funding, liquidity and exposure to currency and interest rate risk is managed by the groups treasury department.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised by the board and are subject to internal control procedures.
The objective of the framework is to provide flexibility whilst minimising risk and prohibiting speculative transactions or positions to be taken.
Further detail on policies for managing funding requirements, investment of surplus funds and management of risks can be found with the Financial Review.

This debt has been swapped into 6 month US dollar LIBOR plus an average of 2.5 per cent to the maturity date of the debt.
In addition, the group had interest rate swaps to classify as floating rate in the above table of 108.7m of the outstanding 113.1m 2009 US loan notes.
The loan notes have been swapped into 6 month dollar LIBOR plus an average of 1.89 per cent to the maturity date of the debt.
The counter parties have an option to cancel the swaps every six months first option on 46.6m is 1 July 2003, first option on 62.1m is 1 Jan 2004.
Other floating rate financial liabilities comprise of borrowings which bear interest at rates based on LIBOR minus a margin for each relevant currency for periods between one and six months: and the companys non-equity shares which pay a dividend equal to 75 per cent of 12 month sterling LIBOR.
The total financial liabilities include 13.3m of other creditors falling due after more than one year 2001: 17.0m, the pensions deficit of 90.9m 2001: 41.0m with maturity of greater than five years, 55.3m of vacant property provisions 2001: 37.8m with an average maturity of 3.7 years and 0.6m of non-equity shareholding comprising of B shares outstanding 2001: 12.2m.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued b Financial Assets continued The groups two US dollar senior unsecured loan notes carry interest rates that are significantly in excess of market rates.
As stated in the Financial Review the group has redeemed $75m of these bonds early in order to reduce the groups net interest exposure.
To achieve a higher level of redemption without making a significant early redemption payment, the group has entered into the following transactions that have a similar economic effect to redeeming the bonds.
In 2002, the group has purchased US$205m of credit linked notes from a number of counterparties, these notes having similar maturities to the US dollar loan notes.
The notes pay interest at an average rate of LIBOR plus 267 basis points per annum.
$120m of these variable flows have then been swapped into fixed rate flows of between 6.86 per cent and 8.1 per cent per annum as a hedge against the 7.25 per cent and 7.75 per cent per annum fixed coupon payments on the US dollar loan notes.
In return for paying interest on the credit linked notes at rates in excess of LIBOR the final redemption to be received by the company is determined by certain circumstances related to the credit risk of the company.
These circumstances arise if there has been a credit event as defined in the terms of the note, in which case the counterparties may redeem the notes at less than par value.
A credit event arises in the event of any of the following circumstances: a bankruptcy of the company: if the group is required by any of its lenders to accelerate repayment of borrowings: if the group fails to make payment under any of its borrowings: if the group restructures any of its borrowings in order to avoid default: if any of its borrowings are repudiated, disaffirmed or rejected or subject to any moratorium.
If a credit event should take place, the credit linked note may not necessarily be redeemed for cash.
The company may receive its own bonds or debt obligations with a par value equivalent to the amount of the credit linked notes from the counterparties in settlement of redemption of the note.

Non-interest bearing financial assets comprise other fixed asset investments for which there is no maturity.
c Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following tables provide a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001.
The fair value of US dollar private placements included in long-term borrowings was calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at risk adjusted interest rates.
Market values obtained from third parties have been used to determine the fair value of interest rate swaps, credit linked notes, forward foreign exchange contracts, the fixed rate convertible bonds and the US dollar senior loan.
The fair value of cash at bank and deposits approximates to their book value due to their short maturity.
Listed investments are valued at market value.
For all other financial assets and liabilities the carrying amount has been used.

Net foreign currency transaction risks are hedged as they arise, generally using forward foreign exchange contracts, whilst foreign currency borrowings are used to provide an economic hedge against investments in overseas territories.
The groups policy for accounting for hedges can be found in the Group accounting policies section of this report.
The tables below show the extent to which the group has unrecognised gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning and end of the year.
All the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged transactions or positions.

The provision in respect of these obligations at 31 December 2002 has been determined following external professional advice and will be utilised over the period of the leases in question, which range from 1 to 16 years.
The increase in the provision during the year is a result of additional reorganisation and restructuring of the group during 2002 and the consequent reduction in the groups overall property requirements.

OTHER PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES AND CHARGES continued Liabilities arising from former financial services activities A subsidiary of the group was formerly engaged in the selling of personal pensions prior to 1996.
As a result of the industry-wide review into pension misselling by the Personal Investment Authority, the group is exposed to actual and potential future claims by investors in respect of policies found to have been missold.
Although work is now progressing with respect to the identification and review of all pension policies sold, the number and amount of such claims can not be finally determined until all potential compensation costs have been agreed.
The amount of the provisions at 31 December 2002 has been determined on the basis of independent financial advice.

On 23 April 2001, each of the existing 507,901,885 ordinary shares of 25 pence then in issue were sub-divided into one share of 8 23 44 pence B Shares and one share of 16 21 44 pence and immediately following such sub-division every issued share of 16 21 44 pence was sub-divided into 29 shares of 25 44p.
Every 44 shares of 25 44 pence each resulting from such sub-division were then consolidated into one ordinary share of 25p.
The subdivision created a class of B shares with a total value of approximately 1.25 billion.
UK shareholders had the option to sell these shares for 245 pence per share, to receive a single dividend of 245 pence per share, or to retain the B shares and receive a continuing dividend linked to LIBOR.
During the year ended 31 December 2002, 2,934,255 B shares were purchased by the company for consideration of 7.1m.
Cumulatively to 31 December 2002, 367,871,303 B shares have been purchased by the company for consideration of 901.3m.
At 31 December 2002, 7,546,387 B shares remain in issue.
However, the company has the authority to convert, at its option, all remaining B shares in issue after 23 April 2011, if the number is less than 125m.
The conversion into ordinary shares will be based on the market price of ordinary shares at the time of the conversion.
B Shares B shareholders are entitled to a non-cumulative preference dividend based on the principal of 245 pence per share.
The dividend is the lower of 25 per cent per annum or 75 per cent of the 12 month LIBOR rate.
On winding up, the B shareholders are entitled to 245 pence per share and the relevant proportion of the dividends outstanding.
B shareholders do not have any voting entitlements except in a resolution relating to a winding up of the company or if the B share dividend has been outstanding for more than six months.
B shares are therefore regarded as non-equity shares.
Deferred Shares Deferred shareholders may receive a dividend only after B share dividends and an ordinary dividend of a minimum of 50.0 per share has been paid.
On winding up, the Deferred shareholders are entitled to receive repayment up to the nominal value if there are sufficient funds available after paying the B shareholders 245 pence and any proportion of the preference dividend owing to them and paying ordinary shareholders 100,000 per share.
