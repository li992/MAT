1 Accounting policies continued j Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill is capitalised and amortised through the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over its useful economic life up to a presumed maximum of 20 years.
The Directors consider the carrying value of goodwill and make appropriate adjustments to reflect the disposal of certain of the assets to which it relates.
Where goodwill is impaired the charge is taken to the profit and loss account.
k Leases Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the lease.
The cost of assets held under finance leases is included within tangible fixed assets and depreciation is provided in accordance with the policy for the class of asset concerned.
The corresponding obligations under these leases are shown as creditors.
The finance charge element of rentals is charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
l Financial instruments The financial costs of debt instruments are held at cost and are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
