31 Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2002 Notes to the accounts 1 Principal accounting policies a Accounting convention The Accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The Company has adopted FRS17, 18 and 19 for the year ended 27 April 2002 and for year ended 28 April 2001.
The adoption of FRS17 and 18 has not had a material impact on the Companys results, net assets or shareholders funds.
The transitional disclosures associated with the adoption of FRS17 have been applied.
The adoption will not be required until the reporting period ended April 2004.
Under the original policy the charge for the year ended 27 April 2002 would have been 15,594,000 year ended 28 April 2001: 12,837,000.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements.
b Turnover Turnover represents the value of goods sold to customers excluding value added tax.
c Depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of fixed assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2% p. a.
Short leasehold buildings Length of lease Fixtures and fittings 10% to 15% p. a.
Plant and machinery 10% to 15% p. a.
Motor vehicles 25% p. a. Freehold land is not depreciated.
d Stock Stock is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
e Deferred taxation The Company has adopted FRS19 in full.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when on the basis of all available evidence it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not discounted.
f Leased assets Assets financed by leasing agreements that give rights approximating to ownership are held under finance leases and included in tangible fixed assets and depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the period of the lease.
Rentals are apportioned between reductions in the capital obligations included in creditors and those amounts relating to finance charges, which are charged to the profit and loss account at a constant periodic rate of charge.
All operating lease rentals are written off to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Income under operating leases is credited to the profit and loss on a receivable basis.
g Pensions The Company operates a defined benefit pension scheme.
The cost of providing pension benefits is spread over the expected working lives of pension scheme members.
The Company also operates a defined contribution scheme, contributions to which are charged against profits as they become payable.
h Accounting for new stores Benefits received as incentives to sign leases, in the form of reverse premiums and post-opening rent free periods, are spread on a straight line basis over the period to the first rent review.
Pre-opening costs are expensed to the profit and loss account as incurred.
i Foreign currency The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rate of exchange during the period and the balance sheet at the rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of opening net assets are dealt with through reserves.
In addition, exchange differences between the results translated at an average rate and a closing rate are dealt with through reserves.
2 Segmental analysis Turnover is attributable to carpet retailing activities in the UK and Southern Ireland.
No analysis of turnover, operating profit or net assets is shown because Southern Ireland does not represent a material part of the results or assets.

18 Contingent liabilities There were no contingent liabilities requiring disclosure at the year end 2001: nil.
19 Pensions costs The Company operates a pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company, being invested in a Managed Fund operated by the Clerical Medical Investment Group.
The contributions are determined by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent actuarial review was at 6 April 1999 when the market value of the fund was 3,154,536 excluding the value of any Additional Voluntary Contributions and at which date the actuarial value of the assets represented 106% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are that the yield on the fund exceeds salary increases by 2% per annum and that immediate annuities can be bought at rates with an underlying interest rate of 8%.
An actuarial review as at 6 April 2002 is in preparation at the date of this report.
The contributions of the Company and employees were 12.6% and 5% of earnings respectively.
Contributions totalling 38,221 2001: 38,005 are included in creditors and have been paid to the fund since the year end.
The transitional disclosures with the adoption of FRS17 Retirement Benefits have been applied for the period ended 27 April 2002.
The requirements of FRS17 are that a pension scheme deficit must be applied against distributable reserves.
The adoption of the standard is not required until the Companys reporting period ending April 2004.
The actuarial valuation was updated to 27 April 2002 by a qualified actuary and is reported below.
The major assumptions used for this update were: 27 April 2002 1 Rate of increase in salaries 3 2% Discount rate 6% 1 Inflation assumption 2 2% 38 Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2002 Notes to the accounts 19 Pensions costs continued The assets to the scheme and the expected rate of return were: Expected rate of return 2002 % 000 Equities 8.00 3,483 Bonds 6.00 404 Cash 3.50 150 Property 6.50 153 Total market value of assets 4,190 2002 000 Total market value of assets 4,190 Present value of scheme liabilities 5,200 Deficit in the scheme 1,010 Related deferred tax asset 303 Net pension scheme liability 707 The net pension scheme liability under FRS17 would reduce Company reserves under the adoption of the standard.
In addition, the Company also operates a defined contribution pension scheme which employees have the right to join on request after fulfilling the eligibility conditions.
Contributions are made by the employees which, up to an upper limit, are matched by the Company.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company and are invested by the National Provident Institution.
The contribution by the Company for the year was 427,786 2001: 354,625.
Contributions totalling 83,201 2001: 68,958 are included in creditors and have been paid to the scheme since the year end.
