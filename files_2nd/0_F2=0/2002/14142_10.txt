2002 notes to the financial statements.
1 Accounting policies a Basis of presentation The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, consistent with prior years except as detailed below, and comply with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
Where changes in policy or presentation are made, comparative gures are adjusted accordingly.
b New accounting standards and changes in accounting policies FRS 17 Retirement Benets is applicable to the Group for the first time this year.
As permitted, the Group has elected to apply the transitional arrangements for adoption of the FRS.
Accordingly, no change has been made to the accounting policy for retirement benets but included in these financial statements are the additional disclosures required by FRS 17 as at 31 March 2002 see note 12.
FRS 18 Accounting Policies has been adopted in the current year but this did not require any change in accounting policy.
FRS 19 Deferred Taxation has been adopted for the first time in these financial statements.
As required by the standard, deferred tax has been calculated using the full provision approach rather than the partial provision approach previously employed.
This change has been dealt with as a prior year adjustment and previously reported gures have been restated accordingly.
The reported profit for the year ended 31 March 2001 has been reduced by 0.4m and shareholders funds at 31 March 2001 have been reduced by 8.0m.
Expenditure incurred on long term engineering works at United Kingdom landll sites has been classied as tangible xed assets in 2002.
Previously this expenditure had been classed as a prepayment debtor.
A prior year adjustment has been made to increase the cost of tangible xed assets by 12.5m and accumulated depreciation by 8.4m as at 31 March 2001 with a corresponding decrease to prepayments of 4.1m.
The depreciation charge for 2001 has been increased by 4.2m offset by a reduction to other cost of sales.
There was no net impact on the reported profits for 2001.
The Directors believe that the revised classication more appropriately reects the nature of the expenditure which is then amortised over the relevant usage at the landll site.
c Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Shanks Group plc and all its subsidiary undertakings subsidiaries together with their share of the results of joint ventures.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or sold during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements up to, or from, the date control passes.
d Joint ventures The Groups share of joint ventures results are included in the consolidated profit and loss account.
The Groups share of gross assets and liabilities are shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
e Turnover Turnover represents the invoiced value of waste streams processed and other services provided including landll tax but excluding sales taxes.
Turnover is recognised when processing occurs or when the service is provided.
f Retirement benets The cost of providing retirement pensions and related benets is charged to the profit and loss account over the expected working lives of the pension scheme members currently in service.
For dened benefit schemes, any differences between the actuarial valuation of the schemes and the value of the assets in the schemes are also charged or credited to the profit and loss account over the expected working lives of the scheme members.
Differences between the amount charged in the profit and loss account and payments to the dened benefit schemes are treated as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet.
g Research and development Expenditure on research and development is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
2002 33 notes to the financial statements.
continued 1 Accounting policies continued h Exceptional items Exceptional items are those items that need to be disclosed because of their size or incidence.
Normally these items are included in operating profit unless they are material and represent profits or losses on the sale or closure of an operation, costs of a fundamental reorganisation or restructuring, or profits and losses on the disposal of xed assets.
In these cases the items are shown separately in the profit and loss account after operating profit.
i Goodwill Goodwill arises when the cost of acquiring subsidiaries and businesses exceeds the fair value attributed to the net assets acquired.
Capitalised goodwill is written off over its useful life in accordance with FRS 10.
For goodwill arising in respect of businesses operating under long term Private Finance Initiative contracts the goodwill is written off over the term of the contract, which may exceed 20 years.
The profit or loss on disposal or closure of a business is calculated after taking into account any associated goodwill including amounts previously written off to reserves prior to the adoption of FRS 10. j Fixed assets Tangible xed assets are stated at cost less depreciation, except for freehold land which is not depreciated, and less provision for any impairment.
i Buildings, plant and equipment: Depreciation is provided on these assets to write off their cost by equal annual instalments over the expected useful economic lives.
The expected useful life of buildings is 25 to 50 years.
Plant and equipment lives are: Computer equipment 1 to 3 years Mobile plant 5 years Generation equipment 8 to 15 years Heavy goods vehicles 8 to 10 years Other items 3 to 20 years ii Landll sites: Acquisition, commissioning costs, engineering works and the discounted cost of final site restoration are capitalised.
These costs are written off over the operational life of each site based on the amount of void space consumed.
k Leased assets i Finance leases: Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a leased asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
Leased assets are included in tangible xed assets at the total of the capital elements of the payments during the lease term and the corresponding obligation is included in creditors.
Depreciation is provided to write off the assets over the shorter of the lease term or expected useful life.
ii Operating leases: All leases other than finance leases are treated as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account in the year to which they relate.
The obligation to pay future rentals on operating leases is shown in note 27 to the financial statements.
l Stocks Stocks are valued at the lower of cost, on a first in first out basis, and net realisable value.
m Government grants and subsidies Capital related government grants are released to profit evenly over the expected useful lives of the assets to which they relate.
Revenue grants and subsidies are credited in the same period as the items to which they relate.
2002 1 Accounting policies continued n Unprocessed waste The accrual for the cost of treating unprocessed waste is calculated at the higher of sales value and processing cost.
o Site restoration provision Full provision is made for the net present value NPV of the Groups unavoidable costs in relation to restoration liabilities at its landll sites and this value is capitalised as a xed asset.
In addition the Group continues to provide for the NPV of intermediate restoration costs over the life of its landll sites, based on the quantity of waste deposited in the year.
p Aftercare provision Provision is made for the NPV of post closure costs based on the quantity of waste deposited in the year.
Similar costs incurred during the operating life of the sites are written off directly to the profit and loss account and not charged to the provision.
q Onerous leases provision Where the Group has leased property which is surplus to current requirements and it is unable to reassign the benets of the lease, a provision is made for the NPV of the future cash ows relating to the property.
Future income is only incorporated in the cash ows to the extent that it is virtually certain.
r Discounting All long term provisions for restoration, aftercare and onerous leases are calculated based on the NPV of estimated future costs.
The effects of ination and unwinding of the discount element on existing provisions are reected within the financial statements as a finance charge.
The real discount factor currently applied is 2%.
s Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided in full in respect of timing differences arising between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax assets in respect of trading tax losses are only recognised where the tax losses are expected to be recovered.
Deferred taxation provisions have not been discounted.
t Foreign currencies Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the year end exchange rates or at the rate contracted if forward cover has been arranged.
Transactions and the results of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures in foreign currencies are recorded at the average rate of exchange for the year or at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Exchange differences on these and other trading transactions in foreign currency are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures, together with the capitalised goodwill and goodwill previously written off to reserves, are translated into sterling at the balance sheet date.
This exchange rate gain or loss is offset against the translation gain or loss on currency borrowings to the extent that they have been taken out to fund the acquisition.
The net gain or loss is dealt with through reserves.
u Financial instruments The disclosures required by FRS 13 are shown in note 20 to the financial statements.
The Group does not include short term debtors and creditors in these disclosures as permitted by FRS 13. shanks.

11 Pensions current SSAP 24 basis United Kingdom The Groups principal funded dened benefit scheme is the Shanks Group Pension Scheme the Scheme which covers eligible UK employees.
Pension costs are determined by an independent qualied actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
The Group pensions charge for the year was 2.2m 2001: 2.1m.
The most recent actuarial valuation at 5 April 2000 showed that the market value of the Schemes assets was 52.1m and that those assets represented 117% of the value of the benets that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The actuarial surplus is being spread over the average remaining life of the current employees.
There are two categories of employee benets and contributions, known as staff and operatives sections.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the rate of return on investments and to the rate of increase in salaries.
It was assumed that the investment returns would be 2% per annum higher than the growth in pensionable pay.
It was further assumed that pensions in payment for the staff section would increase at 3% per annum compound in respect of pension earned prior to 5 April 1997 and 2.6% per annum for later service.
It was also assumed that the pensions in payment for the operatives section would remain level for pensions earned before 5 April 1997 except for guaranteed minimum pensions for the period from 6 April 1988 to 5 April 1997 and would increase at 2.6% per annum for service thereafter.
Overseas Local pension arrangements for employees exist in Belgium and the Netherlands.
The total cost arising in the year for overseas pensions was 2.0m 2001: 1.4m.
2002 12 Pensions FRS 17 basis Whilst the Group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs, under FRS 17 Retirement Benets the transitional disclosures set out below are required.
United Kingdom The most recent actuarial valuations of the dened benefit pension schemes operated by the Group have been updated by independent qualied actuaries to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31 March 2002.
The main assumptions for FRS 17 purposes for the three schemes were as follows: Group Discount rate 6.1% Future salary growth 4.3% Rate of increase in pensions payment 2.7% to 3.3% Rate of price ination 2.8% The assumptions used by the independent qualed actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions.
The fair value of the dened benefit schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash ow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, as at 31 March 2002 are set out below: Expected long term rate of return Group % pa m Equities 8.0 39.9 Government bonds 5.3 6.7 With-profits insurance contract 7.1 3.2 Cash 3.5 2.9 Total market value of assets 52.7 Present value of scheme liabilities 58.2 Net deficit in the schemes 5.5 Related deferred tax asset 1.7 Net pension liability 3.8 FRS 17 for accounting purposes at 31 March 2002 indicates a net deficit of 5.5m.
As set out in note 11 the most recent actuarial valuation of the Groups principal dened benfet scheme, the Shanks Group Pension Scheme, indicated a surplus with a funding level of 117% at 5 April 2000.
The assumptions used in this valuation would have been acceptable under FRS 17 if it had applied at 5 April 2000. shanks.
2002 41 notes to the financial statements.
continued 12 Pensions FRS 17 basis continued If the net pension liabilty had been recognised in the financial statements, the Groups net assets and profit and loss reserve at 31 March 2002 would be as follows: Group m Net assets excluding pension liablity 140.7 Net pension liability 3.8 Net assets including pension liability 136.9 profit and loss reserve excluding pension liability 24.3 Net pension liability 3.8 profit and loss reserve including pension liability 20.5 Overseas For the Netherlands, employees are members of an industry wide dened benefit pension scheme.
It is not possible to separately identify the Groups share of the assets and liabilities of that scheme and, as permitted by FRS 17, the scheme is treated as a dened contribution pension scheme.
For Belgium, the Group operates a small dened contribution scheme.
13 Result for the year The profit for the year in the financial statements of the Company is 15.7m 2001: 9.3m.

In addition to the above the Group also purchased the minority interest held in a subsidiary undertaking, Andre fide Vriendt s. a. for 0.5m cash.
This gave rise to 0.2m of capitalised goodwill.
During the year the Group completed the evaluation of the businesses acquired in the year ended 31 March 2001.
This resulted in a decrease in fair value of 0.8m in respect of additional pre-acquisition liabilities recognised at N. V. fide Beer & Partners fide Paepe.
The corresponding increase to goodwill is 0.8m.
No adjustments arose in respect of the other acquisitions for that year.
