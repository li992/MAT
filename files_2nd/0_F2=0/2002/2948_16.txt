54 3 EMPLOYEE NUMBERS, REMUNERATION AND PENSION COSTS CONTINUED b Pension costs under SSAP 24 The Group operates a number of funded defined benefit and defined contribution schemes in its principal locations.
Pension costs for the defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with actuarial advice and are charged to the profit and loss account so as to recognise the cost over the working lifetime of the employees.
Actuarial valuations of these schemes have been carried out by independent actuaries in accordance with local legislative requirements.
The accounting and funding policies differ to the extent that funding valuations may be based on more conservative assumptions and surpluses and deficits may be recognised more quickly for funding purposes.
Details of the assumptions and methods used, for accounting purposes, for the main schemes are given below: Principal Actuarial Assumptions Average Latest Full Valuation Investment Average Average Fund Assets Valuation of Assets Pension Actuarial Method Rate of Salary Pension Spreading Accrued Fund Valuation Actuarial Market Adopted Return Increases Increases Method Benefits Carlton Group 1 July 2001 105.7m 105.7m Projected Unit 6.0% 4.0% 2.53.0% Level % pay 93.5% Central 31 March 2002 247.5m 247.5m Attained age 5.76.7% 3.8% 3.6% Straight line 96.0% HTV 1 August 2000 108.6m 108.6m Attained age 5.56.5% 4.8% 2.8% Level % pay 109.0% In view of the difficult market conditions, the triennial valuation of the Central scheme was brought forward.
The figures above are based on the draft valuation which is expected to be approved by the Trustees on 17 December 2002.
In accordance with SSAP 24 the charge against profits in 2002 of 2.5m reflects the proposed increase in contributions from 1 April 2002 to eliminate the schemes current deficit.
The net pension cost of the defined benefit schemes was 7.6m 2001: 2.3m.
The net pension cost of the defined contribution schemes was 0.4m 2001: 0.5m.
At 30 September 2002 accrued pension costs were 4.6m 2001: 1.4m.
Cash contributions and charges against profits relating to the defined benefit schemes are shown below: Actual Forecast 2002 2003 Pension Fund m m Carlton Group Cash contributions 3.8 4.2 % contributions 9.1% 10.0% Charge against profits 4.1 4.2 Central Cash contributions 0.1 4.4 % contributions n a 27.0% Charge against profits 2.5 4.4 HTV Cash contributions 1.0 1.0 % contributions 20.7% 20.7% Charge against profits 1.0 1.0 Total Cash contributions 4.9 9.6 Charge against profits 7.6 9.6 55 3 EMPLOYEE NUMBERS, REMUNERATION AND PENSION COSTS CONTINUED c Pensions disclosures under FRS 17 transitional requirements Under the transitional requirements of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, the impact that the new accounting standard would have had on the accounts, had it been adopted in the year, is disclosed below.
The full actuarial valuations as shown in note 3 b above have been updated to 30 September 2002 by qualified independent actuaries in accordance with FRS 17.

This does not necessarily result in an increase in cash contributions.
Details of experience gains and losses for the year to 30 September 2002 Difference between the expected and actual return on schemes assets: Amount m 54.0 Percentage of schemes assets 15% Experience gains and losses on schemes liabilities: Amount m 24.0 Percentage of the present value of schemes liabilities 5% Total amount recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses: Amount m 104.1 Percentage of the present value of schemes liabilities 22% 4 EXCEPTIONAL OPERATING ITEMS In 2002 there were exceptional reorganisation and restructuring costs of 2.8m, asset write-downs of 7.1m and a goodwill impairment of 3.9m offset by 18.6m of litigation net income.
A tax credit of 2.0m arises on these items.
In 2001 there were exceptional reorganisation and restructuring costs of 58.6m, mainly relating to digital business closures and downsizing.
A tax credit of 2.1m arose on these items.

The 2001 results have been restated to include ITV Digital and ITV Sport Channel and other digital media businesses in discontinued operations.
The tax credit reflects the offset by consortium or other relief of discontinued operations losses against profits in continuing operations.

The weighted average time for which the rate is fixed on these Preference shares has been calculated on the assumption that the Company redeems the shares at the earliest opportunity.
Sterling fixed rate liabilities in 2002 relate to finance lease creditors see note 23.
Sterling floating rate borrowing mainly comprises the @638.6m Exchangeable bond which was swapped with effect from May 2002 from its fixed rate cost of 2.25% into a floating rate cost of 1 month sterling Libor minus 2.81% on a notional amount of 394.9m until January 2005 and 46.5m private placement loan notes issued under the 1,000m Euro Medium Term Note programme.
The private placement loan notes have been issued in a range of currencies and swapped back to sterling to give a financing cost ranging between 6 month Libor plus 0.19% and 0.48%.
Dollar floating rate borrowing comprises the 200m and 250m Eurobonds see note 21 and the US$150m Exchangeable Capital Securities see note 22 which have been swapped into floating rate dollars as follows: The sterling bonds were swapped with effect from June 2001 200m bond and September 2001 250m bond from their fixed rates of 7.625% and 5.625% respectively into 6 month dollar Libor plus 0.75% but payable in sterling subject to a knock-in commencing from December 2002 200m bond and September 2002 250m bond such that if the 6 month dollar rate fixing is at or below 3.75% there is no net swap payment or receipt relating to that 6 month period only.
In addition both sterling bonds have been swapped for a period of 3 years commencing December 2001 and September 2001 respectively from 6 month dollar Libor plus 0.75% to 6 month dollar Libor plus 0.415% and 0.42% respectively set in arrears if the rate setting at the start of the relevant 6 month period is above 3.75%.
Under the swap terms the bank also has the option commencing from December 2004 for the 200m bond and September 2004 for the 250m bond to choose between the floating rate cost of 6 month dollar Libor plus 0.75% or 6 month sterling Libor minus 0.1% either being set in advance or in arrears if the dollar rate setting at the start of the relevant 6 month period is above 3.75%.
In addition with effect from March 2002 for any dollar rate settings in advance above 6.5% the margin under the swap is increased by an additional 1% for that 6 month period only.
Finally with effect from September 2002 the 250m bond has been swapped into 6 month dollar Libor plus 1.075% plus a further potential additional margin but payable in sterling including if the dollar rate setting in advance for any given 6 month period is at or below 3.75%.
Further potential additional margin to be applied with effect from September 2002 arises to the extent that on a one for one basis the 1 year dollar swap rate observed on 5 November 2003 exceeds each of the strike levels of 4.0%, 4.5% and 5.0% on 125m notional and to the extent that on a one for one basis the 1 year dollar swap rate observed on 17 December 2003 exceeds each of the strike levels of 3.8%, 4.05% and 4.25% on 125m notional.
As at 30 September 2002 the implied 1 year dollar swap rates on 5 November 2003 and 17 December 2003 were 2.68% and 2.79%.
The Group entered into a cancellable swap with effect from February 1999 with a potential maturity of October 2028 which is matched against the US$150m Exchangeable Capital Securities.
Under the swap the Group receives 8% to match the coupon on the securities and pays the higher of 7.25% or 3 month dollar Libor plus 0.25%.
For all periods to date this resulted in a payment of 7.25%.
The payment basis of the swap was amended with effect from September 2002 to 3 month dollar Libor plus 2.65% set in arrears or advance at the banks option.
The swap is cancellable at the banks option from October 2003 onwards.
If the bank exercises this option it must pay the Group US$6m.
