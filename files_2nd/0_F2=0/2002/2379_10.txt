In preparing those accounts, the directors are required: To select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.
To make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
To state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the accounts.
To prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group will continue in business.
The directors are also responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The directors confirm that they have complied with these requirements, and, having a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
BP 2002 3 Independent auditors report To the Members of BP p. l. c. We have audited the groups accounts for the year ended 31 December 2002 which comprise the group income statement, balance sheets, group cash flow statement, statement of total recognized gains and losses, accounting policies and related notes 1 to 48.
These accounts have been prepared on the basis of the accounting policies set out therein.
We have also audited the information in the Directors Remuneration Report contained in Annual Report 2002 that is described as having been subject to audit.
This report is made solely to the companys members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the companys members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the companys members as a body, for our audit work, for this report or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts, including the accounts in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards as set out in the statement of directors responsibilities in respect of the accounts.
Our responsibility is to audit the accounts and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report that is subject to audit in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements, United Kingdom Auditing Standards and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the accounts give a true and fair view and whether the accounts and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report that is subject to audit have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors Report, contained in Annual Report 2002, is not consistent with the accounts, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if the information specified by law or the Listing Rules regarding directors remuneration and transactions with the group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement contained in Annual Report 2002 reflects the companys compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the boards statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the groups corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in Annual Report 2002 and Annual Accounts 2002 and consider whether it is consistent with the audited accounts.
This other information comprises the United States Accounting Principles, the supplementary information on oil and natural gas quantities, the five-year summaries, the Directors Report, and the unaudited part of the Directors Remuneration Report.
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any misstatements or material inconsistencies with the accounts.
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the accounts and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report that is subject to audit.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the accounts, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the groups circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the accounts and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report that is subject to audit are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the accounts and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report that is subject to audit.
Opinion In our opinion: the accounts give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the group as at 31 December 2002 and of the profit of the group for the year then ended: and the accounts and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report that is subject to audit have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

For 2001, the profit relates to the sale of the groups interest in Vysis.
The loss on sale of businesses or termination of operations for 2002 represents the loss on disposal of the plastic fabrications business, the loss on disposal of the former Burmah Castrol speciality chemicals business Fosroc Construction, the loss on withdrawal from solar thin film manufacturing and the provision for the loss on divestment of the former Burmah Castrol speciality chemicals businesses Sericol and Fosroc Mining.
The loss during 2001 arose principally from the sale of the groups Carbon Fibers business and the write-off of assets following the closure or exit from certain chemicals activities.
Sale of fixed assets The major part of the profit on the sale of fixed assets during 2002 arises from the divestment of the groups shareholding in Ruhrgas.
The other significant elements of the profit for the year are the gain on the redemption of certain preferred limited partnership interests BP retained following the Altura Energy common interest disposal in 2000 in exchange for BP loan notes held by the partnership, the profit on the sale of the groups interest in the Colonial pipeline in the USA and the profit on the sale of a US downstream electronic payment system.
For 2001, the profit on the sale of fixed assets includes the profit from the divestment of the refineries at Mandan, North Dakota, and Salt Lake City, Utah: the groups interest in the Alliance and certain other pipeline systems in the USA: and BPs interest in the Kashagan discovery in Kazakhstan.
The major element of the loss on sale of fixed assets in 2002 relates to provisions for losses on sale of exploration and production properties in the USA announced in early 2003.
For 2001, the loss on sale of fixed assets arose from a number of transactions.
Additional information on the sale of businesses and fixed assets is given in Note 17 Disposals.

BP 2002 Notes on accounts 15 12 Taxation continued Factors that may affect future tax charges The group earns income in many different countries and, on average, pays taxes at rates higher than the UK statutory rate.
The overall impact of these higher taxes, which include the supplementary charge of 10% on UK North Sea profits, is subject to changes in enacted tax rates and the country mix of the groups income.
However, it is not expected to increase or decrease substantially in the near term.
The major component of timing differences in the current year is accelerated tax depreciation.
Based on current capital investment plans, the group expects to continue to be able to claim tax allowances in excess of depreciation in future years at a level similar to the current year.
The tax charge in 2002 reflected a benefit from non-conventional fuel credits in the USA.
Those credits are no longer available after 31 December 2002.
The effect of the loss of these credits on the overall tax charge is likely to be offset by benefits from restructuring and planning initiatives.
The groups profit before taxation includes stock holding gains or losses.
These gains or losses are not taxed or deductible in certain jurisdictions in which the group operates, and therefore give rise to decreases or increases in the effective tax rate.
However, over the longer term, significant changes in the tax rate would arise only in the event of a substantial and sustained change in oil prices.
The group has around $5.3 billion of carry-forward tax losses in the UK, which would be available to offset against future taxable income.
To date, tax assets have been recognized on $840 million of those losses i. e. to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that suitable taxable income will arise.
It is unlikely that the groups effective tax rate will be significantly affected in the near term by utilization of losses not previously recognized as deferred tax assets.
Carry-forward losses in other taxing jurisdictions have not been recognized as deferred tax assets, and are unlikely to have a significant effect on the groups tax rate in future years.
The impact on the tax rate of acquisition amortization non-deductible depreciation and amortization relating to the fixed asset revaluation adjustments and goodwill consequent upon the ARCO and Burmah Castrol acquisitions is unlikely to change in the near term.

The profit attributable to ordinary shareholders is $6,843 million $6,554 million.
The average number of shares outstanding excludes the shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plans.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders as for basic earnings per share.
However, the number of shares outstanding is adjusted to show the potential dilution if employee share options are converted into ordinary shares.
The number of ordinary shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share may be reconciled as follows: shares thousand 2002 2001 Weighted average number of ordinary shares 22,397,126 22,435,737 Ordinary shares issuable under employee share schemes 107,322 137,988 22,504,448 22,573,725 In addition to basic earnings per share based on the historical cost profit for the year, a further measure, based on replacement cost profit before exceptional items, is provided as it is considered that this measure gives an indication of underlying performance.

ON in two stages.
Veba owns Aral, Germanys biggest fuels retailer.
In February BP paid $1,072 million to subscribe for new shares issued by Veba and acquired $1,520 million of outstanding loans from E. ON to Veba in return for a 51% interest in and operational control of Veba.
In addition, there were acquisition expenses of $30 million.
Subsequently, on 30 June BP paid E. ON a further $2,386 million to acquire the remaining 49% of Veba.
There were further acquisition expenses of $30 million.
The total consideration of $5,038 million is subject to final closing adjustments.
Other transactions in 2002 included buying our co-venturers 15% interest in the ARCO polypropylene joint venture and acquiring the 51% BP did not own in certain Chinese LPG ventures.
All these business combinations have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
The assets and liabilities acquired as part of the 2002 acquisitions are shown in the above table in aggregate.
The identifiable assets and liabilities of Veba were not revalued on the acquisition of the 49% minority interest in June, as the difference between the fair values and the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities was not material.
Additional goodwill of $203 million was recognized on the acquisition of the minority interest in Veba.
Fair values The methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired are set out in the following paragraphs.
Tangible assets The fair value of refineries has been estimated by using earnings multiples derived from other similar transactions.
The fair value of other tangible assets has been estimated by determining the net present value of future cash flows.
Net assets of businesses held for resale The fair value of the net assets reflects the sales proceeds, less attributable taxation.
Finance debt The debt acquired was floating rate debt and had maturity dates of less than one year, so fair value approximates book value.
Other provisions Liabilities for pensions have been estimated by independent actuaries.
The fair values of other assets and liabilities acquired approximate their book value.
Accounting policy alignment The accounting policy alignment adjustments represent the adjustments necessary to restate the balance sheets of the acquired entities to conform with BPs accounting policies under UK GAAP.
The principal adjustments are set out below.
Fixed assets Investments Interests in certain refinery joint ventures were equity accounted by Veba.
Under UK GAAP these interests are accounted for as joint arrangements that are not entities.
Current assets The basis of stock valuation has been changed from last-in first-out to first-in first-out.
Acquisitions in 2001 During the year the group acquired the 50% of Erdlchemie, a petrochemicals business based in Germany, it did not already own.
In addition a number of minor acquisitions were made.
The assets and liabilities acquired as part of the 2001 acquisitions are shown in the above table in aggregate.
The fair value of tangible fixed assets has been estimated by determining the net present value of future cash flows.
No significant adjustments were made to the other acquired assets and liabilities.
18 17 Disposals As part of the strategy to upgrade the quality of its asset portfolio, the group has an active programme to dispose of non-strategic assets.
In the normal course of business in any particular year, the group may sell interests in exploration and production properties, service stations and pipeline interests as well as non-core businesses.
Divestments in 2002 During the year, BP made a number of asset or business disposals.
The major asset transactions during the year included the sale of the groups shareholding in Ruhrgas, the sale of a US downstream electronic payment system, the groups interest in the Colonial pipeline in the USA, the refinery at Yorktown, Virginia, and the redemption of certain preferred partnership interests BP retained following the disposal in 2000 of the Altura Energy common interest in exchange for BP loan notes held by the partnership.
The group entered into sale and leaseback transactions for certain chemicals manufacturing facilities in the UK, a solar manufacturing facility in Spain and an LNG tanker.
In addition BP sold two-thirds of its interest in the European ethylene pipeline company, ARG, in accordance with EU Commission requirements in relation to the Veba acquisition.
BP closed its polypropylene production facility at Cedar Bayou, Texas, a high density polyethylene unit at Deer Park, Texas, and one of four polypropylene units at Chocolate Bayou, Texas.
BP sold its plastic fabrications business, Fosroc Construction, its UK contract energy management business and its downstream retail businesses in Cyprus and Japan.
The group also announced its withdrawal from solar thin film manufacturing.
Divestments in 2001 The major transactions in 2001 included the sale of the groups interest in the Kashagan discovery in Kazakhstan: the divestment of the refineries at Mandan, North Dakota, and Salt Lake City, Utah: the sale of interests in the Alliance and certain other pipeline systems in the USA: and the disposal of the groups majority interest in Vysis.
At 31 December 2000, the Foseco, Fosroc Construction, Fosroc Mining and Sericol speciality chemicals businesses that were acquired as part of the Burmah Castrol acquisition were categorized as businesses held for resale.
Fosroc Construction was sold in late 2002 and the sales of the remaining two businesses were announced in January 2003.
These three businesses were consolidated from 1 July 2001 until their disposal.
A number of chemicals activities were either sold or terminated during 2001.
Included in the businesses sold was the Carbon Fibers business.
The group reduced its investment in Lukoil, which was acquired as part of the ARCO acquisition, from 7% to 4% through the sale of 23.5 million shares.
To fulfil undertakings given to the European Commission at the time of the ARCO acquisition, BP sold certain UK Southern North Sea natural gas interests in April 2001.

These include the management of the currency, maturity and interest rate profile of finance debt, cash, other significant financial risks and relationships with banks and other financial institutions.
International oil and natural gas trading and risk management relating to business operations are carried out by the groups oil and natural gas trading units.
The main financial risks faced by the group through its normal business activities are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
These risks and the groups approach to dealing with them are discussed below.
Market risk Market risk is the possibility that changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates or oil and natural gas prices will adversely affect the value of the groups financial assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows.
Market risks are managed using a range of derivatives.
The group also trades derivatives in conjunction with these risk management activities.
All derivative activity, whether for risk management or trading, is carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision.
These teams are subject to close financial and management control, meeting generally accepted industry practice and reflecting the principles of the Group of Thirty Global Derivatives Study recommendations.
A Trading Risk Management Committee has oversight of the quality of internal control in the groups trading units.
Independent control functions monitor compliance with BPs policies.
The control framework includes prescribed trading limits that are reviewed regularly by senior management, daily monitoring of risk exposure using valueat-risk principles, marking trading exposures to market and stress testing to assess the exposure to potentially extreme market situations.
For market risk management and trading, conventional exchange-traded derivative instruments such as futures and options are used as well as non-exchange-traded instruments such as swaps, over-the-counter options and forward contracts.
Where derivatives constitute a hedge, the groups exposure to market risk created by the derivative is offset by the opposite exposure arising from the asset, liability, cash flow or transaction being hedged.
By contrast, where derivatives are held for trading purposes, changes in market risk factors give rise to realized and unrealized gains and losses, which are recognized in earnings in the current period.
Currency exchange rates Fluctuations in exchange rates can have significant effects on the groups reported profit.
The effects of most exchange rate fluctuations are absorbed in business operating results through changing cost competitiveness, lags in market adjustment to movements in rates, and conversion differences accounted for on specific transactions.
For this reason the total effect of exchange rate fluctuations is not identifiable separately in the groups reported profit.
The main underlying economic currency of the groups cash flows is the US dollar.
This is because BP's major product, oil, is priced internationally in US dollars.
BPs foreign exchange management policy is to minimize economic and significant transactional exposures arising from currency movements against the US dollar.
The group co-ordinates the handling of foreign exchange risks centrally, by netting off naturally occurring opposite exposures wherever possible, to reduce the risks, and then dealing with any material residual foreign exchange risks.
Significant residual non-dollar exposures are managed using a range of derivatives.
In addition, most group borrowings are in US dollars or are hedged with respect to the US dollar.
Interest rates The group is exposed to interest rate risk on shortand long-term floating rate instruments and as a result of the refinancing of fixed rate finance debt.
Consequently, as well as managing the currency and the maturity of debt, the group manages interest expense through the balance between generally lower-cost floating rate debt, which has inherently higher risk, and generally more expensive, but lower-risk, fixed rate debt.
The group is exposed predominantly to US dollar LIBOR London Inter-Bank Offer Rate interest rates as borrowings are mainly denominated in, or are swapped into, US dollars.
The group uses derivatives to manage the balance between fixed and floating rate debt.
During 2002, the proportion of floating rate debt was in the range 41-60% of total net debt outstanding.
Oil and natural gas prices BPs trading units use financial and commodity derivatives as part of the overall optimization of the value of the groups equity oil production and as part of the associated trading of crude oil, products and related instruments.
They also use financial and commodity derivatives to manage certain of the groups exposures to price fluctuations on natural gas transactions.
BP 2002 Notes on accounts 23 25 Financial instruments continued Credit risk Credit risk is the potential exposure of the group to loss in the event of non-performance by a counterparty.
The credit risk arising from the groups normal commercial operations is controlled by individual operating units within guidelines.
In addition, as a result of its use of derivatives, to manage market risk, the group has credit exposures through its dealings in the financial and specialized oil and natural gas markets.
The group controls the related credit risk by entering into contracts only with highly credit-rated counterparties and through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures, and does not usually require collateral or other security.
Counterparty credit validation, independent of the dealers, is undertaken before contractual commitment.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that suitable sources of funding for the groups business activities may not be available.
The group has long-term debt ratings of Aa1 and AA assigned respectively by Moodys and Standard and Poors.
The group has access to a wide range of funding at competitive rates through the capital markets and banks.
It co-ordinates relationships with banks, borrowing requirements, foreign exchange requirements and cash management centrally.
The group believes it has access to sufficient funding and also has undrawn committed borrowing facilities to meet currently foreseeable borrowing requirements.
At 31 December 2002, the group had substantial amounts of undrawn borrowing facilities available, including committed facilities of $3,600 million expiring in 2003 $3,400 million expiring in 2002.
These facilities are with a number of international banks and borrowings under them would be at pre-agreed rates.
The group expects to renew the facilities on an annual basis.
Certain of these facilities support the groups commercial paper programme.
Financial instruments Financial instruments comprise primary financial instruments cash, fixed and current asset investments, debtors, creditors, finance debt and provisions and derivative financial instruments interest rate contracts, foreign exchange contracts, oil price contracts and natural gas price contracts.
Interest rate contracts include futures contracts, swap agreements and options.
Foreign exchange contracts include forwards, futures contracts, swap agreements and options.
Oil and natural gas price contracts are those that require settlement in cash and include futures contracts, swap agreements and options.
Oil and natural gas price contracts that require physical delivery are not financial instruments.
However, if it is normal market practice for a particular type of oil and natural gas contract, despite having contract terms that require settlement by delivery, to be extinguished other than by physical delivery e. g. by cash payment it is called a cash-settled commodity contract.
Contracts of this type are included with derivatives in the disclosures in Notes 26 and 27.
With the exception of the table of currency exposures shown on page 25, short-term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the groups operations have been excluded from the disclosures contained in this note, as permitted by Financial Reporting Standard No.

The group aims for a balance between floating and fixed interest rates and, in 2002, the proportion of floating rate debt was in the range 41-60% of total net debt outstanding.
Aside from debt issued in the US municipal bond markets, interest rates on floating rate debt denominated in US dollars are linked principally to London Inter-Bank Offer Rate LIBOR, while rates on debt in other currencies are based on local market equivalents.
The group monitors interest rate risk using a process of sensitivity analysis.
Assuming no changes to the finance debt and hedges described above, it is estimated that a change of 1% in the general level of interest rates on 1 January 2003 would change 2003 profit before tax by approximately $130 million.
BP 2002 Notes on accounts 25 25 Financial instruments continued Interest rate swaps and futures are used by the group to modify the interest characteristics of its long-term finance debt from a fixed to a floating rate basis or vice versa.

Fixed asset investments included in the table above are held for the long term and have no maturity period.
They are excluded from the calculation of weighted average time until maturity.
26 26 Derivative financial instruments In the normal course of business the group is a party to derivative financial instruments derivatives with off balance sheet risk, primarily to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including management of the balance between floating rate and fixed rate debt.
The group also manages certain of its exposures to movements in oil and natural gas prices.
In addition, the group trades derivatives in conjunction with these risk management activities.
Risk management Gains and losses on derivatives used for risk management purposes are deferred and recognized in earnings or as adjustments to carrying amounts, as appropriate, when the underlying debt matures or the hedged transaction occurs.
Where such derivatives used for hedging purposes are terminated before the underlying debt matures or the hedged transaction occurs, the resulting gain or loss is recognized on a basis that matches the timing and accounting treatment of the underlying hedged item.
The unrecognized and carried-forward gains and losses on derivatives used for hedging, and the movements therein, are shown in the following table.

This activity is undertaken in conjunction with risk management activities.
Derivatives held for trading purposes are marked-to-market and any gain or loss recognized in the income statement.
For traded derivatives, many positions have been neutralized, with trading initiatives being concluded by taking opposite positions to fix a gain or loss, thereby achieving a zero net market risk.
The following table shows the fair value at 31 December of derivatives and other financial instruments held for trading purposes.
The fair values at the year end are not materially unrepresentative of the position throughout the year.

These techniques are based on a variance covariance model or a Monte Carlo simulation and make a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market values over a 24-hour period.
The calculation of the range of potential changes in fair value takes into account a snapshot of the end-of-day exposures, and the history of one-day price movements over the previous 12 months, together with the correlation of these price movements.
The potential movement in fair values is expressed to three standard deviations which is equivalent to a 99.7% confidence level.
This means that, in broad terms, one would expect to see an increase or a decrease in fair values greater than the value at risk on only one occasion per year if the portfolio were left unchanged.
BP 2002 Notes on accounts 27 26 Derivative financial instruments continued The group calculates value at risk on all instruments that are held for trading purposes and that therefore give an exposure to market risk.
The value-at-risk model takes account of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate forward and futures contracts, swap agreements, options and swaptions, foreign exchange forward and futures contracts, swap agreements and options and oil price futures, swap agreements and options.
Financial assets and liabilities and physical crude oil and refined products that are treated as trading positions are also included in these calculations.
The value-at-risk calculation for oil and natural gas price exposure also includes cash-settled commodity contracts such as forward contracts.
The following table shows values at risk for trading activities.

The fair value of listed fixed asset investments has been determined by reference to market prices.
Current assets Debtors falling due after more than one year The fair value of other debtors due after one year is estimated not to be materially different from its carrying value.
Current assets Investments and cash at bank and in hand The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for unlisted current asset investments and cash at bank and in hand approximates their fair value.
The fair value of listed current asset investments has been determined by reference to market prices.
Finance debt The carrying amount of the groups short-term borrowings, which mainly comprise commercial paper, bank loans and overdrafts, approximates their fair value.
The fair value of the groups long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations is estimated using quoted prices or, where these are not available, discounted cash flow analyses, based on the groups current incremental borrowing rates for similar types and maturities of borrowing.
Creditors Amounts falling due after more than one year Other creditors These liabilities are predominantly interest-free.
In view of the short maturities, the reported carrying amount is estimated to approximate the fair value.
Provisions for liabilities and charges Other provisions Where the liability will not be settled for a number of years the amount recognized is the present value of the estimated future expenditure.
The carrying amount of provisions thus approximates the fair value.
Derivative financial instruments and cash-settled commodity contracts The fair values of the groups interest rate and foreign exchange contracts are based on pricing models that take into account relevant market data.
The fair values of the groups oil and natural gas price contracts futures contracts, swap agreements, options and forward contracts are based on market prices.

Total finance debt includes an asset of $277 million a liability of $264 million for the carrying value of currency swaps and forward contracts.
Included within Other loans repayable within one year are US Industrial Revenue Municipal Bonds of $1,881 million $1,768 million with maturity periods ranging up to 35 years.
They are classified as repayable within one year, as required under UK GAAP, as the bondholders typically have the option to tender these bonds for repayment on interest reset dates.
Any bonds that are tendered are usually remarketed and BP has not experienced any significant repurchases.
BP considers these bonds to represent long-term funding when assessing the maturity profile of its finance debt.
At 31 December 2002, the groups share of third party finance debt of joint ventures and associated undertakings was $457 million $460 million and $849 million $1,136 million respectively.

At 31 December 2002, the provision for the costs of decommissioning these production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives was $4,168 million $3,304 million.
The provision has been estimated using existing technology, at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 2.5% 3%.
These costs are expected to be incurred over the next 30 years.
While the provision is based on the best estimate of future costs and the economic lives of the facilities and pipelines, there is uncertainty regarding both the amount and timing of incurring these costs.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount reasonably determinable.
Generally, this coincides with commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or closure of inactive sites.
The provision for environmental liabilities at 31 December 2002 was $2,122 million $2,098 million.
These costs are expected to be incurred over the next 10 years.
The extent and cost of future remediation programmes are inherently difficult to estimate.
They depend on the scale of any possible contamination, the timing and extent of corrective actions, and also the groups share of liability.
The group also holds provisions for potential future awards under the long-term performance plans, expected rental shortfalls on surplus properties and sundry other liabilities.
To the extent that these liabilities are not expected to be settled within the next three years, the provisions are discounted using a real discount rate of 2.5% 3%.
BP 2002 Notes on accounts 31 31 Called up share capital The companys authorized ordinary share capital remains unchanged at 36 billion shares of 25 cents each, amounting to $9 billion.

BP offers most of its employees the opportunity to acquire a shareholding in the company through savings-related and or matching share plan arrangements.
Such arrangements are now in place in nearly 80 countries.
BP also uses long-term performance plans see Note 36 and the granting of share options as elements of remuneration for executive directors and senior employees.
During 2002, share options were granted to the executive directors under the Executive Directors Incentive Plan EDIP.
For these options the option exercise price was the market value as determined in accordance with the plan rules on the grant date.
The options granted to executive directors reflect BPs performance in terms of total shareholder return TSR, that is, share price increase with all dividends reinvested, relative to the FTSE Global 100 group of companies over the three years preceding the grant.
Options vest over three years one-third each after one, two and three years respectively and have a life of seven years after the grant.
Share options were also granted in 2002 under the BP Share Option Plan to certain categories of employees.
Subject to certain vesting requirements the options are exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant.
There are no performance conditions attaching to the options granted during the year.
Under the BP ShareSave Plan a savings-related share option plan employees save on a monthly basis over a threeor five-year period towards the purchase of shares at a price fixed when the option is granted.
The option price is usually set at a 20% discount to the market price at the time of grant.
The option must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract: otherwise it lapses.
The plan is run in the UK and a small number of other countries.
Under the BP ShareMatch Plan, BP matches employees own contributions of shares, up to a predetermined limit.
The shares are then held in trust for a defined minimum period.
The plan is run in the UK and in over 60 other countries.
BP does not recognize an expense in respect of share options granted to employees.
If the fair value of options granted in any particular year is estimated and this value amortized over the vesting period of the options, an indication of the cost of granting options to employees can be made.
The fair value of each share option granted has been estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: 2002 2001 Risk-free interest rate 4.0% 5.0% Expected volatility 26% 26% Expected life in years 1 to 5 1 to 5 Expected dividend yield 3.75% 3.0% Weighted average fair value of options granted $ 1.64 2.05 The additional expense that would have been recognized in 2002 on this basis would be $90 million $102 million and the impact on earnings per share would be 1 cent 1 cent.
The company sponsors a number of savings plans covering most US employees.
Under these plans, most employees may contribute up to 100% of their salary subject to certain regulatory limits.
Most employees are eligible for a dollar-for-dollar company matched contribution for the first 7% of eligible pay contributed on a before-tax or after-tax basis, or a combination of both.
The precise arrangement may vary in certain business units.
Company contributions are initially invested in a fund primarily comprised of BP ADSs but employees may transfer those amounts and may invest their own contributions in more than 200 investment options.
The companys contributions generally vest over a period of three years.
Company contributions to savings plans during the year were $125 million $125 million.
An Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP was established in 1997 to acquire BP shares to satisfy future requirements of certain employee share plans.
The company provides funding to the ESOP.
The assets and liabilities of the ESOP are recognized as assets and liabilities of the company within the accounts.
The ESOP has waived its rights to dividends.
During 2002, the ESOP released 15,332,235 shares 11,508,754 shares for the matching share plans.
The cost of shares released for these plans has been charged in these accounts.
BP has established a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST to support the UK ShareSave plan.
During the year, contributions of $21 million $36 million were made by the company to the QUEST which, together with option-holder contributions, were used by the QUEST to subscribe for new ordinary shares at market price.
The company has transferred the cost of this contribution directly to retained profits and the excess of the subscription price over nominal value has increased the share premium account.
At 31 December 2002, all the 9,443,842 ordinary shares issued to the QUEST had been transferred to employees exercising options under the UK ShareSave plan.
Under new legislation, the QUEST can no longer be used for ShareSave plans after 31 December 2002.

36 Long term performance plans During 2002, the company operated two long-term performance plans: the Executive Directors Incentive Plan EDIP for executive directors and the Long Term Performance Plan LTPP for senior executives.
Executive directors participated in the LTPP prior to 2002 or to their appointment as an executive director.
Both plans are incentive schemes under which the company may award shares to participants or fund the purchase of shares for participants if long-term targets are met.
Awards were made in 2002 in respect of the 1999-2001 LTPP.
Further details of the plans are given in the directors remuneration report on pages 30 to 39 of Annual Report 2002.
The costs of potential future awards for both the EDIP and LTPP are accrued over the three-year performance periods of each plan.
The amount charged in 2002 was $51 million $80 million.
The value of awards under the 1999-2001 LTPP made in 2002 was $125 million 1998-2000 LTPP $61 million.
Employee Share Ownership Plans ESOPs have been established to acquire BP shares to satisfy any awards made to participants under the EDIP and LTPP and then to hold them for the participants during the retention period of the plan.
In order to hedge the cost of potential future awards the ESOPs may, from time to time over the performance period of the plans, purchase BP shares in the open market.
The company provides funding to the ESOPs.
The assets and liabilities of the ESOPs are recognized as assets and liabilities of the company within these accounts.
The ESOPs have waived their rights to dividends on shares held for future awards.
At 31 December 2002, the ESOPs held 3,901,317 shares 7,673,056 shares for potential future awards.

Pension contributions Four executive directors participated in a non-contributory pension scheme established for UK staff by a separate trust fund to which contributions are made by BP based on actuarial advice.
Two US executive directors participated in the BP Retirement Accumulation Plan during 2002.
Non-executive directors retiring in 2002 The board did not make any payment to Sir Robert Wilson, the only non-executive director retiring in 2002, in view of his limited length of service.
Non-executive directors retiring in 2001 In accordance with Article 76 of the company's Articles of Association, the board exercised its discretion, following the retirement of each of those non-executive directors retiring during 2001, to make an ex-gratia payment in lieu of superannuation.
The payments made were as follows: $86,400 to the Lord Wright of Richmond, who retired after serving on the board since 1991: $21,600 to Richard Ferris, who retired after serving on the board of first Amoco and then BP since 1981: and $17,280 to Ruth Block, who retired after serving on the board of first Amoco and then BP since 1986.
Richard Ferris and Ruth Block also had accrued certain entitlements which crystallized at the time of the merger with Amoco Corporation in the Amoco Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Executive Directors the Plan.
The terms of the Plan provided that shares in respect of service on the board of Amoco Corporation were to be held in the Plan until the non-executive director retired at the normal retirement age 70, or in the case of earlier retirement the board had a discretion to make an appropriate award based upon length of service.
Those directors who left the Plan at the time of the merger had their entitlements paid out.
The operation of the Plan for those who remained fell to the discretion of the board of BP.
Ruth Block retired at age 70 and following her retirement the board released her shares held in the Plan in respect of her service at Amoco Corporation to the value of $283,512 as at the date of their release.
Richard Ferris retired at age 64 and the board elected to waive restrictions on all those shares held in the Plan in respect of his service at Amoco Corporation to the value of $293,716 as at the date of their release.
Office facilities for former chairmen and deputy chairmen It is customary for the company to make available to former chairmen and deputy chairmen, who were previously employed executives, the use of office and basic secretarial facilities following their retirement.
The cost involved in doing so is not significant.
Further information Full details of individual directors remuneration are given in the directors remuneration report on pages 30 to 39 of Annual Report 2002.
39 Loans to officers Miss J C Hanratty has a low interest loan of $43,000 made to her prior to her appointment as Company Secretary on 1 October 1994.
36 40 Pensions Most group companies have pension plans, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benefits may be provided through defined contribution plans money purchase schemes or defined benefit plans final salary schemes.
For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
For defined benefit plans, retirement benefits are based on the employees pensionable salary and length of service.
Defined benefit plans may be externally funded or unfunded.
The assets of funded plans are generally held in separately administered trusts.
Contributions to funded defined benefit plans are based on advice from independent actuaries using actuarial methods, the objective of which is to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
The cumulative difference, since the adoption of Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
24 Accounting for Pension Costs SSAP 24, between the contributions paid by BP to the pension funds and the pension expense recorded each year is reflected in the balance sheet.
If the cumulative contributions exceed pension expense the difference is shown as a prepayment on the balance sheet.
If the cumulative contributions are less than pension expense the difference is shown as a provision on the balance sheet.
For unfunded plans, where assets are not held with the specific purpose of matching pension obligations, the accrued liability for pension benefits is included within other provisions.
The majority of the groups employees are members of defined benefit plans.
The principal plans are reviewed annually by the independent actuaries and subject to a formal actuarial valuation at least every three years.
The date of the latest actuarial valuation for the UK plans was 1 January 2001 and for the US plans and the unfunded plans in Europe was 1 January 2002.
The date of the most recent actuarial reviews was 31 December 2002.
The pension assumptions for the principal plans are set out below.
The assumptions used to evaluate accrued pension benefits at 31 December in any year are used to determine pension expense for the following year, that is, the assumptions at 31 December 2002 are used to determine the pension liabilities at that date and the pension cost for 2003.
This applies for all accounting bases described in this note.
Pension costs for the principal plans have been derived using the projected unit method and by amortizing surpluses and deficits on a straight line basis over the average expected remaining service lives of the current employees.
An analysis of pension expense is set out below.

The entitlement to these benefits is usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum period of service.
The plans are funded to a limited extent and the accrued net liability for post-retirement benefits is included within other provisions.
The cost of providing post-retirement benefits is assessed annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit method.
The date of the latest actuarial valuation was 1 January 2002.
The assumptions used in calculating the charge for post-retirement benefits are consistent with those shown in Note 40 for US pension plans.
The charge to income for post-retirement benefits is as follows: $ million 2002 2001 Service cost 37 31 Interest on post-retirement benefit liabilities 219 187 Expected return on plan assets 4 5 Amortization of variances 21 21 Curtailment 3 32 276 160 At 31 December 2002, the independent actuaries reassessed the obligation for post-retirement benefits at $4,326 million $3,080 million.
The discount rate used to assess the obligation at 31 December 2002 of the US plan was 6.75% 7.25%.
The provision for post-retirement benefits at 31 December 2002 was $2,762 million $2,664 million.

The sales and purchases shown above occurred in the period to 31 July 2002.
On 2 May 2001, BP purchased the outstanding 50% of Erdlchemie, previously an associated undertaking.
From that date it was fully consolidated.
The sales and purchases shown above occurred in the period to 1 May 2001.
On 1 November 2001, the BP Solvay Polyethylene Europe joint venture was formed.
The sales figures for 2001 are from 1 November 2001.
43 Contingent liabilities There were contingent liabilities at 31 December 2002 in respect of guarantees and indemnities entered into as part of the ordinary course of the groups business.
No material losses are likely to arise from such contingent liabilities.
Approximately 200 lawsuits were filed in State and Federal Courts in Alaska seeking compensatory and punitive damages arising out of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound in March 1989.
Most of those suits named Exxon now ExxonMobil, Alyeska Pipeline Service Company Alyeska, which operates the oil terminal at Valdez, and the other oil companies which own Alyeska.
Alyeska initially responded to the spill until the response was taken over by Exxon.
BP owns a 47% interest reduced during 2001 from 50% by a sale of 3% to Phillips in Alyeska through a subsidiary of BP America Inc. and briefly indirectly owned a further 20% interest in Alyeska following BPs combination with Atlantic Richfield Company ARCO.
Alyeska and its owners have settled all the claims against them under these lawsuits.
Exxon has indicated that it may file a claim for contribution against Alyeska for a portion of the costs and damages which it has incurred.
If any claims are asserted by Exxon which affect Alyeska and its owners, BP will defend the claims vigorously.
Since 1987, Atlantic Richfield Company ARCO, a current subsidiary of BP, has been named as a co-defendant in numerous lawsuits brought in the USA alleging injury to persons and property caused by lead pigment in paint.
The majority of the lawsuits have been abandoned or dismissed as against ARCO.
ARCO and in one case two of its affiliates is named in these lawsuits as alleged successor to International Smelting & Refining which, along with a predecessor company, manufactured lead pigment during the period 1920-1946.
Plaintiffs include individuals and governmental entities.
Several of the lawsuits purport to be class actions.
The lawsuits depending on plaintiff seek various remedies including: compensation to lead-poisoned children: cost to find and remove lead paint from buildings: medical monitoring and screening programmes: public warning and education on lead hazards: reimbursement of government healthcare costs and special education for lead-poisoned citizens: and punitive damages.
No case has been settled or tried to conclusion.
While the amounts claimed could be substantial and it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions, ARCO believes that it has valid defences and it intends to defend such actions vigorously.
Consequently, BP believes that the impact of these lawsuits on the groups results of operations, financial position or liquidity will not be material.
The group is subject to numerous national and local environmental laws and regulations concerning its products, operations and other activities.
These laws and regulations may require the group to take future action to remediate the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release of chemicals or petroleum substances by the group or other parties.
Such contingencies may exist for various sites including refineries, chemical plants, oil fields, service stations, terminals and waste disposal sites.
In addition, the group may have obligations relating to prior asset sales or closed facilities.
The ultimate requirement for remediation and its cost are inherently difficult to estimate.
However, the estimated cost of known environmental obligations has been provided in these accounts in accordance with the groups accounting policies.
While the amounts of future costs could be significant and could be material to the groups results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, BP does not expect these costs to have a material effect on the groups financial position or liquidity.
The group generally restricts its purchase of insurance to situations where this is required for legal or contractual reasons.
This is because external insurance is not considered an economic means of financing losses for the group.
Losses will therefore be borne as they arise rather than being spread over time through insurance premia with attendant transaction costs.
The position is reviewed periodically.
The parent company has issued guarantees under which amounts outstanding at 31 December 2002 were $19,952 million $19,900 million, including $19,896 million $19,843 million in respect of borrowings by its subsidiary undertakings and $56 million $57 million in respect of liabilities of other third parties.
In addition, other group companies have issued guarantees under which amounts outstanding at 31 December 2002 were $338 million $327 million in respect of borrowings of joint ventures and associated undertakings and $237 million $218 million in respect of liabilities of other third parties.
42 44 Capital commitments Authorized future capital expenditure by group companies for which contracts had been placed at 31 December 2002 amounted to $5,966 million $4,712 million.
45 New accounting standard for deferred tax With effect from 1 January 2002, BP has adopted Financial Reporting Standard No.
This standard generally requires that deferred tax should be provided on a full liability basis rather than on a restricted liability basis as required by Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
The adoption of FRS 19 has been treated as a change in accounting policy.
Under FRS 19, deferred tax is recognized in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future.
In particular: Provision is made for tax on gains arising from the disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of the replacement assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold.
Provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated undertakings only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.
Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
As a consequence of adopting FRS 19, acquisitions have been restated as if the new standard applied at that time.
This leads to the creation of higher deferred tax liabilities and greater amounts of goodwill on those acquisitions.
The change in accounting policy has resulted in a prior year adjustment.
Shareholders funds at 1 January 2001 have been reduced by $7,832 million and the tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2001 increased by $1,358 million.
The provision for deferred tax has been increased by $10,047 million at 31 December 2001.
Profit for the current year has been reduced by approximately $750 million as a result of the change in accounting policy.
Comparative information for 2001 has been restated to reflect the changes described above.
