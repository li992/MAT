16 BEHIND THE BRANDS Tea is one of our major businesses.
To help secure the future of this important crop, as part of our pioneering sustainable agriculture initiative, we have created guidelines for sustainable tea production.
Our initiatives on agricultural sustainability, and the wider environment, may not be as well known as our famous brands.
However, like our commitment to responsible corporate behaviour and good employment practice, they are an integral part of our operating tradition.
