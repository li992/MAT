The disclosures within the remuneration report and corporate governance statement also form part of this report.
The following significant changes in the companys activities took place during the period: 1.

Directors Details of the current directors are given opposite.
All of these directors held office throughout the period except Rooney Anand, who was first appointed to the board on 31 August 2001.
In addition, Jonathan Clarke served as a non-executive director of the company until 19 October 2001.
Under article 85 of the companys articles of association Tim Bridge, David Elliott and Graham Greene retire by rotation and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election at the forthcoming annual general meeting.
Details of the directors service agreements, remuneration, and interests in shares and share options are set out in the remuneration report on pages 45 to 49.
Save as disclosed, there have been no changes in their interests between 4 May 2002 and the date of this report.
41 DIRECTORS REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT Interests in contracts No director had a material interest in any contract that was significant in relation to the groups business at any time during the period.
Share capital Details of the share capital of the company are set out in note 23 to the accounts on page 38.
Under the authorities granted to the directors by shareholders in 2001, the company allotted a total of 358,997 ordinary shares of 25p each, with an aggregate nominal value of 89,749 for cash during the period, in connection with the companys sharesave and executive share option schemes.
Under the authority granted to the directors by shareholders in 2001, the company has purchased a total of 530,000 of its own ordinary shares of 25p each, with an aggregate nominal value of 132,500, as follows: 280,000 shares were bought in the market on 22 March 2002 at a price of 737p per share and cancelled on 2 April 2002.
200,000 shares were bought in the market on 4 April 2002 at a price of 779p per share and cancelled on 12 April 2002.
50,000 shares were bought in the market on 10 April 2002 at a price of 787p per share and cancelled on 17 April 2002.
A number of resolutions will be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting in connection with the companys share capital: Share allotment authority This resolution seeks to renew the authority of the directors to allot securities in the company up to an aggregate nominal amount of 6,457,462, being the authorised but unissued capital of the company and representing approximately 34.8 per cent of the current issued ordinary share capital, for up to fifteen months after the AGM.
Dis-application of statutory pre-emption rights This resolution seeks to renew the authority of the directors to dis-apply pre-emption rights and allot equity securities for cash in connection with a rights issue and otherwise up to an aggregate nominal amount of 927,126, being approximately 5 per cent of the current issued ordinary share capital, for up to fifteen months after the AGM.
Authority for purchase of own shares This resolution seeks to renew shareholders authority for the company to make market purchases of its own shares, as permitted by article 8 of the Articles of Association.
Any shares so purchased would be cancelled.
A purchase of own shares would only be undertaken when the directors believed this would result in an increase in expected earnings per share and be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
The authority that will be sought contains several important restrictions, being: the authority is limited to a specific period of time and only permits 7,417,015 shares with a nominal value of 1,854,254, being 10 per cent of the companys current issued share capital, to be purchased on the London Stock Exchange: the minimum price per share which may be paid is the nominal value of 25p: the maximum price per share that may be paid is 105 per cent of the average mid-market price for the companys shares as shown in the Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five business days immediately preceding the purchase.
Full exercise of all options outstanding at the date of this report would require the issue of 2,711,220 ordinary shares.
This represents 3.7% of the current issued share capital and 4.1% of the share capital if the proposed authority to purchase own shares had been obtained and exercised in full.
The company has issued no warrants to subscribe for share capital.
DIRECTORS REPORT 42 DIRECTORS REPORT Substantial shareholdings At the date of this report, the company had been notified of the following material interest of 3 per cent or more in its issued ordinary share capital: Ordinary shares of 25p each % Scottish Widows Investment Partnership Limited 2,522,938 3.40 Employment policies Internal communications The group is committed to involving employees in its activities and believes that effective communication brings important business benefits.
This is achieved through regular briefings, a weekly internal news bulletin and access to an intranet for all computer-using employees, whilst information about the business is published in a range of in-house magazines and the annual report.
Employee benefits The group operates a profit-sharing scheme open to all employees with the requisite qualifying service and a sharesave option scheme open to all employees.
The schemes are intended to enhance commitment to the success of the company and details of them can be found in the notes to the accounts.
All employees are offered access to a  defined contribution pension scheme.
Training and development The group is committed to developing its people.
Training and development opportunities are provided at all levels, from bar skills training to MBA programmes.
By giving employees the skill and knowledge essential to perform their jobs effectively, the group believes it will create a professional and highly motivated workforce that will take the business forward.
Equal opportunities The group is committed to the principle of equal opportunities for all.
The rationale for recruitment and selection is the ability and aptitude of applicants.
Disabled people are offered the same opportunities as all others in respect of recruitment, training, promotion and career development, taking account of their skills and qualifications.
Employees who become disabled will be retained and retrained wherever possible.
Environmental policy The group regards compliance with relevant environmental laws and the adoption of responsible standards as integral parts of its business operations.
It is also committed to introducing measures to limit any adverse effects its business may have on the environment and will promote continuous improvement in accordance with the best available techniques.
The overall responsibility for environmental policy rests with the board, but the managing directors of the divisions are responsible for the sound environmental management of their particular operations.
Charitable donations Donations for charitable purposes made during the period amounted to 57,950 2001 - 37,100.
The group made no political donations.
Going concern The directors expect the group to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and have, therefore, used the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
43 DIRECTORS REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT Payments to suppliers The group understands the benefits to be derived from maintaining good relationships with its suppliers and where possible enters into agreements over payment terms.
Where such terms have not been agreed it is the group policy to settle invoices close to the end of the month following invoicing.
This policy is dependent on suppliers providing accurate, timely and sufficiently detailed invoices.
Payment in respect of 33 days average purchases from trade creditors was outstanding at the end of the period 2001 - 33 days.
Annual general meeting and special business The annual general meeting will be held at 12 noon on Friday 30 August 2002 at Culford School, Culford, Suffolk.
The notice of the annual general meeting and an explanation of the items of non-routine business are set out in the explanatory circular that accompanies this annual report.
Auditors Ernst & Young LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office and a resolution to re-appoint the firm as the companys auditors will be proposed at the annual general meeting.
By order of the board Rob Bellhouse Company secretary 4 July 2002 DIRECTORS REPORT 44 REMUNERATION REPORT Composition of the remuneration committee The remuneration committee is appointed by the board and comprises David McCall committee chairman, Alan Bowkett, Graham Greene and Howard Phillips, all of whom are independent non-executive directors.
There are no cross-directorships or other factors that may interfere with their judgement.
Terms of reference and reporting The committee determines all elements of the executive directors remuneration, which is reviewed annually.
It approves all contracts with executive directors and any compensation arrangements arising from the early termination of such service contracts.
It also approves all grants of options over shares.
This report has been prepared by the remuneration committee on behalf of the board.
Service contracts The notice period generally required from the company to terminate the service agreements of the executive directors appointed after 1991 is one year.
Executive directors who held office before that date retain a notice period of two years, which was reduced from five years in September 1995 at no cost to the company.
The committee views the current arrangements as consistent with the objectives of the remuneration policy.
In the event of the employment of an executive director being terminated, the committee would have regard to both the Combined Code and the executives legal duty to mitigate their loss.
The non-executive directors hold letters of appointment and are each appointed for three-year terms.
Tim Bridge, an executive director proposed for re-election, has a service agreement with the company terminable on two years notice.
David Elliott, who is also standing for re-election, will shortly be entering into a service agreement which has a notice period of one year.
Graham Greene is seeking re-election to the board as a non-executive director and does not therefore have a service contract.
Remuneration policy The objective of the companys remuneration policy is to attract, motivate and retain high quality directors and senior executives who will contribute fully to the success of the group and so add shareholder value.
In order to achieve this, regular comparisons are made with current practice in a selected group of companies.
The principal criteria used in the selection of the appropriate companies are turnover, market capitalisation and range of operations and external advice is sought in order to ensure an objective review.
The committee also consults with the chief executive on its proposals and has regard to pay and conditions elsewhere within the group.
No director plays any part in determining his own remuneration.
A significant proportion of each executive directors potential remuneration package is performance-related, thus aligning the directors interests with those of shareholders and encouraging performance at the highest levels.
The remuneration package of each executive director consists of the following elements: Annual pay The annual pay reflects the responsibilities, market value and sustained performance level of executive directors.
Pay is reviewed annually or when a change in responsibility occurs.
Benefits in kind The executive directors are eligible for a range of taxable benefits, which include the provision of a fully expensed company car and private medical insurance.
Bonus Bonus payments are determined by the remuneration committee and awarded where justified by performance.
The executive directors are eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus of up to 75 per cent of their annual pay.
The amount payable is based upon the achievement of financial performance targets, which are agreed in advance by the committee.
45 REMUNERATION REPORT REMUNERATION REPORT Pensions Tim Bridge and Michael Shallow are entitled to receive a pension of up to two-thirds of their annual pay on their retirement, subject to their length of service and Inland Revenue limits, under the groups defined benefit pension scheme, which also provides a cash lump sum accrual.
The directors contribute five per cent of their annual pay to the scheme and have a retirement age of sixty.
David Elliott participates in the groups defined contribution pension scheme, whilst Neil Gillis and Rooney Anand participate in independently arranged defined contribution pension schemes.
The company has a standard contribution policy for these three directors.
Tim Bridge and Michael Shallow participate in the groups defined benefit pension scheme for death-in-service purposes, subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap where appropriate.
Death benefits in excess of the Revenue maximum are provided through insurance, the cost of which is taxable as a benefit in kind on the relevant directors and disclosed as such in the table below.
Life assurance has been purchased by the company in respect of the three other executive directors, which is disclosed as a benefit in kind in the table below to the extent that it provides benefits in excess of the Inland Revenue maximum.
The Inland Revenue earnings cap restricts the pension that the schemes can provide for four of the directors.
The scheme pensions are, therefore, being supplemented for each of them through funded unapproved pension arrangements.
In the case of Michael Shallow some deficit funding is now being undertaken following an actuarial review.
As a result, the companys contribution for the period in respect of him is 78,500 to his pension arrangements and 52,333 to meet the tax liability created 2001 - 17,000 total.
The company contribution for David Elliott is 25,056 to his pension arrangements and 5,945 to meet the tax liability created 2001 - 54,025 total, including 26,974 in respect of prior service.
The contribution for Neil Gillis is 18,515 to his pension arrangements and 4,864 to meet the tax liability created 2001 - 20,000 total, including 2,653 in respect of prior service.
The contribution for Rooney Anand is 13,512 to his pension arrangements, and 3,161 to meet the resultant tax liability.
Executive share option scheme Executive directors and a selection of other managers are rewarded for long-term performance by the phased granting of options at nil cost.
At the 2001 annual general meeting, shareholders approved a rule change so that the scheme now offers executives an annual grant up to the value of once their basic salary.
In certain special situations, the remuneration committee can issue shares with a grant value of up to four times annual salary.
The committee approves all grants of executive share options and does not grant options at a discount to the prevailing mid-market price.
Options issued under this scheme can only be exercised between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant and then only if attaching performance conditions have been met.
Specifically, annual grant options may not be exercised, in whole or in part, unless the growth in audited adjusted earnings per share has exceeded RPI inflation by 3% per annum, measured over periods of 3, 4 or 5 years relative to the year of grant.
Employee share schemes In common with all other employees, the executive directors are also entitled to participate in the sharesave and profit share schemes operated by the company.
Further details of these schemes are given later in this report, together with the directors entitlements under them.
