84 Summary of differences between UK and US GAAP The Groups financial statements are prepared in accordance with UK GAAP which differs in certain significant respects from US GAAP.
These differences relate principally to the following items and the approximate effect of the necessary adjustments is shown in the foregoing tables.
The 2001 US GAAP information is extracted form the Groups 2001 Form 20-F.
Goodwill and US purchase accounting Under UK GAAP, for acquisitions arising before 30 September 1998 the Group charged goodwill arising on such business combinations treated as purchases directly to reserves.
From 1 October 1998 goodwill arising on acquisitions under UK GAAP has been capitalised as an intangible asset and is written off over periods of up to 20 years.
Under US GAAP, intangible assets including goodwill, in respect of business combinations treated as purchases are charged against income over their estimated lives.
Any intangible assets relating to a business sold in the year is written off in determining the profit or loss on disposal.
In determining the differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP shown above, US GAAP has been applied using amortisation periods in respect of goodwill of up to 40 years.
Ordinary dividends Under UK GAAP, final Ordinary dividends are provided for in the fiscal year in respect of which they are recommended by the Board of Directors for approval by the shareholders.
Under US GAAP, such dividends are not provided for until approved by the shareholders.
Pension costs Differences between the UK and US GAAP figures arise from the requirement to use different actuarial methods and assumptions and the method of amortising surpluses or deficits.
Under US GAAP, a minimum pension liability is recorded for the amount by which the plan is under funded, ignoring projected future salary increases.
Stock compensation Under UK GAAP the cost of stock options is only recognised in net income to the extent the options were granted at a value beneath the market value on the date of grant.
Under US GAAP the Group has elected to measure the cost of stock options using a fair value based method at the date of grant and to recognise the charge over the vesting period.
Investments Under UK GAAP, decreases in the market value of fixed asset investments need not be recorded to the extent that the decrease is considered temporary.
Under US GAAP, debit and equity securities are required to be adjusted to reflect the underlying market values, with the change in respect of temporary differences in value being reflected in reserves and other than temporary differences in the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments Under UK GAAP the value of underlying financial instruments including forward exchange contracts is not recorded in the financial statements to the extent that the financial instruments are considered hedges.
Under US GAAP, all financial instruments must be recorded on the balance sheet and carried at their fair value with changes in fair value charged to the profit and loss account.
Derivative financial instruments embedded within host contracts are recorded separately in the financial statements at their fair value.
Acquired film libraries Under UK GAAP, acquired film libraries are amortised over a period of up to 40 years.
Under US GAAP, acquired film libraries are amortised over a period of up to 20 years.
