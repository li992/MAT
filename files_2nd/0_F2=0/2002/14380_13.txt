If demand does not deteriorate further, reduced costs should feed through to higher profits in 2003.
GROUP PROSPECTS In the course of 2002, we have narrowed our focus on chosen growth areas and reduced costs.
Smiths has performed well in difficult markets, mainly as a result of the cost savings which have limited the reduction in operating profit.
The high level of cash generation demonstrates the substance to these profits.
A number of actions will benefit future performance.
We have reduced debt by 1bn since the formation of Smiths Group in December 2000, and the balance sheet is strong.
