17 Retirement benefits This Standard sets out revised requirements for the accounting and disclosure of an employers retirement benefit obligations and related funding.
Increasing levels of disclosure of amounts measured in accordance with the Standard, have been required over the years 2001 and 2002 with recognition in the primary statements for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 following suspension by the Accounting Standards Board.
The Group has followed the transitional requirements of the Standard.
In 2001 information on financial assumptions to calculate the projected benefit obligations of Group schemes and details of scheme assets, expected rates of return, liabilities and net liabilities assets were disclosed in note 37.
In 2002 further analysis covering the amounts to be charged in future years to trading profit, other finance income and the Statement of Group total recognised gains and losses is provided in note 37.
Upon full adoption in 2005, comparative financial statement information will be restated.
The requirements of the Standard will have no impact on cash flows.
19 Deferred Tax This Standard requires full provision to be made for deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in a tax computation except as otherwise required by FRS No.
It also requires deferred tax assets to be recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
The Standard allows the optional discounting of all or none of the deferred tax assets or liabilities and the Group has elected not to discount.
Prior to the adoption of FRS No.
19, deferred tax was only provided on a partial provision basis.
The standard is implemented in these financial statements and all primary statements and notes relating to the accounts have been restated.
19 has increased the 2001 deferred tax provision by 81m 2000 33m.
The tax charge on profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items has increased by 27m in 2001 2000 34m resulting in a restated effective tax rate for 2001 of 28.9% 2000 31.6%, compared with 22.2% 2000 24.0% originally reported.
The net profit for 2001 decreased by 41m 2000 increase 21m.
The estimated impact on the current years profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items if FRS No.
19 had not been adopted would be to reduce the underlying effective tax rate from 29% to approximately 22%.
The impact on profit before tax has not been quantified as it is impractical to do so.
The new standard has no impact on cash flows.
19 were published in 2000 since which time no new UK Standards have been published.
Continuing and Discontinued Operations and Classes of Business For UK reporting purposes, the results in these accounts differentiate between the Groups continuing and discontinued operations.
3 - Reporting Financial Performance, discontinued operations are material, clearly separate operations which have been sold or permanently terminated either during the financial year or during the subsequent period up to the date of approval of the financial statements.
All other operations are classified as continuing operations.
Discontinued operations, in these financial statements, comprise: Chlor-Chemicals, Klea and Crosfield businesses Methanol business 50% equity shareholding in Phillips-Imperial Petroleum Ltd Where businesses have been reclassified as discontinued operations, comparative segmental data has been restated in all cases.
Net interest payable and tax on profit loss on ordinary activities have been allocated to discontinued operations to reflect the legal entity incidence of these items within the business divested.
Non co-terminous year ends Owing to local conditions and to avoid undue delay in the presentation of the Group accounts, three subsidiaries made up their accounts to dates earlier than 31 December, but not earlier than 30 September: additionally seven subsidiaries made up their accounts prior to 30 September but interim accounts to 31 December were drawn up for consolidation purposes.
Cash In the statement of Group cash flow and related notes cash includes cash at bank, deposits repayable on demand and overdrafts: deposits are repayable on demand if they are, in practice, available within 24 hours without penalty.
Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
56 ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002 2 Directors and Officers remuneration and interests Information covering Directors remuneration, interests in shares, debentures, share options and pension benefits is included in the Remuneration report on pages 38 to 46.

Under UK GAAP, exceptional items are material items which derive from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the Group and which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the financial statements are to give a true and fair view.

Earnings per 1 Ordinary Share before exceptional items have been calculated to show the impact of exceptional items as these can have a distorting effect on earnings and therefore warrant separate consideration.
On 4 February 2002, the Company announced a Rights Issue and, following approval of the required resolutions at the subsequent Extraordinary General Meeting, 463m new Ordinary Shares were issued at 180p per share on the basis of 7 new Ordinary Shares for every 11 existing Ordinary Shares.
The actual cum rights price on 25 February 2002, the last day of quotation cum rights, was 319p per share and the theoretical ex rights price for an ordinary share was therefore 265p per share.
The comparative earnings per share are shown after applying the factor 265 319 to the published figures for 2001 and 2000, after adjusting for deferred tax see note 1 in order to adjust for the bonus issue within the Rights Issue.

Huntsman International Holdings LLC Under the terms of a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated 14 June 2002, ICI agreed to sell its interests in Huntsman International Holdings LLC HIH, which comprise 1 a holding of subordinated loan notes in HIH HIH Notes and 2 ICI Alta Inc. the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company which holds ICIs 30% equity interest in HIH and ICIs rights under the option Agreement with Huntsman Specialty Chemicals Corporation HSCC dated 2 November 2000 the Option Agreement, as amended 20 December 2001, to CSFB Global Opportunities Partners, L. P. now Matlin Patterson Global Opportunities Partners L. P..
The aggregate purchase price is $440m 283m.
Of this amount, $160m 109m has been received.
The remaining $280m 174m with an amount equivalent to interest from 15 May 2002 to the date of payment will be payable on 15 May 2003, with the purchaser having the option to pay all or part of the amount due prior to 15 May 2003 by means of instalment payments.
As security for a portion of the outstanding purchase price, the HIH Notes have been pledged back to ICI, otherwise the agreement is effectively without recourse to Matlin Patterson Global Opportunities Partners L. P. This pledge will be released when ICI has received in aggregate at least $260m of the total purchase price.
When ICI has received at least $350m of the total purchase price, ICI will release ICI Altas existing pledge over 21% of the 30% equity interest in HIH pledged to ICI by HSCC and reduce the amount due from HSCC to ICI Alta under the Option Agreement by approximately 50%.
If no installment payments are made, the Option Agreement will remain in place on its existing terms.
The sale of ICI Alta and the indirect transfer of ICIs 30% equity interest in HIH is permitted by the Option Agreement: however, due to separate constraints on members of HIH transferring any interests in HIH to third parties, the purchaser may be obligated to obtain the written consent of HSCC prior to transfer of ownership of ICI Alta.
Ownership of the HIH Notes has been transferred, subject to the pledge arrangements above, and ownership of ICI Alta will be transferred when the full purchase price has been received.
The HIH Notes have been accounted for as sold, with some of the purchase price outstanding, and the equity interest in HIH accounted for as an investment rather than an associate undertaking.
As the transaction has not been completed the estimated net overall gain of approximately 55m has not been recognised.
The outstanding purchase price on the HIH Notes of $100m 62m and the loss on the HIH Notes of approximately 40m, together with the equity interest in HIH 23m are held in the Group balance sheet as current asset investments until such time as the total purchase price of $440m 283m has been received in full.
At that date, the overall profit on the transaction will be recorded.
Although not expected at this time, a failure by Matlin Patterson Global Opportunities Partners L. P. to complete all aspects of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, would require the Group to review and amend the above accounting treatment in the light of the circumstances then prevailing.
In general, HIH is required to make certain distributions in respect of taxes payable by its members tax distributions, and may make other distributions upon approval of a majority of its board of directors, subject to two restrictions.
First, under Delaware law, HIH may not make a distribution to its members if, after such distribution, HIHs liabilities would exceed the fair value of its assets.
Second, with certain exceptions including for tax distributions, the terms of HIHs outstanding indebtedness which mature in 2009 generally prohibit HIH from making any distributions or payments on or with respect to HIHs equity while such indebtedness is outstanding.

Employees share option schemes and other share based plans ICI granted share options and other market based units to Executive Directors, senior executives and certain key employees under four main plans: the Performance Growth Plan and other share based plans, the Share Option Scheme Senior Staff Scheme, the Bonus Conversion Plan which operated for the last time in respect of the 1999 performance year and the Stock Appreciation Rights Plan SARP.
These schemes are described on pages 39 to 43.
The Company also operates a savings related share option scheme UK Sharesave for all UK employees meeting minimum service requirements.
Following ICIs rights issue in 2002, the numbers of shares under option as at 1 January 2002 and their exercise prices were adjusted for the impact of the Rights Issue using adjusted factors determined by the Remuneration Committee of the Board.
The option prices under these schemes were reduced by a factor of approximately 0.830 and the number of shares under option was increased, by a factor of approximately 1.204 calculated using the standard theoretical ex-rights price TERP adjustment to preserve the aggregate exercise price.
The narrative and tables below set out the adjusted amounts.
At 31 December 2002 the maximum number of ordinary share equivalents which could be awarded under the Performance Growth Plan was 2,471,791 2001 1,496,648.
The maximum number awarded in 2002 was 1,151,150, with lapses during the year of 176,007 2001 50,382.

The prices at which options are granted under the Senior Staff Scheme must not be less than the nominal value of an Ordinary Share nor less than the average of the middle market quotation of an ICI Ordinary Share on the London Stock Exchange on the five business days immediately preceding the date on which the option is offered.
Options under this scheme expire after 10 years.
Grants under the SARP are made on the same terms as the Senior Staff Scheme.
On exercise the participant receives the gain payable in American Depositary Shares ADSs for grants prior to 1998 paid twothirds in cash and one-third in ADSs.
At 31 December 2002 there were 572,885 shares outstanding representing the matched shares under the Bonus Conversion Plan to be delivered as the Companys Ordinary Shares or in the form of ADSs.

88 ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002 24 Reserves continued The Articles of Association of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC state that borrowings after deducting cash, current asset investments and short-term deposits, must not exceed two and a half times the shareholders equity after adding back sums, calculated in accordance with US GAAP, equivalent to the unamortised balance of goodwill arising on acquisitions made after 1 January 1986.
Any borrowings, cash or short-term investments held by subsidiaries in their capacity as trustee of a Group pension fund are excluded from the calculation.
For the purpose of calculating the basis of the borrowing limits, in accordance with the Articles of Association, the total of the sums standing to the credit of capital and revenue reserves of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings, to be added to the nominal amount of the share capital of the Company, was 2,970m at 31 December 2002 2001 restated note 1 2,693m: 2000 restated note 1 2,680m.

93 notes relating to the accounts 34 Statement of Group cash flow: Basis of preparation The Statement of Group cash flow is prepared in accordance with UK FRS No.
1 Revised 1996 Cash Flow Statements, the objective of which is similar to that set out in the US Standard SFAS No.
The two statements differ, however, in their definitions of cash and their presentation of the main constituent items of cash flow.
The definition of cash in the UK Standard is limited to cash plus deposits less overdrafts borrowings repayable on demand without penalty.
In the US, the definition in SFAS No.
95 excludes overdrafts but is widened to include cash equivalents, comprising short-term highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturities that they present insignificant risk of changes in value: generally, only investments with original maturities of 3 months or less qualify for inclusion.
Calculated in accordance with SFAS No.
95, cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2000, 2001 and 2002 and the movements during the years ending on those dates were as follows: 2002 2001 2000 m m m Cash and cash equivalents Cash 267 301 255 Investments and short-term deposits which were within 3 months of maturity when acquired 158 135 317 425 436 572 Change in the balance of cash and cash equivalents At beginning of year 436 572 454 Exchange adjustments 12 3 1 Cash inflow outflow during year 2 119 114 Acquisitions and disposals 1 14 3 At end of year 425 436 572 The format of the UK statement employs some nine headings compared with three in SFAS No.
The cash flows within the UK headings of Operating activities, Dividends received from associates, Returns on investments and servicing of finance and Taxation would all be included within the heading of Net cash provided by operating activities under SFAS No.
Likewise, the UK headings of Capital expenditure and financial investment and Acquisitions and disposals correspond with Cash flows from investing activities under SFAS No.
95, and Equity dividends paid, Management of liquid resources and Financing in the UK, subject to adjustments for cash equivalents, correspond with Cash flows from financing activities in the USA.

Pensions SSAP 24 Group The Company and most of its subsidiaries operate retirement plans which cover the majority of employees including Directors in the Group.
These plans are generally of the defined benefit type under which benefits are based on employees years of service and average final remuneration and are funded through separate trustee-administered funds.
Formal independent actuarial valuations of the Groups main plans are undertaken regularly, normally at least triennially and adopting the projected unit method.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligation of the Groups pension plans vary according to the economic conditions of the country in which they are situated.
The weighted average discount rate used in determining the actuarial present values of the benefit obligations was 6.0% 2001 6.1%.
The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on investments was 6.1% 2001 6.3%.
The weighted average rate of increase of future earnings was 4.0% 2001 4.1%.
The market value of the fund assets of these plans at the date of the latest actuarial valuations was sufficient to cover 99% 2001 99% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings: their market value was 7,721m 2001 7,843m.
The total pension cost for the Group for 2002 was 89m 2001 70m: 2000 85m.
Accrued pension costs amounted to 9m 2001 11m and are included in other creditors note 19 : provisions for the benefit obligation of a small number of mainly unfunded plans amounted to 148m 2001 179m and are included in provisions for liabilities and charges - pensions note 21.
Prepaid pension costs amounting to 525m 2001 510m are included in debtors note 16.
ICI Pension Fund The ICI Pension Fund accounts for approximately 87% of the Groups plans in asset valuation and projected benefit terms.
From the date of the actuarial valuation of the ICI Pension Fund as at 31 March 1994 the Company has been making payments into the Fund to reflect the extra liabilities arising from early retirement as retirements occur.
Based on a Funding Review as at 31 March 1997, the Company agreed to make six annual payments into the Fund of 100m per annum from 1998 through 2003, subject to a review in 2000.
The latest actuarial valuation of the Fund, as at 31 March 2000, disclosed a solvency ratio of 98% and the Company has agreed to make a further six annual payments into the Fund of 30m per annum from 2001 to 2006, subject to a review in 2003.
The deficit, together with the prepayment, is taken into account in arriving at the employers pension costs charged in the accounts by being amortised as a percentage of pensionable emoluments over the expected working lifetime of existing members.
In 2002 this gave rise to a charge of 16m 2001 13m.
Healthcare UITF Abstract 6 The Group provides in North America, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, certain unfunded healthcare and life assurance benefits for retired employees.
At 31 December 2002 approximately 20,000 2001 20,000 current and retired employees were eligible to benefit from these schemes.
The liabilities in respect of these benefits are fully accrued over the expected working lifetime of the existing members.
The total post-retirement healthcare cost for the Group for 2002 was 12m 2001 10m: 2000 13m and the provision at the year end was 179m 2001 199m.
The Group has adopted the measurement basis of the US Standard, SFAS No.
106 - Employers Accounting for Post-Retirement Benefits other than Pensions as the basis of its UK GAAP reporting.
Costs and provisions were determined on an actuarial basis.
The assumptions relating to the US plans, which represent a substantial proportion on the Group total, are set out in the table on note 42.
The healthcare cost trend has a significant effect on the amounts reported.
For the Group, increasing the assumed health care cost rates by 1% in every year would increase the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation as of 31 December 2002 by 11m 2001 8m and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic post-retirement benefit cost for the year ended 31 December 2002 by 2m 2001 1m.

The figures shown above take into account various interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward exchange contracts used to manage the interest rate and currency profile of financial assets and liabilities.
b Currency exposures on monetary assets and liabilities As explained in the Operating and Financial Review, on page 23, the Groups policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities.
As a result there are no significant non functional currency exposures.
c Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, as defined in section a above, at 31 December 2002 was as follows: 2002 2001 m m In one year or less 726 1,668 In more than one year but not more than two years 548 366 In more than two years but not more than five years 792 860 In more than five years 44 515 2,110 3,409 101 notes relating to the accounts 38 Financial risk management continued d Borrowing facilities Committed facilities available to the Group at 31 December 2002 in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date were as follows: 2002 2001 m m Expiring in one year or less 201 512 Expiring in more than one year 883 Expiring in more than two years 425 1,232 1,509 1,744 e Net debt management The Group manages the currency and interest rate exposure which arises on borrowings and cash not immediately required by the business on a net basis through the use of currency swaps, forward exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps.
The most significant consequences of this approach are: to manage the currency exposures arising from loans by holding cash and through currency swaps.
to reduce the proportion of the Groups fixed interest rate liabilities arising from loans through the use of fixed to floating rate swaps.
The financial instruments used in debt management are accounted for as described in the Groups accounting policies on pages 50 and 51.
The notional principal amounts and fair values, net of associated hedges, of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities were as follows: Notional principal amounts Carrying values Fair values At 31 December At 31 December At 31 December 2002 2001 2002 2001 2002 2001 m m m m m m Interests in participating and other investments other investments 17 287 17 287 17 287 Current asset investments and short-term deposits 54 55 54 55 54 55 Cash 264 301 264 301 264 301 Other financial assets 31 54 31 54 31 54 Short-term borrowings 224 418 226 418 224 425 Loans 1,850 2,965 1,848 2,963 2,010 3,077 Other financial liabilities 21 36 21 36 21 36 Currency swaps 814 849 15 8 27 38 Interest rate swaps 3,485 4,377 36 68 Interest rate caps 1,945 Total net liabilities 1,744 2,712 1,826 2,735 Financial assets 366 Financial liabilities 2,110 1,744 liability The Group has assumed that the fair value approximates to the carrying value.
The fair value of the Groups long-term publicly quoted debt is based upon quoted market prices.
The fair value of the Groups non-publicly quoted debt, all swaps, and caps have been estimated from discounted anticipated cash flows utilising a zero coupon yield curve.
The total decrease in the fair value of long-term debt net of associated hedges for the year ended 31 December 2002 of 1,067m arose from the net repayment of loans 966m, favourable movements on foreign exchange 152m and adverse movements due to changes in interest rates 51m.
A portfolio approach is adopted to create the Groups target proportion of fixed and floating rate debt by currency.
The maturity profile of the net fixed rate exposure is spread over several years to reduce re-pricing risk.
Short term borrowings include balances relating to forward exchange contracts.
These balances are further analysed in section g. Where interest rate and currency instruments are designated to a group of borrowings or cash and cash equivalents with similar characteristics, altering their interest rate or currency profile, the net cash amounts to be received or paid on the agreements are accrued in current assets or liabilities and recognised as an adjustment to interest income or expense accrual accounting.
102 ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002 38 Financial risk management continued e Net debt management continued The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event that counterparties to off-balance-sheet financial instruments do not perform according to the terms of the contract.
In the opinion of management, the counterparties to the financial instruments are creditworthy parties and the Group does not expect any significant loss to result from non-performance.
The immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments that have a positive fair value at 31 December 2002.
At 31 December 2002 the aggregate value of all financial instruments with a positive fair value assets was 62m for currency swaps, 96m for interest rate swaps, 12m for forward contracts, nil for interest rate caps and 2m for currency options.
There were no net material gains or losses deferred at 31 December 2002 2001 nil.

The Group selectively hedges its anticipated currency cash flow exposures for up to 12 months ahead through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and selective purchase of currency options.
Surplus funds are invested in instruments in a variety of currencies.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge these back to the currencies that are appropriate for the net debt portfolio.
The financial instruments used in currency management are accounted for as described in the Groups accounting policies on pages 50 and 51.
The notional principal amounts and fair values of forward exchange contracts used in currency management are as follows: Notional principal amounts Carrying values Fair values At 31 December At 31 December At 31 December 2002 2001 2002 2001 2002 2001 m m m m m m Hedging working capital 1 1 1 1 Forward contracts to buy currency 99 86 Forward contracts to sell currency 96 85 Hedging anticipated cash flows 6 1 6 1 Currency contracts to buy currency 97 135 Currency contracts to sell currency 88 133 Hedging debt 4 39 4 32 Forward contracts to buy currency 617 1,445 Forward contracts to sell currency 620 1,409 liability The carrying values of currency hedging instruments do not materially differ from the fair values based on quoted market prices.
h Management of current asset investments Surplus funds are invested in high quality liquid marketable investments, including money market instruments, government securities and asset backed securities.
Investments are of a plain vanilla nature with no embedded interest rate options.
The majority of asset backed securities have some risk of early redemption, but are of a floating rate nature and hence have minimal fixed interest rate risk.
There are no investments of a fixed rate nature with maturity greater than one year and consequently the fair value of investments is considered to be materially the same as the value in the Groups balance sheet.
Investments are classified as available for sale.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is controlled by setting a policy for limiting credit exposure to counterparties, which is reviewed annually, and reviewing credit ratings and limiting individual aggregate credit exposures accordingly.
The Group considers the possibility of material loss in the event of non-performance by a financial counterparty to be unlikely.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in debt and currency management do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of the credit risk to the Group arising through the use of these instruments.
The immediate credit risk of these instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value.

The Chairman and Executive Directors are employed pursuant to agreements which terminate on 12 months notice.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an unspecified term pursuant to letters of engagement.
