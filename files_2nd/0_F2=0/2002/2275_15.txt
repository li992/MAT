Pension schemes The Group operated a number of pension schemes during the year.
The cost to the Group of these schemes was 5.5m 2001: 4.2m of which 4.1m 2001: 3.2m related to overseas arrangements.
UK Schemes The Group operates a funded dened benefit arrangement for UK employees in which the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The pension cost relating to the UK arrangement is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualied actuaries using the projected unit method.
The last actuarial assessment of the scheme was performed on 6 April 2001.
The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the results of each of the actuarial assessments are those relating to the rate of return on the investments 6.25%, the rate of increase in salaries 4.25% and the allowance 2.75% made for pension payment increases of 5% or retail price ination if less.
At the last actuarial valuation of the scheme, the market value of the assets totalled 26.0m.
The actuarial value of these assets represented 90% of the benets that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
At 6 April 2001, there was a shortfall of 3.0m on the basis of the minimum funding requirement of the Pensions Act 1995.
This is being addressed by payment of contributions aimed at removing this shortfall by 6 April 2007 at the latest.
The contributions made by the employer over the financial year have been 1,325,000, equivalent to 14.8% of pensionable pay after allowing for National Insurance rebates.
This contribution rate is to continue until reviewed following the triennial valuation of the scheme due as at 6 April 2002.
As the scheme is closed to new entrants, the current service cost as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll.
The transitional arrangements of the new accounting standard FRS 17 require disclosure of assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2002 calculated in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17.
They also require disclosure of the items which would appear in the profit and loss account and in the statement of total recognised gains and losses were the full requirements of FRS 17 in place.
For the purpose of these financial statements, all of these gures are illustrative only and do not impact on the actual 31 December 2002 balance sheet or on this years performance statements.
Assumptions The assets of the scheme have been taken at market value and the liabilities have been calculated using the following principal actuarial assumptions: 2002 2001 % p. a.

The disclosures required under the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 in respect of these pension schemes are set out below.
The contributions made by the employer over the financial year have been $272,000 181,000 equivalent to 4.19% of pensionable pay.
The next actuarial valuation for funding purposes is due as at 31 December 2002.

Currency exposures The Groups objectives in managing the currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas in other words, its structural currency exposures are to maintain a low cost of borrowings and to retain some potential for currency-related appreciation while partially hedging against currency depreciation.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The table on page 45 shows the Groups currency exposures: in other words, those transactional or non-structural exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas operations.
