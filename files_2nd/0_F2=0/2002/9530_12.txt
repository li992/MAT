The return of capital involved four stages: i each existing ordinary share was subdivided and re-designated into one capital share of 25p and one ordinary share of 75p: ii the Companys share capital was increased by the creation of premium shares with an aggregate nominal value equivalent to the total of the share premium account and one premium share was created for each existing ordinary share: iii the share premium account was capitalised by paying up the newly created premium shares and allotting them to the holders of the newly created ordinary shares of 75p each: iv the newly created capital shares and premium shares were cancelled in return for payments of 25p and 125p respectively, a total of 150p per share being paid to shareholders.
Lonmin Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2002 43 Notes to the Accounts 20 Called up share capital and share premium account continued The remaining balances on the share capital account of $39 million and the share premium account of $110 million were transferred to the Companys reserves.
The capital reduction was achieved by the cancellation of the new issued ordinary shares of 75p each and the authorised but unissued ordinary shares of 1 each and the creation of dollar shares of $1 each and their subsequent allotment to the holders of the 75p shares in the ratio of 21 new dollar shares for every 25 ordinary shares of 75p each.
The redenomination of the share capital was thus effected by the issue of dollar shares of $1 each.
In addition, because a Public Limited Company must have a minimum share capital of 50,000 in sterling, 50,000 of sterling deferred shares of 1 each were created and issued to a nominee Company by the capitalisation of reserves.
The deferred shares do not rank pari passu with the ordinary shares.
During the year the Company also bought back and cancelled 10,400,000 ordinary shares at a total cost of $128 million.
21 Share options The grant of all options is made by the Remuneration Committee.
Exercises of options granted under The Lonmin Share Option Scheme 1994 and The Lonmin Executive Share Option Scheme are normally subject to the attainment of the performance condition that, over any consecutive three year period starting not earlier than the first day of the month in which the option is granted, the total return to shareholders is greater than the total return during the same period on, i the FTSE Actuaries All-Share Index, for options granted prior to 1998, and ii the Mining formerly Extractive Industries Sector of the FTSE Actuaries Share Indices, for options granted from 1998.
The method of calculation of the total return to shareholders is the same method as used to calculate the total return figures published in the Financial Times for the FTSE Actuaries All-Share Index and Mining Sector Indices.
This method assumes that the dividends which the Company pays during the period are reinvested in its shares and takes account of the increase in the Companys share price.
During the year options were granted over 1,324,900 shares of the Company at a subscription price of 1,150 pence 1,785 cents under The Lonmin Executive Share Option Scheme and The Lonmin Share Option Scheme 1994 and over 6,207 shares of the Company at a subscription price of 1,007 pence 1,563 cents under The Lonmin Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1994.
