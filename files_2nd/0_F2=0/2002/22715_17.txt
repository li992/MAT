NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2002 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of accounting The Group Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of Section 255A of, and Schedule 9A to, the Companies Act 1985 and with the Statement of Recommended Practice on Accounting for Insurance Business issued by the Association of British Insurers the ABI SORP dated December 1998.
The balance sheet of the holding company has been prepared in accordance with Section 226 of, and Schedule 4 to, the Companies Act 1985.
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The principal accounting policies adopted are described below.
b Basis of preparation of accounts As at 31 December 2001 the Group had negative net assets of 10.5m.
On 12 April 2002 the Group raised approximately 65m, net of expenses, by means of a successful Cash Placing and Placing and Open Offer of new shares.
In addition, on 25 April 2002, the Groups bankers provided a revised syndicated loan facility of 82.5m to the Group.
The continuing provision of these facilities is dependent on the Group passing a series of financial covenants as set out in the Term of Revolving Facilities dated 25 April 2002.
As at 31 December 2002 the Group had positive assets of 83.1m.
The Directors believe that the financial condition of the Group will continue to strengthen in 2003 and the Group will continue to pass its financial covenants.
The accounts have therefore been prepared on the going concern basis which the Directors believe to be appropriate.
c Changes in accounting policy The transitional disclosures required under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits have been presented in Note 40.
These disclosures are presented in addition to the requirements under the existing standard.
The Accounting Standards Board ASB has deferred mandatory full adoption and the full provisions of the standard are not required to be implemented until the 31 December 2005 year end.
The provisions of FRS 19 Deferred Tax have been adopted for the first time in these Financial Statements.
The impact of this change in accounting policy on the prior years result would not be material and accordingly this has not resulted in a restatement of the prior year deferred tax charge.
As required by the FRS, an analysis of the current tax charge together with the factors affecting the tax charge have been disclosed for the current and comparative periods.
d Basis of consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the assets, liabilities and results of the Company, all of its subsidiary undertakings, and the Groups underwriting activities through its participation on the Cox managed syndicates on an annual accounting basis.
Transactions between Group companies and between those companies and the Cox managed syndicates, to the extent of the Groups participation, are eliminated on consolidation.
On acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking all of its assets and liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Associated undertakings are companies other than subsidiary undertakings in which the Group holds 20% or more of the equity share capital for the long-term and over which the Group exercises significant influence.
Associated undertakings are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
e Premiums written Written premiums comprise the premiums on contracts incepting in the period.
Estimates are included of pipeline premiums due but not yet notified to the Group.
Written premiums are stated gross of commissions payable to intermediaries and exclusive of taxes and duties levied on premiums.
Commission due but not paid is included in creditors.
f Reinsurance to close To the extent that the Group increases its participation on a Cox managed syndicate from one Lloyds year of account to the next, it is a net recipient of premium to reinsure the earlier Lloyds year of account into the latter.
This share of the reinsurance to close premium is recognised as income at the end of the financial period when the related Lloyds year of account closes and is represented in the balance sheet by the related share of assets and liabilities transferred between the two Lloyds years of account of the relevant Cox managed syndicate.
g Unearned premiums A provision for unearned premiums is made which represents that part of gross and reinsurers share of premiums written which relates to unexpired terms of policies in force at the balance sheet date, calculated on a time apportioned basis.
h Acquisition costs Acquisition costs represent the expenses, both direct and indirect, of acquiring insurance policies written during the period.
Acquisition costs are spread over an equivalent period to that over which premium on the underlying business is earned.
Deferred acquisition costs represent the proportion of acquisition costs incurred in respect of unearned premiums at the balance sheet date.
i Claims incurred Claims incurred comprise all claim payments and internal and external settlement expense payments made in the period and the movement in the provisions for outstanding claims and settlement expenses, including claims incurred but not reported, net of salvage and subrogation recoveries.
Outwards reinsurance recoveries are accounted for in the same accounting period as the claims for the related direct or inwards reinsurance business being reinsured.
Cox Insurance Holdings Plc ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 41 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2002 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED j Claims outstanding Provision is made at the year end for the estimated cost of claims incurred but not settled at the balance sheet date, including the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to the Group.
The estimated cost of claims includes expenses to be incurred in settling claims and a deduction for the expected value of salvage and other recoveries.
The Company takes all reasonable steps to ensure that it has appropriate information regarding its claims exposures.
However, given the uncertainty in establishing claims liabilities, it is likely that the final outcome will prove to be different from the original provision established.
The estimation of claims incurred but not reported IBNR is generally subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than the estimation of the cost of settling claims already notified to the Group, where more information about the claim event is generally available.
Claims IBNR may often not be apparent to the insured until many years after the event, giving rise to the claims, has happened.
Classes of business where the IBNR proportion of the total reserve is high will typically display greater variations between initial estimates and final outcomes because of the greater degree of difficulty of estimating these reserves.
Classes of business where claims are typically reported relatively quickly after the claim event tend to display lower levels of volatility.
In calculating the estimated cost of unpaid claims the Group uses a variety of estimation techniques, generally based upon statistical analyses of historical experience, which assumes that the development pattern of the current claims will be consistent with past experience.
Allowance is made, however, for changes or uncertainties which may create distortions in the underlying statistics or which might cause the cost of unsettled claims to increase or reduce when compared with the cost of previously settled claims, including: changes in company processes which might accelerate or slow down the development and or recording of paid or incurred claims compared with the statistics from previous periods: changes in the legal environment: the effects of inflation: changes in the mix of business: the impact of large losses: and movements in industry benchmarks.
A component of these estimation techniques is usually the estimation of the cost of notified but not paid claims.
In estimating the cost of these the Group has regard to the claim circumstance as reported, any information available from loss adjusters and information on the cost of settling claims with similar characteristics in previous periods.
Large claims impacting each relevant business class are generally assessed separately, being measured on a case by case basis or projected separately in order to allow for the possible distortive effect of the development and incidence of these large claims.
Where possible the Group adopts multiple techniques to estimate the required level of provisions.
This assists in giving greater understanding of the trends inherent in the data being projected.
The projections given by the various methodologies also assist in setting the range of possible outcomes.
The most appropriate estimation technique is selected taking into account the characteristics of the business class and the extent of the development of each accident year.
Provisions are calculated gross of any reinsurance recoveries.
A separate estimate is made of the amounts that will be recoverable from reinsurers based upon the gross provisions and having due regard to collectability.
Property, aviation and accident business Property, aviation and accident business is short tail: that is there is not a significant delay between the occurrence of the claim and the claim being reported to the Group.
The costs of material claims notified to the Group at the balance sheet date are estimated on a case by case basis to reflect the individual circumstances of each claim.
The ultimate expected cost of claims is projected from this data by reference to statistics which show how estimates of claims incurred in previous periods have developed over time to reflect changes in the underlying estimates of the cost of notified claims and late notifications.
Motor business The estimated cost of motor claims excluding the cost of personal injury claims is calculated by reference to the projected number of claims, based on statistics showing how the number of notified claims has been developed over time, and the anticipated average cost per claim, based on historical levels adjusted to allow for movements in the variables described above.
The personal injury element of motor claims costs is estimated using the same method as used for liability claims described below.
In addition the estimate is assessed in the context of the historical development of paid and incurred claims and the implied loss ratios for each accident year.
Liability and marine claims These claims are longer tail than those of the other classes of business described above and so a larger element of the claims provision relates to incurred but not reported claims.
Claims estimates for the Groups marine and liability business are derived from a combination of loss ratio-based estimates and an estimate based upon actual claims experience using a predetermined formula whereby greater weight is given to actual claims experience as time passes.
The initial estimate of the loss ratio based on the experience of previous years adjusted for factors such as premium rate changes and claims inflation, and on the anticipated market experience, is an important assumption in this estimation technique.
In respect of liability claims, the assessment of claims inflation and anticipated market experience is particularly sensitive to the level of court awards and to the development of legal precedent on matters of contract and tort.
The liability class of business is also subject to the emergence of new types of latent claims but no allowance is included for this as at the balance sheet date.
Reinsurance recoveries Reinsurance recoveries in respect of estimated claims incurred but not reported are assumed to be consistent with the historical pattern of such recoveries, adjusted to reflect changes in the nature and extent of the Groups reinsurance programme over time.
An assessment is also made of the recoverability of reinsurance recoveries having regard to market data on the financial strength of each of the reinsurance companies.
Cox Insurance Holdings Plc 42 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED k Other technical provisions Provision is made for unexpired risks when it is anticipated, on the basis of information available at the year end, that unearned premiums will be insufficient to meet future claims and related expenses of business in force at the end of the year.
The provision for unexpired risks is included within technical provisions in the balance sheet.
l Investment income, expenses and charges Investment income comprises interest, realised gains and dividends and is dealt with on an accruals basis.
Interest receivable in respect of premium financing is recognised under the sum of digits method.
Interest payable and expenses incurred in the management of investments are accounted for on an accruals basis.
m Investment return Net investment return comprises investment income, unrealised gains and losses on investments, investment expenses and interest payable.
The longer-term return on investments owned by the underlying syndicates, together with the longer-term return generated by the funds at Lloyds which support the underwriting activities, initially allocated to the non-technical account, is transferred from that account to the technical account.
The actual net investment return from other activities is included within the non-technical account as part of operating profit.
The difference between the longer-term return allocated to the technical account and the actual return achieved on the underlying assets is recorded in the non-technical account after Operating profit on a longer-term rate of return, and disclosed as Short-term fluctuations in investment return.
n Profit commissions Profit commissions from the Cox managed syndicates are recognised as earned as the related underwriting profits are recognised on an annual basis.
Profit commissions are receivable when the relevant Lloyds year of account closes, normally after three years, and are received when the syndicates Financial Statements are despatched to Names.
o Brokerage fees and commissions Brokerage fees are generally recognised when cover commences.
Policy fees, including mid-term adjustments, are generally recognised when received.
Commissions are recognised on an accruals basis.
p Agency fees and Lloyds personal expenses Agency fees receivable are recognised over a three-year period in a pattern similar to the premium-earning pattern.
The fees levied by Lloyds on the Groups corporate members are expensed over a three-year period in the same pattern as agency fees are earned.
q Foreign exchange Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the times of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The syndicates maintain separate funds in sterling, United States and Canadian dollars.
All transactions expressed in United States and Canadian dollars are translated to sterling at the average quarterly rate of exchange ruling at the transaction date.
For Syndicate 1208, transactions during the year in other overseas currencies are expressed in sterling at the rates ruling at the transaction date.
Calendar year movements within the underwriting accounts normally include exchange differences on retranslating cumulative amounts brought forward.
For Syndicate 218, separate currency funds are maintained for each territory in which it operates.
Transactions during the year in other overseas currencies are expressed in sterling at the rates ruling at the transaction date.
r Investments in subsidiary undertakings In the Companys Financial Statements, shares in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provisions for any permanent diminution in value.
s Investments in associated undertakings In the Companys Financial Statements, investments in associated undertakings are stated at cost less provisions for any permanent diminution in value.
t Goodwill Purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions effected on or before 31 December 1997 has been taken directly to reserves.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions occurring since 31 December 1997 is stated at cost less amounts amortised.
The cost of goodwill is amortised over the estimated useful life of the asset.
The estimated lives of each goodwill asset acquired are separately considered on the basis of the merits of the underlying business.
In the first full year following the year of acquisition an impairment review is performed.
The value of the goodwill and life of the asset is reviewed and amended as necessary.
The current amortisation rate for goodwill is 5% pa on a straight line basis.
u Investment in syndicate capacity Investment in syndicate capacity is stated as cost less amounts amortised and after any provision for permanent diminution in value.
The cost is amortised over 20 years from the date relevant underwriting results are first recognised in the technical account.
v Investments Investments are stated at market value on an aggregate basis.
The aggregate difference between valuation and cost is recognised as an unrealised gain or loss in the non-technical account.
Cox Insurance Holdings Plc ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 43 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2002 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED w Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation less amounts depreciated.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful economic lives of the tangible fixed assets.
The rates of depreciation are, on a straight line basis, as follows: Furniture, fittings, equipment and motor vehicles 20-50% pa Freehold buildings 2% pa Leasehold property 10% pa or the lease term if shorter Software and IT development costs are capitalised to the extent that they relate to bringing business-critical systems and hardware into economic use.

Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
y Revaluation reserve The aggregate difference between valuation and cost of investments in the Company is accounted for in the revaluation reserve, which is stated net of deferred tax.
The aggregate difference between revalued amount and the net book value of fixed assets is accounted for in the revaluation reserve.
z Leases Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at their fair value on inception of the leases and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
The finance charges are allocated over the period of the lease on a straight line basis.
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account in equal annual instalments over the period of the lease.

The Group continues to apply the required transitional disclosure requirements.
bb Own shares The shares held in trust under the terms of the five share option schemes in operation are shown as Investment in own shares on the balance sheet at cost less an amortisation charge and provision for permanent diminution in value see Note 17.
This amortisation charge is recognised in the profit and loss account, being the difference between the book value of the shares purchased by the trust and the amount of consideration that the participants may be required to pay for the shares apportioned over the relevant period over which the options may be exercised.
2 THE LLOYDS AGREEMENT On 11 April 2002 the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an agreement with Lloyds relating to the proposed restructuring of the Groups activities.
Under this agreement a new subsidiary, Equity Red Star Limited formerly Cox Underwriting Limited, commenced underwriting on Syndicate 218 for the 2002 year of account, in substitution for the existing capital provider Cox Dedicated Corporate Member Limited CDCM on 1 July 2002.
Ultimately any further economic exposure of the Group in respect of the liabilities of CDCM estimated at the balance sheet date from its participation on Syndicate 1208 will be limited to the aggregate of: Future underwriting earnings from the 2002 and prior underwriting accounts Any value realised in the future from existing tax losses over and above the amount recognised in the balance sheet at 31 December 2001 875,000 of financing charges.
If the liabilities of CDCM were to deteriorate beyond this limit CDCM could become insolvent as the Company will not provide any further support to its subsidiary.
Should CDCM become insolvent, subsequent to the appointment of a liquidator the Company would no longer consolidate the assets and liabilities of CDCM.
However, until this time any future underwriting results and other changes in the value of assets and liabilities of CDCM will be reflected in the Groups profit and loss account.
Lloyds has agreed that it would continue to allow Cox to participate in underwriting on Syndicate 218 through Equity Red Star Limited if these circumstances were to arise.
Cox Insurance Holdings Plc 44 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 2 THE LLOYDS AGREEMENT CONTINUED The Company is of the view having taken legal advice that the Lloyds Agreement is binding on Lloyds and legally enforceable.
In common with all other businesses regulated directly or indirectly in the UK by the Financial Services Authority, the Group could be subject to the FSAs reserve power of intervention as set out in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
These powers cannot be overridden.
The Lloyds Agreement expressly entitles Lloyds to comply with any direction or requirement of the FSA and this is stated to apply notwithstanding the terms of the Lloyds Agreement.
The Lloyds Agreement states that Lloyds has made the FSA aware of the provisions of the Lloyds Agreement and the FSA has not sought to prevent Lloyds from entering into the Lloyds Agreement.
Nevertheless, there is a risk that the FSA may intervene in the future in such a manner as may effectively alter or disapply the provisions of the Lloyds Agreement, or may in some other way expose the Group other than CDCM and CDCM No 2 Limited formerly Equity Red Star Limited to underwriting liabilities in respect of the 2002 and prior years of account, beyond the exposure described above.
As the Group remains subject to regulation by Lloyds there is a risk which the Directors have been advised is a remote risk that Lloyds may be entitled to make future changes to the Groups regulation which adversely affects its position: notwithstanding the expressed terms of the Lloyds Agreement to the contrary.
3 POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS On 15 January 2003 Christopherson Heath Group Limited disposed of the whole of the share capital of The Company of Veteran Motorists Limited for a cash consideration of 795,000.

Cox Insurance Holdings Plc ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 59 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2002 28 RECONCILIATION OF MOVEMENT IN EQUITY SHAREHOLDERS FUNDS Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2002 2001 000 000 Profit loss for the financial period 26,074 201,341 Shares issued, net of issue costs 67,593 572 Revaluation of freehold property 11 12 Net increase decrease in equity shareholders funds 93,656 200,781 Opening equity shareholders funds 10,510 190,271 Closing equity shareholders funds 83,146 10,510 29 WORLD TRADE CENTER The Groups exposure to losses from the terrorist attack of 11 September 2001 in the United States arise entirely from its participation on Syndicate 1208.
This loss is unprecedented in the insurance industry and as such the extent of the gross and net loss to the Group is subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than for other insurance losses.
The claims have had a material effect on the Companys business.
As at 24 March 2003, notifications received from the Xchanging Claims Services amounted to $270m.
Reinsurance recoveries of $142m offset by net reinstatement premiums payable of $20m to reinstate cover for future losses reduce these claims to a net notified loss of $148m.
Because of the uncertainty inherent in the evaluation of this loss the Directors have included a degree of caution in arriving at their estimated gross ultimate loss of $294m and net loss after subrogation of $193m.
Exchange rate fluctuations have generated a net benefit of 7m when converted to sterling resulting in a net loss after subrogation of 120m.
Settlements have been made against these claims during the year.
As at 31 December 2002 the Group had remaining provisions outstanding in respect of this event of 95m gross and 72m net of reinsurance and subrogation.
The assessment of the direct property loss, other than where buildings have been totally destroyed, and related business interruption claims, is subjective and therefore the estimate uncertain.
The process of arriving at estimations of inwards reinsurance claims is more subjective than arriving at estimations of direct insured losses.
This is because the Company has to rely upon either the direct insurers own estimates or the intermediate reinsurers estimates in the cases of reinsurance and retrocession respectively.
Outstanding claims notifications received from policyholders, intermediaries and loss adjusters in respect of losses incurred have been subject to review and amendment by management in the light of other information available to them.
Additional estimates have been made of further claims which may be notified in the future based on a comprehensive review of exposures in respect of insurance and reinsurance policies issued by Syndicate 1208, and assigning of probability factors to each exposure.
The estimates are sensitive to assumptions about the legal basis for the liability to losses from the World Trade Center towers and the extent to which reinsurance policies written are claimed upon, as follows: The question whether the attack on the World Trade Center WTC is one or two losses is now the subject of litigation in New York.
Having taken legal advice management considers that a one-loss basis is the correct interpretation of the contract made.
An action has been started in the US courts for a declaration in resolution to this issue by one of the insurers involved and all other insurers have been brought into that dispute.
The question is unlikely to be resolved finally for several years.
If the Courts were to conclude that the attack should be deemed to be two insured events then the estimate of the Groups gross loss would increase by 53.4m and its net loss by 9.3m.
The extent to which losses arise from risk excess and catastrophe reinsurance policies written will vary particularly if a wide definition of business interruption is adopted.
At present, exposures are provided for where property losses and business interruption are known or expected to have occurred in the immediate vicinity of the towers.
Remoter claims or advices of potential losses have not been provided for.
The Company is exploring the subrogation opportunities that may be open to it.
Typically, if a property loss is caused by a third party, subrogation can lead to substantial recovery of the value of the claim from the third partys liability insurers.
Reinsurance recoveries represent the amounts calculated to be recoverable from the syndicates reinsurers on the gross losses reported.
As currently estimated the gross ultimate claims exceed the vertical limit of the Groups whole account reinsurance protections.
The calculation of recoveries is particularly sensitive to whether or not reinsurers follow direct writers if the courts deem that the attack on the WTC constitutes two losses rather than one.
Having taken legal advice management consider that the treatment from the reinsurers should not be disadvantageous to the Company, although it is difficult to take a final view prior to the resolution of the dispute on the underlying claim and the basis of any decision on the insurance claim.
If the reinsurers were able to argue successfully that their loss was on a one-event basis, even though the inwards claim was deemed to be two events, then the net loss would increase materially from estimates currently held.
The amount of reinsurance recoveries would also be sensitive to any insolvencies among the Companys reinsurers, with the assumption being made that there will be no major reinsurer default.
The Company has no material contractual disputes with any of its reinsurers at the present time in relation to this loss.
Whilst the Directors consider that the WTC loss estimate is the best estimate that can be made on the basis of information currently available, the estimate is subject to significant uncertainties as described above.
Further information could be received which may cause the estimate to be increased or decreased.
The cost or benefit of these adjustments will be reflected in the Financial Statements for the period in which the adjustments are made.
It may take a number of years to resolve some of these uncertainties.

Accordingly, a provision of this amount has been made which will be utilised as and when the Company and its subsidiary are called upon to fund these liabilities to the syndicate.
The analysis of deferred tax is shown in Note 31.
31 DEFERRED TAX The balances can be analysed as follows: Group Company 2002 2001 2002 2001 000 000 000 000 Provided on: Underwriting result 25,933 39,647 Other timing differences 266 266 25,933 39,647 266 266 The deferred tax asset arises, largely, as a result of underwriting losses incurred during 2001, which are not yet allowable for tax.
It is anticipated that when these losses become allowable for tax other profits in the Group will more than offset these amounts.
The maximum amount that future taxation liabilities might be reduced in respect of the losses recognised in the accounts is 47m 2001 61m.
As a result, there are unrecognised deferred tax assets at 31 December 2002 of 21,067,000 in respect of underwriting losses 2001 20,829,000.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains on revaluation of freehold land and buildings as such tax would become payable only if the properties were sold, and there is no intention to do so and in any event any gain would be reduced to nil due to the availability of indexation allowance.
32 TERMINATION PROVISION A provision in relation to the termination and costs of running-off the business of the Commercial Division, which the Group finally ceased writing during 2002, has been included within claims outstanding based on the Directors estimate of the likely costs of running-off the business.
It is estimated that all of the costs associated with running-off the business will be incurred by 31 December 2009.
The gross provision of 18.6m has been reduced by offsetting expected future investment return of 11.9m resulting in a net provision of 6.7m.

Cox Insurance Holdings Plc 66 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 39 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES CONTINUED c Leases The Group has annual commitments before recovery from Cox managed syndicates under operating leases where the lease expires: Premises Equipment 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2002 2001 2002 2001 000 000 000 000 Within one year 159 810 39 32 Two to five years 1,342 981 8 6 After five years 1,968 603 588 563 3,469 2,394 635 601 d Guarantees The Company has provided an indemnity to a bank in respect of the banks obligations to guarantee the 7% fixed rate secured loan notes 1999 2006.
These loan notes amount to 9,361,000 at 31 December 2002 and are shown as creditors in these Financial Statements.
The Group operates as a single Group for VAT purposes and each member of the VAT group is jointly and severally liable for any VAT liabilities of any other member within the VAT group.
At 31 December 2002 a Group Company had issued guarantees in respect of premiums payable to insurance operations of 52m 2001 45m.
e Contingencies and commitments Of the total assets disclosed on the Groups balance sheet, 364,391,000 2001 365,300,000, are subject to Lloyds Premium Trust Funds PTFs or will become subject to the PTFs on realisation, of which 323,345,000 2001 309,700,000 are investments.
These funds will only be released to the Group on the closing of the 2000, 2001 and 2002 years of account in 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively.
Included within cash at bank is 15,900,000 2001 nil in respect of the Crowe transaction.
This is held within a trust fund by a Group company, and as costs are incurred equivalent amounts are released to free cash.
40 PENSION SCHEMES The Group operates several pension schemes: some are defined contribution schemes money purchase schemes and others are defined benefit schemes final salary schemes.
The assets of all the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
All final salary schemes are closed to new entrants and all new employees are eligible to join the Group Personal Pension Plan, a money purchase scheme.
Following a review by KPMG the largest final salary pension scheme, the Christopherson Final Salary scheme, and the associated Money Purchase scheme, has been discontinued so no further benefit accrues.
There is a deficit on the scheme that the Company has agreed to make up over a five-year period.
The most recent draft valuation of the Christopherson Final Salary scheme was at 1 July 2002 by an independent qualified actuary.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rate of increase in pensions.
It is assumed that the investment returns would be 6% pa and that salary increases would be nil as the scheme has been discontinued.
Limited Price Indexation increases are assumed to be at 2.5%.
Increases in deferment are assumed to be at 5% pa as guaranteed.
The market value of the schemes assets was 19,260,000 representing an ongoing funding value of 75%.
As at 1 July 2002 the scheme had a deficit of 6,535,000.
The funding rate was adjusted during 2002 to eliminate this deficit over five years.
Of this deficit approximately 66% is rechargeable to Equity Red Star Limited Syndicate 218, of which the Company has a 57% interest.
The Group expense in respect of the defined benefit schemes during the year was 1,270,146.
There was an accrual of 104,557 in the balance sheet at the year end in respect of unpaid defined benefit contributions.
In addition, Group contributions payable to the defined contribution scheme were 3,274,058.
There were no arrears or prepaid contributions as at 31 December 2002.
Two of the final salary schemes are held within the Lloyds Superannuation Fund.
The pension expense in respect of the Lloyds Superannuation Scheme was 312,909.

Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2002.
The current service cost will increase as a percentage of pensionable payroll for all defined benefit schemes, except for the Christopherson Final Salary Scheme, which is closed to future accrual.
Prior year restatement The Directors have made the decision to restate a number of the prior year comparatives as a more accurate position is available at 31 December 2002 than was previously available at 31 December 2001.
The financial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under FRS 17 using the projected unit valuation method are: 31 December 2002 31 December 2001 % % restated Discount rate 5.5-5.6 5.8-5.9 Inflation rate 2.3-2.4 2.5-2.6 Increases to pensions in payment 2.0-2.4 2.3-2.5 Increases to deferred pensions 2.3-5.0 2.6-5.0 Pensionable salary increases 3.5-3.9 3.6-4.0 The assets in the scheme and the expected rate of return were: Long-term Long-term rate of return rate of return expected at Value at expected at Value at 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2002 2002 2001 2001 %000 %000 restated restated With-profits policies 5.6-6.7 12,473 6.5-7.5 13,951 Bonds 4.5 8,612 4.8-7.1 2,663 UK equities 8.0 3,053 8.0-8.1 Cash 5.5 376 4.8-7.1 9,125 Total market value of assets 24,514 25,739 Present value of scheme liabilities 34,791 32,549 Deficit in the scheme 10,277 6,810 Related deferred tax asset 3,083 2,043 Net pension liability 7,194 4,767 If the above amounts had been recognised in the Financial Statements, the Groups net assets and profit and loss reserve at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001 would be as follows: 2002 Group 2001 Group 000 000 restated Net liabilities Net liabilities excluding pension liability 83,146 10,510 Pension liability 7,194 4,767 Net assets liabilities including pension liability 75,952 15,277 Cox Insurance Holdings Plc 68 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 40 PENSION SCHEMES CONTINUED Prior year restatement continued 2002 2001 Group Group 000 000 adjusted Reserves Profit and loss reserve excluding pension liability 27,311 199,149 Pension liability 7,194 4,767 Reserves including pension liability 20,117 203,916 The following amounts would have been recognised in the performance statements in the year to 31 December 2002 under the requirements of FRS 17: 2002 Group 000 Operating profit Current service cost 1,136 Total operating charge 1,136 Other finance income Expected return on pension scheme assets 1,398 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 1,880 Net return 482 Statement of total recognised gains and losses STRGL Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 2,175 Experience gains and losses arising on the scheme liabilities 1,393 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the scheme liabilities 2,321 Actuarial loss recognised in STRGL 3,103 Movement in deficit during the year Deficit in scheme at beginning of year restated 6,810 Current service cost 1,136 Contributions 1,254 Other net finance income 482 Actuarial loss 3,103 Deficit in scheme at end of year 10,277 Cox Insurance Holdings Plc ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 69 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2002 40 PENSION SCHEMES CONTINUED Prior year restatement continued 2002 Group %000 Details of experience gains and losses for the year to 31 December 2002 Difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets 2,175 Percentage of scheme assets 9 Experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities 1,393 Percentage of the present value of the scheme liabilities 4 Total amount recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses 3,153 Percentage of the present value of the scheme liabilities 9 Lloyds Superannuation Scheme The Lloyds Superannuation Scheme is a multi-employer scheme and consequently the Group is not able to separate out its share of the assets and liabilities and therefore will account for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme as permitted by the exemptions provided in paragraph 9 of FRS 17.
The most recent valuation at 31 March 2001 indicated that the Lloyds Superannuation Scheme had a deficit of 19.2m.
Due to the financial status of the Lloyds Superannuation Scheme and the potential for active employers to be responsible for non-company related deficits, the Trustee of the Lloyds Superannuation Scheme has sought legal advice on sectionalisation.
This matter is due to go before the High Court in the Summer of 2003 where the Scheme and employers subject to all employers agreeing and some representative defendants on behalf of the various classes of membership, will seek judgement on what is a fair apportionment of assets and liabilities under Trust law.
Judgement will also be sought on whether the effect of this fair apportionment benefits or is detrimental to any class of member at the expense or benefit of any other class of member, or to the employers.
The Scheme proposals submitted to the High Court would, if approved, leave a broadly neutral position to the Group.
While it is possible that the Group may be required to fund a greater share of the liability of this scheme, the Directors believe this is remote and no further material exposure will result.
