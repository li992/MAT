Smith Group Pension Scheme.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out by independent actuaries as at 5 April 2001, using the projected unit method.
The actuaries reviewed the methods and assumptions underlying the actuarial valuation of the Scheme and, as in previous years, a valuation basis linked to market value was used to value investments.
The principal assumptions used at 5 April 2001 were as follows: Valuation discount rate pre-retirement 6.6% post-retirement 5.6% Rate of increase in salaries 3.9% Pension increases 2.4% At the valuation date, the market value of the assets of the scheme was 527.3m and the actuarial value of the assets was 117% of the value of accrued benefits after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The surplus of assets over past service liabilities is being used to suspend contributions until the results of the next triennial actuarial valuation are known, subject to the continuing consent of the Trustee.
The next triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme will be as at 5 April 2004.
An amount of 2.0m 2001 2.2m in respect of the UK defined benefit scheme is included in debtors falling due after more than one year.
The Group has also made provision for unfunded pensions for those Executive Directors whose benefits under the funded Scheme are restricted by the Inland Revenue earnings cap.
The pension cost for the year has been assessed as 0.6m 2001 0.8m and the balance sheet liability at 30 April 2002 as 3.4m 2001 2.8m.
In France the Group operates a defined benefit scheme which is fully funded through a segregated fund.
The disclosures required under the transitional arrangements within FRS 17 Retirement Benefits have been calculated by qualified independent actuaries based on the most recent full actuarial valuation at 5 April 2001, updated to 30 April 2002.
The financial assumptions used were: 2002 % per annum Rate of increase in salaries 4.1% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.6% Inflation 2.6% Discount rate 5.9% The assets in the scheme and the expected rates of return were: 2002 Expected rates of return Market value %m Equities 7.6 348.9 Bonds, Gilts and Cash Weighted average 5.2 154.1 Total 503.0 The following amounts were measured in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17: 2002 m Total market value of assets 503.0 Present value of scheme liabilities 513.5 Deficit in the scheme 10.5 Related deferred tax asset 3.2 Net pension liability 7.3 49 DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2002 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 6 Pensions continued The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which due to the timescales covered may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The schemes assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and their fair value may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present value of the schemes liabilities is derived from cashflow projections over long term periods and thus is inherently uncertain.
If these amounts had been recognised in the financial statements, the Groups net assets and profit and loss account reserve at 30 April 2002 would be as follows: 2002 m Net assets 438.9 SSAP 24 prepayments and liabilities 0.1 Pension liability 7.3 Net assets including pension liability 431.7 Profit and loss account reserve excluding pension liability 209.3 SSAP 24 prepayments and liabilities 0.1 Pension reserve 7.3 Profit and loss account reserve including pension liability 202.1 7 Exceptional items and amortisation of intangibles 2002 2001 m m Impairment of tangible fixed assets and goodwill 32.4 Amortisation of intangibles see note 12 1.7 1.1 Amortisation of goodwill of associates 0.3 Exceptional loss on termination of operations: Costs of closure 4.3 33.8 5.4 Tax on exceptional items 6.4 1.2 Total 27.4 4.2 In the second half of the year the Group carried out an extensive review of its operating assets, as a result of which a 32.4m impairment charge against the carrying value of tangible fixed assets and goodwill has been charged in arriving at operating profit.
A substantial part of this charge relates to the Groups Office Products Manufacturing business and the investment in Turkish corrugated packaging.
The exceptional loss on termination of operations in the previous year related to the closure of the Groups Bracknell corrugated packaging plant.

The number of shares excludes the weighted average number of the Companys own shares on the Groups balance sheet during the year see note 15 of 0.7m 2001 0.6m.
The Directors believe that the presentation of an adjusted earnings per share, being the basic earnings per share adjusted for exceptional items and amortisation of intangibles, helps to explain the underlying performance of the Group.
