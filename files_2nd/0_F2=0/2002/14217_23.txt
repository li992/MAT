By order of the Board: J R Swynnerton, Secretary 10 March 2003 Notes 1 Members must be registered as the holders of shares 48 hours before the time fixed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting in order to be able to attend and vote at the meeting in respect of those shares.
2 A member entitled to attend and vote is entitled to appoint a proxy or proxies to attend and, on a poll, vote instead of him.
A proxy need not be a member of the Company.
3 The Register of Directors Interests in the Companys shares will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during usual business hours from the date of this notice until the date of the meeting and at the place of the meeting from 11.45 am until the end of the meeting.
4 It is a requirement of Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 that the Directors power to allot shares be authorised by the Articles or by an ordinary resolution.
9 to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting gives the Directors a general authority to allot shares up to a maximum nominal value of 3,989,744 representing one-third of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company.
This authority will expire at the conclusion of the 2004 Annual General Meeting.
It is a requirement of Section 89 of the Companies Act 1985 that any shares being issued for cash must in general be offered to existing shareholders pro-rata to their existing holdings.
However, where the Directors have been granted a general authority to allot shares they may be given power by the Articles or by a special resolution to allot shares pursuant to such authority as if the statutory pre-emption rights described above did not apply.
10 to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting accordingly gives the Directors power to make allotments of shares in connection with a rights issue and otherwise to make allotments to a maximum aggregate nominal amount of 598,461 representing approximately 5 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as if the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 1985 regarding pre-emption rights did not apply.
This power will expire at the conclusion of the 2004 Annual General Meeting.
The Directors have no current intention of using these powers but consider it advisable to pass both resolutions in order that they can be prepared to take advantage of future situations which may arise.
It is a requirement of Section 166 of the Companies Act 1985 that a company shall not make a market purchase of its own shares unless the purchase has first been authorised by the company in general meeting.
11 to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting as a special resolution gives the Directors power to make market purchases of the Companys shares up to a maximum of 11,969,200 representing approximately 10 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company.
This power will expire on the earlier of 1 August 2004 and the conclusion of the 2004 Annual General Meeting.
It is intended that purchases will only be made on the London Stock Exchange.
This is not intended to imply that shares will be purchased.
The Directors believe that it is in the best interests of all shareholders that the Company should have the flexibility to make market purchases of its own shares.
The effect of such purchases would be to reduce the number of shares in issue and, accordingly, the Directors would make such purchases only if it would be in the best interests of shareholders generally and, in any case, if it would result in an increase in earnings per share.
