Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and under the historical cost accounting rules.
The Group was created by a group reconstruction whereby, on 24 May 2002, the shareholders in Intertek Testing Services Holdings Limited ITSHL, formerly Intertek Testing Services Limited, exchanged the whole of their shareholdings in ITSHL in return for shares in a newly formed holding company, Intertek Testing Services plc.
The acquisition of ITSHL by Intertek Testing Services plc was accounted for in accordance with the principles of merger accounting as set out in FRS 6: Acquisitions and Mergers and Schedule 4A to the Companies Act 1985.
By adopting this accounting treatment the consolidated financial information included in these accounts has been shown as though the reconstruction had occurred prior to 1 January 2001.
Parent company Intertek Testing Services plc was incorporated on 9 August 2001 as Alnery No.
At 31 December 2001 the Company had an issued share capital of 1 ordinary share of 1.
On 10 April 2002 the Company made an exchange offer for all the issued share capital of Intertek Testing Services Limited until then the parent company of the Group for a consideration satisfied by the issue of one new share in the Company for each corresponding share in Intertek Testing Services Limited.
On 24 May 2002 the Company was re-registered as a public limited company and changed its name to Intertek Testing Services plc.
Under section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries together with the Groups share of net assets and results of associates, made up to 31 December 2002.
New subsidiaries are included from their respective dates of acquisition during the period except where they have been merger accounted.
The results of subsidiaries disposed of during the period are included up to the date of disposal.
An associate interest is one in which the Group has a long-term interest, usually from 20% to 50% of the equity voting rights, and over which it actually exercises significant influence.
The Groups share of the profits less losses of associates is included in the consolidated profit and loss account on the equity accounting basis and the holding value of associates in the Group balance sheet is calculated by reference to the Groups equity in the net assets of such undertakings.
In the Companys financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less amounts written-off.
Foreign currencies The results of operations and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries and associated undertakings are translated into sterling at the average of the month end rates of exchange for the year.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at closing rates of exchange except where rates are fixed under contractual arrangements.
The difference between the net profit translated at average and at closing rates of exchange is included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses as a movement in shareholders equity.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation to closing rates of exchange of opening shareholders equity, long term foreign currency borrowings used to finance foreign currency investments, and foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against shareholders equity are also reflected as movements in shareholders equity.
All other exchange differences are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
36 Intertek Annual Report and Accounts 2002 www.
com 1 Accounting policies continued Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation, which is provided, except for freehold land, on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets down to its expected residual value, mainly at the following annual rates: Freehold buildings and long leasehold land and buildings 2% Short leasehold land and buildings term of lease Plant, machinery and equipment 10% to 33.3% Leases Assets held under finance leases are treated as if they had been purchased at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
This cost is included in tangible fixed assets and depreciation is provided over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life.
The corresponding obligations under these leases are included within borrowings.
The finance charge element of rentals payable is charged to the profit and loss account to produce a constant rate of interest.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Stocks Stocks and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing stocks and work in progress to their present condition and location.
Turnover Turnover represents the total amount receivable for services provided and goods sold, excluding sales-related taxes and intra-group transactions.
Turnover is recognised when the relevant service is completed or goods delivered.
Deferred tax Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Deferred tax assets in respect of timing differences are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits to offset the future reversal of these timing differences.
Pension benefits Contributions payable under defined contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account as they fall due.
The Group has a number of defined benefit pension schemes.
Following the implementation in 2001 of FRS 17: Retirement Benefits, the defined benefit schemes assets are valued at market value and the schemes liabilities are discounted to present values using high quality corporate bond rates.
The resultant pension scheme surpluses, to the extent that they are considered recoverable, or deficits are recognised in full on the face of the balance sheet, net of deferred taxation.
The increase in the present value of the liabilities expected to arise from the employees services in the accounting period is charged to profits.
The expected return on the schemes assets less the interest on the present value of the schemes liabilities during the accounting period is shown as Other finance income.
Actuarial gains and losses, net of deferred tax, are recognised in the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Goodwill Purchased goodwill, being the difference between the fair value of consideration payable and the fair value of separable net assets acquired, in respect of acquisitions since 1 January 1998 is capitalised in accordance with the requirements of FRS 10: Goodwill and Intangible Assets, and is amortised on a straight line basis over the Directors estimate of useful life, which is up to 20 years.
37 Intertek Annual Report and Accounts 2002 www.
com Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued Goodwill continued Purchased goodwill in respect of acquisitions before 1 January 1998 was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition in accordance with the accounting standard then in force.
When a subsequent disposal occurs any goodwill previously written off to reserves is written back through the profit and loss account and in respect of acquisitions since 1 January 1998, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated after charging the unamortised amount of any related goodwill.
Impairment of goodwill is recorded when it becomes clear that the carrying value of goodwill in relation to a specific business may not be recoverable.
Financial instruments These instruments are used to manage the Groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
Instruments accounted for as hedges are designated as a hedge at the inception of contracts.
Interest differentials on derivative instruments and amounts receivable and payable on interest rate instruments are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the contracts.
Gains and losses on foreign currency hedges are recognised on maturity of the underlying transaction.
Gains and losses arising on hedging instruments which are cancelled due to the termination of the underlying exposure are taken to the profit and loss account immediately.

22 Pension schemes The Group operates a number of pension plans throughout the world.
In most locations, these are defined contribution arrangements.
However, there are significant defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom, United States, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
These are all funded plans, with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Other defined benefit plans in certain countries are not considered to be material and are therefore accounted for as if they were defined contribution plans.
The schemes in Hong Kong and in the United Kingdom were closed to new entrants with effect from 1 December 2001 and 1 April 2002 respectively.
a The total pension cost for the Group was: 2002 2001 m m Defined contribution schemes 5.6 5.9 Defined benefit schemes - current service cost 2.5 2.7 8.1 8.6 The pension cost for the defined contribution plans is the contribution payable by the Group during the year.
There were no past service costs during the year in respect of the defined benefit plans.
For closed schemes, under the projected unit method as required by FRS 17, the current service cost as a percentage of relevant defined benefit pensionable payroll will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.

27 Financial instruments a Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate and foreign currency risks.
Whilst these hedging instruments are subject to fluctuations in value, such fluctuations are offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged.
The Group is not a party to any leverage derivatives and does not hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
The notional amount of derivatives summarised in this footnote does not represent amounts exchanged by parties and, thus, are not a measure of the exposure of the Group through its use of derivatives.
The amounts exchanged are calculated on the basis of the notional amount and the other terms of the derivatives, which relate to interest rate or exchange rates.
57 Intertek Annual Report and Accounts 2002 www.
com Notes to the financial statements 27 Financial instruments continued Counterparties to financial instruments expose the Group to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance, but it does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations given their high credit ratings.
The Group does not demand collateral when entering into derivative financial instruments.
The credit exposure of interest rate and foreign currency contracts is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at the end of each period.
The following numerical disclosures relate to the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in FRS 13: Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments.
For all the numerical disclosures, short term debtors and creditors, which arise directly from the Group operations, apart from the disclosures, have been excluded as permitted under FRS 13. b Foreign exchange risk management A substantial portion of the Groups sales is derived from customers located outside the United Kingdom.
In addition the net assets of foreign subsidiaries represent a significant portion of the Companys shareholders funds.
The Groups administrative operations are conducted in several countries outside of the United Kingdom and operating costs are incurred in currencies other than the pound sterling.
Because of the high proportion of international activity, the Groups income is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.
Risk of two kinds arise as a result: a transaction risk, that is, the risk that currency fluctuations will have a negative effect on the value of the Groups commercial cash flows in various currencies, and a translation risk, that is, the risk of adverse currency fluctuations in the translation of foreign currency operations and foreign assets and liabilities into pound sterling.
The Group enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies.
Some of the contracts involve the exchange of two foreign currencies, according to local needs in foreign subsidiaries.
The term of the currency derivatives do not exceed one year.
The table below summarises by major currency the contractual amounts of the Groups forward exchange contracts in pound sterling.
The buy amounts represent the pound sterling equivalent of commitments to purchase foreign currency, and the sell amounts represent the pound sterling equivalent of commitment to sell foreign currencies.
2002 2001 Buy Sell Buy Sell m m m m United States Dollar 14.0 9.5 Euro 3.2 1.6 The following table presents information regarding the forward exchange contract amounts in pound sterling equivalent and the estimated fair value of the Groups forward contracts with a positive fair value assets and a negative fair value liabilities : 2002 2001 Contract Contract amount Fair value amount Fair value m m m m Assets 3.2 11.1 0.2 Liabilities 14.0 0.1 Net liabilities assets 10.8 0.1 11.1 0.2 58 Intertek Annual Report and Accounts 2002 www.

d Currency exposure of the Groups net monetary assets liabilities These exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating units involved.
In view of the hedges taken out by the Group, the currency exposure i. e. those transactional exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account, of the Groups net monetary assets liabilities is not material.
e Interest rate risk management The Group has a significant amount of borrowings bearing interest at variable rates.
To reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations, the Group enters into interest rate swap agreements.
The interest rate swap agreements convert certain long term borrowing at floating rates based on inter-bank borrowing rates in various countries to fixed rates, that are lower than those available to the Group if the fixed-rate borrowing were made directly.
Under the interest rate swap agreements, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.

Financial liabilities The fair values, maturity, interest rate and exchange profile of borrowings is shown in the table under the exchange rate sensitivity section below.
The maturity profile of other financial liabilities of 4.1m is shown in note 16.
This liability is mainly US dollar denominated and is non-interest bearing.
The fair value approximates its carrying value of 4.1m.
f Fair value of financial instruments The Groups on-balance sheet financial instruments, with the exception of borrowings, are generally short term in nature.
Accordingly, the fair value of such instruments approximates their carrying value.
The fair value of variable rate borrowings approximates carrying value because such loans reprice at market rate periodically.
The fair value and carrying value of long term borrowings, including current portion, was 241.3m 2001: 366.9m and 241.3m 2001: 348.0m respectively.
The fair value of off-balance sheet financial instruments are as follows: 2002 2001 m m Forward exchange contracts 0.1 0.2 Interest rate swaps 1.8 0.6 60 Intertek Annual Report and Accounts 2002 www.
com 27 Financial instruments continued g Exchange rate sensitivity The table below provides information about the maturity and interest rate profile of the Groups borrowings.
Accordingly, the counterparty risk is reduced from the nominal to the fair value of the derivatives.
Therefore, the Groups counterparty exposure under foreign exchange contracts was nil 2001: 0.2m and interest rate swaps nil 2001: nil.

The Group is not currently party to any legal proceedings other than ordinary litigation incidental to the conduct of business.
On the basis of currently available information, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome, arising from any such ordinary litigation is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group in the foreseeable future.
The Group holds a professional indemnity insurance policy that provides coverage for certain claims from customers.
The Directors consider this policy adequate for normal commercial purposes.
29 Related party transactions In connection with the acquisition from Inchcape plc, the Company was required to pay an acquisition advisory fee of 3.8m to Charterhouse Development Capital Holdings Limited, a majority shareholder.
During the year 2.8m was paid 2001: 1m paid.
Transactions with Directors are disclosed in the Remuneration report on page 26.
