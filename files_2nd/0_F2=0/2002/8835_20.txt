Exceptional items Operating exceptional items Impairments In 2001, the Group performed impairment reviews in respect of property, plant and equipment and goodwill when subsidiaries experienced sustained losses as a result of the deterioration of market conditions in the aero sector, resulting in impairment charges of US$1.0m.
Non-operating exceptional items Loss on sale termination of discontinued operations The Group closed its aero engine overhaul business in Connecticut in March 2002 and decided to divest of its other aero engine overhaul business.
A charge of US$13.6m was made in 2001 to reduce the carrying value of stocks and fixed assets and to provide for closure costs in respect of the business in Connecticut.
A related tax credit of US $4.1m was provided against this charge.

Financial instruments The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources, and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions primarily interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
The purpose of such transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these are summarised below.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies at floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps and caps to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The Groups current policy is to keep between 25% and 75% of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest.
At the year-end, approximately 56% of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps.
Liquidity risk As regards liquidity, the Groups policy has throughout the year been that, to ensure continuity of funding, at least 90% of its borrowings should mature in more than a year.
At the year-end, 96% per cent of the Groups borrowings were due to mature in more than four years.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities and sterling cash balances.
60 John Wood Group PLC Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2002 17.
Financial instruments continued Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies, primarily US dollars and pounds sterling.
The Group also has significant overseas subsidiaries which operate in North America and South America and whose revenues and expenses are denominated predominantly in US dollars.
In order to protect the Groups US dollar balance sheet from the movements in the exchange rates, the Group finances its net investment in most overseas subsidiaries primarily by means of borrowings denominated in their functional currency.
The Group has not hedged its investment in companies with a sterling functional currency as these investments were made when the Group reported in sterling.
The Group is therefore exposed to exchange movements in reserves on the retranslation of these companies at closing rate.
Some of the sales of the Groups businesses are to customers in foreign locations.
These sales are priced in local currency but invoiced in the currencies of the customers involved.
Where possible, the Groups policy is to eliminate all significant currency exposures on sales at the time of sale through forward currency contracts.
The recently introduced exchange controls in Venezuela will potentially result in increased foreign currency risk whilst they are in place.
Short-term debtors and creditors Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than the currency risk disclosures.
Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities The interest rate risk profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December, after taking account of the interest rate and currency swaps used to manage the interest and currency profile, was as follows: Financial Floating Fixed liabilities rate rate on which financial financial no interest Total liabilities liabilities is paid US$m US$m US$m US$m US Dollars - Financial liabilities 215.8 90.8 125.0 - Canadian Dollars - financial liabilities 20.1 20.1 - - Other currencies - financial liabilities 10.0 10.0 - - At 31 December 2002 245.9 120.9 125.0 - US Dollars - Financial liabilities 362.4 252.4 110.0 - - Convertible redeemable preference shares 88.1 60.0 28.1 - Sterling - Convertible preference shares 3.1 - - 3.1 Canadian Dollars - financial liabilities 19.4 19.4 - - Other currencies - financial liabilities 3.9 3.9 - - At 31 December 2001 476.9 335.7 138.1 3.1 All the Groups creditors falling due within one year other than bank and other borrowings are excluded from the above tables either due to the exclusion of short-term items or because they do not meet the definition of a financial liability, for example tax balances.
John Wood Group PLC 61 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2002 17.
Financial instruments continued The Group has entered into US$125m of interest rate swaps from floating to fixed rates as at 31 December 2002 2001 : US$110m.
The weighted average interest rate excluding margin currently 0.6% for fixed rate financial liabilities was 4.5% 2001 : 4.8%.
This rate is fixed for between 4 and 5 years 2001 : 5 years.
Floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates, based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents, which are fixed in advance for periods of between one month and three months.
Interest rate risk of financial assets The Group has no significant financial assets, other than short term deposits, cash at bank and short-term loans to associates and joint ventures.
Floating rate cash earns interest at between UK base rate and UK base rate less 10 basis points.
No interest was charged on the loan to associate up to 30 September 2001 but interest is receivable as a special dividend at 5% above LIBOR on a sale of shares in ASCO plc.
From 30 September 2001, interest was charged at floating market rates including an appropriate margin see note 14.
Interest on loans to joint ventures is charged at floating market rates.
Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the carrying amount of the groups financial liabilities other than short-term trade creditors and accruals at 31 December was as follows: 2001 Convertible 2002 redeemable Deferred preference consideration Debt Total Debt shares Total US$m US$m US$m US$m US$m US$m In one year or less, or on demand - 10.7 10.7 3.3 - 3.3 In more than one year but not more than two years 6.7 - 6.7 382.4 - 382.4 In more than two years but not more than five years 5.8 222.7 228.5 - 88.1 88.1 12.5 233.4 245.9 385.7 88.1 473.8 62 John Wood Group PLC Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2002 17.
Financial instruments continued Borrowing facilities The group has undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at 31 December 2002 of US$369.2m 2001 : US$92.1m in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date.
These are floating rate facilities and were renewed on 9 April 2002.
These facilities expire on 9 April 2007.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December 2001 and 2002.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
Set out below the table is a summary of the methods and assumptions used for each category of financial instrument.
2002 2001 Book Fair Book Fair value value value value US$m US$m US$m US$m Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the groups operations: Short-term borrowings 10.7 10.7 3.3 3.3 Long-term borrowings 222.7 222.7 382.4 382.4 Deferred consideration 12.5 12.5 -- Convertible preference shares -- 3.1 78.8 Convertible redeemable preference shares -- 88.1 95.9 Loans to joint ventures 10.9 10.9 17.1 17.1 Loans to associate 3.3 3.3 2.9 2.9 Short-term deposits 24.8 24.8 21.8 21.8 Cash at bank and in hand 31.4 31.4 107.5 107.5 Derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate and currency profile: Interest rate swaps - 6.1 -1.4 Forward foreign currency contracts 1.3 1.3 -- Under the Groups accounting policy, forward contracts that are entered into in order to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities are revalued to balance sheet rates with net unrealised gains losses being shown as part of the underlying asset or liability being hedged.
Changes in the value of the swap as a result of changes in interest rates are not included in the book value of the relevant asset or liability.
At 31 December 2002, the Group had entered into forward contracts to sell 31.0m for US dollars at rates between 1 $1.5656 and 1 $1.5716.
These contracts were entered to hedge sterling assets in dollar functional companies.
John Wood Group PLC 63 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2002 17.
Financial instruments continued Summary of methods and assumptions Interest rate swaps, currency swaps and Fair value is based on market price of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date.
Forward foreign currency contracts have been forward foreign currency contracts valued at spot rate on the balance sheet date as the contracts mature within one year.
Short-term deposits, short and long-term The fair value of short-term deposits, short and long-term loans and overdrafts, deferred consideration and loans to joint ventures and borrowings, deferred consideration and associates approximates to the carrying amount because of the short loans to joint ventures and associates maturity of interest rates in respect of these instruments.
The long term loans are generally rolled over for periods of three months or less.
Preference shares The fair value of the convertible preference shares at 31 December 2001 was based on the higher of fair market value in respect of share options and the latest transaction price.
The dividend payable on the convertible redeemable preference shares equated to the market rate for long-term borrowings.
The fair value applied was therefore the par value plus the portion of the 20% redemption premium payable accrued to that date.
Currency exposures To mitigate the effect of the currency exposures arising from its net investments overseas the Group either borrows in the local currencies of its main operating units or swaps other borrowings, using currency swaps, into such local currencies.
Gains and losses arising on net investments overseas and the financial instruments used to hedge the currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The Group has typically not hedged its net investments in sterling functional companies.
The tables below show the extent to which Group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currency.

Payment of dividends The Company declares its dividends in US dollars.
As a result of the shareholders being mainly UK based, dividends will be paid in sterling, but if you would like to receive your dividends in dollars please request the companys Registrar to send you an election form.
All shareholders will receive dividends in sterling unless requested in writing.
If you are a UK based shareholder the company encourages you to have your dividends paid through the BACS Bankers Automated Clearing Services system.
The benefit to shareholders of the BACS payment method is that the Registrar posts the tax vouchers directly to them, whilst the dividend is credited on the payment date to the shareholders Bank or Building Society account.
Shareholders who have not yet arranged for their dividends to be paid direct to their Bank or Building Society account and wish to benefit from this service should request the Companys Registrar to send them a Dividend Interest mandate form.
Sterling dividends will be translated at the closing mid-point spot rate on 9 May 2003 as published in the Financial Times on 10 May 2003.
