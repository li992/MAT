It had 725 active members in the dened benefit section and 334 active members in the dened contribution section at 31st December 2002 924 and 196 respectively at 31st December 2001.
The most recent triennial valuation of the UK Scheme was performed as at 1st January 2000 and disclosed that the actuarial assets of the UK Scheme represented 136% of the liability for the benets that had accrued to members at that date allowing for future increases in earnings and pensions.
The pension cost of the dened benefit section has been determined across the membership as a whole by independent qualied actuaries, Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow, and is based on an interim valuation of the UK Scheme at 1st January 2002.
The valuation was carried out using the projected unit method.
The principal assumptions used to calculate the UK Schemes liabilities were that ination would average 2.5% per annum, that deferred pensions would increase in line with ination and that increases to pensions in payment, the return on investments and the general increase in salaries would be 0.1% per annum, 3.4% per annum and 1.5% per annum above ination respectively.
Assets were taken at their market value with an increase in respect of underperformance over the last three years over a portfolio constructed to match the liabilities of the dened benefit section.
The interim valuation at 1st January 2002 showed that the market value of the dened benefit sections assets was 363.4 million.
After allowing for the underperformance increase, the value put on the UK Schemes assets was 408.4 million.
These assets represented 139% of the liability for benets.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of the regular costs of the UK Scheme was 11.7 million 12.3 million less the variation of 10.8 million 13.9 million for the amortisation of the surplus over the average remaining service lives of employees 11 years using the percentage of payroll method.
The net pension cost charged was 0.5 million a credit of 1.6 million which incorporated a reduction in respect of interest on the prepayment existing at the start of the year.
Over the year, the contributions to the dened benefit section totalled 4.6 million 5.5 million.
The prepayment at 31st December 2002 was 11.2 million 7.1 million.
The Directors will review the contribution policy for the dened benefit section of the UK Scheme after consultation with the Groups rm of actuaries following completion of the triennial valuation of the UK Scheme as at 1st January 2003.
