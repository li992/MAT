The principal schemes are located in the UK the Smiths Industries Pension Scheme and the TI Group Pension Scheme and in the USA and are of the defined benefit type, with assets held in separate trusteeadministered funds.
For the principal schemes the regular pension cost is assessed using the Projected Unit method.
The most recent full actuarial valuations of the two principal UK schemes were performed as at 31 March 2001 for the Smiths Industries Pension Scheme and as at 5 April 2001 for the TI Group Pension Scheme.
The most recent valuations of the principal USA plans were performed at 1 August 2001.
At these dates the market value of the principal schemes assets was 2,082m for the UK and $485m for the USA and the aggregate funding levels were 124% and 100% respectively.
The funding levels were determined by comparing the market value of each of the funds assets with the value of benefits accrued at the valuation date.
In the UK, the actuarial valuations made allowance for future general annual salary increases of 4% and for pension increases of 2.5%.
The discount rate assumed in assessing the present value of accrued future benefits was 6% for pensioner liabilities and 7% for active member liabilities.
In the USA discount rates of 7.257.75% were used and allowance was made for salary increases of 4.5%4.75%.
The regular pension cost is assessed at each actuarial valuation.
The variation from regular pension cost, which recognises the excess of assets over liabilities of the pension schemes, is spread over the average remaining working life of relevant employees, generally between 10 and 15 years.
Contributions to these schemes are made on the advice of independent qualified actuaries with the objective that the benefits be fully funded during the scheme members working lives.
A prepayment of 155.6m 2001 145.4m is included in debtors in respect of the UK schemes.
Other creditors includes 12.9m 2001 4.4m in respect of the USA plans.
The pension costs of other schemes operated by the group were assessed in accordance with local practice.
The group provides a defined contributions 401K plan for its USA employees and post-retirement healthcare benefit plans, principally in the USA.
The cost of the postretirement healthcare benefits is assessed by independent qualified actuaries and provided for in accordance with UITF6 see note 25.
The major assumptions used in the latest plan valuations are interest rates of 7.25% and a long-term rate of increase in healthcare costs of 5%.
FRS17 Retirement Benefits The Accounting Standards Board has proposed a deferral of full mandatory adoption of Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits FRS17 following an announcement by the International Accounting Standards Board that it is to review IAS19, the present international standard for post-employment benefits.
Instead the existing transitional disclosure requirements will continue.
For the purposes of the additional disclosures required by FRS17 the most recent full actuarial valuations of the principal schemes have been updated to 31 July 2002 by qualified independent actuaries.
The principal assumptions used in updating the valuations are set out below.
The disclosures relate to all retirement benefit plans in the UK and the USA.
Plans in other territories are not material.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in updating the most recent valuations of all the UK and USA schemes to 31 July for FRS17 purposes were: 2002 2001 UK USA UK USA Rate of increase in salaries 3.9% 4.2% 4.0% 4.5% Rate of increase in pensions 2.5% n a 2.5% n a Discount rate 6.0% 7.0% 6.0% 7.25% Inflation rate 2.4% 3.25% 2.5% 3.5% Healthcare cost increases 5.0% 4.5% 10% per annum reducing 1% per annum to 5% per annum in 2008 10% per annum reducing 1% per annum to 5% per annum in 2007 Smiths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 37 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 12 POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued The assets in the schemes and the expected rates of return as at 31 July 2002 were: 2002 2001 UK schemes USA schemes UK schemes USA schemes Long-term Value Long-term ValueLong-term ValueLong-term Value rate of return m rate of return m rate of return m rate of return m Equities 8.25% 828 9.0% 158 8.0% 1,012 9.0% 160 Government bonds 4.9% 810 5.5% 39 5.2% 738 5.5% 150 Corporate bonds 6.0% 251 7.0% 55 6.0% 371 7.25% 23 Property 7.25% 116 n a n a 7.0% 118 n a n a Other 4.9% 78 3.5% 10 5.0% 81 3.5% 6 Total market value 2,083 262 2,320 339 Present value of funded pension scheme liabilities 2,075 355 1,990 350 Surplus deficit 8 93 330 11 Unfunded pension plans 20 4 17 5 Post-retirement healthcare 16 79 15 70 28 176 298 86 Related deferred tax asset liability 867 89 33 Net pension asset liability 20 109 209 53 The net UK pension liability of 20m represents, net of related deferred tax, surpluses of 84m and deficits of 79m in funded pension plans and unfunded pension plan post-retirement healthcare balances of 25m.

This is lent through to the relevant subsidiary on inter-company loans at commercial arms length terms.
Smiths strong cash generation in the businesses is tax-efficiently remitted to the UK to repay central borrowings.
Local working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements are typically funded by local bank facilities, which are not guaranteed by the parent company.
The company seeks to manage its borrowings and business risks to maintain its current credit ratings.
Borrowings for periods more than 364 days require Board approval.
The company seeks to maintain a spread of maturity profiles on its debt and no more than 30% of the companys net debt will be held on borrowings due within one year, without firm plans for refinancing or repayment.

The maturity profile of our bonds is well spread, maturing in 2005, 2010 and 2016.
The floating-rate borrowings are related to LIBOR in the UK, to LIBOR and bank funding rates in the USA, and to LIBOR and bank base rates in Japan.
Borrowings in continental Europe are based mainly on EURIBOR.
The borrowings of all non-UK operations are in local currencies to provide a structural hedge against foreign currency movements on the overseas assets.
The company has two private placement debts.
The first with an outstanding principal of $100m 2001 $100m 8.34% Senior Notes was repaid in full on 5 August 2002.

Both debts are placed by Smiths Group North America, Inc. with major USA institutional investors and are guaranteed by Smiths Group plc.
The medium-term borrowings include our syndicated bank facility of 500m that runs until 2004 together with an unsecured nominal 300m 6.375% bond maturing in 2005 which is largely swapped to floating interest rates.
The long-term borrowings greater than five years of 297m 2001 297m relate to Smiths Group plc unsecured nominal 150m 7.875% bonds maturing in 2010 which are swapped to floating interest rates and to unsecured nominal 150m 7.25% bonds maturing in 2016 which remain fixed rate.
To ensure better than adequate liquidity committed unused credit facilities of at least 100m are maintained at all times.
At the year-end the company had the following unused committed borrowing facilities: 2002 2001 m m Expiring within one year 65.0 35.0 Expiring between one and two years 337.0 Expiring after two years 440.9 402.0 475.9 The company also has a number of uncommitted facilities and overdraft lines provided by its core relationship banking group.

23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS a Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The company uses financial instruments to raise finance for its operations and manage the related financial risks.
Acceptable derivative instruments for hedging are forward currency contracts, currency and interest rate swaps and options, spot and forward rate agreements, collars, caps, floors, cylinders and similar bank products.
Counterparties for hedging are limited to our relationship banks with credit ratings of Aor better to avoid unnecessary credit risk.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than the currency risk disclosures.
The companys policy forbids trading or speculation in financial instruments.
Where the underlying transaction being hedged disappears or is cancelled or does not arise, the related financial instrument must also be cancelled or otherwise negated as soon as possible.
Set out below is a year-end comparison of the book value and current fair value of the companys financial instruments by category.
Fair values of interest rate swaps, currency swap and forward currency contracts are based on the market prices of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date.
Where market prices are not available, the fair value has been calculated by discounting cash-flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.

The transactions to which the forward currency contracts relate are mainly expected to occur in 2003 and 2004.
Currency rate swaps protect the group from transaction exposure in line with its policy as set out in note 23 e and interest rate swaps are used to ensure that the groups debt is broadly evenly split between fixed and floating rate funds.

48 Smiths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued e Currency exposures Transactions All material cross-border trading contracts or forecast commitments are hedged at inception by appropriate derivative financial instruments, with the companys core banks as counterparties.
The company takes competitive quotes on all major foreign exchange contracts through its central foreign exchange programme.
For smaller deals, the company has centralised the entire groups foreign exchange dealings through an e-based foreign exchange trading system operated by a major bank.
The analysis below shows the net monetary assets and liabilities of the group companies that are not denominated in their functional currency and therefore give rise to exchange gains and losses in the profit and loss account.
The amounts shown in the table take into account the effect of hedging instruments used to manage these exposures.

Translation The company protects its reserves from foreign currency fluctuations by ensuring that at least 75% of the total net overseas operational assets are offset, either by borrowings in the respective currency or by currency swaps.
The company does not hedge the translation of its overseas profits, although does mitigate currency effects through foreign interest costs and by applying average exchange rates for the year.
Gains and losses arising on net investments overseas and the financial instruments used to hedge the currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
