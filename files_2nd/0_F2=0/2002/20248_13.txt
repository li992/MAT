The adjustment in respect of prior periods foreign tax arises principally as a result of a reduction in tax rates in subsidiary undertakings, resulting in an overprovision.
The main reason for the prior period adjustment in respect of deferred tax relates to a movement between deferred tax and current tax.
Aberdeen Asset Management 39 Notes to the Accounts continued Continuing Exceptional 2002 2001 activities items Total Total Factors affecting the tax charge for the period 000 000 000 000 The tax assessed on the profit on ordinary activities for the period is higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK.
The differences are explained below: Profit before tax 22,104 3,826 18,278 24,589 Profit multiplied by standard rate of UK corporation tax of 30% 6,631 1,148 5,483 7,377 Effect of: Non taxable income 20 20 1,600 Disallowed expenses 296 296 649 Difference between capital allowances for year and depreciation 229 229 200 Other timing differences 503 503 1,553 Amortisation of goodwill 6,368 6,368 3,783 Depreciation and loss on disposal of non-qualifying assets 182 182 150 Effect of foreign tax rates below 30% 4,854 4,854 3,936 Tax on non-UK group dividends net of double tax relief 3,026 3,026 3,176 Amounts written off investments for which no relief available 796 796 Adjustments in respect of prior years 241 241 Total current tax, UK and foreign 12,144 352 11,792 8,246 Factors affecting future tax charge The groups overseas profits are subject to overseas tax rates which are normally lower than the standard rate of UK corporation tax 30%.
The tax benefit of lower tax rates is only one of timing to the extent that these overseas profits are subsequently remitted to the UK.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised on tax losses being carried forward in certain overseas subsidiaries due to the lack of certainty as to the ability to use these losses: had they been recognised the deferred tax asset would have been 1.7m.
In accordance with FRS 19 a deferred tax asset has not been recognised on connected party capital losses of 9m which arose in the year.
Profit for the financial year The profit dealt with in the accounts of the Company was 20,621,000 2001 37,403,000.

The Directors believe that the Groups results are more fairly represented by a measure of earnings per share which excludes exceptional items and amortisation of goodwill and therefore also present earnings per share figures stated before these items are charged to the profit and loss account.
The two measures of earnings per share can be reconciled as follows: Basic Diluted 2002 2001 2002 2001 After goodwill amortisation & exceptional items FRS 14 basis 3.29p 8.51p 3.28p 8.26p Add: amortisation of goodwill 11.23p 7.83p 11.21p 6.97p Add: exceptional items, net of attributable taxation 1.99p 4.78p 1.98p 4.26p Before goodwill amortisation & exceptional items 16.51p 21.12p 16.47p 19.49p Group Company Present value Unit in force Unit trust of life trust management assurance management contracts business Total contracts 10 Fixed intangible assets 000 000 000 000 At 1 October 2001 57,517 57,517 502 Acquisitions 20,868 20,868 Amortisation for year 1,565 1,565 At 30 September 2002 57,517 19,303 76,820 502 Aberdeen Asset Management 41 Notes to the Accounts continued Group Company Consolidation Purchased Purchased goodwill goodwill Total goodwill 11 Goodwill 000 000 000 000 Cost At 1 October 2001 360,826 6,297 367,123 5,451 Additions 515 515 224 Adjustment to acquisition expenses 355 355 At 30 September 2002 361,181 6,812 367,993 5,675 Amortisation At 1 October 2001 15,557 1,004 16,561 962 Charge for year 18,863 777 19,640 766 At 30 September 2002 34,420 1,781 36,201 1,728 Net book value At 30 September 2002 326,761 5,031 331,792 3,947 At 30 September 2001 345,269 5,293 350,562 4,489 During the year ended 30 September 2001 the Company completed a number of acquisitions and expenses of acquisition were estimated in respect of these acquisitions using the information available subsequent to the date of acquisition.
In the year to 30 September 2002 these estimated expenses were revised to actual costs incurred with a consequent increase in goodwill.
During the year the Group acquired a 40% interest in Schroder Asset Management subsequently renamed Aberdeen Asset Management Company Limited, a fund management company based in Thailand.
Additions to other unlisted investments includes an investment in Globe Financial Investments Limited, a Maltese fund management business of 789,000 and the subscription for 6 million of class D preference shares in Enhanced Zero Trust PLC EZT as part of a reconstruction of that company undertaken in conjunction with EZTs bankers.
The redemption value of this investment is 10.1 million at 31 May 2011, equivalent to a gross redemption yield of 6% per annum.
To reflect the current uncertainty in the split capital market sector in which EZT invests, and the ranking of this investment behind the banks investment, the Directors have applied a discount to the projected redemption value of this investment and the resulting provision for impairment has been recorded.
The Group has an investment in the ordinary shares of Lombard International Assurance SA Lombard, a Luxembourg registered life company.
This holding represents approximately 15% of the equity of Lombard.
The investment has been valued on the basis of the relevant share of Lombards most recently available embedded value, resulting in an uplift in value in the current year of 2,465,000.
During the year the Group received repayments of 1,538,000 of capital invested in private equity partnerships.
Loan repayments of 1,799,000 were received from Century Group Limited during the year.
At 30 September 2002, 51,000 own shares of 10p, which were not conditionally gifted, under option or held for the beneficial ownership of employees, were held by the Companys Employee Share Ownership Trust market value 40,000.
The rights to dividends on these shares have been waived until such time that they are held beneficially by the employees.
On 30 November 2000, the Company subscribed for Discounted Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock 2030 issued by Aberdeen Murray Johnstone Limited.
The principal amount of the loan stock is 172,950,000 and the cost to the Company was 150,000,000.
During the year a discount released of 11,743,000 2001 9,162,000 was added to the cost of the investment.

US$37.5 million 7% Convertible Subordinated Loan Notes were issued to The Phoenix Companies Inc on 15 April 1996.
The Notes are convertible at any time, at the option of the holder, into a maximum of 17,441,860 ordinary shares at a price of US$2.15.
If not converted the Loan Notes are repayable on 29 March 2003, except that the Company has the option to extend the term of all or part of the Loan Notes for a maximum of two years thereafter.
The Company currently expects that it will exercise its option to extend the term.
However, no formal notice to this effect has yet been served and therefore the debt has been classified as due within one year.
The Company has entered into currency swap arrangements to hedge the exchange risk related to the loan note liability.

10 million floating rate guaranteed unsecured loan stock was issued to Life Assurance Holding Corporation in part consideration of the Companys acquisition of G Developments Limited on 3 June 2001.
The loan stock is repayable on 30 June 2006 and bears interest at the rate of 1% above six month LIBOR.
100 million 5.875% Convertible Bonds 2007 were issued on 14 January 2002.
At the option of the Bondholders, the Bonds are convertible into Ordinary Shares of the Company at any time after 24 February 2002 at an initial conversion price of 520p per share.
Unless previously redeemed, purchased and cancelled, or converted, the Bonds are redeemable on 14 January 2007 at their principal amount.
The Groups borrowings are subject to a number of covenants which, in accordance with standard practice, are reviewed and discussed with the lenders from time to time.
The significance of these covenants will diminish considerably following the reduction in borrowings Aberdeen Asset Management 51 Notes to the Accounts continued which will result from the proposed divestment of the property division, expected to occur in the first quarter of 2003.
The Company and the lenders have therefore agreed to defer discussion of covenants, which would otherwise require amendment, on and after 31 March 2003 so that the detailed structure of this transaction can be taken into account.
The Board, having regard to its business plans, is confident that the Group will continue to comply with covenants for the foreseeable future.
Interest on the term loans is at a variable rate of 1.25% above LIBOR but the Group has undertaken a cross-currency interest rate swap on 88.6 million 2001 100 million of these amounts with the effect of fixing the interest rate at 5.03% p. a. plus the margin of 1.25%.
The interest on this swap is payable in US dollars while the principal amount of the loan remains denominated in sterling.
The US dollar liabilities, comprising the Convertible Loan Notes, bear interest at a rate of 7% p. a. fixed to the earlier of date of repayment or conversion note 22 or 29 March 2003.
Thereafter the interest rate increases to 7.5% p. a.
The financial liabilities on which no interest is payable represent deferred considerations.
They principally comprise fixed asset investments.
The floating rate financial assets principally comprise cash and deposit balances which earn interest at rates which fluctuate according to money market rates.
The Group has a 15 million bank overdraft limit for the purposes of providing liquidity if exceptional levels of short term timing differences arise on unit trust settlements.
This facility is reviewed on an annual basis.
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are not materially different to their carrying amounts.
Foreign net investment The majority of the Groups subsidiaries use sterling as their reporting currencies.

In the prior year the Group accounted for deferred tax on the upward revaluation of the Groups investment in Lombard International Assurance SA.
FRS 19 permits provision for revaluation surpluses only where there is a binding commitment to sell the asset.
There was no such commitment as at 30 September 2001.
The adoption of FRS 19 has been recorded as a prior year adjustment.
The effect of this has been to decrease the opening deferred tax provision by 1.9 million and to increase the opening revaluation reserve by 1.9 million note 19.
The elements of deferred taxation are as follows: Group Company 2002 2001 2002 2001 restated restated 000 000 000 000 Deficit on defined benefit pension scheme note 27 1,650 1,806 Accelerated capital allowances 345 345 Other timing differences 2,718 3,671 1,851 2,453 1,413 1,865 2,196 2,453 Timing differences represent deferred taxation in respect of the profits of certain overseas subsidiary undertakings to the extent that dividends are expected to be remitted to the UK in the foreseeable future.

Both schemes are closed to new membership and to future service accruals.
The Group also operates three defined contribution schemes worldwide.
The total contributions charged to profit in respect of the schemes operated by the Group were as follows: 2002 2001 000 000 a In respect of the Groups money purchase schemes: Pension cost charged to profit on ordinary activities 4,332 3,509 b In respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes: Pension cost charged to profit on ordinary activities 145 494 CGA Staff Pension Fund The cost was based on the independent actuarial valuation carried out as at 1 April 2001, made by a qualified actuary using the Minimum Funding Requirement MFR basis.
The main assumptions were: Discount rate before retirement 9% after retirement 8% Pensions increases 3.5% Price inflation 4% The market value of the schemes assets at 1 April 2001 was 4,093,000 and the actuarial value of these assets represented 89% of the value of the benefits that had accrued to members.
There is now no further accrual of benefits in the scheme.
The Company has agreed to make contributions of 145,000 annually until 2007 to bring the scheme back to 100% funding on the MFR basis.
Murray Johnstone Retirement Benefits Plan The cost was based on the independent actuarial valuation carried out as at 30 June 1999, made by a qualified actuary using the Projected Unit Method.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 30 June 2001, by a qualified independent actuary using the Minimum Funding Requirement MFR basis.

58 Aberdeen Asset Management 29 Contingent liabilities The UK split capital closed-end fund sector has suffered acutely since its fide-rating in September 2001.
The Group has acted as manager of a total of 20 split capital closed-end funds Splits in recent years.
The value of gross assets managed for Splits peaked at 3.4 billion including 1.2 billion financed by borrowings in January 2001.
This represented 11.4% of the Groups total assets under management at that time and approximately 25% of the assets of the Splits sector as a whole.
At 30 September 2002 the Group managed assets of 1.3 billion including 235 million of borrowings for 15 Splits, representing 5.4% of the Groups total assets under management.
Since the year end, the total has reduced to 1.1 billion 4.7% of total assets managed for 13 Splits.
Across the sector a number of Splits have suspended trading in their shares and, of these, 4 were managed by Aberdeen Aberdeen Preferred Income, Aberdeen High Income and Media & Income, each of which is in administrative receivership, and Leveraged Income which has been placed in liquidation, which at the time had aggregate borrowings of 192 million against assets of 167 million.
The Financial Services Authority FSA has commenced a review of the Splits sector and Aberdeen is among the companies which have been interviewed by the FSA and been requested to provide further information.
The Group has at all times co-operated with the FSA in their review and will continue to do so.
Aberdeen has also given evidence on two occasions to the Treasury Select Committee, which is carrying out its own review.
There has also been speculation that legal actions may be brought against a range of parties involved in the split capital sector.
No legal action has been served against any company in the Aberdeen Group and in the event that the Group were to be included in any such proceedings these would be defended robustly.
The Board believes that the Group has at all times acted with integrity and in accordance with all relevant regulations and laws.
It is important to understand that Splits are not regulated products under the Financial Services Act, although the companies which manage these funds are themselves regulated by the FSA.
Having taken legal advice and reviewed the present progress of regulatory proceedings, the Board does not consider that any provision is appropriate.
However, the Group does manage one UK retail unit trust, the Aberdeen Progressive Growth Unit Trust Progressive, which invests in the zero dividend preference shares of a range of Splits.
Progressive is a regulated product in terms of the Financial Services Act.
The FSA has been investigating into the marketing and management of this fund, which also comes within the remit of the Financial Ombudsman Service FOS.
The FOS has the power to require compensation to be paid to complainants, where it upholds relevant complaints.
The FOS will usually make a preliminary determination, which a firm may challenge, followed by a final ruling.
This will bind the firm but not the complainant, although it may then seek judicial review of an adverse decision.
Zero dividend preference shares were, until the latter part of 2001 generally considered by market commentators to be low risk, but not no-risk, investments and Progressive was promoted by Aberdeen as being a low risk fund.
The Board considers that all marketing material issued in relation to Progressive complied with regulatory requirements and fairly described the nature of the fund and risks involved in the light of available information and opinion in the market at the time.
The Company is in correspondence with the FOS, which has recently indicated its areas of concern in relation to Progressive Growth.
Although the FOS has not provided details of individual complaints that have been referred to it, the Companys legal advice is that there are good grounds for arguing that any complaints should not be upheld.
Further, were the FOS ultimately to adjudicate against the Company, any compensation would need to take into account the circumstances of individual cases.
There is currently so much uncertainty about both the number and quantum of claims that the Board considers it impossible to make any reasonable estimate of any potential liability to the Group.
Accordingly, and as required by FRS 12, no provision for such claims has been made in these accounts.
However, the Board recognises the distress suffered by individual investors in Progressive as a result of the rapid change of sentiment and removal of liquidity from the zero dividend preference share sector since late 2001.
The Group is working towards providing an uplift package to these investors, intended to take effect in August 2005, but no decision or commitment has been made in this respect.
To put this in context, the peak value of Progressive was approximately 80 million in September 2001.
The portfolio is currently valued at some 22 million, based on the market prices of the individual holdings of zero dividend preference shares.
However, the portfolio stands at a discount of around 50% to the estimated underlying net asset values attributable to these holdings of approximately 45 million.
In the absence of any market movements or other change, this discount would be expected to narrow over time as the maturity dates of individual holdings are reached.
In the event that the contingent issues referred to above were to give rise to liabilities significantly in excess of the Groups insurance cover, certain asset sales would need to be considered.
The Board is confident that, if this were to become necessary, such disposals could be achieved at above book value, including attributable goodwill.
Whilst the position is necessarily uncertain, the Board considers, having regard to the above courses of action open to them, that it is appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis.
