FRS 19 requires that deferred tax be recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
The Group has decided to adopt the policy of discounting deferred tax balances as permitted by FRS 19.
The effect of the restatement of 2001 is to increase the tax charge on profit on ordinary activities before taxation, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, having excluded imputed interest income, which does not attract tax, the ordinary tax charge by 1.3 percentage points.
This equates to 6 million in the year to 30 September 2001.
The ordinary tax charge for the year to 30 September 2001 has increased by 6 million as described above, but there is an additional exceptional UK deferred tax credit of 6 million.
The total tax charge has thus remained constant at 92 million.
However, the restatement of deferred tax balances has increased the currency translation loss on foreign currency net investment by 3 million from 81 million to 84 million, and has also reduced goodwill by 54 million.

This net income will be matched with the interest cost arising on the loans for which the swaps provide a hedge.

All acquisitions were accounted for under the acquisitions method of accounting.
Adjustments to prior year acquisitions relate to the restatement of the values of assets and liabilities in the light of knowledge arising from a more extended period of ownership and additional consideration and costs, all in respect of acquisitions made during the year ended 30 September 2001.
There was no material difference between operating profits arising from acquisitions and cash flows contributed by those acquisitions.
23 Pensions Pension schemes operated The Group operates a number of pension arrangements throughout the world which have been developed in accordance with statutory requirements and local customs and practices.
The majority of schemes are self administered and the schemes assets are held independently of the Groups finances.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
UK Schemes Within the UK there are two main arrangements: i Compass Group Final Salary Pension Plan ii Compass Pension Scheme Both plans are defined benefit arrangements operated on a prefunded basis.
The funding policy is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the Actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
The Compass Pension Scheme was set up from 1 February 2001 to mirror the Granada Pension Scheme and accept the seamless transfer of pension rights for the former Granada Group PLC employees who transferred to Compass Group PLC.
New employees join the Compass Group Final Salary Pension Plan.
It was agreed that after 1 February 2001, all accrued rights in respect of the Granada Pension Scheme of and in respect of the employees and former employees including pensioners of, or who are attributed to, the hospitality businesses previously owned by Granada Compass plc, should be transferred to the Compass Pension Scheme, together with an agreed share of all the assets of the Granada Pension Scheme.
This transfer is to be effected under the terms of a specific agreement, the Pension Demerger Deed.
The share of assets is to be determined on a share of fund basis, whereby the assets to be transferred are to be in the same proportion of all of the relevant assets of the Granada Pension Scheme as the liabilities to be transferred to the Compass Pension Scheme bear to the whole of the relevant liabilities of the Granada Pension Scheme.
It is estimated by the actuary to the Granada Pension Scheme, on the basis of values derived from the most recent formal actuarial valuation of the Granada Pension Scheme that approximately 30% of the assets and liabilities of the Granada Pension Scheme will be transferred to the Compass Pension Scheme under the arrangements set out in the Pension Demerger Deed.
The transfer of assets and liabilities from the Granada Pension Scheme to the Compass Pension Scheme is subject to agreement between the respective actuaries to those schemes and to all applicable legal and Inland Revenue requirements being met.
An interim transfer was made at the end of October 2001.
Compass Group PLC 63 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 23 Pensions continued Overseas Schemes In the USA the main plan is a defined benefit plan.
The funding policy, in accordance with government guidelines, is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
In Denmark, the Netherlands and Ireland the Group operates insured defined benefit pension plans where the Group contributions represent the insurance companies assessment of the annual cost of the benefits earned in that year.
In other countries Group employees participate primarily in state arrangements to which the Group makes the appropriate contributions.
Regular pension costs SSAP 24 The pension cost of these plans for the year was 50 million 2001: 38 million of which 25 million 2001: 20 million relates to overseas plans.
The pension cost of the Compass Group Final Salary Pension Plan for the year to 30 September 2002 has been assessed in accordance with the advice of professionally qualified consulting actuaries based in the UK on an actuarial valuation at 6 April 2001.
This was made using the projected unit method.
The most significant actuarial assumptions adopted for determining pension costs and contributions were as follows: i Rate of return on investments: pre-retirement 6.5% per annum post-retirement 6.5% per annum current pensioners 6.5% per annum ii Rate of increase in pensionable pay 4.0% per annum iii Rate of increase in pension 3.0% per annum The asset valuation method used was the market value approach.
The market value of the plans assets was 157 million as at 6 April 2001.
The results of the valuation in the UK showed that the value of the assets at 6 April 2001 represented 99% of the value of the accrued benefits after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable pay and pensions.
Payments to the plan total 3 million more than the profit and loss pension cost: consequently, this amount is included within prepayments.
There have been no material changes to the pension arrangements since the valuation and review dates.
The assets of the plans are held in separate funds administered by trustees and are independent of the Groups finances.
Actuarial assumptions adopted for determining pension costs and contributions for the Compass Pension Scheme were similar to those of the Compass Group Final Salary Pension Plan.
Pending the finalisation of an actuarial valuation as at 31 December 2001, the costs of the scheme have been assessed on the basis of the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
At the balance sheet date, outstanding employer and employee contributions amount to 6 million and 2 million respectively.
The assets in the USA Group final salary pension plan had a market value of $105 million as at 1 January 2002, representing 103% of the accrued benefits under the scheme, after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable pay and pensions in the course of payment.
The most significant assumptions used for the USA Group final salary Pension Plan were: i Expected rate of return on assets 10.0% per annum ii Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.0% per annum iii Discount rate 7.0% per annum The pension cost charged to the profit and loss account is such as to spread the cost of pensions over the working lives with the Group of employees who are members of the plans.
Unfunded Pension Liabilities Unfunded pension liabilities have accrued for a total of 45 individuals.
The total value of the unfunded liabilities at 30 September 2002 was 17 million 2001: 16 million, which has been provided for in full.
