The deferred tax benefit arising has been treated as an exceptional item.

The difference between carrying value and fair value is also considered to be immaterial for oating rate bank loans and finance lease obligations.
Interest bearing investments included subordinated loan notes that were valued by discounting the associated future cash ows to 31 December 2001.
The difference between carrying value and fair value was considered immaterial.
2 Equity investments represent equity holdings in trade investments.
The fair value of listed investments is equal to the year end market price.
3 Other financial assets include investments in unit trusts and capital funds that are valued at market value.
4 The non-equity minority interest represents 45% of the 8% non-equity redeemable cumulative preference shares of Amersham Biosciences, which was extinguished in 2002 on the purchase of the 45% minority in Amersham Biosciences.
5 Other financial liabilities largely comprise discounted deferred consideration on acquisitions, for which book value is not materially different to fair value.
6 The book value of the unsecured loan notes includes a fair value adjustment of 3.5m 2001 5.4m, that arose as a result of the acquisition of the notes at the time of the merger with Nycomed.
The fair value quoted at 31 December is based on the present value of future cash ows of the notes.

f Hedges As explained in the Financial review on page 33, the groups policy is to hedge exposures to interest rate risk and currency exposures using a variety of derivative financial instruments.
Gains and losses on these instruments are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Gains or losses on the fair value of financial instruments are classied as unrecognised where they have not yet been recorded in the financial statements.
Where gains or losses have crystallised, but are carried forward in the balance sheet pending their recognition in the profit and loss account in a future period, they are treated as deferred.
The following table analyses the movement in unrecognised and deferred gains or losses on hedge instruments during the year to 31 December 2002.

The prior year adjustment relates to the introduction of FRS19, Deferred Taxation, as explained in note 36.
Provisions for decommissioning and efuent costs relate to the costs, determined on a going concern basis, associated with decommissioning radioactive facilities and with the eventual disposal of the groups intermediate level waste which arises from operations.
Decommissioning costs will be incurred after the facilities are withdrawn from use in radioactive operations and extend out to 2036.
Total decommissioning and efuent costs to be incurred in the next 10 years amount to approximately 37.4m.
The provisions are based on the latest technical assessment of the process and methods likely to be used, and are stated at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 4%.
The provisions for pensions and similar obligations primarily relate to pension schemes, details of which are given in note 29.
The 9.6m provision for disposal costs related to sale of businesses comprises 0.8m for the disposal of the Tomojet business in 2002, 0.8m for the closure of the disease proling project in 2001, 7.3m for the disposal of Nycomed Pharma in 2001, 0.3m for the sale of Puerto Rico Plant in 1998 and 0.4m for the sale of Puridec arising in 1996.
These provisions are for legal or constructive obligations arising from the sale of businesses and are expected to be incurred within the next five years.
Other provisions are principally insurance claims, warranties and costs associated with the rationalisation of radiopharmaceutical production within Amersham Health.
The provision at 31 December 2002 of 25.4m 2001 27.8m is made up of 8.0m 2001 5.5m relating to insurance reserves, 2.4m 2001 3.0m relating to warranties, 3.8m 2001 4.5m relating to radiopharmaceutical rationalisation costs and 11.2m 2001 14.8m of legal and other provisions.

The remaining 19.6m is not recognised as there is insufficient evidence, at this time, that the asset will be recoverable in the foreseeable future.
In addition, the group has further unrecognised deferred tax assets of 13.5m arising in other territories.
These relate primarily to tax losses in those territories.
There is insufficient evidence, at this time, that these assets will be recoverable.
The unrecognised assets will be recoverable when sufficient evidence becomes available to support that recoverability.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
24 Acquisitions During the year the group made acquisitions with a total consideration of 767.9m, of which 708.6m related to the purchase of the 45% minority interest in Amersham Biosciences from Pharmacia Corp. a Purchase of 45% minority interest holding in Amersham Biosciences On 21 March 2002 the group completed the purchase of the 45% minority interest holding in Amersham Biosciences that it did not already own.
The purchase consideration was 704.1m of cash, plus costs associated with the purchase of 4.5m.
The purchase was nanced by a placing of 57.5m new ordinary shares on 18 March 2002, which generated 397.0m after costs of issue, together with the use of existing cash resources and drawings under the groups committed bank facilities.
The transaction was accounted for using acquisition accounting.
Goodwill of 692.3m arose on the transaction, and will be amortised over 20 years from the date of the purchase.
The 20 year useful life reects the continuing investment in the development of the business.
The values ascribed to the net assets acquired in Amersham Biosciences, and details of the fair value adjustments, which are provisional, are set out below: Book value Fair value at 21 Mar at 21 Mar 2002 Revaluation Other 2002 m m m m Tangible xed assets including investments 205.0 27.2 232.2 Intangible xed assets 146.9 142.0 4.9 351.9 27.2 142.0 237.1 Current assets including intra-group deposits of 60m 353.4 353.4 Current liabilities including intra-group loans of 339m 482.1 482.1 Net current liabilities 128.7 128.7 Total assets less current liabilities 223.2 27.2 142.0 108.4 Non-current liabilities 25.2 25.2 Provisions for liabilities and charges 47.6 0.6 47.0 150.4 27.8 142.0 36.2 Net assets acquired 45% 16.3 Cost of acquisition cash consideration 704.1 Acquisition expenses professional fees and tax costs 4.5 Goodwill arising on acquisition 692.3 Amersham plc 75 Notes to the financial statements continued 24 Acquisitions continued The other adjustment relates to goodwill in the Amersham Biosciences balance sheet eliminated on the purchase of the minority interest.
No accounting policy alignment adjustments are required as Amersham Biosciences accounting policies are consistent with those of the Amersham group.
Tangible xed assets have been revalued to their fair value and listed investments have been written down to their market value.
Adjustments within provisions for liabilities and charges relate to the funded status of pensions, primarily unrecognised actuarial gains.
A 45% share of the revaluation and other adjustment has been recognised in the group accounts.
As the purchase of Amersham Biosciences is an increase in stake, the profits and cash ows of Amersham Biosciences are already contained within the consolidated profit and loss account and cash ow statement of the Amersham group for the current and prior year.
The minority interest for the period to 21 March 2002 was 0.8m credit, represented by a 0.6m charge for non-equity minority interests and 1.4m credit for equity minority interests.
The purchase of the 45% minority interest was partly achieved by the group acquiring a 100% interest in Pharmacia Biosystems AB, now known as Amersham Biosystems AB, a former trading company in the Pharmacia Corporation group.
At the date of the purchase this company had no assets or liabilities, apart from the investment in Amersham Biosciences.
Full warranties and indemnities were received from Pharmacia Corporation in respect of this company.
b Other acquisitions On 31 January 2002, the group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of two ltration companies, AG Technology Corp and InnovaSep Technology Corp.
The fair value of the total consideration is 38.1m, of which 11.8m is deferred consideration and 6.7m is the groups best estimate of deferred contingent consideration.
The deferred contingent consideration is dependent on the acquired companies reaching technological milestones and on performance conditions.
The ultimate amount of deferred and contingent consideration payable is expected to be in the range of $15-33m.
Goodwill arising of 36.9m is being amortised over 10 years.
On 29 April 2002, the group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Synthia Lab Systems Sweden AB.
Goodwill arising of 0.5m is being amortised over seven years.
On 10 May 2002, the group acquired a further 16% holding in Cimarron Software Inc, taking the groups total holding at acquisition to 35%.
Cimarron Software Inc is being consolidated as a subsidiary undertaking as the group controls the company through a shareholders agreement.
Goodwill arising of 6.3m is being amortised over seven years.
Since 10 May 2002, the group has subscribed for additional allotted share capital in Cimarron Software Inc, taking its holding at the year end to 44%.
Goodwill recognised on the post-acquisition allotments of share capital amounts to 1.7m.
The group has obligations to subscribe for a further 7% of share capital over the next three years, and has options to acquire the remaining 49% of the company for a maximum consideration of $33m, the total consideration payable being contingent on performance conditions.
On 11 July 2002, the group acquired the net assets of Motorolas CodeLink pre-arrayed slide business.
Goodwill arising of 6.8m is being amortised over 10 years.
All transactions were accounted for using acquisition accounting.
The groups estimated useful life for these acquisitions reects the period over which the group expects to receive benefit based on acquired patents and technology.

The principal scheme is the Amersham Pension Scheme, which is a dened benefit arrangement, the assets of which are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
An actuarial valuation of this scheme as at 31 March 2000 was made by Watson Wyatt, an independent rm of actuaries, using the projected unit method.
The main assumptions adopted in that valuation for the purposes of the UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP 24, Accounting for Pension Costs, were that over the long term the rate of return on investments would be 6.9% pa, the increase in pensionable pay 5% pa and pensions in payment 3% pa. On the basis of these assumptions the market value of the schemes assets as at 31 March 2000 represented 112% of the value of the benets to members at that date including allowance for future salary and pension increases.
The market value of the schemes assets on 31 March 2000 was 209m.
The pension cost in the companys financial statements and the associated amounts of prepayment are set out below: 31 Dec 2002 31 Dec 2001 m m Prepayment at start of year 8.7 6.8 Regular cost 10.3 9.0 Variation from regular cost 1.6 1.6 Contributions paid 10.7 9.3 Prepayment at end of year 10.7 8.7 Overseas schemes The group operates a number of pension schemes overseas, which have been developed in line with, and are funded under, local practices.
The principal overseas schemes are in the US, Norway and Sweden and are mainly of the dened benefit type funded via separately administered trusts or guaranteed by insurance policies.
The scheme in Sweden is an unfunded arrangement and there is an unfunded arrangement in Norway in addition to the funded scheme.
These are provided for in the group financial statements and secured on the ongoing business.
Watson Wyatt have prepared pension costs using actuarial valuations carried out in accordance with local requirements, for the purposes of group reporting under SSAP 24, Accounting for Pension Costs.
A surplus or deficit is amortised over the average remaining service lives of the relevant employees using the straight-line method.
The review was made as at 1 January 2002, using the projected unit method and using the following principal assumptions.
US Norway Sweden %%% Return on investment 7.5 6.5 7.0 Increase in pensionable salary 4.5 3.5 4.0 Increase in pensions in payment 2.0 2.5 The pension cost in the groups financial statements and associated amounts of provision are set out below, in aggregate, for these principal overseas funded and unfunded schemes.

In addition to the schemes included in the above analysis the group also operates dened benefit schemes in other territories, principally Japan and Germany.
FRS 17 In November 2000, the Accounting Standards Board published FRS 17 Retirement Benets to replace the existing standard SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension costs.
Although the new standard does not become mandatory until accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005, it sets down transitional arrangements which require footnote disclosures in the interim period up to full adoption.
The most recent actuarial valuations have been updated by Watson Wyatt to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2002.
For the principal overseas schemes this latest valuation was at 31 December 2001 including both the US and Norway and at 31 December 1999 for Sweden.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2002.
The future agreed contribution rate for the UK scheme is currently 15.2%.
This is subject to review during 2003.
For the overseas schemes the contribution rate will be assessed on year on year basis.
All of the group pension schemes are open as at 31 December 2002.

Loan to Dr A Carr In 2000, the group provided an interest free, secured loan facility to Dr A Carr, the Chief Executive of Amersham Biosciences, of $300,000 to assist in the purchase of a house following his relocation to the US.
The loan was repayable over five years in equal fortnightly instalments or on his ceasing to be employed by the group, if earlier.
The maximum balance on this loan in the year was $291,000.
The loan has been repaid since the year end.
35 Contingent liabilities The group is involved in various negotiations or disputes of a nature considered typical for its businesses, including those relating to product liability and infringements and claims of intellectual property rights, validity of patents and taxation.
Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of these negotiations or disputes, the group believes that on the basis of current available information they will not have a material adverse impact on the groups financial position.
36 Restatement of prior periods Following the introduction of Financial Reporting Standard 19, Deferred Taxation in 2002, the group has changed its accounting policy with respect to deferred taxation.
Under the previous policy, provision was made for deferred taxation, using the liability method, on all material timing differences to the extent that it was probable that an asset or liability would crystallise.
Under the revised accounting policy, liabilities will be recognised for most types of timing differences regardless of whether they are anticipated to reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred taxation assets will be recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will reverse.

For the year ended 31 December 2002, deferred tax charged under FRS 19 amounted to 23.1m: this would have been 18.9m under SSAP 15.
37 Post balance sheet events On 26 February 2003 the group announced a restructuring of its discovery systems business area.
The restructuring programme, which will deliver a more efficient manufacturing cost base and focus research and development on fewer sites, will result in the loss of approximately 400 jobs.
The group will incur one off costs in the range of 45-50m, which is expected to result in savings running at the rate of 30-35m per annum by the end of 2004.
