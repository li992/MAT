The overall tax rate would be likely to rise if the proportion of profits in overseas territories increases reflecting the higher corporation tax rates in those countries in which the group operates.
In addition the tax rate would be impacted by the extent to which losses are available to offset taxable income.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of the overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures other than in the case of the groups captive insurance company where cumulative deferred tax of 0.9 million charge for the year 0.1 million has been provided on an accrued dividend.

At 1st April 2000, the date of the latest actuarial valuation, the market value of the UK schemes assets was 633.0 million, the actuarial value of which represented 141% of the liability for benefits that had accrued to that date, making full allowance for future salary and pension increases.
This represents an actuarial surplus of 164.2 million which, following actuarial recommendations, has permitted the company to suspend contributions for the foreseeable future.
A surplus cannot be refunded to the company except by dissolution of the scheme in accordance with the rules of the scheme and relevant legislation.
The financial assumptions applicable to the last actuarial valuation at 1st April 2000 were: long term rate of investment return 6.75%, dividend increase rate 4%, general salary and wage inflation rate 5% and pension increase rate 3%.
In accordance with the applicable accounting standard, the surplus on the groups principal UK pension fund has been spread over the average of the expected remaining service lives of current employees 12 years as a variation from regular cost.
The regular pension cost is assessed using the projected unit method.
The groups other UK pension schemes relate to Meconic plc which the group acquired on 9th July 2001.
Meconic operates a number of defined contribution schemes and one scheme, closed to new members on 31st December 1998, providing benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of these schemes are held in separately administered funds.
At 31st December 1999, the date of the latest actuarial valuation, the market value of the defined benefits schemes assets was 18.6 million, the actuarial value of which represented 104% of the liability for benefits that had accrued to that date, making full allowance for future salary and pension increases.
This represents an actuarial surplus of 0.8 million which has been spread over the average of the expected remaining service lives of current employees 10 years as a variation from regular cost.
The regular pension cost is assessed using the attained age method.
The financial assumptions applicable to the last actuarial valuation at 31st December 1999 were: long term rate of investment return 7.0% reduced to 5.0% in respect of the period post retirement, general salary and wage inflation rate 4.5% and pension increase rate 3%.
Notes on the Accounts Annual Report and Accounts 2002 for the year ended 31st March 2002 10c Retirement benefits continued ii Foreign schemes Pension costs relating to foreign schemes are charged in accordance with local best practice using different accounting policies.
The groups largest foreign scheme is in the US, which is of the defined benefit type and which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered fund.
This scheme is accounted for using the applicable US accounting standard.
The cost of obtaining actuarial valuations for the purpose of adjusting to the applicable UK accounting standard is considered to be out of proportion to the benefits to be gained.
iii Other retirement benefits These costs are charged on an accruals basis similar to that used for pensions.
The actuarial liability for the cost of these benefits is fully provided for in the balance sheet.
iv Profit and loss account and balance sheet impact of providing retirement benefits The effect of providing pensions and other retirement benefits on operating profit was as follows: 2002 2001 million million United Kingdom Regular pension cost 12.5 10.7 Variation from regular cost 8.2 10.1 Interest on prepayment 7.0 6.6 Cost of post-retirement medical benefits 0.4 0.3 2.3 5.7 Overseas Cost of foreign pension schemes 4.5 3.6 Cost of post-retirement medical benefits 0.8 0.6 3.0 1.5 The following prepayments and provisions relating to pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits are included in the group and parent companys balance sheets: Group Parent company 2002 2001 2002 2001 million million million million Prepaid pension costs in the UK 107.7 103.9 107.7 103.9 Prepaid pension costs overseas 3.0 Provision for foreign pensions 1.0 9.0 Provision for post-retirement medical benefits UK 4.2 3.9 4.1 3.9 Provision for post-retirement medical benefits overseas 12.7 12.2 Provision for other post-retirement benefits overseas 0.4 v FRS 17 Retirement Benefits disclosures The group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and the US.
Full actuarial valuations were carried out at 1st April 2000 for the principal UK scheme, 31st December 1999 for the Meconic defined benefits scheme and 30th June 2001 for the US schemes and updated to 31st March 2002 by qualified independent actuaries.
For the principal UK scheme the company made no contributions in the year and the company has suspended contributions for the foreseeable future.
The contribution to the Meconic defined benefits scheme amounted to 0.6 million at a rate of 17% and to the US schemes 11.3 million.
The Meconic defined benefits scheme closed to new members on 31st December 1998 and under the projected unit method the current service cost would increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The group operates a number of other small schemes around the world which are not material and their net liabilities of 0.4 million are included in the balance sheet.

The fair value of the US Dollar Bonds is calculated by discounting cash flows based on the four year Treasury Bond rate plus a margin of 1.35%.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts represents the unrealised gain or loss on revaluation of the contracts to year end exchange rates.
The fair value of all other financial instruments is approximately equal to book value due to their size, short term nature or the fact that they bear interest at floating rates.

This involves estimating the effect on profit before tax over various periods of possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
Most of the groups borrowings and deposits are at floating rates.
A 1% change in all interest rates would have a 0.6% impact on group profit before tax.
This is well within the range the group regards as acceptable.
The main impact of movements in exchange rates on the groups results arises on translation of overseas subsidiaries profits into sterling.
The groups largest exposure is to the US dollar since Johnson Mattheys largest single overseas investment is in the US.
A 5 cent 3.5% movement in the average exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling has a 2.0% impact on group profit before tax.
This exposure is part of the groups economic risk of operating globally which is essential to remain competitive in the markets in which the group operates.
20 Precious metal leases Precious metal leases are rental and consignment stock arrangements under which banks provide the group with precious metals for a specified period and for which the group pays a fee.
The group holds sufficient precious metal stocks to meet all the obligations under these lease arrangements as they come due.
