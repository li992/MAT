The principal differences that affect net income and combined shareholders funds are explained below and their approximate effect is shown on page 88.
The Reed Elsevier Annual Report 2002 on Form 20-F provides further information for US investors.
Goodwill and intangible assets Under UK and Dutch GAAP, acquired goodwill and intangible assets are capitalised and amortised systematically over their estimated useful lives up to a maximum of 40 years, subject to impairment review.
Under US GAAP, acquired goodwill and intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with SFAS141: Business Combinations and SFAS142: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
In accordance with these SFAS, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortised and are subject to annual impairment review, with effect from 1 January 2002, except in respect of acquisitions made after 1 July 2001 for which the effective date under the transitional provisions was 1 July 2001.
Other intangible assets are amortised over periods up to 40 years, also subject to impairment review.
The gross cost under US GAAP, as at 31 December 2002, of goodwill is 4,553m 2001: 4,860m and of intangible assets is 5,264m 2001: 5,583m.
Accumulated amortisation under US GAAP, as at 31 December 2002, of goodwill is 1,328m 2001: 1,414m and of intangible assets is 1,352m 2001: 1,131m.
Deferred taxation Under UK and Dutch GAAP, the combined businesses provide in full for timing differences using the liability method.
Under US GAAP, deferred taxation is provided on all temporary differences under the liability method subject to a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets where applicable, in accordance with SFAS109: Accounting for Income Taxes.
The most significant adjustment to apply SFAS109 arises on those acquired intangible assets for which amortisation is not tax deductible.
Under the timing difference approach applied under UK and Dutch GAAP, no such liability would be recognised.
Pensions Under UK and Dutch GAAP, the combined businesses account for pension costs under the rules set out in SSAP24: Accounting for Pension Costs.
Its objectives and principles are broadly in line with SFAS87: Employers Accounting for Pensions.
However, SSAP24 is less prescriptive in the application of the actuarial methods and assumptions to be applied in the calculation of pension assets, liabilities and costs.
Under UK and Dutch GAAP, pension plan assets and liabilities are based on the results of the latest actuarial valuation.
Pension assets are valued at the discounted present value determined by expected future income.
Liabilities are assessed using the expected rate of return on plan assets.
Under US GAAP, plan assets are valued by reference to market-related values at the date of the financial statements.
Liabilities are assessed using the rate of return obtainable on fixed or inflation-linked bonds.
Stock based compensation Under US GAAP, the combined businesses apply the accounting requirements of APB25: Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations in accounting for stock based compensation.
Under APB25 compensatory plans with performance criteria qualify as variable plans, for which total compensation cost must be recalculated each period based on the current share price.
The total compensation cost is amortised over the vesting period.
Under UK and Dutch GAAP, compensation cost is determined based on a comparison of the exercise price with the share price on the date of grant.
Also under US GAAP, SFAS123: Accounting for Stock Based Compensation establishes a fair value based method of computing compensation cost.
It encourages the application of this method in the profit and loss account but, where APB25 is applied, the proforma effect on net income must be disclosed.
The disclosure only provisions of SFAS123, as amended by SFAS148: Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, have been adopted.
If compensation costs based on fair value at the grant date had been recognised in the profit and loss account, net income under US GAAP would have been reduced by 36m in 2002 2001: 22m.
86 REED ELSEVIER ANNUAL REPORTS & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2002 140350 pp82-93 27 2 03 8:43 pm Page 87 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR US INVESTORS REED ELSEVIER COMBINED BUSINESSES Derivative instruments Under US GAAP, SFAS133: Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities requires all derivative instruments to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
Changes in fair value are accounted for through the profit and loss account or comprehensive income statement, depending on the derivatives designation and effectiveness as a hedging instrument.
Certain derivative instruments used by Reed Elsevier have not been designated as qualifying hedge instruments under SFAS133 and, accordingly, a charge to net income is recorded under US GAAP for the changes in the fair value of those derivative instruments.
Under UK and Dutch GAAP, derivative instruments intended as hedges are recorded at appropriate historical cost amounts, with fair values shown as a disclosure item.
SFAS133 was effective from 1 January 2001 resulting in a cumulative transition adjustment of 1m loss to US GAAP net income and 86m loss in other comprehensive income in 2001, of which 7m was charged to US GAAP net income in 2002.
Equity dividends Under UK and Dutch GAAP, dividends are provided for in the year in respect of which they are proposed by the directors.
Under US GAAP, such dividends would not be provided for until they are formally declared by the directors.
Available for sale investments Under UK and Dutch GAAP, fixed asset investments excluding investments in joint ventures are recorded at historical cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Under US GAAP, investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value, with unrealised gains or losses reported as a separate component of shareholders funds.
Acquisition accounting Under UK and Dutch GAAP, severance and integration costs in relation to acquisitions are expensed as incurred and, depending on their size and incidence, these costs may be disclosed as exceptional items charged to operating profit.
Under US GAAP, certain integration costs may be provided as part of purchase accounting adjustments on acquisition.
Employee Benefit Trust shares Under UK and Dutch GAAP, shares held by the Reed Elsevier Employee Benefit Trust EBT are classified as fixed asset investments.
Under US GAAP, shares held by the EBT are treated as a reduction in shareholders funds.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are material items within the combined businesses ordinary activities which, under UK and Dutch GAAP, are required to be disclosed separately due to their size or incidence.
These items do not qualify as extraordinary under US GAAP and are considered a part of operating results.
Adjusted earnings In the combined financial statements adjusted profit and cash flow measures are presented as permitted by UK and Dutch GAAP as additional performance measures.
US GAAP does not permit the presentation of alternative earnings measures.
Short term obligations expected to be refinanced Under US GAAP, where it is expected to refinance short term obligations on a long term basis and this is supported by an ability to consummate the refinancing, such short term obligations should be excluded from current liabilities and shown as long term obligations.
Under UK and Dutch GAAP, such obligations can only be excluded from current liabilities where, additionally, the debt and facility are under a single agreement or course of dealing with the same lender or group of lenders.
Short term obligations at 31 December 2002 of 1,359m 2001: 1,551m would be excluded from current liabilities under US GAAP and shown as long term obligations.

The most significant differences relate to the capitalisation and amortisation of goodwill and intangibles, pensions, deferred taxes and derivative financial instruments.
