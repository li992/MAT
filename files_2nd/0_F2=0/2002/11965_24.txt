P&O Annual Report 2002 Notes to the accounts 55 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to these accounts.
Basis of preparation of accounts The accounts have been prepared on the historical cost basis modied to include certain properties at market value and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 except as stated under properties and in note 30.
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 19 Deferred tax, the effect of which is set out in note 2 to the accounts.
The comparative gures have been restated accordingly.
The Group has followed the transitional arrangements of Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement benets in these accounts.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December each year.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
An associate is an undertaking in which the group has a long term interest, usually from 20 per cent to 50 per cent of the equity voting rights, and over which it exercises significant inuence.
The Groups share of the profits less losses of associates is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest in their net assets is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
A joint venture is an undertaking in which the group has a long term interest and over which it exercises joint control.
The Groups share of the turnover and profits less losses of joint ventures is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest in their assets and liabilities is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
Under section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
Goodwill arising on consolidation Purchased goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration and associated costs over the fair value of the separable net assets of businesses acquired.
Goodwill both positive and negative arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions before 1 January 1998, when Financial Reporting Standard 10 Goodwill and intangible assets was adopted, was deducted from reserves in the year of acquisition.
When a subsequent disposal occurs any related goodwill previously deducted from reserves is written back through the profit and loss account as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions since 1 January 1998 is capitalised.
Positive goodwill is amortised to nil on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, which can be up to 20 years.
Goodwill arising on the Groups acquisition of its joint ventures and associates less accumulated amortisation is included in the carrying amount for the joint ventures and associates.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a business acquired since 1 January 1998, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging the unamortised amount of any related goodwill.
Investments In the Companys accounts, investments in subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates are stated at cost less any impairment in value.
Where merger relief provisions of the Companies Act 1985 apply, investments of the Company are accounted for on the basis of the nominal value of shares issued as purchase consideration.
Other investments are stated at historical cost net of provisions for impairment.
Properties Investment properties and properties occupied by Group companies are included in xed assets at their latest valuations plus subsequent additions at cost, and surpluses and deficits on valuation are included in the revaluation reserve.
A substantial proportion by value of investment properties, including the largest properties, is valued annually by the Group chief surveyor and triennially by external valuers.
The remaining low value P&O Annual Report 2002 56 Notes to the accounts investment properties are valued triennially, a third each year, by the Group chief surveyor.
Properties occupied by Group companies are valued systematically over five years by external valuers.
profits and losses on sale of properties are calculated by reference to their net carrying amounts.
Depreciation or amortisation is not provided in respect of freehold or long leasehold investment properties.
This treatment is a departure from the Companies Act 1985 concerning the depreciation of xed assets in respect of certain of these properties.
However, such properties are not held for consumption but for investment and the directors consider systematic annual depreciation would be inappropriate and that this policy is necessary for the accounts to give a true and fair view.
Depreciation or amortisation is only one of the many factors reected in the valuation and the amount which might otherwise have been shown cannot be separately identied or quantied.
In the case of freehold buildings and leasehold properties occupied by Group companies, annual depreciation is provided on a straight line basis.
Freehold properties are written off over 50 years and leasehold properties are written off over the remainder of the lease period.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Provision for any impairment in value of properties held as xed assets is made in the profit and loss account.
Development properties are not revalued during development and are included in current assets at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
For properties previously held for investment, which the directors have decided are to be developed and which are reclassied as development properties, cost is considered to be the latest valuation prior to their reclassication.
This treatment is a departure from the Companies Act 1985 which would normally require current assets to be carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
The directors consider that compliance with this requirement would fail to give a true and fair view of historic revaluation surpluses, which remain unrealised by the Group until disposal.
Interest and other outgoings less income receivable are charged to the profit and loss account during development, except in respect of certain overseas properties where the development period is extensive, when such amounts are included in cost.
Development properties retained by the Group are transferred to investment properties at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Dealing properties are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In certain subsidiaries, realised capital profits on the sale of properties are not ordinarily available for distribution and accordingly these capital profits are transferred to other reserves.
These capital profits can be distributed by the passing of a special resolution by the subsidiary.
Ships and other xed assets These assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Assets acquired under finance leases are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, the future capital payments being included in loans.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of these assets to estimated residual value, on a straight line basis over the expected useful life of the asset concerned: generally for ships between 10 and 25 years, for port installations and cold storage facilities over periods of up to 40 years, and for other assets, including computer hardware and software, various periods of up to 16 years.
Provision for any impairment in value of ships and other xed assets is made in the profit and loss account.
Interest incurred in respect of payments on account of assets under construction is capitalised to the cost of the asset concerned.
Stocks Stocks and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Liquid resources Liquid resources comprise term deposits of less than one year.
Turnover Turnover comprises amounts derived from the provision of goods and services to third parties excluding VAT and similar sales taxes and includes rent receivable from properties.
Turnover from the provision of goods includes sales of development and dealing properties, recognised on exchange of contracts.
Turnover from the provision of services is recognised on the delivery of those services.
Operating leases Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis.
P&O Annual Report 2002 Notes to the accounts 57 Pension schemes Contributions in respect of dened contribution pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account when they are payable.
Contributions in respect of dened benefit pension schemes are calculated as a percentage, agreed on actuarial advice, of the pensionable salaries of employees.
The cost of providing dened benefit pensions is charged to the profit and loss account on a systematic basis over the periods benefiting from the services of employees.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet dates except as otherwise required by Financial Reporting Standard 19 Deferred tax.
Derivatives and other financial instruments Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments to the interest expense over the period of the contracts.
Non interest bearing amounts due after one year are discounted at a rate approximating to current interest rates.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
profits and losses of subsidiaries, branches, joint ventures and associates which have currencies of operation other than sterling are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange except for material exceptional items which are translated at the rate ruling on the date of transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the year end exchange rates.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net assets of subsidiaries, branches, joint ventures and associates which have currencies of operation other than sterling and any related loans are taken to reserves together with the differences arising when the profit and loss accounts are translated at average rates and compared with rates ruling at the year end.
Other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
2 New accounting standard In December 2000, the Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Reporting Standard 19 Deferred tax, which the Group has adopted for the first time in preparing these accounts.
Prior to the implementation of FRS 19, the Group provided deferred tax on timing differences arising from the revaluation of certain of its properties.
Under FRS 19 this treatment is now prohibited when there is no binding agreement to sell these properties.
This has resulted in an adjustment to prior year reserves and a restatement of comparative gures.
The change to the balance sheet is a decrease in the deferred tax provision of 7.2m at 31 December 2001, with a consequential increase to reserves of the same amount.
There is no impact on the profit and loss account as reported for the year ended 31 December 2001 or 31 December 2002.

P&O Annual Report 2002 64 Notes to the accounts 6 Taxation continued b Factors affecting the taxation charge for the current period The current taxation charge is higher 2001 lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% 2001 30%.
The differences are explained below: 2002 2001 m m Loss profit on ordinary activities before taxation 135.7 173.0 Loss profit on ordinary activities before taxation multiplied by standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% 2001 30% 40.7 51.9 Effects of: profits and losses on sale of xed assets and businesses not subject to taxation 43.9 0.9 UK expenses not deductible and other UK permanent adjustments 2.5 0.4 UK tax losses not utilised 14.7 2.6 Timing differences taken up in deferred tax 13.8 12.6 Tonnage tax 1.3 Variance from overseas tax rates and adjustments 9.5 11.5 Variance on associates and joint ventures 29.3 8.7 Adjustments in respect of prior periods 18.3 21.3 Current taxation charge for the period 25.8 24.7 The Groups principal shipping businesses and P&O Nedlloyd and Associated Bulk Carriers operate under the UK tonnage tax regime.
Under this regime the current year tax charge arising on qualifying activities is calculated by reference to the net tonnage of the ships owned by the business.
This method replaces both the tax adjusted profit or loss on a qualifying shipping trade and the chargeable gains and losses made on the disposal of tonnage tax assets as calculated in previous periods.
Under this method when the shipping businesses are profitable the effective tax rate will usually be less than the standard rate of corporation tax, but no tax relief is available when the shipping businesses report losses.
c Factors which may affect future tax charges The UK tax losses not utilised can only be carried forward against certain categories of non shipping UK income in certain companies.
The UK tonnage tax regime, within which the shipping businesses operate, includes provision whereby a proportion of capital allowances previously claimed by the Group may be subject to tax in the event of a significant number of ships being sold and not replaced.
This contingent liability diminishes to nil over the seven year transitional period following entry into the regime.
At 31 December 2002 the Groups contingent liability in respect of this provision would be 40.0m 2001 11.4m under the assumption that all ships and related assets were sold at book value and none of the proceeds were reinvested in shipping businesses.
The groups overseas tax rates are typically a mixture of rates higher and lower than 30 per cent.
An overseas variance will arise, partly due to losses being ring fenced in certain overseas jurisdictions.
In accordance with FRS 19, no deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, as earnings are reinvested by the Group, and no tax is expected to be payable in the foreseeable future.
In accordance with FRS 19, no provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing property to its market value.
The total amount unprovided is 6.6m 2001 7.2m.
At present, it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.

The principal schemes are located in the UK The P&O Pension Scheme and in Australia The P&O Australia Superannuation Fund.
The UK scheme is a dened benefit scheme and the Australian scheme includes both a dened benefit and a cash accumulation section.
Both have their assets managed on behalf of the respective trustees by independent fund managers.
The UK scheme was closed to new members on 1 January 2002.
The Group also operates a number of smaller dened benefit and dened contribution schemes and makes contributions to various industry schemes.
These generally have assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The pension charge for the year was: 2002 2001 m m The UK Scheme 10.1 8.0 The Australian Scheme 2.4 3.0 Other dened benefit schemes 2.4 2.2 Dened contribution schemes 5.5 5.0 Merchant navy pension schemes 6.2 3.1 Other industry schemes 2.1 1.3 Unfunded liabilities 0.1 1.6 28.6 24.2 Formal actuarial valuations of the UK scheme and the Australian scheme are carried out triennially by qualied independent actuaries, the latest valuation report for the UK scheme being at 1 April 2000, using the projected unit method and for the Australian scheme being at 1 January 2002, using the entry age normal funding method.
P&O Annual Report 2002 78 Notes to the accounts 26 Pensions continued At these dates the market values of these two principal schemes were 1,402.0m for the UK scheme and AU$78.8m for the dened benefit section of the Australian scheme and the value of those assets represented 97.8 per cent and 100.3 per cent respectively of the value of benets accrued to members allowing for future increases in earnings.
For both the principal schemes the pension charge for the year has been based on these valuations in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for pension costs and in both cases the charge for the year is the same as the contributions paid to the schemes.
The contribution rate for the UK scheme is 21.2 per cent, and for the dened benefit section of the Australian scheme 12.9 per cent to 31 December 2002 and 14.3 per cent from 1January 2003.
The principal long term assumptions in the UK schemes 2000 valuation are: Nominal % per annum Price ination 3.00 Investment return on existing assets 5.40 Investment return on future contributions 6.10 Earnings escalation 4.50 LEL escalation 3.00 Increases in accrued pensions on excess over Guaranteed Minimum Pensions 2.75 Increases in pensions to accrue in the future 3.00 The principal assumptions in the Australian schemes 2002 valuation were that, over the long term, the annual rate of return on investments would be 6.5 per cent, which is 2.5 percentage points higher than the annual increase in total pensionable remuneration.
For the purposes of the accounting disclosure requirements of Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement benets the latest valuations of the principal schemes have been updated to 31 December 2002 by qualied independent actuaries.
The principal assumptions are set out below.
The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
In the table, the less material dened benefit schemes have been aggregated and the assumptions are given in the form of weighted averages.
These schemes are principally in the UK, the USA and the Netherlands and were assessed and updated to 31 December 2002 in accordance with FRS 17.

The Group provides dened contribution 401k plans for its US employees and some post-retirement healthcare benefit plans, principally in the US.
The cost of these post-retirement healthcare benefit plans is not considered material to these accounts.
The merchant navy ratings pension fund MNRPF and the merchant navy ofcers pension fund MNOPF are industry wide dened benefit pension schemes.
The MNRPF is a closed scheme and the full triennial actuarial valuation at 31 March 2002 carried out by an independent actuary showed that the scheme had exceeded its minimum funding requirement at that date, but was still in deficit on an ongoing basis.
The valuation showed that the market value of assets was 84 per cent of the value of benets accruing to members allowing for future increases.
As a result of this valuation a revised xed schedule of payments has been drawn up which remains in place until 31 March 2007.
Under this schedule the Group is obliged to make contributions in respect of subsidiaries that are current employers in the scheme.
The Group is also making voluntary payments in respect of subsidiaries that have settled the relevant statutory debt obligations and are no longer current employers within the scheme.
These payments are included within the merchant navy pension schemes charge on page 77.
For FRS 17 purposes the trustees of the MNRPF have not updated the actuarial valuation to 31 December 2002 and the Group cannot identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the MNRPF on a consistent and reasonable basis.
The Group is therefore accounting for contributions and payments to the MNRPF as if it were a dened contribution scheme.
The MNOPF is closed to new members and the latest valuation was carried out at 31 March 2000.
The schemes independent actuary advised that the market value of the schemes assets for the old section of the scheme represented approximately 111 per cent of the value of the benets accrued to members, and for the new section of the scheme 100 per cent of the value of the benets accrued to members allowing for the future increases in earnings.
A full valuation of the MNOPF is due at 31 March 2003 when it is expected that the position will have deteriorated since 31 March 2000.
However, until the valuation is nalised and a number of other matters are resolved it is not possible to assess with any certainty the implications for the Group of any deficit that may arise.
For FRS 17 purposes although the employers contributions to the MNOPF are affected by a surplus or deficit in the scheme, the Group is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis.
The Group is therefore accounting for contributions to the MNOPF as if it were a dened contribution scheme.
Other industry schemes are mainly overseas multi-employer schemes, in which the Group is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis.
The Group is therefore accounting for contributions to these schemes as if they were dened contribution schemes for FRS 17 purposes.
P&O Annual Report 2002 Notes to the accounts 81 26 Pensions continued Within the Groups principal joint venture, P&O Nedlloyd Container Line Ltd, similar arrangements are in place.
P&O Nedlloyd Container Line Ltd has eligible employees and contributes to the UK scheme as described above, the same merchant navy schemes and some of the same other industry schemes as well as to the principal scheme of the Groups joint venture partner, Royal Nedlloyd NV.
The joint venture accounts for contributions to these schemes as if they were dened contribution schemes.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of its pension schemes on a consistent and reasonable basis.
It is therefore accounting for contributions to these schemes as if they were dened contribution schemes for FRS 17 purposes.

Other contingent liabilities in the Group and the Company also include 14.2m 2001 13.3m, being the Groups share of fines imposed by the European Union on P&O Nedlloyd for anti-competitive practices on the North Atlantic trade.
Together with other members of the Trans Atlantic Conference Agreement, P&O Nedlloyd has appealed against the fines and, on the basis of legal advice, is confident the appeal will succeed and the fines will in any event be severely reduced or quashed.
Accordingly no provision has been made in these accounts.

P&O Annual Report 2002 84 Notes to the accounts 30 Notes to the Group cash ow statement continued Prior to becoming a subsidiary, P&O Stena Line was accounted for as a joint venture.
In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 2 Accounting for subsidiary undertakings, and in order to give a true and fair view, purchased goodwill has been calculated as the sum of the goodwill arising on each acquisition of shares in P&O Stena Line, being the difference at the date of each purchase between the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of the identiable assets and liabilities attributable to the interest purchased.
This represents a departure from the Companies Act 1985, under which goodwill is calculated as the difference between cost and fair value on the date that P&O Stena Line became a subsidiary.
Had goodwill been calculated under the Companies Act method, 58.9m already recognised in reserves would have been recharacterised as goodwill.
The approach adopted has resulted in fair value adjustments to reserves of 12.7m.
The cash outow of 188.8m 2001 54.5m on the purchase of subsidiaries and businesses comprises the cash consideration of 241.8m 2001 55.0m less net cash of 53.0m 2001 0.5m of the subsidiaries at the dates of acquisition.
The negative deferred consideration of 8.8m represents 1.0m consideration provided for 2002 acquisitions to be paid in future years, less 9.8m representing payments in 2002 relating to companies purchased in prior years.
The investments already owned represent the reserves of and loans to joint ventures and associates now consolidated as subsidiaries of 126.8m 2001 7.5m.
