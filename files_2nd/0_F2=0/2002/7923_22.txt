NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 20 Acquisitions Reemtsma.
On 15 May 2002 the Group acquired a 90.01% interest in Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH and entered into an Option Agreement which will enable it to acquire the outstanding 9.99%.
The Group also entered into a Profit Pooling Agreement whereby the holders of the outstanding 9.99% surrendered their interests in the equity and results of Reemtsma in exchange for a fixed return.
As a result the Group has consolidated 100% of the results and net assets of Reemtsma and have reflected a liability to the holders of the 9.99%.
The acquisition method has been adopted.
The book values of the Reemtsma group assets and liabilities acquired, with provisional fair values, are set out below: Accounting policy Fair value In s million Book value alignment adjustment Fair value Intangible fixed assets 4 4 Tangible fixed assets 266 219 26 511 Investments 191 8 199 Stocks 419 54 473 Debtors 244 5 239 Cash 266 266 Creditors 646 23 623 Borrowings 20 20 Provisions 253 64 46 363 Deferred taxation 3 85 18 70 Minority interests 4 4 464 146 2 608 Goodwill 3,209 Acquisition price including costs 3,817 Satisfied by: Cash 3,407 Acquisition costs 32 Cash consideration in 2002 3,439 Deferred consideration 378 3,817 The accounting policy alignments represent the restatement of assets and liabilities in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
The principle adjustments are:- i Valuation of stocks on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis: ii Applying the Groups depreciation policies: and iii Alignment of accounting policy for pensions.
The fair value adjustments are:- i Revaluation of tangible fixed assets based on market values at the date of acquisition: and ii Provision made against the future contractual commitments with regard to a long-term marketing contract.
Under German GAAP the profit after tax and minority interest for Reemtsma for the period from 1 January 2002 to 14 May 2002 and the year ended 31 December 2001 was 31m and 189m respectively.
Total recognised gains for the same periods were 24m and 188m respectively.. 75 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 20 Acquisitions continued The results of Reemtsma since acquisition, before amortisation charges of 62m, have been included within the Groups reported figures for the year ended 28 September 2002 and are set out below.
For the periods prior to acquisition, the consolidated results of Reemtsma, prepared on a UK GAAP basis for comparability, are also set out below: Year ended 1 January to 15 May to 31 December 14 May 28 September In s million 2001 2002 2002 Turnover 4,330 1,531 1,752 Operating profit pre exceptional items 220 46 107 Exceptional items 26 44 Operating profit 194 46 63 Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 357 68 69 Taxation 76 20 22 Profit on ordinary activities after taxation 281 48 47 Equity minority interests 2 Profit attributable to shareholders 279 48 47 Within the 2002 consolidated cash flow statement, Reemtsma contributed the following amounts:- Net cash outflow from operating activities 46m, cash inflow from returns on investment and servicing of finance 6m, cash outflow on taxation 9m, cash outflow on capital expenditure and financial investment 6m, and net cash inflow from movement of liquid resources 102m.
On 23 September 2002 Tobaccor purchased from Bollor, by way of a share buy-back, a further 12.5% interest in Tobaccor.
The remaining interest of Bollor in Tobaccor will be acquired by 31 December 2005.
Total consideration for these transactions amounts to 91m, using a similar multiple of profit as for the acquisition of the original shares, and includes a net cash adjustment, incorporating dividends accrued since the acquisition.
As a result of these transactions, the Company has consolidated 100% of the results and net assets of Tobaccor from 23 September 2002, and reflected a liability to the holders of the remaining shares.
The fair and book value of the net assets acquired is 19m, giving rise to goodwill of 72m.. 76 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 20 Acquisitions continued Lao Tobacco.
On 6 February 2002 the Group acquired the majority interest in Lao Tobacco.
The fair value of the individual assets at the date of acquisition, which was also the book value, is set out below: Book and In s million Fair value Tangible fixed assets 4 Stocks 2 Debtors 3 Short-term creditors 3 6 Minority interest arising on acquisition of Lao Tobacco 3 Goodwill Acquisition price including costs 3 Satisfied by: Cash 3 Goodwill on all acquisitions is being amortised on a straight line basis over their useful economic life.
This has been assessed as 20 years for both the Reemtsma and Lao Tobacco acquisitions.
21 Capital commitments In s million 2002 2001 Contracted but not provided for 5 6 22 Legal proceedings The Group is currently involved in a number of legal cases in which claimants are seeking damages for alleged smoking-related health effects.
In the opinion of the Groups lawyers, the Group has meritorious defences to these actions, all of which are being vigorously contested.
Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation, the Directors believe that the pending actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of the operations, cash flow or financial condition of the Group.. 77 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 23 Pensions The Group operates pension schemes in the UK and overseas, principally those operated by Imperial Tobacco Limited, John Player & Sons Limited, Rizla companies, Van Nelle Tabak companies, Reemtsma group companies, Imperial Tobacco Australia Limited, Imperial Tobacco New Zealand Limited and Imperial Tobacco EFKA GmbH & Co. KG.
The main schemes are of the defined benefit type and the assets are held in trustee administered funds, apart from the German Schemes which are unfunded.
The principal Group scheme, covering UK employees, is the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund the Scheme.
An actuarial valuation of the Scheme was made at 31 March 2001.
The assumptions which had the most significant effect when valuing the Schemes liabilities were those relating to the rate of investment return earned on the Schemes existing assets and the rates of increase in pay and pensions.
It was assumed that the future investment returns relative to market values at the valuation date would be 5% per annum and that pay and pension increases would average 4.25% and 2.5% per annum respectively.
The assets were brought into account at their market value.
At 31 March 2001, the market value of the assets of the Scheme was 2,439m.
The total assets were sufficient to cover 111% of the benefits that had accrued to members for past service, after allowing for expected future pay increases.
Group contributions to the Scheme remain suspended having regard to the surplus disclosed in this valuation.
There was no pension cost to disclose in respect of the Scheme for the year ended 28 September 2002.
The pension cost has been assessed in accordance with the advice of Watson Wyatt LLP, actuaries and consultants, using the projected unit method.
There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions at the balance sheet date.
Actuarial valuations of the pension liabilities of the Reemtsma pension schemes were undertaken at 31 May 2002 and 30 September 2002.
The valuations disclosed unfunded past service liabilities of 287m at 31 May 2002 and 291m at 30 September 2002.
The pension cost reported for the Reemtsma pension schemes for the period since acquisition was 7.5m.
The pension cost relating to foreign schemes is calculated in accordance with local accounting principles.
The pension cost for the foreign schemes in the year was 13m 2001: 7m.
FRS 17 disclosures for the year to 28 September 2002 The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24.
Full implementation of FRS 17 Retirement benefits, which was to be mandatory for the Group for the year ended September 2003, has been indefinitely deferred.
However, the following transitional disclosures are still required.
The results of the most recent available actuarial valuations for the principal Group schemes have been updated to 28 September 2002 by Watson Wyatt LLP, actuaries and consultants.
The main financial assumptions used in the valuation of the Schemes liabilities under FRS 17 are: At At 28 September 29 September 2002 2001 % p. a.
Inflation 2.3 2.5 Rate of increase in salaries 3.0 to 4.1 3.0 to 4.5 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 2.0 to 2.4 1.5 to 2.5 Discount rate 4.5 to 5.8 5.5 to 7.5 The scheme assets and the expected rate of return were: At At 28 September 29 September Expected rate 2002 Expected rate 2001 of return Fair value of return Fair value % p. a.
78 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 23 Pensions continued The following amounts at 28 September 2002 were measured in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17: At At 28 September 29 September In s million 2002 2001 Fair value of scheme assets 2,121 2,361 Actuarial value of scheme liabilities 2,389 2,015 Assets less liabilities 268 346 Less: irrecoverable surplus in respect of the closed New Zealand Scheme 1 2 Recognised pension liability asset 269 344 Related deferred tax asset liability 7 103 Net pension liability asset under FRS 17 262 241 Pension liability recognised in net assets 301 Net pension asset not recognised in net assets 39 241 The valuation identified overall liabilities of 269m which comprised 43m in respect of schemes with a surplus, less 312m in respect of schemes with a deficit.
If the above amounts had been recognised in the financial statements, the Groups net liabilities and profit and loss account at 28 September 2002 would be as follows: At At 28 September 29 September In s million 2002 2001 Net liabilities excluding pension liability asset 75 1,101 Add back unfunded pension provision included in net assets 301 Less recognised deferred tax asset 20 Pension liability asset 262 241 Net liability including pension liability asset 56 860 Profit and loss account excluding pension liability asset 1,129 1,174 Pension reserve 262 241 Profit and loss account 1,391 933.

82 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 29 Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom UK GAAP.
Such principles differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States US GAAP.
A summary of principal differences and additional disclosures applicable to the Group is set out below.

Actual results could differ from those estimates.. 83 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 29 Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP continued i Pensions Group contributions to the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund the Scheme are suspended as a result of the surplus disclosed in note 23.
Under UK GAAP, in accordance with SSAP 24, no pension expense has been reflected in the profit and loss account and no pension asset has been recognised in the balance sheet.
A pension liability is recognised for the German unfunded pension schemes.
Under US GAAP, the annual pension cost comprises the estimated cost of benefits accruing in the period as determined in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
Under SFAS 87, a pension asset representing the excess of Scheme assets over benefit obligations has been recognised in the balance sheet.
ii Intangible assets Both UK and US GAAP require purchase consideration to be allocated to the net assets acquired at their fair value on the date of acquisition.
Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising and separately identifiable and separable intangible assets acquired on acquisitions made on or after 27 September 1998 are capitalised and amortised over their useful life not exceeding a period of 20 years.
Prior to 27 September 1998, all goodwill and separately identifiable and separable intangible assets were written off to reserves on acquisition.
Under US GAAP, identifiable intangible assets are separately valued and amortised over their useful lives for all purchase transactions closing after June 2001.
Goodwill is no longer subject to amortisation, but rather an annual assessment of impairment by applying a fair value based test.
For purchase transactions prior to 30 June 2001, goodwill was capitalised and is being amortised over its useful lives.
The separately identifiable intangible assets included in the US GAAP balance sheet are principally comprised of brand rights which are being amortised over 25 to 30 years.
iii Deferred taxation Under UK GAAP, deferred taxation is provided in full on all material timing differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is considered more likely than not.
US GAAP requires deferred taxation to be provided in full, using the liability method.
In addition, US GAAP requires the recognition of the deferred tax consequences of differences between the assigned values and the tax bases of the identifiable intangible assets, with the exception of non tax-deductible goodwill, in a purchase business combination.
Consequently, the deferred tax liability attributable to identifiable intangible assets has been recognised and is being amortised over the useful lives of the underlying intangible assets.
iv Derivative financial instruments The Group has entered into certain swap transactions with contractual maturities exceeding those of the underlying debt being hedged, in anticipation of there being additional floating rate debt when the existing debt matures.
Under UK GAAP, derivative financial instruments, that reduce exposures on anticipated future transactions, may be accounted for using hedge accounting.
US GAAP requires the Group to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
The Group has decided not to satisfy the SFAS 133 requirements to achieve hedge accounting for its derivatives, where permitted, and accordingly movements in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in the profit and loss account.
v Proposed dividends Under UK GAAP, dividends paid and proposed are shown on the face of the profit and loss account as an appropriation of the current years earnings.
Proposed dividends are provided on the basis of recommendation by the Directors and are subject to subsequent approval by shareholders.
Under US GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders.. 84 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 29 Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP continued vi Shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Trusts ESOT Under UK GAAP, shares held by the Trusts are recorded at cost and reflected as a fixed asset investment in the Groups balance sheet.
Under US GAAP, these shares are recorded at cost and reflected as a deduction from shareholders funds.
vii Employee share schemes charge to the profit and loss account Under UK GAAP, the cost of shares purchased by the ESOTs in conjunction with an employee share scheme are charged to the profit and loss account according to the book value of the shares at the date of purchase.
The cost of employee share schemes not held under the ESOTs are charged using the quoted market price of shares at the date of grant.
The charge is accrued over the vesting period of the shares in both cases.
Under US GAAP, the compensation cost is recognised for the difference between the exercise price of the share options granted and the quoted market price of the shares at the date of grant or measurement date and accrued over the vesting period of the options.
For option plans which contain performance criteria, compensation cost is remeasured at each period end until all performance criteria have been met.
viii Inventory step-up Under UK GAAP, the fair value of inventory is represented by the acquired companies current cost of reproducing that inventory.
Under US GAAP, the fair value represents the selling price less any further costs to be incurred to sale.
ix Restructuring costs Under UK GAAP, restructuring provisions may only be recognised as a fair value adjustment if the acquired company had an irrevocable commitment to restructure which was not conditional on the completion of the purchase.
Under US GAAP, restructuring liabilities associated with acquisitions relating solely to the acquired entity may be provided in the opening balance as a fair value adjustment if specific criteria about restructuring plans are met.
x Net income per ordinary share The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per ordinary share in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.

There are certain differences between FRS 1 revised and SFAS 95 with regard to classification of items within the cash flow statement.
In accordance with FRS 1 revised, cash flows are prepared separately for operating activities, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investment, acquisitions and disposals, equity dividends paid, management of liquid resources and financing.
Under SFAS 95, cash flows are classified under operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.
Under FRS 1 revised, cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts repayable on demand.
Under SFAS 95, cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less.
A summary of the Groups cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities classified in accordance with SFAS 95 is presented below.
For the purposes of this summary, the Group considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.

86 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 29 Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP continued xiii Impact of new accounting standards In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
According to this statement goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortisation, but rather an annual assessment of impairment by applying a fair value based test.
The standard is effective for all new acquisitions in the current accounting period and will become effective for all goodwill and amortisation in the accounts to 30 September 2003.
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations which requires recording the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period incurred.
The standard is effective for the Company for the year ending 30 September 2003.
The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys results.
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144 Accounting for the impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.
The objectives of SFAS 144 are to address significant issues relating to the implementation of FASB statement 121 Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, and to develop a single accounting model based on the framework established in SFAS 121, for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale.
The standard requires that long-lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell.
Additionally, the standard expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction.
The statement is effective for the Company for the year ending 30 September 2003 and generally its provisions are to be applied prospectively.
In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 145 Rescission of FASB Statements 4, 44 and 46, Amendment of FASB Statement 13, and Technical Corrections.
This statement eliminates the automatic classification of gain or loss on extinguishment of debt as an extraordinary item of income and requires that such gain or loss be evaluated for extraordinary classification under the criteria of Accounting Principles Board No.
This statement also requires sales-leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sales-leaseback transactions, and makes various other technical corrections to existing pronouncements.
This statement will be effective for the Company for the year ending 30 September 2003.
In July 2002, the FASB issues SFAS 146 Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after 31 December 2002.
The standard will require companies to recognise costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan.
The standard replaces the existing guidance provided by EITF Issue No.
94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a Resolution.
