Interest rate and currency profile The interest rate and currency profile, after taking account of interest rate and cross currency swaps, of the financial liabilities of the Group at 31 December 2002 was as follows: Fixed rate interest financial liabilities Weighted average Floating rate Weighted period for financial average which rate Total liabilities Principal interest rate is fixed m m m % Years Sterling 252.3 22.4 229.9 6.5 3.1 Euro 65.1 21.6 43.5 4.9 4.4 Danish Krone 41.2 23.9 17.3 4.3 7.0 Swedish Krone 10.6 10.6 5.1 2.3 Currency swaps: Euro liability 133.2 133.2 4.0 1.8 Danish Krone liability 36.0 36.0 3.7 1.8 Sterling asset 162.4 162.4 4.8 1.8 All currencies 376.0 67.9 308.1 5.6 3.4 Although the Group only has a net exposure under the currency swaps, in order to fairly present the impact of the currency swaps on the interest payable on the Groups financial liabilities, the gross notional liability and asset arising from the currency swap transactions are shown in the table above.
Floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates, based on the relevant national LIBOR equivalents, which are fixed in advance for periods of between 1 month and 6 months.
The Group had short-term cash deposits of 65.9 million, of which 42.8 million was in Sterling, 17.1 million in Euros and 6.0 million in Danish Krone, which earn interest at rates based on the relevant national LIBID equivalents.

Arriva plc Annual report and accounts 2002 55 15 Pensions At 31 December 2002 the Group operated a number of retirement benefit schemes, both defined benefit and defined contribution which are financed through separate Trustee administered funds managed by independent professional fund managers on behalf of the Trustees.
Contributions to the defined benefit funds are based upon actuarial advice following the most recent of a regular series of valuations of the funds by their respective actuaries.
For the purpose of arriving at the pension cost charged in the accounts the defined benefit funds were last assessed on 5 April 2000 excluding the Merseyside Pension Fund, details of which are provided below by their respective actuaries, using the Projected Unit Method.
The principal actuarial assumptions were that: i the annual rate of return on investment would be 2.5 per cent higher than the annual increase in total pensionable remuneration and, where relevant, ii there would be no variation from a schemes rules regarding pensions in payment.
On the basis of these assumptions the actuarial value of the funds at 5 April 2000 was sufficient to cover 114 per cent of the benefits then accrued to members.
A prepayment of 40.4 million 2001: 37.7 million is included in the accounts and represents the excess of the amount of the fund over the estimated accumulated cost of accrued benefits at the year end date.
The market value of the various schemes assets at 5 April 2000 was 270 million.
Certain employees of Arriva Trains Northern Limited and Arriva Trains Merseyside Limited participate in funded defined benefit sections which form part of the overall Railways Pension Scheme RPS.
The accounting policy is to charge the contributions to these pension sections to the profit and loss account in accordance with actuarial advice.
This is on the basis that there is no recourse to the companies for any over or under funding of their sections of the RPS following expiry of the franchises.
During 2002 the sections to which Arriva Trains Northern Limited and Arriva Trains Merseyside Limited contribute were subject to a pensions contribution holiday.
Certain employees of Arriva Merseyside Limited participate in the Local Government Pension Scheme.
This is a defined benefit scheme funded by payments to the Merseyside Pension Fund.
The latest formal actuarial valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2001 using the Attained Age Method.
The market value of the assets notionally attributed to the Arriva Merseyside Limited section was 147.5 million, which represented 114 per cent of the accrued liabilities.
The pension cost and provision are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The principal assumptions for valuing accrued liabilities were that investment returns would exceed salary increases by 2.3 per cent per annum and pension increases by 3.3 per cent per annum.
Assets were taken at market value.
For accruing benefits, the principal assumptions were that investment returns would exceed salary increases by 3.0 per cent per annum and pension increases by 4.0 per cent per annum.
A prepayment of 20.0 million 2001: 20.6 million is included within debtors, representing the excess of the payment contributions to the pension fund over the accumulated pension cost.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits The full disclosures and accounting treatment required under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits will be mandatory for the Group in its accounts for the year ended 31 December 2005.
Prior to this, transitional disclosures are required, and these are set out below.
The calculations used to assess FRS 17 liabilities of the retirement benefit schemes are based on actuarial valuations at 5 April 2000 and the 31 March 2001 valuation for the Merseyside Pension Fund updated by the respective actuaries to 31 December.
The schemes assets are stated at their market value at 31 December.
