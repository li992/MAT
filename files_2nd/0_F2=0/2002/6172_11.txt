Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the ESOP trust and QUEST which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has one category of dilutive potential ordinary shares, being the Directors share options first exercisable on 27th April 2003 where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys shares during the year.
Underlying earnings per share excludes exceptional items and the tax thereon from the profit for the year attributable to shareholders, with the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year as per the calculation for basic earnings per share.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

The bank loans in Notes 17 and 18 are unsecured and bear interest at rates based on LIBOR.
Financial instruments Short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures.
Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities The Groups policy on interest rates is to keep floating rate borrowings under review and to use financial instruments to lock into specific rates as and when appropriate.
There is no specific level of Group borrowings that must be fixed.
The interest rate risk profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31st December 2002 was as follows: Floating Rate Fixed Rate Financial Financial Total Currency Liabilities Liabilities Borrowings UK Sterling 000 000 000 At 31st December 2002 115,256 500 115,756 At 31st December 2001 105,117 500 105,617 All the Groups creditors falling due within one year other than bank and other borrowings are excluded from the above table either due to the exclusion of short-term items or because they do not meet the definition of a financial liability, such as tax balances.
The fixed rate 3.75% financial liabilities are redeemable at the discretion of the Board of Forth Ports PLC.
Accordingly, no weighted average period to maturity is shown see Note 18.
Floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates based on LIBOR which are fixed in advance for periods of up to six months.
Notes on the Accounts continued Forth Ports PLC 54 Annual Report & Accounts 2002 19.
Financial instruments continued Financial assets The Group aims to maintain a level of liquidity appropriate to its short-term needs and longer-term strategy.
Enough working capital should be available to allow the Group to operate efficiently without there being surplus funds drawn from the lenders.
At no time should the Group exceed its overdraft and borrowing limits.
Other than short-term debtors the Group has financial assets as follows: 2002 2001 000 000 Assets held as part of financing arrangements for the Group Sterling cash deposits 6,973 4,877 Debt instrument Loan to joint venture company in sterling denominated securities 19,000 9,000 25,973 13,877 The sterling cash deposits comprise deposits placed on money markets at call and monthly rates.
The debt instrument is at a floating rate based on three month LIBOR.
Currency exposures The Groups objectives in managing currency exposures are to use options or other instruments to hedge against future movements where there is material risk from currency exposure.
The Group conducts a relatively small amount of business in currencies other than sterling, and exposure to foreign currency risks is limited.
The table below shows the Groups currency exposures: that is, those transactional or non-structural exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
The Group had no liabilities not denominated in the operating currency of the operating unit involved.

Pension schemes The Group operates two pension schemes that cover the vast majority of employees.
Other employees are covered by a national scheme.
The schemes that the Group has established are as follows: Forth Ports PLC Pension Scheme Port of Tilbury London Limited Pension Fund These schemes are of the defined benefit type, providing benefits that are linked to pay near retirement.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate funds that are administered by trustees.
These funds are held separately from the Company assets.
The pension cost relating to these schemes is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.
The latest actuarial assessments of the schemes were as at 5th April 2002.
Assets are taken at their market value.
Liabilities are valued using various assumptions.
The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
The assumptions used for the valuations were linked to market conditions.
It was assumed that the investment return will exceed price inflation by 3.5% per annum and that salary increases will exceed price inflation by 1.5% per annum.
The projected unit method was used to determine the pension cost.
Taking the schemes together, the assets represented 94% of the total liabilities: the market value of the assets was 101m.
The funding level of the Forth Ports Scheme exceeded 100%.
The funding level of the Tilbury Fund was 71%.
The total pension cost for these schemes was 3,909,000 2001 3,917,000.
This compares with Group contributions of 8,888,000 2001 4,241,000 : member contributions are paid in addition.
Additional contributions are being paid to the Tilbury Fund in order to improve the funding level of that Fund.
These contributions will be paid partly in three lump sums over the next three years, with the balance met by increases in the monthly payments for the next several years.
The need for these additional contributions is partly due to the imposition of a Minimum Funding Requirement MFR for UK pension schemes.
The MFR position for the Forth Ports Scheme is satisfactory and no special contributions are required.
In addition to the schemes that have been set up specifically for Group employees, a number of employees are members of the Former Registered Dock Workers Pension Scheme: this is a national scheme providing defined benefits based on pay near retirement.
However, the contributions paid by the Group are accounted for as a defined contribution scheme as the Group is unable to identify its share of the assets and liabilities in the scheme.
The Group contributions during the year were 268,000 2001 287,000.
The pension cost figures used in these accounts comply with the current pension cost accounting standard SSAP24.
The new pension cost accounting standard, FRS17, must be used for the figures that will be shown in the accounts at 31st December 2005 and subsequent years.
Under transitional arrangements the Group is required to disclose the following information about the schemes and the figures that would have been shown under FRS17 in the current balance sheet.
