Headline and basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the respective Headline and FRS 3 earnings as outlined above for the year by the weighted average number of fully paid ordinary shares in issue during the year, less those shares held by the Inchcape Employee Trust note 13a ii.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated as per Headline and basic earnings per share with a further adjustment to the weighted average number of fully paid ordinary shares to reflect the effect of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

Additions to goodwill arise mainly from the acquisition of the minority interest in Inchcape Motors Limited, as set out in note 27a.
Goodwill relating to Ferrari Belgium and Australia Retail is being amortised over periods ranging from five to ten years.
All other goodwill is being predominantly amortised over twenty years.
These periods are the periods over which the Directors estimate that the values of the underlying businesses acquired are expected to exceed the value of the underlying assets.
The adjustment relating to the prior year acquisition refers to the acquisition of Eurofleet in 2001.
The Group then assumed the additional consideration payable for Eurofleet would be in the range of 14.0m to 22.0m based on challenging EBIT growth assumptions.
In valuing the goodwill at 31 December 2001, it was assumed that 21.8m deferred consideration was payable.
Following this years performance, the Group now considers that the deferred consideration will be up to 14.3m.
Accordingly, goodwill has been reduced by 7.5m in 2002.
In addition, the provisional fair values of Eurofleet assets and liabilities at the acquisition date have been revisited and goodwill has been reduced by 0.2m accordingly.
