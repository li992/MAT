The cost of these shares is written down to realisable value over the periods of service in respect of which options and awards are granted.
Other fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provision required for impairment in value.
Tangible assets and depreciation a Freehold properties, including related fixed plant, have been revalued by external chartered surveyors and are included in the financial statements at the revalued amounts.
Following the implementation of FRS 15 no revaluations of freehold properties after March 1997 will be made.
Freehold buildings and related fixed plant are depreciated, based on cost or valuation at the beginning of the year plus subsequent additions, over their estimated economic lives.
The economic lives of properties range from 15 to 50 years, the estimated useful lives of fixed plant range from five to 20 years.
b Leasehold properties and improvements are included at cost and depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease or the economic life of the property.
c Plant and equipment is stated at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are mainly in the range from three to five years.
Third party software costs for the development and implementation of systems which enhance the services provided by the Company are capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful lives, which is an average of three years.
d The Group selects its depreciation rates based on expected economic lives, taking into account the expected rate of technological developments, market requirements and expected use of the assets.
The selected rates are regularly reviewed to ensure they remain appropriate to the Groups circumstances.
Provisions A provision is recognised where there is a present obligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of a past event for which it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

No discounting of the deferred tax liabilities or assets is applied.

Pension costs The Company operates one pension plan which includes separate defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
The assets of the defined benefit and defined contribution schemes are held separately from those of the Company and the funds are managed by Schroder Investment Management Limited and Legal & General Investment Management Limited respectively.
Defined benefit scheme The defined benefit scheme is non-contributory and provides benefits based on final pensionable pay.
Pension costs are determined by an independent qualified actuary on the basis of regular valuations using the projected unit method and are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Company.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 March 2000 by an independent qualified actuary.
The market value of the plans assets for the scheme was 162m, representing 107 per cent of the value of benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in salaries.
Defined contribution scheme The Companys defined contribution scheme is now the only scheme open to new employees.
A core contribution of eight per cent of pensionable pay is provided and the Company will match employee contributions up to a maximum of six per cent of pensionable pay.
Pension contributions Following a contribution holiday for the defined benefit and defined contribution schemes, contributions recommenced in March 2001.
The contribution rate for the defined benefit scheme is currently 31.2 per cent of pensionable salaries less 1.1m amortisation of the scheme surplus.
As the defined benefit scheme is closed to new members, under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as a percentage of pensionable salaries as the members approach retirement.
At 31 March 2002 contributions of 0.3m 2001: nil were paid in advance to the defined benefit scheme.

LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE ANNUAL REPORT 2002 59 25.
Employee Share Ownership Plans ESOP As referred to in the Remuneration report on pages 34 and 35, the Company is proposing a new long term incentive scheme to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
This will set out the arrangements for future long term incentive awards of share options.
The previous long term incentive scheme comprising the Initial and Annual Share Plans was approved by shareholders in March 2000 and option grants and share awards were made based on approvals prior to the Companys listing in July 2001.
No further option grants or share awards will be made under this scheme apart from the SAYE scheme available to all staff.
The Company established an ESOP discretionary trust to administer the original, and the proposed new, share scheme and to acquire the Companys shares to meet commitments to employees.
Under the Initial Share Plan, introduced in November 2000 following the Companys conversion to a public limited company, share awards and grants of options were made to senior executives.
The share awards have a vesting period of three years and share options become exercisable at 20 per cent per annum over five years.
Under the Annual Share Plan, awards of shares and grants of options to staff were made in November 2000 and June 2001, based on individual performance and potential.
The SAYE scheme provides for grants of options to employees who enter into a SAYE savings contract.
As provided under UITF 17, no charge is made in the accounts in respect of the SAYE scheme.
Share awards were granted at nil cost to employees and share options were granted at fair market value or above.
Options under the SAYE scheme were granted at 20 per cent below fair market value.
Costs for the Initial Share Plan are being charged to the profit and loss account over three years from the date of award and for the Annual Share Plan in the year to which the awards relate.
At the balance sheet date, 5,309,967 shares 2001: 4,240,000 shares were held by the trust, at an initial cost of 14.0m.
This was funded by an interest free loan from the Company.
At the balance sheet date, the market value of these shares was 23.0m 2001: 12.3m.
Dividends on shares held in respect of share awards have not been waived by the trust.
In accordance with UITF 13, the assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOP trust have been included in the Companys financial statements.
Transactions with related parties During the financial year, no contracts of significance were entered into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries in which the directors had a material interest.
FTSE International Limited Details of transactions with FTSE International Limited are included in note 13.
