United Kingdom FRS 3 would require profits and losses on disposal of most businesses to be excluded from operating profit.
However, because the business disposals above and the restructuring costs are part of a series of linked initiatives, separate presentation would not give a true and fair view and therefore we have included all exceptional items arising from these initiatives on a single line in operating profit.
Costs associated with restructuring, such as training and information technology development costs, are recognised as they arise and are not treated as exceptional.
The exceptional items in 2002, 2001 and 2000 principally relate to a series of linked initiatives the Path to Growth, announced on 22 February 2000 to align the organisation behind plans for accelerating growth and expanding margins and to restructuring arising from the integration of Bestfoods.
