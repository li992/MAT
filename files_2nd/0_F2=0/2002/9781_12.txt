com 29 Notes to the financial statements 1.
Basis of accounting Marks and Spencer Group p. l. c. the Company was incorporated on 23 July 2001.
On 19 March 2002, the Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Marks and Spencer p. l. c. following implementation of a Scheme of Arrangement under section 425 of the Companies Act 1985.
The Scheme of Arrangement involved the issue of 17 ordinary shares and 21 redeemable B shares by the Company for every 21 ordinary shares held by the shareholders of Marks and Spencer p. l. c. The Scheme of Arrangement has been accounted for using merger accounting principles, although it does not satisfy all the conditions required see below.
Schedule 4A to the Companies Act 1985 and FRS 6 Acquisition and Mergers require acquisition accounting to be adopted where all the conditions laid down for merger accounting are not satisfied.
Under the Scheme of Arrangement, not all of the conditions were satisfied because the fair value of the non-equity share element of the consideration the redeemable B shares given by the Company for the shares in Marks and Spencer p. l. c. exceeded 10% of the nominal value of the share element of the consideration.
However, in the opinion of the directors, the Scheme of Arrangement is a group reconstruction rather than an acquisition, since the shareholders of the Company are the same as the former shareholders in Marks and Spencer p. l. c. and the rights of each shareholder, relative to the others, are unchanged and no minority interest in the net assets of the Group is altered.
Therefore, the directors consider that to record the Scheme of Arrangement as an acquisition by the Company, attributing fair values to the assets and liabilities of the Group and reecting only the post Scheme of Arrangement results within these financial statements would fail to give a true and fair view of the Groups results and financial position.
Accordingly, having regard to the overriding requirement under section 227 6 of the Companies Act 1985 for the financial statements to give a true and fair view of the Groups results and financial position, the directors have adopted merger accounting principles in drawing up these financial statements.
The directors consider that it is not practicable to quantify the effect of this departure from the Companies Act 1985 requirements.
The consolidated financial statements are presented as if the Scheme of Arrangement had been effective on 1 April 2001 except for the effect of the capital restructure and subsequent reduction of capital which took place on 22 March 2002.
The consolidated profit and loss account combines the results of Marks and Spencer p. l. c. for the 52 week period ended 30 March 2002 with those of the Company for the period since its incorporation to 30 March 2002.
The comparative gures relate to Marks and Spencer p. l. c. as restated for the effect of the Scheme of Arrangement.
Further detail relating to the Scheme of Arrangement can be found in note 24.
Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is given below.
These policies have been applied consistently with the exception of the Groups policy on deferred tax which has been amended following the adoption of the new accounting standard on deferred tax.
Details of the effect of this change in accounting policy are set out in note 7.
In addition, the Group has adopted the following financial reporting standards in these financial statements for the first time: i FRS 17 Retirement Benets.
The Group is not required to adopt this standard in full until the period ending March 2004, however the transitional disclosure requirements are set out in note 11A.
ii FRS 18 Accounting Policies has been complied with, but has not resulted in any amendments to the Groups accounting policies.
Accounting convention and basis of consolidation The financial statements are drawn up on the historical cost basis of accounting, modied to include the valuation of certain United Kingdom properties at 31 March 1988 and the valuation of investment properties.
Compliance with SSAP19, Accounting for Investment Properties requires a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 relating to the depreciation of investment properties as explained below.
The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Marks and Spencer Group p. l. c. and all its subsidiaries for the 52 weeks ended 30 March 2002, or to the date of disposal.
Turnover Turnover comprises sales of goods to customers outside the Group less returns, VAT and sales taxes, together with interest and other income attributable to the Financial Services operations.
30 Marks and Spencer Group p. l. c. Notes to the financial statements 2.
Accounting policies continued Current asset investments Current asset investments are stated at market value.
All profits and losses from such investments are included in net interest income or in Financial Services turnover as appropriate.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is accounted for on an undiscounted basis at expected tax rates on all differences arising from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable in the foreseeable future out of suitable taxable profits from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Fixed assets a Capitalised interest Interest is not capitalised.
b Depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation of tangible xed assets, less residual value, by equal annual instalments as follows: Land: not depreciated.
Freehold and leasehold buildings over 50 years: depreciated to their estimated residual value over their estimated remaining economic lives see also c below.
Leasehold land and buildings under 50 years: over the remaining period of the lease.
Fit out: 10-25 years according to the estimated life of the asset.
Fixtures, ttings and equipment: 3-15 years according to the estimated life of the asset.
Depreciation is charged on all additions to or disposals of depreciating assets in the year of purchase or disposal.
Any impairment in value is charged to the profit and loss account.
c Land and buildings The Groups freehold and leasehold properties in the United Kingdom were valued on the basis of open market value for existing use in 1982.
At 31 March 1988, those same properties excluding subsequent additions and adjusted for disposals were revalued.
On adoption of FRS 15, the Group followed the transitional provisions to retain the book value of land and buildings which were revalued in 1988, but not to adopt a policy of revaluation in the future.
These values are retained subject to the requirement to test assets for impairment in accordance with FRS 11. d Investment properties Investment properties are revalued annually and included in the balance sheet at their open market value.
In accordance with SSAP19, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties.
This represents a departure from the Companies Act 1985 requirements concerning the depreciation of xed assets.
These properties are held for investment and the directors consider that the adoption of this policy is necessary to give a true and fair view.
Loans and advances to customers Loans and advances are classied as impaired when an instalment is in excess of 30 days overdue.
Specic provisions are made against all advances identied as impaired at the balance sheet date to the extent that, in the opinion of the directors, recovery is doubtful.
Specic provisions against such exposures are calculated using a bad debt provision model, which uses the last two years credit history to produce estimates of the likely level of asset impairment.
General provisions relate to latent bad and doubtful debts which are present in any lending portfolio but have not been specically identied.
General provisions are calculated using the same bad debt provision model and an evaluation of current economic and political factors.
Loans and advances are written off when there is no realistic prospect of recovery, based on a predetermined set of criteria.
Account balances written off include those where no payment has been received for a period of 12 months since the account was identied as doubtful, and in other situations such as bankruptcy, insolvency or fraud.
Long-term assurance business The value of the long-term assurance business consists of the present value of surpluses expected to emerge in the future from business currently in force, and this value is included in prepayments and accrued income.
In determining their value, these surpluses are discounted at a risk-adjusted, post-tax rate.
Changes in the value are included in the profit and loss account grossed up at the standard rate of corporation tax applicable to insurance companies.
Operating leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposures to uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Derivative instruments utilised by the Group include interest rate and currency swaps, and forward currency contracts.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments to net interest income over the period of the contract.
Forward currency contracts are accounted for as hedges, with the instruments impact on profit deferred until the underlying transaction is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Foreign currencies The results of international subsidiaries are translated at the weighted average of monthly exchange rates for sales and profits.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates.
The resulting exchange differences are dealt with through reserves and reported in the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities held at the year-end are translated at year-end exchange rates or the exchange rate of a related forward exchange contract where appropriate.
The resulting exchange gain or loss is dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Goodwill Prior to 31 March 1998, goodwill arising on consolidation was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition.
As permitted by FRS 10, this goodwill has not been reinstated in the balance sheet and remains written off to reserves.
Goodwill arising on subsequent acquisitions is capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life.
The profit or loss arising on the sale of a previously acquired business includes the attributable goodwill.
Pensions Funded pension plans are in place for the Groups UK employees and the majority of employees overseas.
The assets of these pension plans are managed by third party investment managers and are held separately in trust.
Regular valuations are prepared by independent professionally qualied actuaries.
These determine the level of contributions required to fund the benets set out in the rules of the plans and allow for the periodic increase of pensions in payment.
The contributions and any variations from regular cost arising from the actuarial valuations are charged or credited to profits on a systematic basis over the estimated remaining service lives of the employees.
Stocks Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value using the retail method.
All stocks are nished goods.
Segmental information A Classes of business The Group has two classes of business: Retailing and Financial Services.

Notes to the financial statements 3.
Segmental information continued B Geographical split The geographical segments disclose turnover and operating profit by destination and reect management responsibility.
This fee is payable by UK Retail and has been deducted in arriving at UK Retail operating profit.
2 Financial Services operating profit is stated after charging 103.7m last year 115.3m of interest to cost of sales.
This interest represents the cost of funding the Financial Services business as a separate segment, including both intra-group interest and third party funding.
The amount of third party interest payable by the Group amounted to 116.9m last year 107.4m see note 6.
Intra-group interest of 6.4m last year 7.9m, being the excess over third party interest payable, has been added back in the segmental analysis to arrive at total operating profit.
The intra-group interest added back this year arose in the first half of the year when the interest charged to cost of sales of Financial Services was greater than the interest payable for that period.
3 UK Retail turnover including VAT comprises clothing, footwear and gifts 3,773.4m last year 3,649.5m : home 373.3m last year 355.8m and foods 3,093.5m last year 2,925.9m.

FRS 19 requires, subject to certain exemptions, that deferred tax be recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
The Groups previous accounting policy was to recognise a liability or asset in respect of deferred tax to the extent that it was likely to be payable or recoverable.
As a result of this change in accounting policy, comparatives have been restated as follows: profit and loss account Tax charge profit loss Adjusted for the attributable to Earnings earnings period shareholders per share per share m m pence pence Period to 31 March 2001 as reported 142.7 1.3 0.0p 11.4p Implementation of FRS 19 6.8 6.8 0.2 p 0.2 p Period to 31 March 2001 as restated 149.5 5.5 0.2 p 11.2p In the current year, the effect of this change in accounting policy has been to increase the total tax charge for the period by 3.3m.

Notes to the financial statements 10.
Earnings per share The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on earnings after tax and minority interests and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
An adjusted earnings per share gure has been calculated in addition to the earnings per share required by FRS14, Earnings per Share and is based on earnings excluding the effect of the exceptional items.
It has been calculated to allow shareholders to gain a clearer understanding of the trading performance of the Group.
Details of the adjusted earnings per share are set out below: 2002 2001 Basic Diluted Basic Diluted pence pence pence pence m per share per share m per share per share As restated As restated As restated Basic earnings 153.0 5.4 5.4 5.5 0.2 0.2 Exceptional operating charges 19.3 0.7 0.7 profit loss on sale of property and other xed assets 41.2 1.5 1.5 83.2 2.9 2.9 Loss on sale termination of operations 353.5 12.4 12.3 1.7 0.1 0.1 Provision for loss on operations to be discontinued 222.7 7.7 7.7 Adjusted earnings 465.3 16.3 16.2 321.4 11.2 11.2 Operating profit loss from discontinued operations 12.6 0.4 0.4 20.4 0.7 0.7 Adjusted earnings from continuing operations 452.7 15.9 15.8 341.8 11.9 11.9 The weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the calculation of earnings per share are as follows: 2002 2001 m m Weighted average ordinary shares in issue during the year 2,841.7 2,872.4 Potentially dilutive share options under the Groups share option schemes 23.7 9.8 Weighted average ordinary shares for diluted earnings per share 2,865.4 2,882.2 In accordance with the provisions of FRS 14, earnings per share for prior periods have not been restated as a result of the Scheme of Arrangement.
Employees The average number of employees of the Group during the year was: 2002 2001 UK stores Management and supervisory categories 3,939 3,880 Other 50,583 55,511 UK head ofce Management and supervisory categories 2,369 2,242 Other 1,038 1,299 Financial Services Management and supervisory categories 208 189 Other 1,370 1,355 Overseas Continuing operations 4,988 4,514 Discontinued operations 5,404 7,501 69,899 76,491 If the number of hours worked was converted on the basis of a normal working week, the equivalent average number of full-time employees for continuing operations would have been 45,979 last year 46,466 and for discontinued operations 4,197 last year 5,747.
2 Total employee costs include salary and benets paid to a former director who was an employee of the Group for the period to 30 June 2001. www.
Employees continued A Pension costs The total pension cost for the Group was 147.9m last year 120.1m of which 138.5m relates to the UK scheme last year 110.6m, and 9.4m relates to overseas schemes last year 9.5m.
The Group operates a number of funded dened benefit pension schemes of which the UK scheme is by far the most significant.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the UK scheme was carried out at 1 April 2001 by an independent actuary using the projected unit method.
The key assumptions adopted were: % Ination rate 2.5 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.5 Rate of increase in salaries 4.0 Discount rate and rate of return on investments 6.0 This actuarial valuation revealed a shortfall of 134m in the market value of the assets of the UK Scheme of 3,102m compared to the actuarial liability for pension benets.
This represents a funding level of 96%.
The shortfall of 134m together with the unamortised accounting deficit relating to prior periods gives a total unamortised deficit of 177m.
This is being amortised in accordance with SSAP 24 over a period of 12 years from 1 April 2001, being the remaining estimated service lives of the current Scheme members.
The total UK pension cost is analysed as follows: 2002 2001 m m 1 Normal pension cost 116.1 92.6 Amortisation of deficit 14.8 14.1 Net interest elements 7.6 3.9 Total 138.5 110.6 1 At standard contribution rate of 19.7% last year 15.9%.
As shown in note 15, the Group has prepaid pension costs of 169.4m in relation to the UK scheme.
This includes the partial funding of the deficit, offset by the amortisation and interest elements shown above, with the balance being prepaid contributions to the UK scheme.
Financial Reporting Standard 17 FRS 17 Retirement benets was issued in November 2000 to replace SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs and is fully effective for accounting periods ending on or after 22 June 2003.
This year the Group has continued to account for pension costs under SSAP 24 as shown above, although in accordance with the FRS 17 transitional arrangements, certain additional disclosures are required as shown below.
The major assumptions used by the independent qualied actuaries in updating the most recent valuations of the UK and Republic of Ireland dened benefit pension schemes to 30 March 2002 for FRS 17 purposes were: % Rate of increase in salaries 4.0 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.5 Discount rate 5.9 Ination rate 2.5 Long-term healthcare cost increases 7.5 The assets in the UK and Republic of Ireland dened benefit pension schemes and the expected rates of return as at 30 March 2002 were: Long-term rate of return p. a.

Notes to the financial statements 11.
Employees continued The Group financial statements already reect a number of liabilities and assets relating to the retirement benefit schemes which give rise to the net post-retirement liabilities of 293m.
If FRS 17 had been adopted in the financial statements, the net effect of this change on shareholders funds would be as follows: m Net post-retirement liability 293 Amounts currently recognised in: Debtors prepayments and accrued income 50 Provisions for liabilities and charges unfunded pension plans 5 post-retirement healthcare 25 deferred tax 6 Effect on shareholders funds 307 The Groups net assets at 30 March 2002 would be as follows: m Net assets, excluding post-retirement liability 3,081 Effect on shareholders funds above 307 Net assets, including post-retirement liability 2,774 B Post-retirement health benets The Group has a commitment to pay all or a proportion of the health insurance premiums for a number of its retired employees and their spouses, the last of whom retired in 1988.
There is no commitment in respect of current employees or those who have retired since 1988.
At 30 March 2002, the Group reassessed this liability in accordance with the advice of an independent qualied actuary.
The discounted present value of 25.3m see note 22 has been fully provided.
The valuation assumed a premium ination of 7.5% and an after-tax discount rate of 5.9%.
There is a matching deferred taxation asset of 7.6m.
The next actuarial valuation will be carried out as at 31 March 2005.
C United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland profit sharing schemes The amount of profit which will be allocated this year, in the form of ordinary shares in the Company, has been xed at 12.6m last year 8.5m, representing 2.5% last year 1.75% of the earnings of 44,197 last year 43,741 eligible employees.
These shares are purchased in the market: 3,066,891 ordinary shares were purchased by the profit Sharing Trustees in respect of the 2000 2001 allocation.
D United Kingdom Employees Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme Under the terms of the Scheme, the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company once in each financial year to those employees who enter into an Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn SAYE savings contract.
The price at which options may be offered is 80% of the market price for three consecutive dealing days preceding the date of offer.
The options may normally be exercised during the period of six months after the completion of the SAYE contract, either three, five or seven years after entering the Scheme.
Employees continued E Executive Share Option Schemes Under the terms of the current Scheme, approved by shareholders in 2000, the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company to executive directors and senior employees at the market price on a date to be determined prior to the date of the offer.
No further options may be granted under the 1984, 1987 and 1997 Schemes.
Outstanding options under each of the 1984 and 1987 Schemes continue to be bound by the Maximum Option Value which is limited to four times remuneration on exercise further details are set out in the Remuneration Report on page 19.
