Two new UK financial reporting standards have been adopted during the period: FRS 17 Retirement benets and FRS 19 Deferred tax.
FRS 17 is being adopted in line with the transitional timetable laid down by the standard.
FRS 19 has been adopted in full with effect from 29 April 2001 and prior period comparatives have been restated where appropriate.
The principal accounting policies are set out below: 1.1 Accounting convention and basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiaries and associated undertakings.
The results of subsidiaries are included from the date on which control passes.
The net assets of subsidiaries acquired are recorded at their fair values, reecting their condition at that date.
The results of subsidiaries disposed of are included up to the effective date of disposal.
1.2 Turnover Turnover comprises sales of goods, services and property excluding value added tax and similar sales taxes.
1.3 Extended warranty and service contracts Extended warranty and service contracts are included in turnover in the period in which they are sold.
Full provision is made for liabilities for repair costs which the Group has assumed under these contracts.
1.4 Goodwill On acquisition of a subsidiary or associated undertaking, the fair value of the consideration is allocated between the identiable net tangible and intangible assets liabilities on a fair value basis, with any excess consideration representing goodwill.
Goodwill in respect of subsidiaries is included within intangible xed assets.
Goodwill relating to associated undertakings is included within the carrying value of the associated undertaking.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised as an asset on the balance sheet.
Where goodwill is regarded as having a limited estimated useful economic life, it is amortised on a systematic basis over its life up to a maximum of 20 years.
Where goodwill is regarded as having an indefinite life it is not amortised.
The estimated useful economic life is regarded as indefinite where goodwill is capable of continued measurement and the durability of the acquired business can be demonstrated.
Where goodwill is not amortised, an annual impairment review is performed and any impairment is charged to the profit and loss account.
As permitted by FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets, this represents a departure, for the purposes of giving a true and fair view, from the requirements of paragraph 21, Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985, which requires goodwill to be amortised.
In estimating the useful economic life of goodwill arising, account is taken of the nature of the business acquired, the stability of the industry, the extent of continuing barriers to market entry and the expected future impact of competition.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 2 May 1999 remains eliminated against reserves.
This goodwill will be charged in the profit and loss account as appropriate on the subsequent disposal of the business to which it relates.
1.5 Tangible xed assets Tangible xed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and, where appropriate, provision for impairment or estimated loss on disposal.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of the assets by equal instalments over their estimated useful lives.
The rates used are: Short leasehold property over the term of the lease 2 1 Freehold and long leasehold buildings between 1 3% and 2 2% per annum 1 Fixtures, ttings and equipment between 10% and 33 3% per annum No depreciation is provided on freehold and long leasehold land or on assets in the course of construction.
1.6 Investments Investments held as xed assets are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment in value.
In the consolidated financial statements, shares in associated undertakings are accounted for using the net equity method.
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the Groups share of the operating profits, net interest and attributable taxation of the associated undertaking.
In the consolidated balance sheet, the investment in associated undertakings is shown as the Groups share of the net assets liabilities of the associated undertakings.
Short term investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value with the exception of assets held to maturity, which are stated at cost net of amortised premium or discount.
51 Dixons Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2001 02 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued 1.7 Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of properties held for development includes the net development outgoings attributable to such properties and interest incurred during development on those projects where it is expected, on commencement, that the period will exceed one years duration.
1.8 Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided for in full on all timing differences which have not reversed at the balance sheet date.
No provision is made for tax which would become payable on the distribution of retained profits of overseas subsidiaries or associated undertakings, unless the distribution of such earnings has been accrued in the balance sheet.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
1.9 Translation of foreign currencies The results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange during the period.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences resulting from the translation of the results and balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings and related foreign currency borrowings are charged or credited to reserves.
Other exchange differences arising from foreign currency transactions are included in profit on ordinary activities before taxation.
1.10 Operating leases Rentals payable under property leases are charged to the profit and loss account in equal instalments up to each market rent review date throughout the lease term.
Rentals payable under leases for plant and machinery are charged to the profit and loss account in equal instalments over the total lease term.
1.11 Post retirement benets The Group operates a number of funded dened benefit pension schemes for eligible employees.
The expected cost of providing pensions, as calculated periodically by qualied actuaries, is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members in such a way that the pension cost is a substantially level percentage of current and expected future pensionable payroll.
The Group also operates dened contribution pension schemes and contributes to state pension schemes for certain overseas employees.
The costs are charged to the profit and loss account on an accruals basis as contributions become payable.
1.12 Derivative financial instruments derivatives The Group holds derivatives to manage the interest rate and currency exposure of borrowings, investments, future transactions and overseas subsidiary undertakings.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate derivatives are recognised as adjustments to interest over the period of the contract.
Foreign currency borrowings, investments and foreign exchange gains or losses on derivatives held to hedge net assets are carried in the balance sheet at the rates at the balance sheet date.
Gains or losses in respect of hedging of overseas subsidiaries or associated undertakings and investments denominated in foreign currencies are taken to reserves.
Gains or losses in respect of hedging of future transactions are deferred and recognised as appropriate when the hedged transaction occurs.

Elkjp is expected to continue to maintain its market share and profitability over the long term and it is not therefore possible to identify a nite useful economic life for this goodwill.
It is considered that the barriers to entry which exist in Elkjps markets, which are anticipated to continue, will prove this goodwill to be durable.
The application of an annual impairment test supports the value of this goodwill and, as a result, no charge for impairment is required at the balance sheet date.
It is not possible to quantify the effect of this departure from the Companies Act 1985 because no nite life for goodwill can be identied.
Goodwill arising on other acquisitions is amortised over periods not exceeding 20 years.

The principal scheme operates in the UK where the Group maintains a funded dened benefit pension scheme for its employees with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
Contributions are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualied actuaries so as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members.
The scheme is valued by a qualied actuary at least every three years.
The Group has announced that with effect from 1 September 2002, no further entrants will be permitted to the UK scheme and, instead, membership of a dened contribution pension scheme will be offered.
In the Nordic region, the Group operates secured dened benefit pension schemes with assets held in a life insurance company and an unsecured pension arrangement.
In addition, it makes contributions to a state pension scheme.
The effect of these schemes on the Groups results is not significant.
a Regular pension costs SSAP 24 Pension costs are accounted for in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs.
The Group paid contributions during the period of 16.2 million 2000 01 14.4 million.
The pension charge amounted to 12.2 million 2000 01 14.2 million.
This comprised the regular pension cost of 16.5 million 2000 01 15.2 million net of the amortisation of pension surpluses over the average remaining service lives of current employees on a straight line basis.
In addition, the pension charge in respect of dened contribution schemes was 0.4 million 2000 01 0.4 million.
A further 0.1 million 2000 01 0.1 million provision was made in respect of the unsecured pension arrangement.
The last actuarial valuation of the UK scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2001 using the projected unit method and has been used to determine the level of funding to the scheme.
The contribution rate, agreed in consultation with the actuaries, for both the year ended 27 April 2002 and future years is 9.9 per cent.
The principal actuarial assumptions used for accounting purposes were: Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.25% per annum Rate of increase to pensions Guaranteed Minimum Pension 3.0% per annum Pension in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pension 2.5% per annum Discount rate for accrued benets 6.5% per annum Ination assumption 2.5% per annum Investment return for future service benets 6.75% per annum At 5 April 2001, the market value of the schemes investments was 388.2 million and, based on the above assumptions, the value of the assets was sufficient to cover 106 per cent of the benets accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
This amounted to a surplus of assets over liabilities of 25 million.
"b FRS 17 disclosures A new financial reporting standard, FRS 17 Retirement benets"", will introduce new accounting policies in respect of pension arrangements."
Full adoption of FRS 17 is not immediately mandatory, but requires additional information to be disclosed in the intervening period on pension assets and liabilities with effect from 2001 02, as set out below, and pension expense with effect from 2002 03, based on methodologies set out in the standard which are different from those used by the scheme actuaries in determining funding arrangements.
Assumptions at 27 April 2002: Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.25% per annum Rate of increase in pensions in payment deferred pensions 2.5% per annum Discount rate 6.0% per annum Ination assumption 2.5% per annum Valuation at 27 April 2002: Long term expected rate of return million Equities 8.0% 347.6 Bonds 5.2% 30.4 Cash 4.5% 14.8 Market value of assets 392.8 Present value of liabilities 468.9 deficit in the plan 76.1 Related deferred tax asset 22.8 Net pension liability 53.3 The deficit under FRS 17 reects the different basis for valuing assets and liabilities compared with SSAP 24.
The net position is sensitive to market conditions at the assessment date of 27 April 2002, particularly the movement of equity prices relative to corporate bond prices.
If the full provisions of FRS 17 were reected in the financial statements for the year ended 27 April 2002, the Groups profit and loss account reserve of 1,067.6 million and the Groups net assets of 1,616.7 million would be reduced, by 58.6 million, including the elimination of the SSAP 24 pension prepayment, to 1,009.0 million and 1,558.1 million, respectively.
