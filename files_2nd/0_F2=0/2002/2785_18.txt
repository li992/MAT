The following summary financial data should be read in conjunction with Operating and Financial Review and Prospects and our historical consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto.
The summary statement of income data set forth below for the fiscal years ended 30 September 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999 and 1998, and the consolidated balance sheet data at 30 September 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999 and 1998 have been derived from our audited historical consolidated financial statements, but do not, however, constitute our statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 240 of the Companies Act 1985 in the United Kingdom.
ii Under UK GAAP, potentially dilutive issuable shares are only included in the calculation of fully diluted earnings per share if their issue would decrease net profit per share or increase net loss per share.
Since the Group has reported losses, its basic and fully diluted loss per share are therefore equal.
