A deferred tax asset of 14,980,000 2001 4,738,000 has been recognised in respect of these amounts.
The increase in the deferred tax asset arises mainly as a result of the acquisition of Global Switch see note 14.
No provision has been made for taxation which might become payable if the groups investment properties and operating assets were sold at the net amount at which they are stated in the financial statements: the additional taxation liability could amount to approximately 115,000,000 2001 140,000,000 in respect of investment properties and approximately 3,600,000 2001 8,360,000 in respect of operating assets.

Shareholders are being offered the opportunity to receive the final dividend in the form of new fully paid ordinary shares instead of cash.
9 Earnings and net assets per ordinary share The calculation of basic earnings per ordinary share is based on the loss for the year of 15,807,000 2001 loss of 44,097,000 and on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue of 270,361,399 2001 244,536,431.
No further adjustment has been made to the number of ordinary shares in issue when calculating the diluted earnings per share because of the anti dilutive nature of that adjustment.
The calculation of basic net assets per ordinary share is based on the net assets of 1,023,147,000 2001 966,482,000 and on the number of ordinary shares in issue at the end of the year of 281,388,627 2001 244,858,602 which excludes shares held for awards under the LTIP.
The calculation of diluted net assets per ordinary share allows for the exercise of outstanding share options, where the exercise price is below the market value of the shares at the end of the year, and the vesting of the LTIP shares.

ix Group policy with respect to derivatives The group uses a combination of xed rate loans and interest rate swaps to reduce the groups sensitivity to interest rate uctuations to an acceptable level.
The proportion of borrowings that are at xed rates varies but is maintained within limits set by the board.
At the balance sheet date, 65 per cent 2001 85 per cent of the groups net borrowings were xed.
The xed interest period is matched to the length of the relevant property income stream taking account of market rates quoted at the time.
Assets denominated in currencies other than sterling, such as the groups investment properties in the US and the Global Switch properties held ouside the UK, are nanced by borrowings in the same currency so as to minimise the groups exposure to foreign exchange movements.
Other exposures to foreign exchange are hedged with forward contracts where possible to x the rate at which these amounts are converted into sterling.
