This excludes amounts in respect of businesses sold.
A substantial part of the Groups reserves are held in overseas subsidiary undertakings and branches principally to support local operations or to comply with local regulations.
The maintenance of local regulatory capital ratios could potentially restrict the amount of reserves which can be remitted.
In addition, if these overseas reserves were to be remitted, further unprovided taxation liabilities might arise.

Financial Reporting Standard 19 Deferred Tax FRS19 is effective for accounting periods ending on or after 23 January 2002, and the Group adopted FRS19 in the current period.
It specifies the provisions that are required for Deferred Tax, which are on a different basis to its predecessor, Statement of Standard Accounting Practice15.
The adjustments have no effect on current or prior periods tax charge but affect the Deferred Tax balances, and Reserves.
The brought forward balances at 1 January 2001 have been restated as follows: the Deferred Tax Asset balance is increased by $156 million, the profit and Loss Reserves balance is increased by $140 million and the Premises Revaluation Reserve is increased by $16 million.
In the Company balance sheet, the carrying value of Investments in Subsidiary Undertakings and the Revaluation Reserve is increased by $156 million.
In February 2002, the Urgent Issues Task Force issued Abstract 33 UITF 33 Obligations in Capital Instruments.
This reviewed the classication of instruments that have the characteristics of both liabilities and shareholders funds and provided further guidance on the accounting treatment of these issues.
In 2001, the 300 million 8.103 per cent Step-up Callable Perpetual Trust Preferred Securities and the 500 million 8.16 per cent non-cumulative Trust Preferred Securities were treated as minority interests non-equity in the consolidated accounts of Standard Chartered PLC, in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 4 Capital Instruments.
As a result of complying with UITF 33 the instruments have been reclassified from minority interests non-equity to liabilities.
The restatement of principal balances at 31December 2001 is $878 million together with accrued interest is $51million and fee accruals of $11million.
The associated minority interest payable reclassified to interest payable is $59 million, for the year ended 31December 2001.
Comparative figures for the year ended 31December 2001are restated to reflect these changes to accounting policy.

The risk section of the Financial Review on page 37 explains risk management with respect to the Groups hedging policies.
Structural Currency Exposures The Groups structural currency exposures were as follows: 2002 2001 Borrowing Borrowing in the functional in the functional currency of the currency of the units concerned units concerned hedging the net Structural hedging the net Structural Net investments investment currency Net investments investment currency in overseas units in the units exposures in overseas units in the units exposures $million $million $million $million $million $million Functional currency of the business unit: Singapore Dollar 49 49 4 4 Indian Rupee 459 459 278 278 Hong Kong Dollar 32 32 Malaysian Ringgit 428 428 453 453 Thai Baht 27 27 20 20 UAE Dirham 170 170 316 316 Sterling 1,593 1,542 51 633 725 92 Other non US dollar 799 799 808 808 Total 3,493 1,542 1,951 2,512 725 1,787 100 Standard Chartered 50.
Structural Currency Exposures continued Structural currency exposures for 2001and 2002 relate to net investments in non US dollar units.
In the years ended 31December 2001and 2002, the Groups main operations in non US dollar units were Asia, Africa and the United Kingdom.
The main operating or functional currencies of its overseas business units therefore include Hong Kong Dollar, Malaysian Ringgit, Singapore Dollar and Sterling.
As the Group prepares its consolidated financial statements in US dollars, it follows that the Groups consolidated balance sheet is affected by movements in the exchange rates between functional currencies and US dollars.
These currency exposures are referred to as structural.
Translation gains and losses arising from these exposures are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.

The Group measures the risk of losses arising from future potential adverse movements in interest and exchange rates, prices and volatilities using VaR methodology.
This methodology measures the estimated potential change in the market value of the portfolio during a specified period.
The Group Trading book exposure shown in the table above is not a sum of the interest rate and exchange rate risks.
The highest and lowest VaR are independent, and could have occurred on different days.
The Group uses a combination of variance-covariance methodology and historical simulation to measure VaR on all market risk related activities.
In 2002, most of the trading book VaR was measured using the historical simulation and the remainder using the variance-covariance approach.
The exposures above are reported under the variance-covariance methodology VaR is calculated for expected movements over a minimum of one business day and to a confidence level of approximately 97.5 per cent.
This confidence level suggests that potential daily losses, in excess of the VaR measure, are only likely to be experienced six times per year.
For derivative products and FX products the historic simulation method is used with an observation period of 250 days.
The historical simulation approach involves the complete revaluation of all unmatured contracts to reflect the effect of historically observed changes in market risk factors on the valuation of the current portfolio.
This entails building a set of valuations of the portfolio and a set of changes in value relative to the current market valuation, from which VaR can be derived.
The variance-covariance methodology is based on statistical analysis of past interest and exchange rate movements over the past two to three years with greater weight given to more recent data.
The derived volatility and correlations are applied to risk factor sensitivities to measure the VaR.
Offsetting between exchange rate and interest rate exposures is not allowed.
This approach is conservative, as the diversification effects that would be implied if such offsetting were allowed, are likely to have the impact of reducing the overall VaR.

Market Risk continued The Group recognises that there are limitations to the generic VaR methodology.
These limitations include the fact that the risk factors may not fall within the assumption of a normal distribution, i. e. that a greater than expected number of observations may fall outside the stated confidence level.
Also, the historical data may not be the best proxy for future price movements, either because the observation period does not include extreme price movements or, in some cases, because data is not available.
Losses beyond the confidence interval are not captured by a VaR calculation, which therefore gives no indication of the size of unexpected losses in these situations.
This is particularly relevant in the case of extreme market movements, which may arise in periods of low liquidity and invalidate the assumption that positions can be closed in a liquid market.
VaR is calculated as the Groups exposure as at the close of business, London time.
Intra-day risk levels may vary from those reported at the end of the day.
To manage the risk arising from events which the VaR methodology does not capture, the Group regularly back-tests and stress tests its main risk exposures.
In back testing actual profits and losses are compared with VaR estimates to track the accuracy of the predictions.
Stress testing involves valuing portfolios at prices which assume extreme changes in risk factors beyond the range of normal experience.
Positions that would give rise to potentially significant losses under a low probability stress event are reviewed by the Group Risk Committee.
Hedging Instruments Unrecognised Gains and Losses on Derivative Hedges Gains and losses on derivatives used for hedging are recognised and reported in the profit and loss account and balance sheet in line with the underlying items which are being hedged.
At 31December 2002, the unrecognised gains and losses on derivatives used for hedging where the item being hedged had not been recognised were $20 million and $18 million respectively.

However, to reserves of $42 million 2001: credit of $1million.
a revaluation decrease should be charged directly against any related revaluation reserve to the extent that the decrease does not exceed the amount held in the revaluation reserve in respect of that same asset.
Any excess thereafter will be charged to the profit and loss account.
At 31December 2002, the Groups total properties comprised less than one per cent of the Groups total assets.
A formal revaluation of certain of the Groups principal properties was performed at 31August 2002, and at 30 September 2002 for all other properties, by independent valuers.
If the Group had prepared its financial statements under Hong Kong SSAP17 there would have been a net charge to the profit and loss account of $80 million 2001: $Nil million in respect of valuations below depreciated historical cost.
