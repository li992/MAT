Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st December 2002 1 Accounting policies The Group adopted FRS18, Accounting Policies, in the previous year although this did not require any change in accounting policies.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost convention.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements comprise a consolidation of the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of businesses acquired are included from the effective date of acquisition and businesses sold are included up to the date of disposal.
The accounting reference date of the Company and all trading subsidiary undertakings is 31 December.
Goodwill and amortisation Purchased goodwill, being the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets of newly acquired undertakings, is capitalised on the balance sheet, and amortised over its useful economic life not exceeding 20 years.
Prior to 1st January 1998, all purchased goodwill was written off to reserves on acquisition.
Previously written off goodwill has not been reinstated and is charged to the profit and loss account on the disposal or termination of the related business.
Tangible xed assets and depreciation Tangible xed assets are stated at cost less depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write down the cost of tangible assets to their estimated residual value in equal instalments over their estimated useful lives.
The range of estimated useful lives for each major asset category are: Leasehold land and buildings Term of the lease Plant and equipment, xtures and ttings 3 to 8 years Fixed asset investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings are held at original cost less any provision for impairment.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided on the liability method where, in the opinion of the directors, it is probable that the liability will crystallise in the foreseeable future.
Pension costs Pension costs are charged to the profit and loss account in such a way as to provide for the liabilities evenly over the average remaining working lives of the employees.
The Group has adopted the transitional rules on pensions disclosure under FRS 17.
Leases Where xed assets are nanced by leasing agreements which give rights approximately equivalent to ownership finance lease, the assets are capitalised and depreciated accordingly.
The corresponding lease commitments are treated as obligations to the lessor.
All other lease payments are charged to the profit and loss account in the year to which they relate.
Share Schemes The Groups Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST is a separately administered trust which is funded by a loan and a gift from the Group, and the assets of which comprise shares in the Company.
Shares in the QUEST are shown at their estimated recoverable amount, being the option price of the shares payable by employees.
The amounts contributed to the QUEST in excess of the option price are charged against reserves.
2 Turnover Turnover represents the amount invoiced net of value added tax in respect of the provision of services delivered to customers during the year.

The other businesses that were acquired during the year have been fully integrated into the Groups existing businesses.
These businesses generated turnover of 1,746,000.
However, because of the integration, it is not possible to separately identify operating profits of these businesses.
Accordingly, the results of these acquired businesses have been included within existing operations.

Costs incurred in the year in respect of this project amounted to 3,100,000 and primarily comprise redundancy and other related costs.
A tax credit of 846,000 arose on these restructuring costs.
In 2001, following the acquisition of Healthcall and the Goldsborough businesses, the decision was taken to restructure the acquired businesses and integrate them with the Groups existing businesses.
The costs associated with the restructuring and the integration amounted to 3,674,000 and mainly comprised redundancy and other staff-related costs, property withdrawal costs and IT integration costs.
A tax credit of 1,030,000 was booked in respect of these exceptional charges.
On 2nd July 2002, the DTI announced that it had awarded the MAP contract for the assessment of lung disease in coalminers to a third party.
In the light of the loss of the contract, the Board reviewed the carrying value of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Healthcall and decided to write it down by 15,000,000.
A 51% share of Hertford Medical International Limited was acquired at the end of 2000.
Its performance following acquisition was below expectations and a review of the carrying value of the Groups 51% interest was undertaken in 2001.
Accordingly, it was determined that xed assets had been impaired by 73,000 and goodwill by 827,000.
Subsequently, the decision was taken to dispose of the Groups interest see below.
The exceptional gain, after operating profit, on disposal of a subsidiary undertaking in 2002 of 800,000 comprises the gain on disposal of the Groups 51% share of Hertford Medical International Limited in August 2002.
Cash consideration was 670,000 and estimated deferred consideration was 570,000.
No tax credit has been recognised in respect of this exceptional gain.
After deducting costs, the net cash inow from the disposal was 533,000.
The turnover and trading results of the subsidiary for the period to disposal were not material.

50 Nestor Healthcare Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 12 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has only one category of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
Earnings per share before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items have been calculated to show the impact of goodwill amortisation and exceptional items as these can have a distorting effect on earnings and therefore warrant separate consideration.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

This is the period over which the directors estimate that the value of the underlying businesses acquired in each case is expected to exceed the value of the underlying assets.
The impairment in the year of 15,000,000 relates to Healthcall.
As explained in note 5, the directors have reviewed the carrying value of the Groups interest in the shares of Healthcall.
Accordingly it has been determined that goodwill has been impaired by 15,000,000.

Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures.
57 Nestor Healthcare Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st December 2002 21 Financial Instruments continued Interest rate prole of financial liabilities The interest rate prole of the Groups financial liabilities at 31st December 2002 was: Financial Floating rate liabilities financial on which no Total liabilities interest paid 000 000 000 At 31st December 2002 all sterling 72,942 72,891 51 At 31st December 2001 all sterling 84,445 84,363 82 All the Groups creditors falling due within one year other than bank and other borrowings are excluded from the above tables either due to their short-term nature or because they do not meet the denition of a financial liability, such as tax balances.
Included within oating rate financial liabilities are 35 million of borrowings upon which the Group has entered into interest rate swaps that have the effect of restricting LIBOR rates on those borrowings to between 4.0% and 5.6%.
The net fair value of these swaps at 31st December 2002 was nil.
Included in the above are the Groups provisions of 3,934,000 2001 4,672,000 for onerous contracts note 22 which meet the denition of financial liabilities.
These financial liabilities are considered to be oating rate liabilities as, in establishing the provisions, the cash ows have been discounted and the discount rate is re-appraised at each half yearly reporting date to ensure that it reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the liability.
Other oating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates, based on LIBOR, which are xed in advance for periods of between one month and twelve months.
The weighted average period to maturity of financial liabilities that bear no interest at 31st December 2002 was 1.5 years 2001 1.5 years.
Interest rate prole of financial assets The interest rate prole of the Groups financial assets at 31st December 2002 was: Financial assets Floating rate on which financial no interest Total assets received 000 000 000 Sterling 9,170 9,114 56 Australian dollars 4 4 New Zealand dollars 18 18 US dollars 4 4 At 31st December 2002 9,196 9,114 82 Sterling 4,280 4,220 60 Australian dollars 21 21 New Zealand dollars 24 24 Euros 1 1 US dollars 15 15 At 31st December 2001 4,341 4,220 121 The financial assets comprise loan notes, bank deposits, bank current account balances and cash in hand.

27 Contingent liabilities In 1993, CCHP a partner in the Cross Country Stafng CCS partnership commenced a programme of providing tax-free meal and lodging benets Travel Benets to the travelling nurses it employed.
Such benets were also provided to nurses employed by CCS following the establishment of the CCS partnership by CCHP and MRA Stafng Services Inc. a former subsidiary of the Group on 1st July 1996.
The portion of the programme providing meal reimbursements was terminated on 1st June 1999 and applied to all contracts with nurses entered into prior to 1st June 1999.
In November 1998, the Internal Revenue Service of the US the IRS issued a payroll tax assessment of US$21.8 million for unpaid payroll tax in relation to the Travel Benets provided to nurses for the 1993 to 1995 tax years of CCHP which were in the process of being reviewed by the IRS.
On 23rd March 1999, CCHP led a claim against the IRS in the United States Court of Federal Claims protesting this assessment.
CCHP and the Company have received advice from legal advisers in the United States that CCHP should either succeed in opposing this assessment, or be able to settle the case for a signicantly lower sum in relation to all tax years during which the programme operated.
The Companys liability of such settlement would be limited to amounts relating to the period since 1st July 1996 being the date of establishment of the CCS partnership and, taking this into account, the Companys share of any liability would be approximately 22%, with W R Grace & Co. being liable for substantially all of the remaining share.
Based upon the advice received, the directors do not believe it is appropriate to make any provision in the financial statements.
62 Nestor Healthcare Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 28 Pension commitments The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24 and the disclosures given in a are those required by that standard.
FRS 17 Retirement Benets was issued in November 2000 but will not be mandatory for the Group and company until the year ending 31st December 2005.
Prior to this, phased transitional disclosures are required.
a Group pension schemes The Group operates two funded pension schemes providing benets based on final pensionable salary.
The two schemes are the Nestor Healthcare Group Retirement Benets Scheme the Nestor Scheme and the Healthcall Group Limited Pension Scheme the Healthcall Scheme.
Both schemes are closed to new members.
The schemes are administered by Trustees separately from the affairs of the Group and are contracted out of the additional component of the State Pension Scheme.
Nestor Scheme Watson Wyatt Partners, LLP, consulting actuaries, carried out an actuarial valuation of the Nestor Scheme as at 5th April 2000.
On the actuarial basis used, as at that date the market value of the assets was 82% of the value placed on the liabilities in respect of benets earned to 5th April 2000, allowing for expected future increases in pensionable earnings to Normal Pension Age, treating the scheme as an ongoing entity.
The market value of the investments held in the scheme as at the valuation date was 9,059,000.
In addition there were pensions in payment secured by the purchase of annuities.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of investment return on future net cash ow and the rate of increase in pensionable earnings.
These rates were set relative to an assumed long-term rate of price ination of 3% per annum.
The assumed future rate of investment return, used to discount projected income and outgoing benets, was a real rate of 3.5% per annum relative to price ination.
Pensionable earnings were assumed to increase on average at a rate of 3% per annum ahead of price ination.
The employers contribution rate currently 17% is calculated using the projected unit method and the shortfall of assets as at 5th April 2000 is amortised as a constant percentage of members pensionable earnings over the average expected working lifetime of the active members.
As the Nestor scheme is closed to new members, under the projected unit method the employers contribution rate will increase as the members of that scheme approach retirement.
Healthcall Scheme Watson Wyatt Partners, LLP, consulting actuaries, carried out an actuarial valuation of the Healthcall Scheme as at 1st November 2001.
On the actuarial basis used, as at that date the assessed value of the assets was 51% of the capitalised value of the accrued benets, allowing for expected future increases in pensionable earnings to Normal Pension Age, treating the scheme as an on-going entity.
The market value of the investments held in the scheme as at the valuation date was 5,346,000.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of investment return and the rate of increase in pensionable earnings.
It was assumed that the investment return would be 1% higher than the average increase in pensionable earnings.
The employers contribution rate currently 21% is calculated using the projected unit method and the shortfall of assets as at 1st November 2001 is amortised as a constant percentage of members pensionable earnings over the average remaining expected service lives of the active members.
As the Healthcall scheme is closed to new members, under the projected unit method, the employers contribution rate will increase as the members of that scheme approach retirement.
Pension charge The pension charge for the year was 2,649,000 2001 1,883,000.
The increase reects higher employer contribution rates to the Nestor and Healthcall schemes, following the nalisation of the actuarial valuations in 2001 and 2002 respectively, and the increase in the number of employees participating in the Groups Schemes.
At 31st December 2002, there was a net pension liability of 4,708,000 2001 1,129,000 included in the Groups balance sheet comprising an asset of nil 2001 371,000 included in debtors and a liability of 4,708,000 2001 1,500,000 included within provisions.
This relates to the formal valuation of the Heathcall scheme as at the date of acquisition, adjusted for subsequent movements.
This liability is expected to be satisfied by annual payments of 500,000 up to 2015.

Share options in issue expire after a certain time and exercise dates vary.
Exercise rights are subject to the rules of the schemes and share options in issue are not normally exercisable until the expiry of a period of at least three years.
In addition, achievement of performance levels is normally required in all schemes except the SAYE scheme.
