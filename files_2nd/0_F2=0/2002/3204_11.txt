Centrica plc report 2002 41 Notes to the financial statements continued 2002 2001 8 Tax m m a Analysis of tax charge for the year The tax charge comprises: Current tax UK corporation tax 148 157 i Tax on exceptional items 2 9 Adjustments in respect of prior years 16 43 162 105 Foreign tax Foreign tax 17 6 Adjustments in respect of prior years 2 17 4 Total current tax 179 109 Deferred tax Origination and reversal of timing differences 9 10 Deferred petroleum revenue tax relief 55 49 ii Exceptional deferred tax charge 9 Total deferred tax 55 39 Share of joint ventures tax 16 7 Total tax on profit on ordinary activities 250 155 i The tax credit arising on exceptional items related to those costs identified as exceptional in note 5. ii The exceptional tax charge in 2002 comprised an increase in deferred tax provisions arising from the supplementary charge applicable to profits on ring-fenced offshore gas production.
b Factors affecting the tax charge for the year The differences between the total current tax shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax to the profit before tax is as follows: 2002 2001 m m Profit on ordinary activities before tax 719 468 Less: share of joint ventures and associates profit before tax 31 34 Group profit on ordinary activities before tax 688 434 Tax on group profit on ordinary activities at standard UK corporation tax rate of 30% 2001: 30% 207 130 Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including goodwill amortisation 51 61 Depreciation in excess of capital allowances 7 50 Utilisation of tax losses and other short term timing differences 82 40 Deferred petroleum revenue tax relief 55 49 Higher tax rates on overseas earnings 6 2 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of prior years 16 45 Supplementary charge applicable to upstream profits 12 Overseas losses or taxation not available for credit 17 Group current tax charge for the year 179 109 c Factors that may affect future tax charges The group earns its profits primarily in the UK, therefore the tax rate used for tax on profit on ordinary activities is the standard rate for UK corporation tax, currently 30%.
Fair values are attributed to fixed assets on acquisition of businesses and companies and amortisation or depreciation is subsequently provided based upon those amounts.
Were the assets to be sold at the book values at the balance sheet date without the benefit of tax planning arrangements, the amount of tax that would be payable is estimated in aggregate to be 168 million of which 146 million is provided in the balance sheet as deferred tax.
There is, however, no intention to sell any of these assets in the foreseeable future and therefore the crystallisation of the above tax charge is considered to be remote.

10 Earnings per ordinary share Earnings per ordinary share has been calculated by dividing the earnings for the financial year of 478 million 2001: 323 million by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 4, 181 million 2001: 3,984 million.
The number of shares excluded 27 million ordinary shares 2001: 34 million, being the weighted average number of the companys own shares recorded on the group balance sheet during the year in accordance with UITF Abstract 13 ESOP Trusts.
The directors believe that the presentation of an adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, being the basic earnings per ordinary share adjusted for exceptional charges and goodwill amortisation, assists with understanding the underlying performance of the group.
The reconciliation of basic to adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share is as follows: 2002 2001 Pence per Pence per ordinary ordinary m share m share Earnings basic 478 11.4 323 8.1 Exceptional items net of tax 35 0.9 71 1.8 Goodwill amortisation 123 2.9 88 2.2 Earnings adjusted basic 636 15.2 482 12.1 Earnings diluted 478 11.3 323 8.0 In addition to basic and adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, information is presented for diluted earnings per ordinary share.
Under this presentation, there are no adjustments to the reported earnings for either 2002 or 2001, but the weighted average number of shares used as the denominator is adjusted.
The adjustments relate mainly to notional share awards made to employees under the long term incentive scheme and the share options granted to employees under the savings-related share option scheme, as follows: 2002 2001 million million shares shares Weighted average number of shares in issue 4,181 3,984 Estimated vesting of long term incentive scheme shares 35 34 Dilutive effect of shares to be issued at a discount to market value under the savings-related share option scheme 10 43 Potentially dilutive shares issuable under the executive share option scheme 1 1 Weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of diluted earnings per ordinary share 4,227 4,062 Centrica plc report 2002 43 Notes to the financial statements continued 11 Intangible fixed assets goodwill m Cost 1 January 2002 1,684 i Acquisitions 466 Disposals 17 Exchange adjustments 56 31 December 2002 2,077 Amortisation 1 January 2002 160 Charge for the year 116 Disposals 6 Exchange adjustments 6 31 December 2002 264 Net book value ii 31 December 2002 1,813 31 December 2001 1,524 i Acquisitions included 8 million for the revision of provisional fair values relating to the recoverability of certain receivables on the Enron Direct acquisition made in 2001. ii The net book value of goodwill at 31 December related to the following acquisitions: Amortisation 2002 2001 period m m years The AA 829 879 15-20 Goldfish Bank 124 138 10 Direct Energy 279 332 15 Energy America 41 52 15 Enron Direct 53 49 15 One.

The groups share of joint ventures gross assets and gross liabilities principally comprised its interests in Humber Power Limited a power station, Centrica Personal Finance Limited AA and British Gas personal loans activities, AA Financial Services AA credit card activities and Luminus NV energy supply.
The groups share of joint ventures gross liabilities included loans payable to the group amounting to 4 million 2001: 12 million.
The share of Humber Power Limiteds gross liabilities includes 269 million 2001: 270 million of lease finance, of which 254 million 2001: 258 million is repayable after more than five years.
Although the group holds a majority of the voting rights in Humber Power Limited, it is restricted in its ability to exercise these rights under an agreement with the other shareholder.
Consequently the investment has not been consolidated but has been accounted for as a joint venture.

The estimate has been based on proven and probable reserves, price levels and technology at the balance sheet date.
The timing of decommissioning payments are dependent on the lives of a number of fields but are anticipated to occur between 2005 and 2042.
The revision in the year is due to an increase in the estimate for gas field abandonment costs.
The profit and loss charge represents 4 million of notional interest 2001: 3 million.
Deferred petroleum revenue tax The provision for tax on gas and oil activities has been calculated on a unit of production basis.
Deferred corporation tax A deferred tax provision has been made in respect of accelerated capital allowances and other timing differences, net of recognised deferred tax assets.
Pension and other retirement benefits This provision included the difference between charges to the profit and loss account and the contributions paid to the pension schemes in respect of retirement pensions and other related benefits.
Restructuring costs The provision represented costs relating to surplus properties, redundancy and other costs relating to reorganisations.
Surplus properties arose mainly following the closure of retail operations in both British Gas Energy Centres and in the AA.
The provision relating to surplus properties was calculated as the lower of the difference between rental costs and sublet income over the remainder of the leases and the potential cost to surrender those leases.
The provision for redundancy costs reflected announced restructuring plans.
The majority of these sums were expected to be spent between 2004 and 2005.
Centrica plc report 2002 47 Notes to the financial statements continued 19 Provisions for liabilities and charges continued Sales contract loss and renegotiation provisions The sales contract loss provision represented the net present cost, using a risk free discount rate, of expected losses on onerous long term sales contracts, based on the difference between the contracted sales price and the expected weighted average cost of gas.
These contracts terminate between 2005 and 2006.
The profit and loss charge included 14 million of notional interest 2001: 15 million.
In previous years, the group renegotiated certain long term Take or Pay contracts which would have resulted in commitments to pay for gas that would be excess to requirements and or at prices above likely market rates.
The provision represented the net present cost of estimated payments due to suppliers as consideration for the renegotiations, which are due for settlement between 2003 and 2008.
Other Other provisions principally cover estimated liabilities in respect of claims reflected in the groups insurance subsidiaries, Goldfish credit card loyalty points, outstanding litigation, and provision for National Insurance payable in respect of long term incentive scheme liabilities.
The National Insurance provision was based on a share price of 171 pence at 31 December 2002 2001: 222 pence.

The Centrica Employees Share Trusts were established to acquire ordinary shares in the company, by subscription or purchase, with funds provided by way of interest free loans from the company to satisfy rights to shares on the vesting of allocations made under the companys long term incentive arrangements.
Since the beginning of 2002, no further shares have been acquired by the trust.
Any future shortfall will be satisfied by the allotment and issue of new shares.
At 31 December 2002, the trusts held 27 million 2001: 39 million ordinary shares in the company which had a market value of 47 million 2001: 39 million ordinary shares with a market value of 88 million.
Dividends due on shares held in trust are waived in accordance with the trust deeds.

54 Centrica plc report 2002 26 Pensions Substantially all of the groups UK employees at 31 December 2002 were members of one of the four main schemes in the group: the Centrica Staff Pension Scheme, the Centrica Engineers Pension Scheme, the Centrica Management Pension Scheme and the AA Staff Pension Scheme.
They are subject to independent valuations at least every three years, on the basis of which the qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers contributions which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the schemes assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the schemes.
The Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme is an unfunded arrangement which provides benefits to certain employees whose benefits under the main schemes would otherwise be limited by the earnings cap.
Independent actuarial valuations for Statement of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP 24 purposes at 31 March 2001 showed aggregate actuarial asset values and those values relative to benefits due to members, calculated on the basis of pensionable earnings and services on an ongoing basis using the projected unit method as follows: Asset values Asset relative to values liabilities m % Centrica Staff Pension Scheme 713 105 Centrica Engineers Pension Scheme 396 106 Centrica Management Pension Scheme 254 115 AA Staff Pension Scheme 676 117 The long term assumptions applied to calculate group pension costs, 2002 2001 as agreed with the independent actuary, are set out below: % % Rate of price inflation and pension increases 2.50 2.50 Annual rate of return on investments 6.70 6.70 Future increases in employee earnings 4.50 4.50 Dividend growth 3.75 3.75 The pension costs arising, together with unfunded pension costs, 2002 2001 and the reconciliation to the balance sheet provision was as follows: m m Regular pension costs 95 84 Amortisation of surplus 21 21 74 63 Interest 10 12 Net pension costs 64 51 Contributions paid 107 26 Decrease Increase in provision for pension costs 43 25 Pension provision at 1 January 98 73 Pension provision at 31 December 55 98 i AA post retirement private medical insurance 21 18 ii Direct Energy Marketing Limited post retirement benefits 1 Pension and other retirement benefits provision note 19 75 116 Other retirement benefits i The group has a commitment to provide post retirement private medical insurance cover for certain AA current and past employees.
The triennial independent actuarial valuation undertaken at 31 December 2001, assuming a 2.5% per annum real increase in premiums disclosed a liability of 27 million.
The provision under this scheme as recognised under SSAP 24 was 21 million 2001: 18 million.
The net cost to the group of retirement benefits under this scheme was 3 million 2001: 3 million.
ii The group has a commitment to provide certain pension and other post retirement benefits to employees of Direct Energy Marketing Limited Canada.
The Direct Energy Marketing Limited pension plan was established on 1 March 2002 and an independent actuarial valuation carried out on 7 May 2002, which disclosed a surplus in respect of pension benefits of 6 million and a deficit in respect of non-pension post retirement benefits of 4 million, resulting in a net surplus of 2 million.
The net cost to the group of retirement benefits under this scheme was 1 million and the net surplus recognised at 31 December 2002 was 1 million.
The total net cost to the group of other retirement benefits on a SSAP 24 basis was 4 million 2001: 3 million.
Additional disclosures regarding the groups defined benefit pension schemes, the unapproved pension arrangement and the post retirement medical plan are required under the transitional provisions of FRS 17Retirement Benefits.
The disclosures provide information which will be necessary for the full implementation of FRS 17 in due course.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at the following dates: the approved pension schemes at 31 March 2001, the unapproved pension scheme at 6 April 2002, the Direct Energy Marketing Limited pension plan at 7 May 2002 and the post retirement medical liability at 31 December 2001.
These have been updated to 31 December 2002 for the purposes of meeting the requirements of FRS 17.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at market value.
31 December 31 December 2002 2001 The major assumptions used for the actuarial valuation were: % % Rate of increase in employee earnings 4.3 4.5 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.3 2.5 Discount rate 5.75 5.8 Inflation assumption 2.3 2.5 Centrica plc report 2002 55 Notes to the financial statements continued 26 Pensions continued The market value of the assets in the schemes, the present value of the liabilities in the schemes and the expected rate of return at the balance sheet date were: Expected rate Expected rate of return of return per annum Valuation per annum Valuation 2002 2002 2001 2001 31 December %m %m Equities 8.4 1,503 8.0 1,759 Bonds 4.8 267 5.2 274 Property 6.9 62 7.1 60 Cash and other assets 4.0 50 4.5 100 Total fair value of assets 7.7 1,882 7.5 2,193 Present value of schemes liabilities 2,713 2,526 Deficit in the schemes 831 333 Related deferred tax asset 249 100 Net pension liability 582 233 Under SSAP 24 the balance sheet on page 33 includes a provision of 75 million at 31 December 2002 2001: 116 million.
Had FRS 17 been implemented in full at that date the net assets of the group would have been reduced by 507 million 2001: 117 million, and the net charge for pension costs in the profit and loss account would have increased by 47 million 2001: 16 million compared with that under SSAP 24, as set out below: Increase FRS 17 SSAP 24 decrease For the year ended 31 December 2002 m m m Amount charged to operating profit 133 68 65 Amount credited to net finance income 18 18 Net charge to profit and loss account 115 68 47 2002 Analysis of the amount that would have been charged to operating profit under FRS 17 m Current service cost 131 Past service cost 2 2002 Analysis of the amount that would have been credited to net finance income under FRS 17 m Expected return on pension scheme assets 170 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 152 2002 Analysis of the actuarial gain loss that would have been recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses m Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 588 Experience gains and losses arising on the scheme liabilities 3 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the scheme liabilities 99 Actuarial loss to be recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses before adjustment for tax 492 History of experience gains and losses 2002 Difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets: Amount m 588 Percentage of scheme assets 31.2% Experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities: Amount m 3 Percentage of the present value of scheme liabilities 0.1% Total actuarial loss recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses: Amount m 492 Percentage of the present value of scheme liabilities 18.1% 2002 The movement in deficit during the year under FRS 17 would have been: m Deficit in schemes at beginning of year 333 Movements in the year to 31 December 2002: Current service cost 131 Past service cost 2 Employer contributions 107 Other finance income 18 Acquisition of surplus in year 2 Actuarial loss 492 Deficit in schemes at end of year 831 56 Centrica plc report 2002 27 Commitments and contingencies a Acquisitions On 10 December 2002 the group reached agreement to acquire the retail gas and electricity supply businesses of the ATCO Group in Alberta, Canada for consideration of approximately 52 million, payable over two years.
The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals and the promulgation of legislation that reflects the market refinements announced by the Minister of Energy in August 2002.
It is expected that the Alberta Legislature will consider these legislative changes in the spring of 2003.
Completion is expected by mid to late 2003. b Capital expenditure At 31 December 2002, the group had placed contracts for capital expenditure amounting to 106 million 2001: 31 million of which 72 million relates to the investment in customer relationship management CRM infrastructure 2001: nil.
c Decommissioning costs The company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Hydrocarbon Resources Limited, have agreed to provide security to BG International Limited, which, as original licence holder for the Morecambe gas fields, will have exposure to decommissioning costs relating to the Morecambe gas fields should liabilities not be fully discharged by the group.
The security is to be provided when the estimated future net revenue stream from the Morecambe gas fields falls below 150% of the estimated cost of such decommissioning.
The nature of the security may take a number of different forms and will remain in force unless and until the costs of such decommissioning have been irrevocably discharged and the relevant Department of Trade and Industry decommissioning notice in respect of the Morecambe gas fields has been revoked.
d Lease commitments Land and buildings Other At 31 December non-cancellable operating lease commitments of the group 2002 2001 2002 2001 for the following year were: m m m m Expiring: Within one year 4 1 3 Between one and five years 7 5 24 23 After five years 38 42 3 10 49 47 28 36 There were no commitments at 31 December 2002 under finance leases entered into, but for which inception occurs after 31 December 2002 2001: nil.
e Litigation The group has a number of outstanding disputes arising out of its normal activities, for which appropriate provisions have been made, in accordance with FRS12.
f Guarantees and indemnities The company has 1 billion of bilateral credit facilities 2001: 935 million.
Hydrocarbon Resources Limited and British Gas Trading Limited have guaranteed, jointly and severally, to pay on demand any sum which the company does not pay in accordance with the facility agreements.
The group and BG Group plc have agreed, subject to certain limitations, to indemnify each other against certain actual and contingent liabilities associated with their respective businesses.
In relation to the sale and leaseback of the Morecambe gas field tangible fixed assets recorded in these financial statements, the group has given guarantees amounting to 92 million 2001: 116 million.
The group has given guarantees in connection with the finance lease obligations relating to Humber Power Limited referred to in note 13.
A fixed collateral payment amounting to 225 million 2001: 225 million is required in the event of Centrica plc failing to retain at least one credit rating which is not on credit watch above the BBB Baa1 level, and further collateral of 75 million is required if the credit rating falls further.
The group has given guarantees and indemnities to various counterparties in relation to wholesale energy trading and procurement activities, and to third parties in respect of gas production and energy transportation liabilities.
In connection with their energy trading, transportation and upstream activities, certain group companies have entered into contracts under which they may be required to prepay or provide credit support or other collateral in the event of a significant deterioration in credit worthiness.
The extent of credit support is contingent upon the balance owing to the third party at the point of deterioration.
Following the closure of the British Gas Energy Centres Limited Energy Centres operations in July 1999, guarantees have been signed on certain former Energy Centres properties as a result of reassignment of leases.
Centrica plc report 2002 57 Notes to the financial statements continued 27 Commitments and contingencies continued g Gas purchase contracts The group is contracted to purchase 65 billion therms of gas 2001: 46 billion therms in Great Britain under long term contracts.
The significant increase on last year is largely due to a number of contracts that have recently been entered into where the price is linked to the market price for gas.
A proportion of this gas 37 billion therms however relates to legacy contracts at prices, mainly determined by various baskets of indices including oil prices and general inflation, which may exceed market gas prices from time to time.
Whilst there remains uncertainty regarding future prices and market share, in the opinion of the directors, no general provision for onerous contract losses is required.
The total volume of gas to be taken under these long term contracts depends upon a number of factors, including the actual reserves of gas that are eventually determined to be extractable on an economic basis.
Based upon the minimum volume of gas that the group is contracted to pay for in any year, the profile of the contract commitments is estimated as follows: 2002 2001 million million therms therms Within five years 45,900 29,900 After five years 19,200 15,900 65,100 45,800 The directors do not consider it feasible to estimate reliably the actual future cost of committed gas purchase as the groups weighted average cost of gas from these contracts is subject to a variety of indexation bases.
The groups average cost of gas from its long term contracts for the year ended 31 December 2002 was 19.6 pence per therm for the year ended 31 December 2001: 19.9 pence per therm.
This compares to 20.8 pence per therm being the weighted average cost for the three month period ending 31 December 2001 which was used to estimate the financial commitment in 2001.
Applying this value would imply a group financial commitment of approximately 12.7 billion 2001: 9.5 billion as previously stated.
2002 2001 The commitment profile on this same basis is set out below: m m Within one year 1,900 1,900 Between one and five years 7,000 4,300 After five years 3,800 3,300 12,700 9,500 In addition, the group has entered into two new contracts to purchase significant additional volumes of gas at market prices from Statoil 17 billion therms over 10 years from 1 July 2005 and Gasunie 27 billion therms over 10 years from 1 April 2005.
Both of these contracts remain conditional at this stage and so are excluded from the numbers above.

62 Centrica plc report 2002 32 Summary financial information for the Consumers Waterheater Income Fund the Fund In the context of the short period of operation of the Fund which was inadequate to demonstrate its independent operation in practice, and Centricas retained interest in the Fund, directors have concluded that it is appropriate to consolidate the Fund as a quasi-subsidiary in accordance with FRS 5 Reporting the Substance of Transactions.
A summary of the financial information which before elimination of intra-group items has been consolidated into the group accounts is set out below: a Profit and loss account 2002 Period from 17 to 31 December m Turnover 3 Operating costs 1 Net income before distributions 2 Distribution to unit holders 2 Retained earnings There are no recognised gains or losses other than the profit for the period.

The initial public offering of units in the Fund closed on the Toronto Stock Exchange on 17 December 2002.
At 31 December 2002 Centrica held a 42% interest in the Fund, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Enbridge Services Inc, who hold 100% of the Class B iii Exchangeable units in Waterheater Holding Limited Partnership, a subsidiary of the Fund.
i Creditors amounts due after more than one year include bonds of C$500 million gross of issue costs of C$2 million.
The bonds bear a floating rate of interest and are repayable after four years.
The bonds were issued by the Consumers Waterheater Operating Trust the Trust, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Fund.
The debt is secured solely on the assets of the Fund and its subsidiaries, without recourse to the Centrica group.
ii As disclosed in note 30, on 22 January 2003 the Trust issued C$500m of bonds, the proceeds of which have been applied to repay the bonds in place at 31 December 2002.
The bonds carry interest at a fixed rate and an expected final repayment date of between five and seven years.
The issuer, guarantor and holders of this debt have acknowledged in writing that the notes do not represent obligations as to principal or interest of any person other than the issuer and each of the guarantors.
Accordingly there is no recourse to the Centrica group.
iii Class B Exchangeable Units attract comparable voting rights to Units in the Fund, and are exchangeable into Units of the Fund.
The Class B units are held by Enbridge Services Inc, a 100% owned subsidiary of the Centrica group.
iv The goodwill balance eliminates on consolidation with the Centrica group.
The summary financial information above has been prepared under UK generally accepted accounting practices GAAP.
Class A units in the Fund are traded on the Toronto stock exchange, and accordingly its full financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP in Canada.
Under Canadian GAAP the Fund does not recognise a goodwill balance, and adjustments have been made under the purchase method of accounting, to allocate the excess consideration raised through the unit and debt offering to the fair value of the assets acquired by the Fund from Enbridge Services Inc. v Creditors amounts falling due within one year include 11 million due to Enbridge Services Inc which eliminates on consolidation with the group.

iv In 2001 the company balance sheet showed the loan to the Centrica Employees Share Trust 69 million within fixed asset investments.
This year the balance sheet has been restated to reflect the substance of the arrangements with the trust, whereby Centrica shares are held by the trust for the purpose of fulfilling awards to employees of Centrica plc and its subsidiaries under the long term incentive scheme.
The balance sheet of the trust has therefore been consolidated with that of the company.
This treatment is consistent with UITF 13 ESOP Trusts.
18 million of the amortisation carried forward has not been charged through the profit and loss account, but is included in amounts owed by group undertakings in note 35, as it reflects amounts recoverable from subsidiaries for awards due to their employees.
At 31 December 2001, the amount owed by group undertakings relating to amortisation was 27 million, of which 16 million was due after more than one year.
Debtors have been restated accordingly in note 35.
Provisions have also been restated in note 39, reducing the 31 December 2001 balance by 13 million.
Amounts previously included within provisions related to long term incentive scheme costs for company employees.
