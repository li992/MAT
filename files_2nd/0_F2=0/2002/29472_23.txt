NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL INFORMATION A.
BASIS OF PREPARATION The information on pages 88 to 93 shows the Groups results as measured on an achieved profit basis, which includes the results of the Groups unit trust business on a similar basis to the ABI Guidance Supplementary Reporting for long term assurance business the achieved profits method issued in December 2001.
The results of LAHC have been included on a modified statutory solvency basis as opposed to an achieved profit basis as LAHC is a non-core investment.
The assumptions used to determine the unit trust achieved profit result are consistent with those used for life business, which are disclosed on pages 83 and 84.
The unit trust achieved profit is determined using smoothed unit prices.

C. SENSITIVITIES The table below shows the impact of changes in economic assumptions on the reported value of new business and value of long-term business in-force of changes to the risk discount rate, the assumed rate of long-term investment return and market movements for the combined life and unit trust business.
Change in new business Change in post-tax value contribution long-term business in-force Pre-tax Post-tax Million Million Million Reported value at 31 December 2002 33.0 24.0 406.2 Risk discount rate 1% 6.4 4.6 22.8 -1% 7.0 5.0 24.2 Investment return 1% 5.0 3.6 19.2 -1% 5.0 3.6 18.2 Current withdrawal rate x110% 4.6 3.2 17.0 x90% 4.9 3.5 18.5 PAGE 91 NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL INFORMATION continued D. INVESTMENT RETURN ASSUMPTIONS As discussed in note A, smoothed investment assumptions are used.
The impact of the removal of smoothing would be to reduce the Achieved Profit from life and unit trust business before tax by 58.2 million 2001: 42.2 million and reduce the Achieved Profit from life and unit trust business after tax by 41.4 million 2001: 29.7 million.
The impact on shareholder funds on an Achieved Profit basis of the removal of smoothing would be a reduction of 71.1 million at 31 December 2002 2001: 29.7 million.
The net asset per share would be 109.8p 2001: 126.8p on an unsmoothed basis.
