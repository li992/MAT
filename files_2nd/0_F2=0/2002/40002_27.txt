Notes to the financial statements Restatement for FRS 19 Deferred Tax 1 FRS 19 requires full provision to be made in the accounts for deferred tax on temporary timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be a suitable taxable profit from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the financial statements.
Previously, provision was made for timing differences to the extent that it was probable that a liability would crystallise in the foreseeable future.
In adopting the standard, the Group has restated previous periods results.

The Group has also presented an adjusted basic earnings per share figure to exclude the impact of exceptional items, profits and losses on the sale of investment properties net of taxation and minority interests and FRS 19 Deferred Tax.
The directors consider that this adjusted figure gives a more meaningful comparison for the periods shown in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax has been excluded from the adjusted calculation as the Group has no plans to sell a significant proportion of its investment properties, and in any case it is generally very unusual for UK capital allowances to be recaptured on the disposal of a property.
Profits and losses on the sale of investment properties are excluded from adjusted earnings as these are non-recurring items.
Net assets per share are calculated on the equity shareholders funds of 2,107.3 million 2001 2,096.4 million restated.
Adjusted net assets per share have been calculated on the same number of shares but shareholders funds exclude the FRS 19 Deferred Tax liability of 183.5 million 2001 151.6 million as it is the opinion of the directors that deferred tax on capital allowances in relation to investment properties in unlikely to crystallise materially in practice.

Their assets are held by trustees separately from the assets of the employer.
Contributions to the schemes, which are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method of calculation, are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
The latest actuarial valuation of the Slough scheme as at 31 March 2001 was carried out by William M Mercer.
The schemes assets were valued at market value.
The assumptions used to calculate the liabilities of the scheme included investment returns 2.0 per cent per annum higher than the rate of annual salary increase and 2.25 per cent higher than the rate of increase in pensions.
