Net income for the 12 months to 31 December 2001 and shareholders equity at 31 December 2001 in accordance with US GAAP have been restated as outlined in notes iv, vi, viii and ix below.
The effect of these restatements on the 12 months to 31 December 2001 increases net income by 16.1m from 108.3m to 124.4m, with a corresponding 2.5p increase in basic net income per share for the 12 months to 31 December 2001.
The restatements have reduced shareholders equity by 1.6m from 1,628.6m to 1,627.0m at 31 December 2001.
Amersham plc 89 Supplemental financial information continued i Business combinations Under both UK GAAP and US GAAP, acquisitions are accounted for as purchase business combinations.
However, certain differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP in the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations are set out below.
Goodwill, intangible and other assets Both UK GAAP and US GAAP require purchase consideration to be allocated to the net assets acquired at their fair value on the date of acquisition, with the difference between the consideration and the fair value of the identiable net assets recorded as goodwill.
Under the requirements of Financial Reporting Standard FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets, goodwill arising on acquisitions of subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates during accounting periods ending on or after 23 December 1998 should be capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life.
This treatment of goodwill is similar to its treatment under US GAAP prior to the introduction of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS 142 Goodwill and other intangible assets.
The impact of the introduction of SFAS 142 is discussed below.
However, because FRS 10 need not be applied retrospectively to goodwill written off against shareholders funds in earlier years, there will continue to be differences between the goodwill calculated under UK GAAP and US GAAP.
For the purposes of US GAAP, goodwill written off against shareholders funds under UK GAAP has been reinstated.
UK GAAP requires an allocation of purchase consideration to intangible assets, which are separable from the business.
For UK GAAP purposes, intangible assets, other than goodwill, acquired in a business combination, which are not separable and measurable, are not capitalised.
US GAAP requires an allocation of consideration to identiable intangible assets if they arise from contractual or other legal rights: if intangible assets do not arise from contractual or legal rights, the asset is recognised apart from goodwill only if it is separable.
The intangible assets recognised for US GAAP are being amortised on a straight-line basis over periods up to 10 years.
Effect of SFAS 142 Goodwill and other intangible assets Under US GAAP, following the introduction of SFAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised but reviewed annually for impairment.
The 2002 amortisation charge on such goodwill recognised for UK GAAP has been reversed for US GAAP purposes.
The impact of the introduction of SFAS 142 on net income and net income per share is analysed below: 12 months to 12 months to 31 Dec 2002 31 Dec 2001 Restated m m Net income Net income as reported under US GAAP 160.5 124.4 Add back: Goodwill amortisation 68.7 Adjusted net income under US GAAP 160.5 193.1 Net income per share basic p p Net income per share as reported under US GAAP 23.4 19.6 Add back: Goodwill amortisation 10.8 Adjusted net income per share basic as reported under US GAAP 23.4 30.4 Net income per share diluted p p Net income per share diluted as reported under US GAAP 23.3 19.5 Add back: Goodwill amortisation 10.8 Adjusted net income per share diluted as reported under US GAAP 23.3 30.3 Purchased research and development Acquired in-process research and development recognised under US GAAP purchase accounting requirements is written off directly to net income in the year of acquisition: the technological feasibility of such in-process technology not having been established and not having an alternative future use.
Acquired in-process research and development is not recognised as a separate asset under UK GAAP.
Purchase of 45% minority interest in Amersham Biosciences Under UK GAAP, fair value adjustments have been recognised for tangible xed assets, listed investments and the funded status of pensions.
Under US GAAP, additional fair value adjustments have been recognised for separable intangible assets, in-process research and development and the revaluation of inventory.
Intangible assets are being amortised on a straight-line basis over periods up to 10 years.
The in-process research and development asset has been written off to income in the year.
Following the introduction of SFAS 142, goodwill amortisation recorded under UK GAAP has been reversed for US GAAP purposes.
Investment in Nycomed Pharma The 29% investment in Nycomed Pharma was recorded under the cost method of accounting under UK GAAP prior to its disposal as the company did not exert significant inuence over the entity.
Under US GAAP, the investment was accounted for using the equity method.
ii Accounting for investment in Nihon Medi-Physics NMP Under UK GAAP the change from the cost method to the equity method in the year ended 31 March 1997, due to the acquisition of an additional interest in NMP, did not require retroactive adjustment to the financial statements.
Under US GAAP the investment, the results of operations, and shareholders equity of the group were adjusted retroactively in a manner consistent with the accounting for a step-by-step acquisition of a subsidiary.
90 Amersham plc Annual Report & Accounts 2002 iii Disposal of Nycomed Pharma In 2001, the group sold its trade investment in Nycomed Pharma.
Under US GAAP, the investment was treated as an associate company resulting in a lower profit on disposal under the equity method of accounting.
Certain costs associated with the sale have been recognised in 2002 for US GAAP.
iv Derivative hedging Under US GAAP, the group does not qualify for hedge accounting and so gains and losses arising on derivative instruments at the year end have been booked directly to income under US GAAP.
During the year ended 31 December 2002, the group determined that the adjustment relating to gains and losses arising on derivative instruments for the year ending 31 December 2001 had been incorrectly accounted for under SFAS 133 Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities.
Accordingly, the group has restated the 12 months to 31 December 2001.
The adjustment to net income in 2001 has correspondingly increased by 21.0m to 5.6m and the adjustment to shareholders equity has increased by 3.2m to 12.8m at 31 December 2001. v Pensions and post retirement costs Under both UK GAAP and US GAAP, pension and post retirement costs are based on actuarial assumptions.
However, under UK GAAP the cost is based on long term market and economic assumptions and under US GAAP the cost is based on current market and economic assumptions.
In line with SFAS 87 Employers accounting for pensions an additional minimum liability equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation is recognised when the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of pension fund assets.
vi Transfer of assets from pension plans A transfer of assets was received from former pension plans during 2001.
Under UK GAAP, the proportion of the transfer relating to current employees of the group is being spread over the remaining service life of the employees in line with SSAP 24.
Under US GAAP, this was taken to income in 2001.
During the year ended 31 December 2002, the group determined that income recognised in the year ending 31 December 2001 relating to the transfer of assets from former pension plans had been incorrectly accounted for under US GAAP.
Net income in the 12 months to 31 December 2001 has been restated and income recognised on the transfer of assets reduced by 1.0m to 6.0m.
The adjustments to shareholders equity at 31 December 2001 has also been restated, with a corresponding reduction of 1.0m to 6.0m.
vii Revenue recognition Under UK GAAP, contract revenue is recognised when it is earned and non-refundable and when there are no future obligations under the contract terms.
Under US GAAP, the group applies Staff Accounting Bulletin 101 SAB 101.
Under SAB 101, more prescriptive criteria are applied to assess whether the culmination of the earnings process has occurred and the group has a continuing obligation throughout the contract terms.
As a result, certain non-refundable fees have been deferred over the contract terms under US GAAP.
viii Deferred taxation Under UK GAAP, provision for deferred taxation is recorded under FRS 19.
Except for certain timing differences relating to revaluations, rolled over taxable gains and unremitted income, provision is made for all timing differences that would give rise to a deferred tax liability.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not they will be recoverable.
Under US GAAP, deferred tax is provided for on a full liability basis.
A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realised.
Following the adjustments to net income in the 12 months to 31 December 2001, as outlined in notes iv and vi, the tax effects of the US GAAP adjustments have been reduced by 3.9m to 20.5m.
The adjustment to shareholders equity at 31 December 2001 has been correspondingly reduced by 0.7m to 55.7m.
ix Other Other differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP relate to accounting for compensated absences, investments in equity securities, ESOP transactions and stock based compensation.
Certain balances have been reclassied in 2001 from Business combinations to Other to conform to current year presentation.
During the year ended 31 December 2002, the group determined that the adjustment to shareholders equity at 31 December 2001 relating to ESOP transactions had been incorrectly calculated.
Correspondingly, the adjustment to shareholders equity at 31 December 2001 has been restated with a reduction of 3.1m to 23.7m.
x Ordinary dividends Under UK GAAP, dividends proposed are provided for in the period in respect of which they are recommended by the Board of Directors for approval by the shareholders.
Under US GAAP, dividends are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings when they have been formally declared, and notice given to shareholders.
xi Minority interest The amount represents the components of the US GAAP adjustments attributable to Pharmacia Corporations 45% interest in Amersham Biosciences.
The minority interest was extinguished in 2002 on the purchase of the 45% minority interest in Amersham Biosciences that the group did not already own.
