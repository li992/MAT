Principal Accounting Policies Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
The Xstrata plc Group Group has adopted the following principal accounting policies: Merger accounting The statutory merger of Xstrata AG with the company has been accounted for using the merger method of accounting under which the results and cash flows of Xstrata AG are included in the financial statements from 1 January 2002 and its assets and liabilities are included at the amounts at which they were previously recorded, after adjusting to the Groups accounting policies.
The comparatives for the Group balance sheet, profit and loss account and statement of cash flows have been restated to take account of the merger despite the fact that the holding company was incorporated on 31 December 2001, in order to compare meaningfully the performance of the underlying Group.
Basis of consolidation The financial statements consolidate the accounts of Xstrata plc and its subsidiaries.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passes.
Entities in which the Group holds an interest on a long-term basis and are jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other venturers are treated as joint ventures.
The consolidated financial statements include the Group proportion of turnover, operating profit or loss, exceptional items, interest expense, taxation, gross assets and gross liabilities of joint ventures the gross equity method.
Entities, other than subsidiaries and joint ventures, in which the Group has a participating interest and over whose operating and financial policies the Group exercises a significant influence are treated as associates.
The consolidated financial statements include the Group proportion of the operating profit or loss, exceptional items, interest expense, taxation and net assets of associates the equity method.
The Group has certain contractual arrangements with other participants to engage in joint activities that do not create an entity carrying on a trade or business of its own.
The financial statements includes the Groups share of the assets, liabilities and cash flows in such joint arrangements, measured in accordance with the terms of each arrangement, which is usually pro rata to the Groups interest in joint arrangement.
On the acquisition of a subsidiary, or of an interest in a joint venture, associate, or joint arrangement, the purchase consideration is allocated to the assets and liabilities on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition.
Those mineral reserves and resources that are able to be reliably valued are recognised in the assessment of fair values on acquisition.
Other potential reserves, resources and mineral rights, for which in the Directors opinion, values cannot be reliably determined, are not recognised.
When the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair values attributable to the Groups share of the identifiable net assets the difference is treated as purchased goodwill.
This is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life up to a presumed maximum of 20 years.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction or, where forward cover contracts have been arranged, at contractual rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at year end exchange rates, or at a contractual rate if applicable.
Gains and losses on hedging transactions intended to hedge specific sales of goods are included in the measurement of the sale in the same period in which the revenues or costs from the hedged transaction are recorded.
On consolidation, profit and loss account items are translated at average rates of exchange.
Balance sheet items are translated at year end exchange rates.
Xstrata plc 83 notes to the financial statements 1.
Principal Accounting Policies continued Exchange differences on the re-translation of the investments in overseas subsidiaries, joint arrangements, joint ventures and associates at closing rates, together with differences between profit and loss accounts translated at average and at closing rates, are dealt with in reserves.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings financing those net investments, are also dealt with in reserves.
All other exchange differences are charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.
The following exchange rates have been applied: 31 December Average 2002 31 December Average 2001 2002 12 months 2001 12 months Australian Dollar AUD 0.5618 0.5434 0.5114 0.5167 Chilean Peso CLP 718.61 692.32 654.79 637.57 Euro EUR 1.0495 0.9430 0.8849 0.8946 Great Britain Pound GBP 1.6100 1.5013 1.4545 1.4407 South African Rand ZAR 8.5702 10.5035 12.0900 8.6249 Swiss Franc CHF 1.3836 1.5553 1.6749 1.6884 Turnover Revenues associated with the sales of commodities are recognised when all significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset sold are transferred to the customer, usually when the commodity is delivered to the shipping agent.
Turnover is recognised at invoiced amounts, with most sales being priced free on board fob, free on rail for or cost, insurance and freight cif.
Revenues from the sales of by-products are also included in turnover.
Cost of sales Cost of sales represents product cost, determined by means of either the weighted average or first in first out FIFO method, and by applying full absorption costing of mining, processing and smelting overheads, plus any other costs directly attributed to the acquisition of materials.
Investments The investments in the rehabilitation trust funds are measured at fair value based on the market price of the investments held by the trust fund.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition, subject to the constraint that, unless the asset has a readily ascertainable market value, the fair value is limited to an amount that does not create or increase any negative goodwill arising on the acquisition.
Intangible assets are amortised using a straight-line method based on estimated useful lives, except those intangibles assets which the Directors regard as having indefinite useful lives, which are not amortised but are reviewed for impairment annually.
Tangible assets Land and buildings, plant and equipment The cost of each item of buildings, plant and equipment are depreciated over its useful life.
Mine production assets are depreciated using a unit of production method based on estimated economically recoverable reserves, which results in a depreciation charge proportional to the depletion of reserves.
Tangible assets unrelated to production are depreciated using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives.
Each items estimated useful life has due regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property or plantation at which the item is located, and to possible future variations in those assessments.
Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, machinery and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items.
Changes in estimates which affect unit of production calculations are accounted for prospectively.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Principal Accounting Policies continued The expected useful lives are as follows: Buildings 15 40 years Plant and Equipment 4 30 years Furniture and Fixtures 5 15 years Other 3 5 years The net carrying amounts of mine buildings, machinery and equipment at each mine property are reviewed regularly and, to the extent to which these values exceed their recoverable amounts, that excess is fully provided against the financial year in which this is determined.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure Exploration and evaluation expenditure for each area of interest, other than that acquired from the purchase of another mining company, is carried forward as an asset provided that one of the following conditions is met: such costs are expected to be recouped through successful development and exploration of the area of interest or alternatively, by its sale: or exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not yet reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active and significant operations in relation to the area are continuing.
Exploration expenditure which fails to meet at least one of the conditions outlined above is written-off.
Identifiable exploration and evaluation assets acquired are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition.
Exploration assets are reassessed on a regular basis and these costs are carried forward provided that at least one of the conditions outlined above is met.
Mineral properties and mine development expenditure Costs of acquiring mineral properties are capitalised on the balance sheet in the year in which they are incurred.
Capitalised costs development expenditure include interest and financing costs relating to the construction of plant and equipment and costs associated with a start up period where the asset is available for use but incapable of operating at normal levels without a commissioning period.
Mineral properties and capitalised costs are, upon commencement of production, amortised using a unit of production method based on the estimated economically recoverable reserves to which they relate or are writtenoff if the property is abandoned or where there is a impairment in value.
Capital work in progress Assets in the course of construction are capitalised in the capital work in progress account.
On completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of tangible fixed assets.
The cost of a tangible fixed asset comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use.
Costs associated with a start up period are capitalised where the asset is available for use but incapable of operating at normal levels without a commissioning period.
Capital work in progress is not depreciated.
Plantations Plantations are recorded at cost.
Development costs, interest and financing costs relating to the development of the plantations are deferred and amortised upon commencement of production, on a unit of production method based on the estimated future production from each plantation.
Xstrata plc 85 notes to the financial statements 1.
Principal Accounting Policies continued Leasing and hire purchase commitments Assets held under finance leases, where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Group, and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over their useful lives.
The capital elements of future obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged in the profit and loss account over the periods of the leases and hire purchase contracts and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Impairment The carrying amounts of fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether the carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amount.
Such review is undertaken on income generating units.
If the carrying amount of a fixed asset exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded to reflect the asset at the lower amount.
In assessing recoverable amount for fixed assets, the relevant future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of such assets and from their disposal have been discounted to their present value using a market-determined discount rate.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition.
Stocks are categorised, as follows: raw materials and consumables: Materials, goods or supplies including energy sources to be either directly or indirectly consumed in the production process.
work in progress: Items stored in an intermediate state that have not yet passed through all the stages of production.
finished goods: Products and materials that have passed all stages of the production process.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Capital grants Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are credited to a deferred income account and are released to the profit and loss account over the expected useful lives of the relevant assets by equal annual installments.
Grants of a revenue nature are credited to income so as to match them with the expenditure to which they relate.
Potential liabilities to repay grants either in whole or in part are provided for to the extent that the repayment is probable.
Environmental protection, rehabilitation and closure costs Provision is made for close down, restoration and for environmental rehabilitation costs which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs, based on the estimated future costs.
The provision is discounted where material and the unwinding of the discount is included in interest payable.
At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future benefit and depreciated over future production from the mine to which it relates.
The provision does not include allowances for unforeseeable events.
The provision is reviewed on an annual basis for changes in cost estimates or life of operations.
Principal Accounting Policies continued Provisions for liabilities and charges Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, as result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources that can be reliably estimated will be required to settle the obligation.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less tax in the future.
In particular: provision is made for tax on gains arising from the disposal of fixed assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned..
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold: provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas entities only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable: and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that, it is considered that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Derivative instruments The Group uses foreign currency contracts to reduce short-term exposure to foreign exchange movements of the AUD and EUR to the US$.
The Group considers that its derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting when certain criteria are met.
The criteria for forward foreign currency contracts are: the instrument must be related to a foreign currency asset or liability that is probable and whose characteristics have been identified: it must involve the same currency as the hedged item: and it must reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the operations.
The rates under such contracts are used to record the hedged item.
As a result, gains and losses are offset against the foreign exchange gains and losses on the related financial assets and liabilities, or where the instrument is used to hedge a committed, or probable, future transaction, are deferred until the transaction occurs.
The Group uses zinc futures to reduce the effect of market price fluctuations on the sale of zinc.
The futures are matched to purchases of the zinc concentrate and typically expire in three to four months.
The zinc futures are marked to market with gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Pensions and other postretirement obligations The Groups contributions to its defined contribution pension plans are charged to the profit and loss account in the year to which they relate.
The Group has no material defined benefit pension or post-retirement benefit schemes.
Capital instruments Shares are included in shareholders funds.
Other instruments are classified as liabilities if they contain an obligation to transfer economic benefits and if not they are included in shareholders funds.
Xstrata plc 87 notes to the financial statements 1.
Principal Accounting Policies continued Financial liabilities Loans are recognised at inception at the fair value of the proceeds received net of issue costs.
The finance cost recognised in the profit and loss account is allocated to period over the term of the loan at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Research and development Research and development expenditure is written off as incurred, except that development expenditure incurred on an individual project is carried forward when its future recoverability can reasonably be regarded as assured.
Any expenditure carried forward is amortised in line with the expected future sales from the related project.
Comparatives Where applicable, comparatives have been adjusted to disclose them on the same basis as current period figures.
Use of estimates The preparation of these accounts in conformity with generally accepted accounting practice requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual outcomes could differ from these estimates.
Changes in Group companies Xstrata plc In March 2002, Xstrata AG was merged into Xstrata plc, a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales on 31 December 2001.
This was structured as a statutory merger under Swiss law that enabled Xstrata AG to be merged into Xstrata plc, without Xstrata AG being liquidated.
Merger accounting principles have been applied to reflect this combination.
The Company has taken advantage of merger relief under s131 Companies Act 1985 in recording the shares issued under this arrangement.

Post Balance Sheet Events In January 2003, the Group acquired a further 11.5% interest in a Coal Australia subsidiary company, Oakbridge Pty Ltd for US$58 million from Tomen Corporation, increasing the percentage ownership in the subsidiary to 78%.
Capital Commitments Amounts contracted for but not provided in the financial statements amounted to US$23.9 million 2001 US$3.3 million for the Group and US$nil 2001 US$nil for the Company.
Contingent Liabilities In connection with the expansion at the San Juan fide Nieva plant, the company has issued bank guarantees for the amount of EUR 76.9 million US$80.7 million.
The bank guarantees have primarily been issued in respect of grants received from regional and federal authorities.
The guarantees will be released once the authorities are satisfied that the Group has met all its obligations in connection with the receipt of the grants.
Coal Australia has issued performance guarantees to customers under contracts for supply of coal for AUD 12.8 million US$7.2 million and guarantees to the NSW and Queensland Departments for Mineral Resources in respect of various mining leases and the performance thereof AUD 88.1 million US$49.5 million.
Coal South Africa has issued guarantees to Eskom for early termination of power usage of ZAR 12.0 million US$1.4 million, to Department of Mineral and Energy to obtain certain prospecting permits of ZAR 0.8 million US$0.1 million and to banks for property transactions of ZAR 3.4 million US$0.4 million.
Pension Commitments The Group operates or participates in a number of defined contribution pension plans and industry-wide schemes covering a majority of employees.
To the extent there is a difference between pension cost and contributions paid, a prepayment or creditor arises.
The accumulated difference provided in the balance sheet at 31 December 2002 gives rise to a creditor of US$0.4 million 2001 US$0.1 million.
The assets are held separately from those of the Group, being generally invested with insurance companies and regulated by local legislation.
In general, these pension plans provide benefits to participants at retirement or other life contingencies.
The benefits vary from severance payments to retirement pensions on termination of employment.
On retirement or other legitimate life contingency, the employees are eligible to a severance lump sum payment or an annuity equal in value to their share of the fund.
Pension Commitments continued Industry funds In South Africa, the Group participates in two significant multi-employer schemes, The Mine Employees Pension Fund and The Sentinel Mining Industry Retirement Fund.
The Mine Employees Pension Fund is a defined contribution scheme.
The Sentinel Mining Industry Retirement Fund converted to a defined contribution scheme from a defined benefit scheme on 31 March 2001, with members over the age of 55 at conversion retaining their defined benefit promise.
In Australia, under the NSW Coal & Oil Shale Mineworkers Superannuation Act 1941, and certain industrial agreements, the Group is required to make contributions to the Coal Super Retirement Income Fund for each person employed as a Mineworker as defined by the Act.
The Coal Super Retirement Income Fund is separated into two plans: NSW Mineworkers Superannuation Fund.
NSW Coal & Oil Shale Mineworkers Superannuation Accumulation Fund COSAF.
The Mineworkers Superannuation Fund, was closed to new members after a major restructuring in 1993.
The majority of active members 98% have accepted the Transfer of Entitlements Offer from the plan and their entitlements have been transferred to the COSAF Accumulation Fund.
Up until March 1993, benefits were paid from this fund in the form of pensions.
The fund is used to pay pensions to surviving former coal miners or their spouses.
As at 30 June 2000 this fund had an unfunded industry liability of US$19 million Group share US$0.3 million.
The NSW Government planned for the unfunded liability to be eliminated by additional contributions and this is expected to be cleared by 2003.
It is a requirement that the Trustee submit the Mineworkers Fund to actuarial review over three years.
The next actuarial review is due on 30 June 2003.
In addition to the above, contributions are made by certain entities in the consolidated entity to the COSAF fund.
This is an accumulation fund and as such an actuarial review is not required.
Contributions are based on a reference rate as defined in the Act and based on a percentage of an industry classification pay rate.
The fund provides accumulated benefits on resignation, retirement, disability or death.
Defined benefit schemes The Group has no material defined benefit pension or post-retirement schemes at 31 December 2002.
During November 2002, in accordance with Spanish law, the pension commitments of the Spanish pension scheme were externalised through an insurance contract with Bank of Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA at a cost of EUR 20.3 million US$20.2 million.
All the associated pension liabilities of Xstrata Spain have been fully secured, without recourse to Xstrata plc.
At 31 December 2001 a provision of EUR 19.0 million US$16.8 million was held for this fund.

Glencore is nevertheless entitled to the 3.5% agency fees described above in respect of such sales.
Vanadium pentoxide and ferrovanadium sold into the US or Canada is distributed by Glencore Ltd and Glencore Canada Inc respectively, under two distribution agreements.
The distribution agreements have the same term as the marketing agreement.
The percentage of distribution fees payable by the Group in respect of vanadium pentoxide and ferrovanadium is substantially the same as the commission paid in respect of vanadium pentoxide and ferrovanadium sold under the marketing agreement.

Transactions with associates As disclosed in note 17 there was a non-interest bearing advance of US$6.5 million to Cook Resources Mining Pty Limited, an associate of the Group at 31 December 2002.
Financial Instruments The Group is exposed to changes to currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates in the normal course of business.
Derivative transactions are entered into solely to hedge these risks.
Market fluctuations in derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are used to offset the fluctuations in the underlying exposure.
Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to price movements for the products it produces which are generally sold on the world market.
For the three year period ending 31 December 2000 Xstrata Marketing Corporation entered into an off take agreement with Glencore International for all its South African vanadium pentoxide and ferrovanadium production at a fixed price of US$3.50 per pound and US$16.80 per kilogram, respectively.
Any surplus arising between the fixed prices and the delivered customer prices is shared between Xstrata Marketing Corporation and the agent.
With effect from 1 January 2000, the off take agreement was restructured in such a way that half of the vanadium pentoxide offtake entitlement for the year 2000 was allocated equally to the years 2001 and 2002 at US$3.65 per pound and US$3.80 per pound respectively.
Spanish operations enter into LME Zinc futures to counter potential market price fluctuations from the time zinc concentrate is bought to the time when the zinc metal is sold.
The settlement dates for the outstanding contracts all mature within one year and they are marked to market at year end.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of trade receivables, however given the geographical industry spread of the Groups customers, credit risk is believed to be limited.
Financial Instruments continued Interest rate risk of financial assets and liabilities The interest rate profile of the financial assets of the Group as at 31 December was as follows: 2002 Weighted average 2002 2001 rate in % US$m US$m Floating rate: AUD 4.0 37.9 0.7 EUR 3.1 5.5 18.5 US$ 1.2 35.7 21.0 ZAR cash 11.0 7.9 5.2 ZAR rehabilitation trust fund 9.7 24.5 111.5 45.4 Financial assets on which no interest is earned: AUD 30.7 EUR 11.5 9.6 US$ 2.2 ZAR 0.1 0.1 Other 4.0 1.8 46.3 13.7 Total 157.8 59.1 The interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the Group as at 31 December was as follows: 2002 Weighted Weighted average time average 2002 2001 rate is fixed rate in % US$m US$m Floating rate: AUD 5.7 17.8 US$ 2.8 580.9 468.4 US$ overdraft 2.3 0.7 1.3 ZAR 12.9 43.3 30.6 642.7 500.3 Fixed rate: AUD Finance leases 7 years 5.3 17.7 EUR Other loans non interest bearing 12 years 1.6 1.5 EUR Other loans 12 years 5.0 0.6 0.6 ZAR Mineral rights deferred acquisition liability 12 years 8.3 14.8 13.7 Total 34.7 15.8 Xstrata plc 117 notes to the financial statements 32.

Borrowing facilities The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.
The un-drawn committed facilities available at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001 in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date are as follows: 2002 2001 US$m US$m Expiring within one year or less 137.1 78.5 Expiring in more than two years 804.0 98.7 941.1 177.2 Currency risk Owing to the Groups significant operations in Australia, South Africa and Spain, the balance sheet and results can be affected significantly by movements in exchange rates.
The reporting currency of the Group is the US$, as this is the underlying economic currency of the Groups cash flows and the majority of borrowings are denominated in US$.
However overseas operations undertake transactions and have cash flows in local currencies.
The policy of the Group is to use foreign currency contracts to reduce short term exposure to foreign exchange movements of the AUD and EUR to the US$.
Xstrata utilises a range of derivatives as detailed below to manage such exposures.
Typically these derivatives are short term in nature and at 31 December 2002, the only foreign currency contracts outstanding are US$ AUD that span a period of up to 12 months.
The table below shows the Groups currency exposures: in other words, those transactional or non-structural exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved, other than certain non-US$ borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas operations.
Financial Instruments continued As at 31 December, the net US$ monetary receivable exposure is as follows: 2002 2001 Reporting currency US$m US$m AUD 5.5 6.6 EUR 11.2 ZAR 72.7 70.8 67.0 77.4 The amounts shown in the table above take into account the effect of foreign currency contracts entered into to manage these currency exposures.
