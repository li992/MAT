Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting Policies A summary of the accounting policies used is set out below.
The Company has adopted the AITC Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for Investment Trusts dated December 1995. a The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of fixed asset investments and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will be granted.
b Income from equity investments is credited to the revenue account on the date on which it is ex-dividend.
Interest receivable on fixed interest securities is accounted for on an accruals basis.
Unfranked investment income includes tax deducted at source.
Interest receivable on short-term loans and deposits, interest payable and expenses of management are dealt with on an accruals basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital reserves.
c Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are calculated in sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Realised and unrealised capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserves realised and unrealised.
d Listed investments are valued at middle market prices.
Unlisted investments are valued at market prices ruling where an organised market in such investments exists, other unquoted investments are included at Directors valuation.
Where a price is not readily available the holding would be valued at cost unless circumstances indicate that a different valuation is warranted.
In general, valuations are increased where a substantial arms length transaction has occurred subsequent to acquisition, at a price higher than cost.
Valuations are decreased where subsequent transactions have taken place at a price lower than cost or where Fidelitys Fair Value Committee is aware that the company is experiencing operating difficulties.
e All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged in full to the revenue account within the Statement of Total Return.
Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and in accordance with the provisions of FRS4 Capital Instruments.
f Gains and losses on the realisation of investments and realised exchange differences of a capital nature are accounted for in the capital reserve - realised.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end and unrealised exchange differences of a capital nature are accounted for in the capital reserve - unrealised.
g Deferred taxation is provided for in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that its recovery is considered more likely than not.
Deferred tax is recorded in accordance with FRS19 'Deferred Tax'.
The adoption of this standard has had no impact on current or prior year results.

The differences are explained below.
2002 2001 000 000 Return on ordinary activities before tax 1,985 3,111 Return on ordinary activities multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax of 30% 2001: 30% 596 933 Effects of: Tax credits on Avoir Fiscal and other 56 175 Income not included for tax purposes 19 28 Increase in management expenses 424 - Overseas tax 1,107 1,025 Double taxation relief 1,057 874 Avoir Fiscal and other credits 190 582 Current corporation tax charge note 7a 917 649 Investment trust companies are exempt from tax on capital gains if they meet the Inland Revenue criteria set out in s842 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 for a given period.
Therefore, any capital return is not included in the above reconciliation.
c The Company has unrelieved excess tax losses of 1,415,665 2001: nil.
It is unlikely that the Company will generate sufficient taxable profits in the future to utilise these expenses and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised.

In pursuit of this objective, the Company may be exposed to various forms of risk, as described below.
The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies Cash, liquid resources and short-term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations Euro borrowings to finance operations 32 The risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk, which comprises interest rate risk and foreign currency exposure, liquidity risk and counterparty credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the accounting period.
Market price risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and changes in exchange rates.
The Board meets quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Investment Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk-reward profile.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Fair value of financial assets and liabilities are stated in the balance sheet at values which are not materially different to their fair values, with the exception of the long term fixed rate unsecured loans, whose fair value as at 31 December 2002 given below has been calculated by discounting future cash flows at current euro interest rates.
2002 2001 fair value book value fair value book value 000 000 000 000 Fixed rate unsecured loan @ 4.96% per annum 35,334 32,546 32,873 30,521 Fixed rate unsecured loan @ 5.54% per annum 28,838 26,037 26,946 24,417 64,172 58,583 59,819 54,938 Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through share capital raised.
In addition, financing has been obtained through two euro-denominated fixed rate unsecured bank loans, which fall due for repayment on 29 December 2006.
The Company is therefore not exposed to a financial risk arising as a result of any increase in euro interest rates on these loans.
The Companys financial assets are mainly invested in equity shares and other investments which neither pay interest nor have a maturity date.
The Company also has cash balances of 7,972,643 2001: 37,899,518 denominated in euros.
The rate of interest on the cash balances is currently 3.63% 2001: 3.67%, consequently the risk of a decrease in cash interest earned is low.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions.
The interest profile of the Companys financial liabilities excluding short-term creditors, as at 31 December 2002 and 2001 was as follows: 2002 2001 fixed rate financial liabilities fixed rate financial liabilities Currency 000 000 Euro 58,583 54,938 33 Notes to the Accounts 2002 2002 weighted fixed rate financial average liabilities:weighted interest average period for Currency rate which rate is fixed Euro 5.22% 48 months Foreign currency risk The Companys total return and balance sheet can be affected by foreign exchange movements because the Company has assets and income which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys base currency sterling.
The Board has identified three principal areas where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affecting the value of investments Movements in rates affecting short-term timing differences Movements in rates affecting the income received The Company does not hedge the sterling value of investments or other net assets priced in other currencies by the use of derivatives.
However, it has increased finance available to the Company for its investment activities with foreign currency borrowings, thereby hedging part of the movements which are a result of exchange movements.
The Company might also be subject to short-term exposure from exchange rate movements, for example between the date when an investment is bought or sold and the date when settlement of the transaction occurs.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The following is an analysis of the Companys foreign currency exposure as at 31 December 2002 and 2001.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities as required.
Details of the Companys borrowing commitments are explained in note 14 to the accounts.
The maturity profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 31 December 2002 and 2001 is as follows: 2002 2001 000 000 Less than one year - 26,869 After more than two years but less than five years 58,583 54,938 58,583 81,807 Short-term debtors and other short-term creditors are excluded from the above analysis.
Counterparty risk Certain transactions in securities that the Company enters into expose it to the risk that the counterparty will not deliver either the shares on a purchase or the cash on a sale after the Company has fulfilled its responsibilities.
There is also a counterparty risk associated with deposit takers.
The Company buys and sells investments on a delivery versus payment basis to manage risk.
The Company only buys and sells investments through brokers which have been approved by the Manager as an acceptable counterparty.
Additionally, limits are set as to the maximum exposure to any broker at any time, the limits being reviewed on a regular basis.
