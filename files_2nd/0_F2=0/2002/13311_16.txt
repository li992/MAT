For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares.
The company has only one category of dilutive potential shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys shares during the year.

The directors have reviewed these acquisitions and have determined that, as service businesses which are not subject to high volatility in fashions or markets, demand for these services is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.
Hence neither the value of these businesses nor the associated goodwill have a measurable useful economic life and the goodwill is therefore not being amortised.
The useful economic lives and values of the businesses and goodwill were re-assessed as at 31st December 2002.

Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 31st December 2002 and 2001.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available and unless otherwise noted, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at relevant interest and exchange rates.

60 RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 6005 Text 50 74 5 4 03 9:04 am Page 61 On 10th March 2003 Ashtead Group plc announced that it had appointed external advisors to investigate the current 20 DERIVATIVES AND NOTES ON THE and prior year accounts of its US Sunbelt Rentals business following management concerns regarding a potential OTHER FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS understatement of costs.
Ashtead Group plc also reported that its US Sunbelt Rental business was currently trading INSTRUMENTS below market expectations but continued to remain strongly cash generative.
continued On 13th March 2003 Ashtead Group plc further announced that pending the outcome of the above investigation it was unable to give the usual definitive representations required under its bank credit agreements and was accordingly in default under these arrangements.
Ashtead Group plc subsequently arranged to meet its banking group on 21st March 2003 to review the position with a view to developing a proposal to resolve the situation although the final outcome of these discussions is presently unknown.
On 21st March 2003 Ashtead Group plc also announced it was proposing to defer the biannual interest payment due under the convertible loan note.
However it further noted that it had now paid the interest under its senior credit facilities, which had previously been delayed, and had also voluntarily withdrawn the interim dividend previously declared on 15th January 2003 for the 6 month period ended 31st October 2002.
All these recent announcements and subsequent actions taken by Ashtead Group plc have not affected the existing legal rights of the Rentokil Initial group under the convertible loan note, which in particular continues to accrue interest as more fully described above.
Notwithstanding these recent events, given that the board of Ashtead Group plc continues to emphasise the strong operating cash flow of the business and given its positive net asset value, both the book value and the fair value of the convertible loan note remain unchanged as shown in the table on the previous page.
The company will continue to monitor any further announcements by Ashtead Group plc and take any steps as may be required in the future to continue to protect the companys legal rights to the payment of interest and principal under the terms of the convertible loan note.
Debtors include 9.4m 2001: 9.8m of interest bearing and 9.0m 2001: 9.0m of non interest bearing notes and deferred consideration received in respect of non-core business disposals.
The notes deferred consideration have final maturities between 2003 and 2008, although earlier repayments may be precipitated under the terms of the respective sale agreements disposal notes.
The group does utilise foreign currency short term and long term borrowings to hedge overseas acquisitions and investments.
Any differences between the book values and the fair values for these borrowings are shown above.
Currency exposures As explained in the Finance Directors review on page 16 the groups currency borrowings including those held in its main operating businesses are used to hedge the exchange effects arising from the retranslation of its net overseas investments.
Gains and losses arising on net overseas investments and the currency borrowings used to hedge the currency exposures are recognised in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses in accordance with SSAP 20.
The groups businesses provide goods and services in their local economies, sourced predominately from the local economies.
As a consequence the groups businesses do not have any material transactional currency exposures nor any material foreign currency assets or liabilities by reference to their reporting currencies.
Such foreign exchange differences which do arise on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account of the group companies and the group 2002: 0.1m, 2001: nil.
Hedges Other than the gains and losses on net interest rate and currency swaps noted in the fair value table on page 60, there are no material unrecognised or deferred gains or losses at either year end in respect of financial instruments used as hedges.

The major COMMITMENTS schemes are of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The principal scheme in the United Kingdom is the Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme.
Actuarial valuations of the UK scheme are carried out every three years.
The most recent actuarial valuation was at 1st April 1999 although an actuarial valuation at 1st April 2002 is currently being completed by Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow.
The 1999 valuation was carried out using the projected unit credit method and the principal assumptions made by the independent professional actuary were that future investment returns would be 6% per annum, pensionable salaries would increase by 4% per annum and pensions would increase by 2.5% per annum or at the rate provided in the rules of the UK scheme.
The assumed yield on UK equity investments was 2.8%.
64 RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 6005 Text 50 74 5 4 03 9:04 am Page 65 As at 1st April 1999 the market value of the schemes assets totalled 690.5m and the actuarial value of those assets 27 PENSION NOTES ON THE represented 113% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable COMMITMENTS ACCOUNTS salaries.
No contributions have been paid by the group since 1st October 1999 but this is currently being reviewed as part continued of the 2002 actuarial valuation.
The actuarial surplus is being spread over the average future service lives of employees in the scheme.
The world wide pension cost for the group was 12.4m 2001: 9.6m of which 3.1m 2001: 0.6m related to the groups total UK pension costs which were calculated using the same assumptions as above except that future investment returns were assumed to be 6.25% per annum 2001: 6.25% per annum and the assumed yield on UK equity investments was 2.7% per annum.
There is a prepayment of 19.4m in the groups balance sheet 2001: 22.5m in respect of the UK scheme resulting from the difference between contributions paid and pension costs charged to date.
The defined benefit scheme was closed to new employees with effect from 1st November 2001.
With effect from 1st April 2002 a defined contribution section was introduced for all new eligible employees.
As noted above an actuarial valuation as at 1st April 2002 is currently in the process of being finalised.
The provisional results indicate that, consistent with the recent falls in equity markets, the companys future contributions to the UK scheme will need to be increased which is likely to result in an increased pension charge in future years.
The additional disclosures required under FRS 17 are shown below.
These relate only to the main UK scheme but they would not be materially different if they included the defined benefit schemes which operate in other countries.
As a result of the above changes it is possible that the service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The valuation used for this disclosure has been based on the provisional results of the most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 1st April 2002, updated by an independent qualified actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31st December 2002.
