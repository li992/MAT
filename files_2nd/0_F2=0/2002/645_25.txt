Participants may elect to defer vesting for a further period of three years, during which the shares are held in the Employee Benefit Trust and may become eligible for matching under the rules of the Plan.
On the occasion of the sale of the Homes business, the Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion by subjecting all outstanding awards to a performance test as at 1st October, 2001.
With the exception of the awards made on 17th July and 27th October, 1997 which achieved vesting at 144.79%, the Companys performance was measured as achieving 150% maximum vesting at 1st October, 2001.
The shares representing the proportion of each award deemed to have tested successfully calculated by reference to the proportion of the initial three-year test period that had elapsed at 1st October, 2001 are held by the Trustee of the Employee Benefit Trust until such time as the award would normally vest, subject to the participant continuing to be employed by the Group.
As at 12th April, 2002, the Companys performance over the three-year period from the date of award ranked first in its comparator group, and the awards made on 12th April, 1999 were capable of vesting to 150%.
Participants elected to defer vesting of 284,250 shares.
As at 2nd June, 2002, the Companys performance over the preceding three-year test period ranked first in its comparator group, and the remaining 163 shares under the award made on 2nd December 1998 became capable of vesting.
The participant elected to defer vesting of all 163 shares.
As at 29th October, 2002, the Companys performance over the preceding three-year test period ranked first in its comparator group, and the remaining 5,938 shares under the awards made on 29th October 1997 were capable of vesting.
Participants elected to defer vesting of 4,792 shares.

Financial instruments It is the Groups objective to minimise exposure to interest rate, currency and liquidity risk through the use of primary and derivative financial instruments.
During the year the group has addressed these risks principally through the use of primary financial instruments only.
Formal procedures are in place to cover banking and other treasury matters.
The Groups policy is not to speculate or trade in financial instruments.
Short-term debtors and creditors Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than the currency risk disclosures.
Fair values The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 31st December, 2002.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
Set out below the table is a summary of the methods and assumptions used for each category of financial instrument.
Financial instruments continued Summary of methods and assumptions The fair value of the Groups bank loans approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the loans are floating, with payments reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
The Companys preference shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange and their fair value is based on their quoted market price at 31st December, 2002.
The fair value of short-term deposits, cash and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of other financial assets approximates to the carrying amount because of the ongoing trading nature of these items and the effect of increasing expected recovery off-setting the effect of discounting.
Other financial liabilities include the provisions for vacant leasehold properties of 1.6m 2001: 3.6m, and long-term creditors of 0.4m 2001: 3.4m.
Other financial assets include shared equity debtors of 5.6m 2001: 6.1m, long-term debtors of 5.2m 2001: 5.5m and loans to Joint Ventures of 3.6m 2001: 1.8m.
Floating rate cash earns interest based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents.

In addition to the above, the Groups provisions of 1.6m for vacant leasehold properties note 19 meet the definition of financial liabilities.
These financial liabilities are considered to be floating rate financial liabilities as, in establishing the provisions, the cash flows have been discounted and the discount rate is re-appraised at each half-yearly reporting date to ensure that it reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate liabilities is 7.9%, fixed for a weighted average period of three years.
The Companys fixed rate 9% cumulative preference shares have no redemption date.
Floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates, based on relevant LIBOR equivalents, which are fixed in advance for periods up to three months.
The weighted average period until maturity of financial liabilities on which no interest is paid is 1.5 years.

Pension costs Defined contribution schemes The Group operates five main defined contribution pension schemes in the UK.
All provide benefits based upon the individual funds available, at retirement, for the purchase of an annuity.
The Alfred McAlpine Utility Services Group Limited Retirement Benefits Scheme received employer contributions in 2002 of 95,599 2001: 46,124 part year.
The Alfred McAlpine Utility Services Group Limited Group Personal Pension Plan received employer contributions in 2002 of 315,255 2001: 220,394 part year.
The Stiell Retirement Savings Scheme received employer contributions in 2002 of 366,974.
The Stiell Limited Group Personal Pension Plan received employer contributions in 2002 of 119,939.
The Eastern Contracting Limited Group Personal Pension Plan received employer contributions in 2002 of 12,045.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan and participates in the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme ESPS in the UK.
Both the Alfred McAlpine Pension Plan the Plan and the ESPS provide benefits based on final pensionable salary for eligible employees.
The assets are held separately from those of the Group and are managed on the Trustees behalf by investment managers.
Both are funded by contributions from the employer and employees and investment returns.
The rates of contribution are determined by independent qualified actuaries, using the projected unit method.
The most recent full valuation of the Plan was at 31st December, 1999 and incorporates the assumption that investment returns will be 2.75% per annum greater than the rate of future salary increases to normal retirement date or earlier death or withdrawal from the Plan and 2.5% greater than the rate of increase in present and future pensions.
The actuary reported that the smoothed market value of the Plans assets at 31st December, 1999 was 236.8m which was sufficient to cover 106.6% of the benefits that had accrued to members allowing for future salary projections.
Contributions made to the Plan in 2002 were 4.5m 2001: 5.4m and the charge to the profit and loss account in the year to 31st December, 2002 totalled 4.5m 2001: 5.4m.
The most recent full valuation of ESPS was at 31st March 2001 and incorporates the assumption that investment returns will be 2.5% per annum greater than the rate of future salary increases to normal retirement date or earlier death or withdrawal from the ESPS.
The actuary reported that the smoothed market value of the Alfred McAlpine Group of ESPS assets at 31st March 2001 was 37.3m, which was sufficient to cover 124% of the benefits that had accrued to members.
Contributions made to the Plan in 2002 were 238,901.
A separate group of employees has been indentified as meeting the eligibility requirements for The Alfred McAlpine Group of ESPS.
At 31st December 2002, the contributions payable in 2002 for this group have been accounted for as a defined contribution scheme, as the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities.
Application of FRS 17 The following information is given under the transitional provisions of FRS 17, which prescribes a method of valuation, for accounting purposes, that differs widely from both the full actuarial valuation and the methodology as prescribed by regulation of the minimum funding rate.
FRS 17 gives the present value of pension liabilities by discounting pension commitments, including salary growth, at an AA corporate bond yield and includes assets at the market value at that date.
The FRS 17 value of total liabilities under the Plan and ESPS at 31st December, 2002 estimated by qualified independent actuaries was 294.4m 2001: 245m and the snapshot market value of assets was 222.4m 2001: 220m, giving a deficit as at that specific date of 50.4m 2001: 17.5m after the related deferred tax asset.
