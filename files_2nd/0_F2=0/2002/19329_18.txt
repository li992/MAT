Notes to the financial statements Annual report and accounts 2002 1 Accounting policies Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost accounting rules as modified by the revaluation of investment properties and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and with the Companies Act 1985 except as noted below under investment properties.
The group has adopted FRS19, Deferred Taxation during the year.
The results of the previous year have been restated accordingly, the overall impact on net assets was a deficit of 3.2 million.
The group has also adopted UITF 28, Operating Lease Incentives, during the year.
The revised accounting policy is stated below.
The results of the previous year have been restated accordingly.
The impact on net assets was nil.
The adoption of FRS17 Retirement Benefits and FRS18 Accounting Policies has had no material impact on these results.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the company and its subsidiary undertakings and the appropriate share of the results and net assets of joint venture operations.
Goodwill, being the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the underlying net assets, previously written off against reserves has not been reinstated.
Goodwill arising in future will be capitalised in the balance sheet and written off to the profit and loss account over its useful life.
On disposal of an acquired business any balance of goodwill relating to its acquisition is written off through the profit and loss account.
Investment properties Investment properties are revalued annually on the basis of open market value.
Surpluses and deficits on revaluation are taken to the revaluation reserve, except for those deficits expected to be permanent, which are included in the profit and loss account for the year.
In accordance with SSAP 19, no depreciation or amortisation is provided in respect of freehold investment properties.
Leasehold investment properties are not depreciated where the unexpired term is over 20 years.
This treatment for certain of the companys investment properties represents a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 concerning depreciation of fixed assets.
However, these properties are not held for consumption but for investment and the directors consider that systematic annual depreciation would be inappropriate.
The accounting policy adopted is therefore necessary for the accounts to give a true and fair view.
Depreciation or amortisation is only one of the factors reflected in the annual valuation, and the amount which might otherwise have been shown cannot be separately identified or quantified.
Purchases and sales of investment properties and properties held for resale are recorded when contracts have been exchanged by the year end, and are wholly unconditional by the date of approval of the accounts.
Surpluses and deficits realised on sales of properties, calculated by comparing net sales proceeds with book values, are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Gains arising in the current year on the sale of the groups properties to unit trusts are recognised in the profit and loss account pro rata to that proportion of the total proceeds received in cash.
The gains relating to that proportion received in units are taken to the revaluation reserve.
Investment in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at directors valuation which represent the underlying net asset value.
Development properties Development properties are included at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost includes directly attributable costs together with interest on specific external debt.
Profits on sales are recognised when the overall profitability of the development can be reasonably foreseen.
Depreciation Tangible fixed assets are depreciated by equal instalments over their expected lives.
The rates used are: Vehicles and equipment 25% Furniture and fittings 10% Deferred taxation Provision is made at the appropriate rates, using the liability method, for deferred taxation arising from temporary timing differences.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS19.
Operating Lease Incentives Rent frees given to tenants are amortised over the earlier of either the period of the lease, or, to when the rent is adjusted to the prevailing market rate, usually the first rent review.
Capital contributions given to tenants are shown as a debtor, and amortised over the earlier of either the period of the lease, or, to when the rent is adjusted to the prevailing market rate, usually the first rent review.
The valuation of the properties is reduced by the total of the unamortised capital contributions and rent frees.
On the disposal of properties, the unamortised rent incentives are charged against rental income and the balance of the unamortised capital contributions are charged to the disposal of investment properties.
Notes to the financial statements continued 28 29 Pillar Property PLC 1 Accounting policies continued Leasing Rentals on operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Assets held under hire purchase agreements are recorded in the balance sheet as an asset and an obligation to pay future rentals.
Depreciation is charged over the assets useful lives and finance charges accrue at a constant rate over the lease term.
Turnover Turnover, which is stated net of VAT, is derived from sale proceeds of trading and development properties, together with net rental income from operations in the United Kingdom.
Hedging costs Hedging costs are amortised over the life of the hedging instruments and the element not amortised is included within prepayments.
Pension costs The company makes payments to individual pension schemes on behalf of certain employees on a fixed percentage contribution basis.

The Audit Committee has reviewed the level of the fees paid to the auditors and its affiliates, to ensure that the auditors independence is not compromised.
