PENSION OBLIGATIONS The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24.
FRS 17 accounting will become mandatory for the Group and Company for the year ended 31 December 2005 until which time phased transitional disclosures are required which are detailed in note 13 b to the extent not already made in note 13 a. a SSAP 24 pension costs The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The principal schemes are in the UK and cover 97% of the Groups UK employees.
These schemes are of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds and are funded.
In other countries benefits are determined in accordance with local practice and regulations and funding is provided on several bases.
As the overseas arrangements are relatively small when compared to the UK schemes a more limited disclosure has been included.
The charge to the profit and loss account for the year in respect of pensions was 5.4m 2001 : 4.3m.
Contributions to the schemes were 8.9m for the year 2001 : 5.4m.
The latest actuarial valuation of the principal UK schemes was carried out by Watson Wyatt LLP, independent consulting actuaries, as at 5 October 1999 using the projected unit method.
For the purposes of assessing the pension costs under SSAP 24 the most significant long-term assumptions relating to the valuation of the schemes are that the annual rate of return on investments will be 5.9%, the annual increase in general salaries will be 4.5%, and that annual pension increases and the underlying rate of inflation will be 3%.
At 5 October 1999 the market value of the assets in the UK schemes was 287m and this was sufficient to cover 103% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings and equalisation of benefits for males and females.
The actuarial surplus in excess of the prepayment at 1 January 2000, which has been calculated by adjusting the surplus shown by the 5 October 1999 valuation is being taken to the profit and loss account over the average remaining service lives of current employees.
Watson Wyatt LLP are currently undertaking the triennial actuarial valuation as at 5 October 2002.

e Hedging of currency exposures The Group does not actively seek to hedge its currency net asset position, though in seeking to match interest costs with trading income to hedge currency cash flows, an effective asset hedge often results.
The Group has substantial cross-border transactions which are denominated in currency other than that of the division carrying out the transaction.
In these circumstances the Group policy is to hedge short term movements in exchange rates by selling or purchasing the appropriate currency to cover specific transactions.
The principal exposures arise in the Groups UK manufacturing divisions which utilise foreign currency bank accounts and forward foreign currency contracts to hedge their respective positions.
At 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001 the Group had no significant unhedged currency exposures that would give rise to currency profits or losses in the profit and loss account.
