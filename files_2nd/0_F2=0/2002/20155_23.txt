7 Directors emoluments Details of Directors emoluments are contained within the Remuneration report on pages 30 to 35.
8 Pension arrangements The Group operates a number of pension schemes.
The main scheme, which covers most employees, is the 3i Group Pension Plan the Plan.
This is a funded defined benefit scheme, the assets of which are independent of the Groups finances and are administered by trustees.
The Plan is the subject of an actuarial valuation every three years.
The last full valuation was made at 30 June 2001 on the projected unit method.
At that date the market value of the assets was 246 million, and this was sufficient to cover 92% of the value of benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for assumed increases in earnings and benefits.
The principal assumptions were as follows: Accrued Future liabilities contributions Price inflation 2.7% 2.7% Rate of return pre-retirement 8.2% 8.6% Rate of return post-retirement 5.2% 5.5% Salary increases excluding promotion 5.2% 5.2% Pension increases 3.0% 3.0% The deficit at 30 June 2001 has been spread over a ten year period, the average remaining service lives of the existing employees, using the percentage of payroll method.
The net cost for the year to 31 March 2002, in respect of the main scheme, of 13 million 2001: 3 million represents the net pension cost for the year, comprising a regular cost 11 million, together with the amortisation of the net actuarial deficit of 2 million determined in accordance with the above assumptions.
During the year a payment of 22 million was made to the Plan.
Based on advice from independent actuaries, regular contributions will recommence in April 2002.
Contributions for the year to 31 March 2003 have been agreed to be 31.5% of members salaries.
An amount of nil 2001: 9 million included in other accruals represents the cumulative difference between the net cost and contributions made.
R W Perry and O H J Stocken are Directors of 3i Group plc and were also throughout the year Directors of Gardens Pension Trustees Limited, one of two Corporate Trustees of the 3i Group Pension Plan.
The Group accounts for pension arrangements in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits FRS17 changes the basis of accounting for pensions and other post-retirement benefits.
This new standard will be mandatory for the year to 31 March 2004 and will then be adopted by the Group.
Under the transitional arrangements, certain additional disclosures are required and these are given below.
The valuation used for FRS17 disclosures is based on membership details supplied for the most recent actuarial valuation at 30 June 2001.
The actuarial valuation was updated to 31 March 2002, by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with FRS17.
As required by FRS17, the defined benefit liabilities have been measured using the projected unit method.
The value of the assets of the scheme have been updated to market value as at 31 March 2002.
The demographic assumptions used in calculating the scheme liabilities remain unchanged from those used in the most recent actuarial valuation.
46 3i Group plc Report and accounts 2002 Notes to the accounts 8 Pension arrangements continued The following table sets out the key FRS17 financial assumptions used for the Plan.
Price inflation 2.5% Salary increases excluding promotion 5.0% Pension increases 3.0% Discount rate 6.1% The following table sets out at 31 March 2002 the market value of assets, a breakdown of the assets into main asset classes with their long term rates of return, the present value of the FRS17 liabilities and the net pension liability.
Expected rate of return for the year to Market value 31 March 2003 m Equities 8.5% 212 Other 5.2% 39 251 Present value of Plan liabilities 265 Net pension liability 14 No deferred tax has been recognised on this deficit because there are surplus losses within the Group and their utilisation is considered unlikely in the foreseeable future.
The net assets of the Group would be reduced by this amount had FRS17 been fully adopted.
9 Cost of changes to organisational structure A provision of 18 million was made for organisational changes of the Group and staff reductions made during the year.
This has been allocated between the revenue account 9 million and the capital reserve 9 million based on the underlying nature of the cost.
10 Profit on ordinary activities before tax 2002 2001 m m This is arrived at after charging: Depreciation on owned assets 6 6 Depreciation on hire purchase assets 2 2 It also includes fees of 6 million 2001: 9 million received from quoted investment companies and the 3i Group Pension Plan which were managed by 3i Investments plc.
Auditors remuneration The auditors received fees for the audit of the Group of 0.6 million 2001: 0.5 million which included 0.2 million 2001: 0.2 million for the Company.
They received fees for non-audit services of 1.2 million 2001: 0.4 million of which 0.4 million 2001: 0.1 million was overseas.
Non audit services, including regulatory reports and taxation advice, were undertaken by Ernst & Young in accordance with the principles in the Directors report on page 27.
Finance charges on hire purchase motor vehicles were 0.6 million 2001: 0.5 million.
11 Tax on profit on ordinary activities The tax charge for the year comprises: 2002 2001 m m UK corporation tax at 30% 2001: 30% 2 4 Less relief for foreign tax 2 4 Foreign tax 4 5 Adjustment in respect of previous periods 1 1 Charge for the year 3 4 The charge for the year is made up as follows: The Company and subsidiary undertakings 3 4 Joint ventures 3 4 Notes to the accounts 3i Group plc Report and accounts 2002 47 11 Tax on profit on ordinary activities continued Factors affecting the charge for the year The tax charge for the year differs from the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK, currently 30% 2001: 30%, and the differences are explained below: 2002 2001 m m Revenue account profit on ordinary activities before tax 109 120 Revenue account profit on ordinary activities before tax multiplied by standard UK corporation tax rate of 30% 2001: 30% 33 36 Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1 2 Short term timing differences 5 1 Current period unutilised tax losses 10 5 Non-taxable UK dividend income 37 37 Foreign tax 4 4 Foreign tax credits available for double tax relief 2 4 Adjustments in respect of previous periods 1 1 Charge for the year 3 4 Factors that may affect future tax charges The Group currently has and expects to continue to generate surplus tax losses.
A deferred tax asset in respect of these surplus losses is not recognised because their utilisation is considered unlikely in the foreseeable future.
12 Profit after tax The amount dealt with in the revenue account of the Company is 110 million 2001: 108 million.
13 Dividends 2002 2001 m m Interim paid 4.9p per share 2001: 4.9p per share paid 29 29 Final proposed 8.1p per share 2001: 8.1p per share paid 49 49 78 78 14 Earnings and net assets per share 2002 2001 Revenue profit for the year 106m 116m Weighted average number of shares Basic 609m 606m Diluted 613m 613m Earnings per share Basic 17.4p 19.2p Diluted 17.3p 18.9p Net assets 3,945m 4,973m Number of shares Basic 610m 607m Diluted 612m 610m Net asset value per share Basic 647p 819p Diluted 645p 815p The difference between the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares is the dilutive effect of share options.
15 Related undertakings The Directors are of the opinion that the number of undertakings in respect of which the Company is required to disclose information under Schedule 5 to the Companies Act 1985 is such that compliance would result in information of excessive length being given.
In accordance with section 231 of that Act information regarding principal subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures is set out on pages 62 and 63.
Full information will be annexed to the Companys next annual return.

Full amortisation of goodwill is considered appropriate as market conditions for technology companies have become tougher and therefore the value of the goodwill is now impaired.
This has resulted in a charge of 73 million 71 million to capital reserve and 2 million to the revenue account instead of 18 million based on a five year amortisation period.

The Groups policy is that fixed rate lending is matched with fixed rate borrowings and the interest rate resetting profile of variable rate lending is matched with that of variable rate borrowings through gearing the portfolio.
Financial instruments including interest rate swaps are used as part of this matching process.
Equity investments, which are mainly funded by shareholders funds but also partially by borrowings in similar currencies, give rise to an interest rate sensitivity gap as a result of the equity investments being non-interest bearing and having no fixed maturity date.
The interest rate sensitivity gap at 31 March 2002 was: Investment activity More than More than More than three months six months one year but not but not but not Not more than more than more than more than More than Non-interest three months six months one year five years five years bearing Total 2002 2002 2002 2002 2002 2002 2002 Assets m m m m m m m Treasury bills and other eligible bills 1 1 Debt securities and other fixed income securities held as financial fixed assets Loan investments 496 98 95 273 446 1,408 Fixed income shares 324 324 Equity shares 3,377 3,377 Other assets 269 269 496 98 95 273 447 3,970 5,379 Liabilities Deposits by banks 448 68 3 519 - Debt securities in issue 425 28 108 424 506 585 - Other liabilities 246 246 Subordinated liabilities 84 84 Shareholders funds 3,945 3,945 23 40 111 424 590 4,191 5,379 Interest rate sensitivity gap 473 58 16 151 143 221 Cumulative gap 473 531 515 364 221 Long term borrowing awaiting investment More than More than More than three months six months one year but not but not but not Not more than more than more than more than More than Non-interest three months six months one year five years five years bearing Total 2002 2002 2002 2002 2002 2002 2002 Assets m m m m m m m Loans and advances to banks 509 54 563 Debt securities held for treasury purposes 161 30 191 670 84 754 Liabilities Deposits by banks Debt securities in issue 569 530 715 754 569 530 715 754 Interest rate sensitivity gap 101 84 530 715 Cumulative gap 101 185 185 715 Combined interest rate sensitivity gap 574 142 16 379 858 221 Combined cumulative gap 574 716 700 1,079 221 Notes to the accounts 3i Group plc Report and accounts 2002 55 29 Interest rate sensitivity gap analysis continued Investment activity More than three More than six More than one months but not months but not year but not Not more than more than more than more than More than Non-interest three months six months one year five years five years bearing Total 2001 2001 2001 2001 2001 2001 2001 Assets m m m m m m m Treasury bills and other eligible bills 1 1 Debt securities and other fixed income securities held as financial fixed assets Loan investments 482 100 92 305 543 1,522 Fixed income shares 434 434 Equity shares 4,001 4,001 Other assets 390 390 482 100 92 305 544 4,825 6,348 Liabilities Deposits by banks 240 10 13 263 Debt securities in issue 140 71 495 482 766 Other liabilities 276 276 Subordinated liabilities 70 70 Shareholders funds 4,973 4,973 100 61 13 495 552 5,249 6,348 Interest rate sensitivity gap 382 161 79 190 8 424 Cumulative gap 382 543 622 432 424 Long term borrowing awaiting investment More than three More than six More than one months but not months but not year but not Not more than more than more than more than More than Non-interest three months six months one year five years five years bearing Total 2001 2001 2001 2001 2001 2001 2001 Assets m m m m m m m Loans and advances to banks 890 890 Debt securities held for treasury purposes 148 50 3 201 1,038 50 3 1,091 Liabilities Deposits by banks 354 354 Debt securities in issue 642 270 365 737 642 354 270 365 1,091 Interest rate sensitivity gap 396 304 3 270 365 Cumulative gap 396 92 95 365 Combined interest rate sensitivity gap 778 143 82 80 373 424 Combined cumulative gap 778 635 717 797 424 The above tables analyse the interest rate sensitivity of the Groups non-trading book after the effect of swaps.
The first section analyses assets and liabilities associated with the Groups investment activity.
The second section analyses funds which have been raised for future investment in long term investment assets.
The funds include the proceeds of two fixed rate bonds of 200 million each, a 10 year issue and a 25 year issue, placed in the year to 31 March 1998, a fixed rate bond of 180 million, a 33 year issue, placed in the year to 31 March 2000 and a fixed rate bond of 135 million, a 31 year issue, placed in the year to 31 March 2002.
These are currently swapped to variable rate and held in money market assets.
A fixed rate bond of 85 million, a 31 year issue placed in the year to 31 March 2002, has been used to fund investment activity.
30 Currency exposures Currency rate risk emanates from the Groups international operations.
The policy regarding currency risk is set out in the Financial review on page 20.
Currency swaps are used as part of applying that policy.
The Groups structural currency exposures at 31 March 2002 were as follows: Variable Fixed Other Other net Short term Other rate loan rate loan investment assets before variable rate variable rate Fixed rate investments investments assets borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings Net assets 2002 2002 2002 2002 2002 2002 2002 2002 Currency m m m m m m m m Sterling 572 534 2,178 503 80 71 1,034 2,744 Euro 72 155 841 186 61 53 231 909 US dollar 351 347 24 96 14 315 Swiss franc 6 27 1 22 12 Swedish krona 34 280 10 353 56 Other 8 63 19 14 55 21 Subtotal 78 224 1,558 240 193 406 300 1,201 Total 650 758 3,736 743 273 335 1,334 3,945 56 3i Group plc Report and accounts 2002 Notes to the accounts 30 Currency exposures continued Variable Fixed Other Other net Short term Other rate loan rate loan investment assets before variable rate variable rate Fixed rate investments investments assets borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings Net assets 2001 2001 2001 2001 2001 2001 2001 2001 Currency m m m m m m m m Sterling 575 662 2,981 594 187 194 842 3,589 Euro 49 155 1,014 516 479 209 1,046 US dollar 60 337 2 160 14 225 Swiss franc 6 84 25 65 Swedish krona 13 14 27 Other 15 59 27 15 65 21 Subtotal 49 236 1,507 559 200 479 288 1,384 Total 624 898 4,488 1,153 387 673 1,130 4,973 The assets and liabilities denominated in all euro currencies have been grouped together under the heading euro.
31 Liquidity The Groups liquidity policy is based on a maturity ladder approach with all mismatch limits of cash flows between cumulative assets and cumulative liabilities over various time periods approved by the Board.
The limits for shorter periods are also agreed with the Financial Services Authority.
32 Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities The Group does not have a trading book and it holds all assets and liabilities in a non-trading book.
Financial assets Quoted and unquoted equity investments and quoted fixed income shares are included in the consolidated balance sheet at market value or Directors valuation which equates to fair value.
Unquoted fixed income shares and loan investments are included in the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost or recoverable amount.
No liquid and active market exists, either for the unquoted fixed income share or loan investments or their component parts.
The fair value of other financial assets equates to their book value in the consolidated balance sheet.
Financial liabilities 3is fixed rate borrowings finance mainly fixed rate loan investments and a proportion of fixed income shares and a small proportion of equity shares, variable rate borrowings finance variable rate loan investments.
As stated above, these unquoted loan and fixed income share investments are included in the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost or recoverable amount.
These investments are not shown at an estimated market value as no active and liquid market exists for them.
The Report and Accounts therefore do not include any recognition of the effect of their yield being above or below current market yields.
However, Financial Reporting Standard 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures requires disclosure of the fair value of those elements of the Groups borrowings that are listed even though, in some cases, the market for those borrowings is not particularly active.
The remainder of the Groups borrowings, which are unlisted, do not have a liquid or active market.
The fair value of the listed element of financial liabilities at 31 March 2002 was 1,222 million 2001: 1,306 million, which compares with a book amount of 1,208 million 2001: 1,260 million.
These borrowings are used to fund investments which, in general, yield a net margin to the Group and which would therefore have a higher fair value than the fair value of the borrowing.
The fair value of other financial liabilities equates to their book value in the consolidated balance sheet.
Derivatives The Group does not trade in derivatives.
The derivatives held hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
It is the intention to hold both the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the derivative hedging them until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
The book value of derivatives represents net interest receivable payable, on such instruments at the balance sheet date.
The fair value represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date.
No unrealised gains or losses are included in the balance sheet.
The fair values and book values at 31 March 2002 of the swaps were: Fair value Fair value Book value Book value 2002 2001 2002 2001 m m m m Interest rate swaps 5 6 11 Currency swaps 2 6 1 2 3 6 7 13 All swaps held at 31 March 2002 mature before 31 March 2041.
The principal outstanding on currency swap agreements and notional principal outstanding on interest rate swap agreements were: 2002 2001 m m Fixed rate to variable rate 715 855 Variable rate to fixed rate 1,064 1,111 Variable rate to variable rate 175 235 Fixed rate to fixed rate 60 60 Included in the above are currency swaps amounting to 271 256 All financial instruments are unsecured.
However, 3i does not expect non-performance by the counterparties, whose credit ratings are reviewed regularly.

The remaining provision is expected to be largely utilised in the year to 31 March 2003.
Deferred tax Full provision has been made for deferred tax relating to capital allowances and other timing differences.

A deferred tax asset in respect of these surplus losses has not been recognised because their utilisation is considered unlikely in the forseeable future.
Deferred tax provision is made in respect of unrealised appreciation on investment assets not held by the Groups ultimate parent company and which therefore do not enjoy the capital gains exemption.
36 Subordinated liabilities Subordinated liabilities comprise funding from Kreditanstalt fr Wiederaufbau, a German federal bank.
This funding, which individually finances investment assets, is at various fixed rates of interest and maturity is dependent upon the disposal of the associated assets.
This funding is subordinated to other creditors of the individual group undertakings to which these funds have been advanced.

In addition to the interests shown above, the executive Directors also have beneficial interests in the conditional rights to acquire shares pursuant to the performance linked awards granted under the Management Equity Investment Plan, which are detailed in the table on page 34.
Each of the employees of the Group including each of the executive Directors is a potential beneficiary of The 3i Group Employee Trust and as such is interested within the meaning of section 324 of the Companies Act 1985 in the 9,716,940 shares held by the trust at 31 March 2002.
This number of shares includes the shares over which Directors are mentioned above as having conditional rights to acquire under the Management Equity Investment Plan.
During the year to 31 March 2002 shares were transferred by The 3i Group Employee Trust, on exercise of share bonus awards following fulfilment of the conditions attached to such awards, to B P Larcombe: 24,829 2001:nil, M M Gagen: nil 2001: 9,602, R W Perry: nil 2001: 9,673, M J Queen: 5,696 2001:nil and Dr R D M J Summers: 10,188 2001:nil.
Details of Directors share options under the Groups Executive Share Option Plans are shown in the Remuneration report on page 32.
Dr R D M J Summers retained throughout the year an interest in one share of c7 in 3i SA and an interest in one share of c16 in 3i Gestion SA, subsidiary undertakings of the Company, in order to comply with provisions in the Articles of Association of those companies.
Since 31 March 2002 there have been changes in the Directors interests in shares.
As at 3 May 2002 each of these Directors were beneficially interested in the following number of additional shares: B P Larcombe 102, R W Perry 102, M J Queen 51, Dr R D M J Summers 102 and P B G Williams 102.
In addition, as at that date, the number of shares held by The 3i Group Employee Trust was 9,653,690.

As investment trusts are exempt from capital gains tax, the Groups capital return is largely not taxable.
Factors that may affect future tax charges Deferred tax provision is made in respect of unrealised appreciation on investment assets not held by the Groups ultimate parent company and which therefore do not enjoy the capital gains tax exemption.
