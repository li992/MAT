Canary Wharf Group plc Report & Financial Statements 2002 Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2002 Notes to the Financial :45 Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2002 1Principal Accounting Policies A summary of the principal accounting policies of the group, all of which have been applied consistently throughout this and the preceding year save for the adoption of Financial Reporting Standard 19 Deferred Tax FRS 19 and Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 28 Operating Lease Incentives UITF 28 which now have effect, is set out below.
The comparatives for the year ended 30 June 2001 have been restated to comply with FRS 19 and UITF 28.
1 Accounting Convention The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment properties in accordance with Note 1 4 below, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
2 Basis of Consolidation On 4 December 2001 a restructuring of the group was completed and a new ultimate holding company was introduced by way of a scheme of arrangement in accordance with Section 425 of the Companies Act 1985.
The new holding company was incorporated on 30 March 2001 as a public company, Dolphincove plc.
On 15 October 2001 it changed its name to New Canary Wharf plc.
In order to maintain continuity following implementation of the scheme, New Canary Wharf plc changed its name to Canary Wharf Group plc on 4 December 2001, whilst the previous company of that name has been re-incorporated as a private limited company and changed its name to Canary Wharf Estate Limited.
The financial statements include consolidated accounts for New Canary Wharf plc and its subsidiaries at 30 June 2002.
The combination of New Canary Wharf plc with Canary Wharf Group plc has been accounted for using merger accounting in accordance with the group reconstruction provisions of Financial Reporting Standard 6 Acquisitions and Mergers.
Consequently, although the combination did not become effective until 4 December 2001, the financial statements of the combined group are presented as if the merged businesses had always been part of the same group.
Accordingly, the results of the group for the entire year ended 30 June 2002 are shown in the consolidated profit and loss account and the comparative figures for the year ended 30 June 2001 are also prepared on this basis.
The directors have adopted the basis of preparation set out above because they consider that it is necessary in order to give a true and fair view of the results of the group for the period to 30 June 2001 consistent with the financial period adopted by the group previously.
The effect of not doing so would have been to present only the results for the period since the combination became effective on 4 December 2001.
The consolidated profit and loss account of Canary Wharf Group plc for the period from the date of incorporation, 30 March 2001, to 30 June 2002 is presented in Note 27 in order to comply with the Companies Act 1985.
Canary Wharf Group plc Report & Financial Statements 2002 Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2002 46: Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2002 Group restructuring expenses have been treated as an exceptional item in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 3 Reporting Financial Performance.
This transaction did not give rise to deferred tax in the period.
3 Profit and Loss Account Turnover, which is stated net of VAT, comprises rental income and service charges.
Marketing and administrative costs which are not development expenses are charged to the profit and loss account when incurred.
4 Property Interests The groups property interests comprise investment properties, properties under construction and properties held for development.
Investment properties Investment properties are revalued annually and in accordance with SSAP 19 Accounting for Investment Properties no provision is made for depreciation.
This departure from the requirements of the statutory accounting rules, which require all properties to be depreciated, is, in the opinion of the directors, necessary for the financial statements to show a true and fair view.
Depreciation is only one of the factors reflected in the annual valuation and the amount attributable to this factor is not capable of being separately identified or quantified.
Surpluses or deficits on investment properties are transferred to the revaluation reserve, unless a deficit is expected to be permanent and exceeds previous surpluses recognised on the same property, in which case the excess is charged to the profit and loss account.
Properties under construction and properties held for development Properties held for development and properties under construction which are to be retained are categorised as fixed assets and included in the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value at the date of the acquisition by Canary Wharf Estate Limited of the Canary Wharf Holdings Limited CWHL group in December 1995, together with subsequent additions at cost, less subsequent disposals, subject to any provision for impairment.
Properties under construction which are to be retained are transferred to investment properties on an individual building basis when construction is complete and the properties are substantially let.
Properties under construction or held for development where the group has entered into an agreement for sale are categorised as current assets and stated at the lower of cost namely fair value at date of acquisition plus subsequent additions at cost and net realisable value.
Profits on sale of such properties are taken into account on completion of the sale contract.
Additions to properties under construction or held for development include all expenses of development, including attributable interest where appropriate.
Interest capitalised is calculated by reference to the rate of interest payable on the borrowings drawn down to finance the development.
Canary Wharf Group plc Report & Financial Statements 2002 Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2002 :47 5 Lease Incentives Lease incentives include rent-free periods and other incentives given to lessees on entering into lease agreements.
The groups policy for accounting for lease incentives has changed to comply with UITF 28.
Previously rental income was recognised only on expiry of rent-free periods and other lease incentives were capitalised as part of the cost of the property.
Under UITF 28 the aggregate cost of lease incentives is recognised as an adjustment to rental income, allocated evenly over the lease term or the term to the first open market rent review if earlier.
The cost of other lease incentives is included within prepayments and spread on a straight line basis over a similar period.
Accordingly the external valuation of investment properties is reduced for these incentives.
The new accounting policy applies to all lease incentives relating to leases commencing subsequent to 1 July 2000.
The effects of the change in policy are summarised below: Year Ended Year Ended 30 June 2002 30 June 2001 m m Profit and loss account: Increase in rental income 15.5 Balance sheet: Decrease in investment properties 10.7 Decrease in properties under construction 10.7 Increase in prepayments and accrued income 26.2 10.7 6 Other Tangible Fixed Assets Other tangible fixed assets are depreciated so as to write off the cost in equal annual instalments over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned.
The principal annual rates used for this purpose are: Computer equipment 33% Fixtures and equipment 25% 7 Debt Debt instruments are stated initially at the amount of the net proceeds.
The finance costs of such debt instruments are allocated to periods over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the reporting period and reduced by payments made in respect of the debt in that period.
Finance costs are charged to the profit and loss account, except in the case of development financings where interest and related financing costs are capitalised as part of the cost of development.
Amounts receivable and payable, arising from derivatives which hedge interest rate exposures, are treated as part of financing costs.
Canary Wharf Group plc Report & Financial Statements 2002 Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2002 48: Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2002 8 Investments Except as stated below, fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Investments in associates are included in the financial statements using the equity method.
In the consolidated balance sheet, investments in associates are stated at the groups share of net assets less provision for unrealised profit on the sale of land to the associates.
The groups share of the associates profits losses after tax is included in the consolidated profit and loss account.
9 Finance Leases Sales and leasebacks where the leaseback is treated as a finance lease, as required by SSAP 21 and FRS 5 are recorded in the balance sheet as assets and as obligations to pay future rentals.
Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance charge and a reduction in the outstanding obligation for future amounts payable.
The total finance charge, which includes the amortisation of deferred expenses relating to finance leases, is allocated to accounting periods over the lease terms so as to produce a constant periodic charge on the remaining balance of the obligation for each accounting period.
10 Vacant Leasehold Property Provision is made for the present value of the anticipated net commitments in relation to leasehold properties where there is a shortfall in the rental income receivable against the rent and other costs payable.
11 Pensions The group operates two defined contribution pension schemes.
Pension contributions in respect of these schemes are accrued as they fall due.
12 Share Option Schemes The economic cost to the group of share option schemes is charged to the same expense category as the employment cost of the relevant employee, spread on a straight line basis over the relevant performance criteria period.
The economic cost represents either the acquisition cost of the shares or the market value of the shares at the date the options are granted, less any amount recoverable from the employee.
Shares purchased and held in trust in connection with the groups share option schemes are recorded as an investment in own shares within fixed asset investments and shown net of accumulated amortisation.
Where relevant, provision is made for employers National Insurance contributions based on the market value of the share options at the balance sheet date and spread on a straight line basis over the period of the relevant performance criteria.
Canary Wharf Group plc Report & Financial Statements 2002 Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2002 :49 13 Deferred Taxation Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in the corporation tax return.
The groups policy for accounting for deferred tax has also been changed to comply with FRS 19.
Previously the groups policy was to provide for deferred tax only to the extent that liabilities or assets were expected to crystallise in the foreseeable future.
Under FRS 19 deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured on a discounted basis to reflect the time value of money over the period between the balance sheet date and the dates on which it is estimated that the underlying timing differences will reverse or, where the timing differences are not expected to reverse, a period not exceeding 50 years.
Discount rates of 3.2% to 3.5% have been adopted reflecting the post-tax yield to maturity that can be obtained on government bonds with similar maturity dates and currencies to those of the deferred tax assets or liabilities.
The effects of the change in policy are summarised below: Year Ended Year Ended 30 June 2002 30 June 2001 m m Profit and loss account: Increase in deferred tax charge credit 10.1 1.1 Balance sheet: Deferred tax liability 51.6 41.5 Canary Wharf Group plc Report & Financial Statements 2002 Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2002 50: Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2002 2Restatement The effects of adopting UITF 28 and FRS 19 for the current and prior years are as follows: Profit after Earnings per share Shareholders Turnover Taxation Taxation Basic Diluted Funds m m m p p m Year ended 30 June 2001 As previously reported 159.2 42.5 6.2 6.1 1,637.9 Effect of adopting UITF 28 Effect of adopting FRS 19 1.1 1.1 0.1 0.1 41.5 As restated 159.2 1.1 43.6 6.3 6.2 1,596.4 Year ended 30 June 2002 Results without adopting UITF 28 and FRS 19 191.3 187.6 29.2 28.9 1,896.4 Effect of adopting UITF 28 15.5 15.5 2.4 2.4 15.5 Effect of adopting FRS 19 10.1 10.1 1.6 1.6 51.6 As reported 206.8 10.1 193.0 30.0 29.7 1,860.3 3Segmental Reporting The Operating and Financial Review includes a discussion of segmental information, including a summary of the properties in each segment.

All other fair values shown have been calculated by discounting cash flows at the relevant zero coupon LIBOR interest rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
During the year to June 2001 2.5 million was realised on certain interest rate hedges.
These hedges were entered into in anticipation of the tap issue completed in June 2001 and the gains were therefore deferred and will be recognised over the term of the debt.
In addition, security over certain cash deposits was released and at the same time interest rate swaps relating to these deposits were unwound resulting in a net gain to the group of 4.5 million which was included in interest receivable see Note 5.
In anticipation of the tap issue in February 2002, the group entered into certain interest hedges, which were subsequently closed out realising a net loss of 0.6 million.
These losses have been deferred and will be recognised over the term of the debt.
In addition, the group realised a 0.1 million gain on closing out certain interest rate hedges related to its construction facility.
This amount has been netted against the financing cost attributable to the relevant building.
Other than the above no gains or losses on derivative financial instruments have been recognised in the year.
