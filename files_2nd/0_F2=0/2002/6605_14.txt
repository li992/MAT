The standard rate of tax for the Group has been estimated by aggregating the local standard tax rates and weighting these in proportion to accounting profits.
profits arising from manufacturing operations in Singapore, Puerto Rico and Ireland are taxed at reduced rates.
The effect of this reduction in the taxation charge increased earnings per share by 3.6p in 2002, 2.7p in 2001 and by 3.2p in 2000.
The integrated nature of the Groups worldwide operations, involving significant investment in research and strategic manufacture at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets, gives rise to complexity and delay in negotiations with revenue authorities as to the profits on which individual Group companies are liable to tax.
Disagreements with, and between, revenue authorities as to intra-Group transactions, in particular the price at which goods should be transferred between Group companies in different tax jurisdictions, can produce conicting claims from revenue authorities as to the profits that fall to be taxed in individual territories.
Resolution of such issues is a continuing fact-of-life for GlaxoSmithKline.
In the USA, for a number of years, GlaxoSmithKline has had significant open issues relating to transfer pricing.
These issues affect all years from 1989 to the present and concern a number of products, although the most significant relates to the success of Zantac, in respect of which the claims of the US Internal Revenue Service IRS substantially exceed the Groups estimation of its taxation liabilities.
The IRS claims, which are not completely quantied, continue to be the subject of discussions between the US and UK tax authorities under the competent authority provisions of the double tax convention between the two countries.
Within these discussions there is a wide variation between the views of the US and UK tax authorities and, exceptionally, they may be unable to reach agreement to settle the dispute.
In the event of the UK and US tax authorities not reaching agreement, the matter may have to be resolved by litigation.
GlaxoSmithKline uses the best advice in determining its transfer pricing methodology and in seeking to manage transfer pricing issues to a satisfactory conclusion and, on the basis of external professional advice, continues to believe that it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from open assessments.
92 GlaxoSmithKline Notes to the financial statements 12 Taxation continued Except as shown in these Financial statements, no provision has been made for taxation which would arise on the distribution of profits retained by overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings, on the grounds that no remittance of profit retained at 31st December 2002 is required in such a way that incremental tax will arise.
At 31st December 2002, the Group had corporate tax losses of approximately 69 million and capital losses estimated to be in excess of 9 billion which are not recognised as deferred tax assets because there is insufficient evidence that these losses will be used.

All deferred taxation movements arise from the origination and reversal of timing differences.
The Group has implemented the new Financial Reporting Standard, FRS 19 Deferred Tax, in 2002, which requires deferred tax to be accounted for on a full provision basis rather than a partial provision basis as before.
For the full year 2001 the business performance tax charge is increased by 8 million, and the total tax charge by 6 million.
The net deferred tax asset at 31st December 2001 has been reduced by 127 million.

The numbers used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share are reconciled below.
To illustrate business performance, which is the primary performance measure used by management, adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share are presented after excluding merger items, integration and restructuring costs and disposal of businesses.
Management believes that exclusion of these non-recurring items provides a better comparison of business performance for the periods presented.
Accordingly this information is provided as a supplement to that contained in the consolidated statement of profit and loss on pages 76 and 77 prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
Basic and diluted earnings per share include these non-recurring items.

Brands largely comprise a portfolio of Sterling products such as Panadol, Solpadeine and Hedex and the Block Drug products such as Sensodyne, Polident and Poligrip.
Each of these is considered to have an indefinite life given the strength and durability of the brand and the level of marketing support.
Accordingly, they are not amortised.
The valuation of each Sterling brand is reviewed annually using a 10 year cash ow forecast as this was the basis for the original independent assessment when they were acquired in 1994 and a post-tax discount rate of eight per cent.
The valuation of each Block Drug brand is also reviewed annually using a five year cash ow forecast and a post-tax discount rate of eight per cent.

The principal associated undertaking is Quest Diagnostics, Inc. a US clinical laboratory business listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
The investment has a book value at 31st December 2002 of 129 million 2001 98 million and a market value of 782 million 2001 1,094 million.
At 31st December 2002, the Group owned 23 per cent of Quest 2001 23 per cent.
This holding was reduced to 21 per cent in February 2003 following Quests acquisition of Unilab Corporation.
The book value includes goodwill which is being amortised over 20 years: the amortisation charge for 2002 was 6 million.
The goodwill at 31st December 2002 amounts to 101 million 2001 118 million.
Goodwill of 115 million which relates to the continuing Group interest in Clinical Laboratories assets attributed to Quest, remains eliminated against Group reserves.
Equity investments comprise listed investments of 7 million 2001 8 million and unlisted investments of 118 million 2001 125 million.
The market value of listed investments was 11 million 2001 8 million.
Investments in own shares consist of shares held by Employee Share Ownership Trusts see Note 34.
The market value of own shares at 31st December 2002 was 2,161 million 2001 3,229 million.
This valuation shortfall is not considered to represent a permanent diminution in value in the context of the length of the future period over which the related share options may be exercised.
Accordingly no provision has been made.

The contributions relating to the US and German pension schemes are included within the amounts applied to the provision above: the contribution relating to the UK pension scheme has increased the prepayment amount shown under debtors in Note 21.
The Group has recognised costs in 2002 in respect of plans for manufacturing and other restructuring initiated in 1998, 1999 and in 2001 following the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham and acquisition of Block Drug.
These plans are largely to be completed during 2003.
Costs recognised as a provision, principally in respect of identied severances at sites where it has been announced that manufacturing activities will cease, are expected to be incurred mainly in 2003.
Costs of asset write-downs have been recognised as an impairment of xed assets.
The Group has recognised costs in 2001 and 2002 in respect of plans for the integration of the Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham businesses.
Additional costs will be incurred as implementation of the integration following the merger continues.
Costs recognised as a provision in respect of identied severances are expected to be incurred in 2003, and in respect of the programme to encourage staff to convert Glaxo Wellcome or SmithKline Beecham share options into GlaxoSmithKline share options when employees exercise these options.
Provisions for legal and other disputes and other matters include amounts relating to US anti-trust, product liability, contract terminations, self-insurance, environmental clean-up and property rental.
The companys Directors, having taken legal advice, have established provisions after taking into account insurance and other agreements and having regard to the relevant facts and circumstances of each matter and in accordance with accounting requirements.
No provisions have been made for unasserted claims.
The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings, investigations and possible settlement negotiations.
GlaxoSmithKline is involved in a number of legal and other disputes including notication of possible claims where, because of the early stage of the matter, no reliable estimate of the outcome can be made.
Accordingly no provision has been recorded for these matters or any unasserted claims.
It is in the nature of the Groups business that a number of these matters may be the subject of negotiation and litigation over several years.
The largest individual amounts provided are expected to be settled within two years.
For a discussion of litigation issues, refer to Legal proceedings in Note 30.

Loans and overdrafts due within one year Commercial paper comprises a US$10 billion programme, of which 1,284 million was in issue at 31st December 2002 at 31st December 2001 1,269 million, backed up by committed facilities of 364 days duration of 872 million, renewable annually, and liquid investments of 787 million.
The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper borrowings at 31st December 2002 was 1.3 per cent.
Loans due after one year In 2002, a 500 million, 4.875 per cent coupon bond and two, US dollar denominated, oating rate bonds totalling $495 million were issued under the European Medium Term Note programme.
The Group also raised $500 million of oating rate debt through a private nancing arrangement.
This may be redeemed by the Group at any time and, in particular, in the event of any accelerating event that would increase the cost of funding for the Group.
Loans due after one year are repayable over various periods as follows: 2002 2001 m m Between one and two years 423 11 Between two and three years 563 116 Between three and four years 311 140 Between four and five years 2 843 After five years 1,793 998 3,092 2,108 The loans repayable after five years carry interest at effective rates between 4.9 per cent and 5.3 per cent.

Pensions Group undertakings operate pension arrangements which cover the Groups material obligations to provide pensions to retired employees.
These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benets can be provided by State schemes: by dened contribution schemes, whereby retirement benets are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee, or by dened benefit schemes, whereby retirement benets are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
Some dened benefit schemes now also include dened contribution sections and are described as hybrid schemes in the table.
In the majority of cases the contributions to dened benefit schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualied actuaries.
Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the Groups main plans are undertaken regularly, normally at least every three years.
The assets of funded schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts or are insured.
Pension costs for accounting purposes have been assessed in accordance with independent actuarial advice, generally using the projected unit method and by spreading surpluses or deficits over the average expected remaining service lives of the respective memberships.
In certain countries pension benets are provided on an unfunded basis, some of which are under a scheme administered by a trustee company.
Where assets are not held with the specic purpose of matching the liabilities of unfunded schemes, a provision is included within provisions for pensions and other post-retirement benets.
The charge against profits in respect of these benets is the aggregate of the increase over the year in the assessed liabilities for members still in service and the net movement in provisions set up for pensions in payment.
Liabilities are generally assessed annually in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
Notes to the financial statements GlaxoSmithKline 115 33 Employee costs continued Throughout 2002 the pension arrangements in some of the former Glaxo Wellcome companies and former SmithKline Beecham companies continued to be operated separately.
However in some instances, including the USA, the pension arrangements have been merged.
The following information deals with each set of arrangements accordingly.
The market value of the assets of the Groups funded dened benefit pension funds at the dates of the latest actuarial valuations, some of which date back to 1999, was 6.5 billion and the actuarial value of assets was sufficient to cover approximately 113 per cent of the benets that had accrued to members after allowing for future salary and pension increases.
The UK dened benefit pension schemes account for approximately 70 per cent of the Groups plans in asset valuation and projected benefit terms and the US dened benefit pension schemes account for approximately 25 per cent of the Groups plans in asset valuation and projected benefit terms.
In December 2002, the Group made special funding contributions to the UK, US and German pension schemes totalling 320 million.
The company will review the pension position annually and will make further contributions as appropriate.
Pension costs are expected to be higher in 2003 than in 2002 as the new actuarial valuations of the UK and US schemes become available.
UK In the UK the dened benefit pension schemes operated for the benefit of former Glaxo Wellcome employees and former SmithKline Beecham employees remain separate.
These schemes were closed to new entrants in 2001 and subsequent UK employees are entitled to join a dened contribution scheme.
The relevant assumptions used in calculating the pension costs of both the former Glaxo Wellcome and former SmithKline Beecham UK dened benefit schemes for accounting purposes are as follows: 2002 2001 % pa % pa Rate of increase of future earnings 4.0 4.0 Discount rate 8.0 8.0 Expected long-term rate of return on investments 8.0 8.0 Expected pension increases 2.5 2.5 UK equity dividend growth 5.0 5.0 The regular cost for the Glaxo Wellcome pension arrangements in 2002 was 62 million, which became a 14 million credit for the financial statements, after allowance was made for spreading the surplus disclosed as a level percentage of salary over the expected future working lifetime of the existing members some 11 years.
The most recent triennial actuarial valuations of the Glaxo Wellcome schemes for funding purposes were carried out as at 31st March 2000.
At that date the assets of the schemes represented 133 per cent of the actuarial value of all benets accrued to members after allowing for future salary and pension increases.
The trustees of the UK pension schemes agreed, at the companys request, to grant various benefit improvements, which included a five per cent enhancement in the entitlement of all beneciaries.
After allowance was made for these improvements, the funding level fell to 123 per cent.
Following the valuations, normal company contributions to the schemes remain suspended at least until the next formal valuation.
The total market value of the assets held by the schemes at 31st March 2000 was 3,670 million.
The regular cost for the SmithKline Beecham schemes in 2002 was 17 million, which increased to an accounting cost of 28 million after allowance was made for the spreading of the deficit over the expected future working lifetime of current employees in the scheme some 11 years.
The latest valuation was carried out at 31st December 1999 and at that date the actuarial value of scheme assets represented 90 per cent of the actuarial value of the accrued service liabilities based on the 2002 assumptions.
The total market value of assets held by the scheme at 31st December 1999 was 1,077 million.
USA In the USA the former Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham dened benefit and hybrid schemes were merged during 2001.
The relevant assumptions used in calculating the pension costs for accounting purposes are as follows: 2002 2001 % pa % pa Rate of increase of future earnings 5.5 5.5 Discount rate 9.5 9.5 Expected long-term rate of return on investments 9.5 9.5 Cash balance credit conversion rate 6.5 6.5 US equity dividend growth 7.75 7.75 The regular cost for the US scheme in 2002 was 64 million, which increased to an accounting cost of 77 million after allowance was made for the spreading of the deficit over the expected future working lifetime of current employees in the scheme.
The latest valuation was carried out at 1st January 2002 and at that date the actuarial value of scheme assets represented 90 per cent of the actuarial value of the accrued service liabilities.
The total market value of assets held by the scheme at 1st January 2002 was 1,536 million.

The dened benefit sections of the UK schemes have been closed to new members, and under the projected unit method of valuing the pension scheme liabilities the current service cost will increase as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
The deficits under FRS 17 reect the different bases for valuing assets and liabilities compared with SSAP 24, including the immediate impact of the fair values of assets at 31st December 2002.
The Group also operates a number of unfunded post-retirement healthcare schemes, the principal one of which is in the USA.
The liability under FRS 17 for the US scheme has been assessed using the same assumptions as for the US pension scheme, together with the assumption for future medical ination of 11 per cent, reducing by one per cent per year to five per cent.
On this basis the liability for the US scheme has been assessed at 766 million 2001 787 million, which reduced to 475 million 2001 488 million after taking account of deferred tax.

The details given below relate to schemes operated by GlaxoSmithKline in 2002 and 2001 and separately by Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham up to the date of the merger, which became schemes of GlaxoSmithKline on the merger.
Each Glaxo Wellcome option outstanding at the date of the merger was converted into one GlaxoSmithKline option.
Each SmithKline Beecham share option was converted into 0.4552 of a GlaxoSmithKline share option and each SmithKline Beecham ADS option was converted into 1.138 GlaxoSmithKline ADS options, with corresponding adjustments to the grant price.
GlaxoSmithKline share option schemes The company operates share option schemes and savings-related share option schemes.
Grants under share option schemes are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Grants under savings-related share option schemes are normally exercisable after three years saving.
Options under the share option schemes are normally granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
In accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the savings-related share option schemes are granted at a price 20 per cent below the market price ruling at the date of grant.

Participations in the MTIP were granted annually to senior staff in SmithKline Beecham, designating a target number of shares for each participant based on job grade.
Following a three-year measurement period, the R&N Committee reviewed SmithKline Beechams total shareholder return relative to the other companies comprising the FTSE 100 Index, and made a final award of a proportion of the target number of shares, up to 100 per cent, depending on performance.
The first two measurement periods ended on 31st December 1998 and 1999 and, 100 per cent and 97 per cent, respectively, of the target number of shares was awarded.

In February 2002, Mr Ingram, then a member of the CET, purchased a portion of land being part of a residential property owned by the Group that was adjacent to Mr Ingrams own residence.
The total sale price was $16,500 based on an independent valuation of the land.
The Group subsequently determined that retention of the residential property no longer served its business needs and listed the property for sale.
An independent valuation of the property on 3rd June 2002 valued it at $1,050,000 and the property was offered for sale through an estate agent.
Mr Ingram made the highest offer for the property and purchased it from the Group for total consideration of $1,070,000.
