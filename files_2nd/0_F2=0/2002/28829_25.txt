Pension costs The Group mainly operates funded dened benefit pension schemes.
There are funded dened contribution schemes in Denmark and Sweden.
Overseas schemes are administered in accordance with local law and practice.
The major pension schemes in the UK, USA, Denmark and Sweden together cover the majority of scheme members throughout the Group and the assets of these schemes are mainly held in separate trustee administered funds.
Each of the major dened benefit schemes are subject to regular valuation using the projected unit or other appropriate method which is the basis of the pension cost in the Consolidated profit and Loss Account, the cost being spread over employees working lives.
In April 2002, the UK schemes were effectively closed to new entrants following the introduction of a new dened contribution scheme.
The total pension cost for the Group in 2002 was 94m 2001 35m of which 43m 2001 11m related to schemes in the UK and 9m 2001 4m related to schemes in the USA.
Contributions of 20m 2001 15m were made to the dened contribution scheme in Denmark and Sweden.
The total pension costs have increased based on the financial position following the new valuations undertaken in 2002 for the UK schemes.
Independent qualied actuaries carry out valuations of the major schemes.
At the most recent formal actuarial valuations of the major dened benefit schemes the two main UK schemes 31 March 2002 and 30 June 2002 respectively, and the USA scheme 1 January 2002, for the purpose of assessing pension costs, the market value of the assets of these schemes was 3,858m 2001 4,751m.
Of this amount, 3,568m related to the two UK schemes and on their valuation dates were sufficient to cover 110% and 101% respectively of the benets accrued to members of each of those schemes, after allowing for projected increases in earnings and pensions.
The valuations for the two major UK schemes were based on assumptions that salaries increase by 4.3% and 4.0% plus allowances for promotional salary increases, pensions increase by 2.9% and 2.5% and investment returns are 7.1% p. a. pre-retirement and 5.6% post retirement for one scheme and 6.5% for the other.
For the two main UK schemes, the level of contributions respectively were 0% and 17% throughout 2002 pending the results of the valuations made in 2002.
For 2003 contributions are being increased to 23% and 20% respectively with arrears of contributions at these rates back to the respective valuation dates plus an amount of 20m in respect of one of the schemes where there was a deficit on the valuation funding basis.
The amounts charged to the profit and Loss Account were the equivalent of 10.8% and 11.5% respectively of relevant UK earnings.
This charge reected a regular cost of 73m 2001 59m and a credit of 34m 2001 50m.
The credit arises from the amortisation of the actuarial surpluses in the funds after taking account of interest on balances between the Group and the funds.
For one scheme an actuarial surplus from the valuation is being applied to reduce pension costs by a level percentage of payroll over the estimated working lives of members of the respective schemes.
There are no significant contributions outstanding or prepaid as at 31 December 2002 except that included in provisions are amounts of 81m 2001 67m resulting from the difference between the amounts charged to revenue and the amounts contributed to schemes in the UK and 8m 2001 29m in respect of provisions for overseas schemes.
Other post-retirement benets The Group provides post-retirement healthcare benets to certain current and retired United States and Canadian employees.
The estimated discounted present values of the unprovided accumulated obligations are calculated in accordance with the advice of independent qualied actuaries.
At 31 December 2002 the unprovided accumulated obligation in the United States is estimated at 15m 2001 18m assuming a pre-65 premium ination for medical care initially of 11% reducing over nine years to 4.25% and a post-65 premium ination of 13% reducing over eleven years to 4.25% 2001 12% reducing over seven years to 5% and a discount rate of 6.5% 2001 7%.
The unprovided accumulated obligation in Canada is estimated at 5m 2001 7m assuming a premium inflation for medical care of 8% 2001 7% reducing over four years to 4% 2001 4% for one scheme and 10% Previous Contents Next I I ROYAL & SUNALLIANCE ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 66 Notes on the Accounts continued 7.
Retirement benets continued 2001 9% decreasing by 0.5% per year to 5% per year 2001 1% per year to 5% for the other scheme.
For dental care, premium ination of 4% and 5% is assumed for the respective schemes 2001 4% and 5% and a discount rate of 6.75% for both schemes 2001 6.75% and 7%.
The benets are accounted for on a systematic basis over the remaining service lives of current employees, the cost in the year being 6m 2001 6m.
The costs of meeting the liability for these benets are expected to attract taxation relief when paid.
The total provision included in the Combined Consolidated Balance Sheet is 42m 2001 44m.
c. Alternative accounting treatment Financial Reporting Standard 17 The Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Reporting Standard 17 FRS 17 Retirement Benets in November 2000.

Methodology for calculations of longer term rate of return and comparison over a longer term The rates of investment return used for the longer term rate of return basis are reviewed annually and are set out below: 2002 2001 % % Pre tax returns assumed Fixed interest returns nominal 6.00 6.00 Equity returns nominal 9.00 9.00 Ination 3.00 3.00 These returns are applied to the average, over the year, of the investments directly attributable to shareholders and the general insurance technical provisions.
In each case, the element of shareholders funds has been determined by reference to the risk based capital that the directors judge is necessary to support the business.
The values of the investments are adjusted to reduce the effect of short term uctuations, while recognising such changes over the longer term.
The aggregate amount of investment return recognised under the longer term basis since 1 January 1994 amounts to 9.9bn.
The total investment return that arose in this period was 10.3bn.

Net deferred tax assets are principally attributable to tax losses and the discounting of claims reserves in the US, and unclaimed capital allowances in the UK.
No credit has been taken in the deferred tax provision for UK tax losses with an estimated tax value of 140m.
This amount includes capital losses that arose prior to the merger of the Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance groups and trading losses, the use of which is severely restricted by UK tax law.
The recoverability of any associated deferred tax asset is therefore considered remote.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of UK capital losses with an estimated value of 94m, or for non UK tax losses with a tax value of 10m as it is not considered likely that suitable capital profits will arise to absorb these losses in the near future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are discounted at rates reecting post tax yields to maturity that can be obtained at the balance sheet date on government bonds with maturity dates and in currencies similar to those of the deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The discount rates used are 1% to 4%.

Transactions with related parties A number of the directors, other key managers, their close families and entities under their control have general and or long term insurance policies with subsidiary companies of the Group.
Such policies are on normal commercial terms except that executive directors and key managers are entitled to special rates which are also available to other members of staff.
The Board has considered the financial effect of such insurance policies and other transactions with Group companies and has concluded that they are not material to the Group or the individuals concerned and, if disclosed, would not inuence decisions made by users of these financial statements.
The Board has also concluded that there are no transactions with other directors or key managers that are material to their own financial affairs.
In 2000, Royal & Sun Alliance Linked Insurances Ltd RSALI and Phoenix Assurance plc Phoenix, two wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group, entered into a financial reassurance arrangement to maintain the regulatory solvency of RSALI.
Due to the legally segregated nature of the long term business fund of Phoenix and the profit recognition methods prescribed by the modied statutory basis of accounting for with profit life companies, the balance on the Consolidated Long Term Business Technical Account of the Group, which is stated after tax, includes 3.2m of net loss 2001 8.1m of net profit arising in the year from this arrangement.
Previous Contents Next I I ROYAL & SUNALLIANCE ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 85 44.
Transactions with related parties continued On 1 October 2002 the Phoenix non participating fund acquired RSALI for 219m.
RSALI was transferred to Phoenix for the value of its embedded value at that date.
RSALI is now treated as an investment of the non participating fund and any movement in its net asset value arising after that date will be reected within the Fund for Future Appropriations within the Phoenix fund, rather than in the balance on the Long Term Business Technical Account.
The movement in the RSALI shareholders accrued interest in the three months ended 31 December 2002 was a loss of 40m which included 21m of recognised costs relating to the closure of its business.
The Phoenix result is determined by the Appointed Actuary having regard to the accumulated surplus in the non participating fund.
The profit so recognised in the Long Term Business Technical Account in 2002 amounted to 41m 2001 50m.
The long term fund of Phoenix comprises both participating and non-participating long term insurance policies, where both of these types of policies have a contingent interest in the excess of assets over liabilities in the long term business fund.
Accordingly, this excess is not allocated between policyholders and shareholders and is taken to the Phoenix Fund for Future Appropriations.
The value of the Fund for Future Appropriations at 31 December 2002 was 601m 2001 725m.
Shareholders interest in long term business The total shareholders interest in long term business contained within the Combined Consolidated Balance Sheet comprises: Asia UK EMEA Americas Pacic 2002 2001 m m m m m m Shareholders accrued interest 71 71 337 Value of long term business 767 5 4284 898 1,335 Shareholders funds and subordinated liabilities attributable 338 323 126 118 905 831 1,105 328 168 273 1,874 2,503 Less notionally attributed to general business 100 200 1,774 2,303 Value of long term business is described in the Accounting Policies and in note 19.
The movement in value of long term business, other than the amortisation of the present value of acquired in-force business, is credited to other reserves within capital and reserves.
Shareholders funds attributable represent those assets held outside the long term funds but which are assessed by the directors to be the amount maintained in support of the long term business.
Estimation techniques, uncertainties and contingencies World Trade Center The estimated cost of the insurance losses associated with the tragic terrorist action of 11 September 2001, is a gross loss of 1,214m, reduced to 269m net of reinsurance.
This was an unprecedented event, which continues to have many unresolved issues in respect of both the gross loss and consequent extent of the reinsurance recoveries.
The loss estimate has been prepared on the basis of the information currently available as to the magnitude of the claims, including business interruption losses.
Most major exposures have now been reserved at policy limits.
The estimate continues to be based on the assumption that the industry position, that the destruction of the World Trade Center towers represents one occurrence rather than two, is correct.
However, this is subject to litigation in the US and, as a consequence, there is uncertainty as to the eventual decision.
The final cost may be different from the current estimate due to the uncertainties outlined above and it is not possible to reliably estimate the quantum.
Nevertheless, the directors believe their estimates of the gross and net loss is appropriate based on the information available to them and that there will be no material adverse effect on the Groups financial position.
Student Finance Corporation Following the decision to cease renewing existing business in the Groups US based Financial Enhancement unit, issues arose in connection with a series of credit risk insurance policies covering loans made by Student Finance Corporation to students in various post secondary trade schools, primarily truck driving schools in the US.
At 31 December 2002, the loan portfolio had a face value of $501m.
In June and July 2002, a US subsidiary led lawsuits seeking, among other things, rescission of these policies in response to a systematic pattern of fraud, misrepresentation and cover up by various parties.
As the Groups lawsuits seek rescission of the policies, all financial accounting entries associated with the transactions have now been reversed.
The ultimate outcome of the suit is uncertain.
In July 2002, MBIA Insurance Corporation and Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, NA, led suit against the US subsidiary seeking to enforce the credit risk insurance policies that the US subsidiary previously sued to rescind.
MBIA insures eight securitisations that were collateralised by the student loans and Wells Fargo is the trustee.
Further suits were led against the Groups US based operations by Wilmington Trust Co. in August 2002 and by PNC Bank in September 2002.
After taking legal advice, the directors intend that the US subsidiary should vigorously assert its entitlement to rescind these policies and defend the legal actions taken against it.

Estimation techniques, uncertainties and contingencies continued In the event the lawsuits do not result in complete rescission of all applicable credit risk insurance policies, any losses on the student loan portfolio, will be reduced by reinsurance, recoveries from the original borrowers on the defaulted loans and any remaining reserves established under the loan programmes.
Any losses may be further offset by recoveries from other third parties.
No assurance can be given that the above mentioned factors, including the outcome of the lawsuit, the availability of reinsurance recoveries, the extent and amount of recoveries from the borrowers under the loan programme and or the reserves for defaults will be resolved in favour of the Group.
Based on our current knowledge of the circumstances, legal advice received and the range of other actions available to the Group to manage any insurance exposure, the directors believe that the resolution of the legal proceedings in respect of these credit risk insurance policies will not have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position.
Financial enhancement products Within the financial enhancement portfolio of Financial Structures Limited, a subsidiary of the US Group, are a variety of credit default product exposures, including collateralised debt obligations CDO, credit enhancement and residual value insurance contracts for which the majority of premium has not been earned and losses are provided on an arising basis.
These products are no longer written.
Losses during 2002 amounted to 36m reecting the deterioration of the corporate credit environment.
Claims provisions of 36m have been established at year end in addition to 81m of unearned premium provision on these products.
The ultimate loss estimate over the life of the CDO products is 116m based on a model which utilises Standard & Poors historical average default patterns and recovery values.
However, the ultimate losses from this business will depend upon the performance of underlying debt obligations.
Contingent loan finance The regulatory solvency of the UK Life funds is sensitive to change in investment conditions and the recent turbulent stock market conditions have heightened the risk of breaches in regulatory solvency.
The funds have low regulatory solvency and a Group company has agreed, in certain circumstances, to make loans of up to 1bn to the Life funds in order to support their solvency position, should the need arise.
These loans will be recoverable only out of any future surpluses arising in the Life funds and realistic balance sheet analysis indicates that is expected to occur.
At 31 December 2002 160m 2001: nil had been funded and 25m 2001: nil had been utilised under these arrangements.
US regulatory capital On 1 March 2003, the Groups US based operations led their regulatory capital return with the relevant state insurance regulators in the USA.
These returns are still subject to audit and may be amended.
For three of the twenty seven legal entities, the statutory surplus is below the company action level of the local regulatory solvency measure.
Company action level is a solvency measure where actual statutory surplus is below twice the regulatory solvency measure.
The specic amounts of the shortfall below the company action level are $2m, $8m and $10m.
At that level, the legal entity is required to submit a plan, to the insurance commissioner of the state of domicile, indicating how the statutory surplus will rise above the company action level.
To resolve this issue a proportion of the xed interest investment portfolio, which is reected at amortised cost in the regulatory returns, will be sold in the first quarter of 2003 to generate gains in those legal entities with capital and surplus below the company action level.
Further declines in regulatory capital could trigger further action by the insurance regulators.
There can be no certainty as to whether, in the light of the other uncertainties affecting the US based operations, or for other reasons, the regulatory position may deteriorate further and, if this occurs, what action the US regulators might take.
The directors believe that, after taking account of the various actions they can take to improve the US based operations regulatory capital, there will be no material adverse effect on the Groups financial position.
UK and Group regulatory capital The Group continues to have discussions with the FSA on the regulatory capital position of its UK insurance subsidiaries including the treatment of certain reinsurance contracts and the implicit item in the calculation of the solvency of the UK Life funds, the progress of the actions announced on 7 November 2002 to improve that position, the other uncertainties described above, the implementation of the EU Groups Directive and its interrelationship with the overall capital of the Group.
It is possible that the resolution of these discussions could lead to financial consequences for the Group including provision of financial support for subsidiaries.
If the FSA were to require action to be taken, there would be a number of different ways in which the FSAs requirements might be satisfied.
Consequently, it is not possible to reliably estimate the extent or probability of these outcomes.
Based on the information currently available, the directors do not believe that any consequences will result in a materially adverse effect on the Groups financial position.
