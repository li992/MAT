BG GROUP PLC 2002 117 supplementary information gas and oil unaudited A PROVED RESERVES Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of gas and oil which geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions.
Proved developed reserves are those reserves which can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.
Proved undeveloped reserves are those quantities that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where relatively major expenditure is required for completion.
Gas and oil reserves cannot be measured exactly since estimation of reserves involves subjective judgment.
Therefore, all estimates are subject to revision.

Future cash inflows have been computed by reference to the Groups estimate of third party prices ruling at the year end and estimates of future production of net proved gas and oil reserves at the end of each year.
The standardised measure of discounted future net cash flow information presented below is not intended to represent the replacement cost or fair market value of the Groups gas and oil properties.
The disclosures shown are based on estimates of proved reserves, future production schedules and costs which are inherently imprecise and subject to revision.
