Note 39 gives details of the estimation techniques used in determining the general business outstanding claims provision.
Both are estimated to give a result within the normal range of outcomes.
To the extent that the ultimate cost falls outside this range, for example where experience is worse than that assumed for long-term business, or assumptions over general business claims inflation may alter in the future, there is uncertainty in respect of this liability.
b Asbestos, pollution and social environmental hazards In the course of conducting insurance business, various companies within the Aviva Group receive general insurance liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened litigation arising therefrom, including claims in respect of pollution and other environmental hazards.
Amongst these are claims in respect of asbestos production and handling in various jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and South Africa.
Given the significant delays that are experienced in the notification of these claims, the potential number of incidents which they cover and the uncertainties associated with establishing liability and the availability of reinsurance, the ultimate cost cannot be determined with certainty.
However, the Groups exposure to such liabilities is not significant and, on the basis of current information and having regard to the level of provisions made for general insurance claims, the directors consider that any costs arising are not likely to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.
c Guarantees on long-term savings products As a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees, including interest rate guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and fund management products.
In the United Kingdom, in common with other pension and life policy providers, the Group wrote individual and group pension policies in the 1970s and 1980s with a guaranteed annuity rate option GAO.
Since 1993, such policies have become more valuable to policyholders, and more costly for insurers, as current annuity rates have fallen in line with interest rates.
Reserving policies for the cost of GAOs varied until a ruling by the House of Lords in the Equitable case in 2000 which effectively required full reserving by all companies.
Prior to the ruling, consistent with the Groups ordinary reserving practice in respect of such obligations, full reserves for GAOs had already been established.
No adjustment was made, or was necessary, to the Groups reserving practice as a result of the ruling.
The directors continue to believe that the existing provisions are sufficient.
d Pensions mis-selling The Pensions Review of past sales of personal pension policies which involved transfers, opt outs and non-joiners from occupational schemes, as required by the Financial Services Authority FSA, has largely been completed.
A provision of some 68 million 2001: 96 million remains to meet the outstanding costs of the few remaining cases, the anticipated cost of any guarantees provided, and potential levies payable to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
It continues to be the directors view that there will be no material effect either on the Groups ability to meet the expectations of policyholders or on shareholders.
e Endowment reviews In December 1999, the FSA announced the findings of its review of mortgage endowments and expressed concern as to whether, given decreases in expected future investment returns, such policies could be expected to cover full repayment of mortgages.
A key conclusion was that, on average, holders of mortgage endowments had enjoyed returns such that they had fared at least as well as they would have done without an endowment.
Nevertheless, following the FSA review, all of the Groups UK mortgage endowment policyholders received policy-specific letters advising them whether their investment was on track to cover their mortgage.
In May 2002, in accordance with FSA requirements, the Group commenced sending out the second phase of endowment policy update letters, which provide policyholders with information about the performance of their policies and advice as to whether these show a projected shortfall at maturity.
The Group will continue to send these updates annually to all mortgage endowment holders, in accordance with FSA requirements.
An expense provision of 50 million 2001: 10 million has been made to meet potential mis-selling costs and the associated expenses of investigating complaints.
It continues to be the directors view that there will be no material effect either on the Groups liability to meet the expectations of policyholders or on shareholders.
f Other In addition, the Company has guaranteed the overdrafts and borrowings of certain subsidiary and associated undertakings.
In the opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise in respect of these guarantees and indemnities.
49 Capital commitments In carrying on the business of investment, the Group has entered into future commitments, including property development, after 31 December 2002.
These amounts are not reflected in the consolidated Group balance sheet on pages 52 and 53.
The Group has in hand a number of property developments which, under contracts already signed, will require expenditure of 344 million 2001: 207 million for long-term business and nil 2001: 1 million for general business operations.

Basis of preparation achieved profit basis The achieved profit statement above includes the results of the Groups life operations reported under the achieved profit basis combined with the modified statutory basis results of the Groups non-life operations set out on pages 44 to 90.
In the directors opinion, the achieved profit basis provides a more accurate reflection of the performance of the Groups life operations year on year than results under the modified statutory basis.
The achieved profit methodology used is in accordance with the guidance on Supplementary reporting for long-term insurance business the achieved profits method circulated by the Association of British Insurers in December 2001.
Further details on the methodology and assumptions are set out on pages 96 to 97.
The results of the Groups life operations under the modified statutory basis, which is the basis used in the annual statutory accounts, can be found on pages 44 to 90.
The contribution from the Groups share of the alliance with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group RBSG is incorporated within the achieved operating profit.
Goodwill amortised in the year in respect of the Groups holding in the associated company, RBS Life Investments Limited, is included within the Amortisation of goodwill above.
The results for 2002 and 2001 have been audited by the auditors Ernst & Young LLP.
Their audit report in respect of 2002 is on page 98.
92 Aviva plc Annual report accounts 2002 Components of total life achieved profit Total life achieved profit, including the Groups share from the alliance with RBSG, comprises the following components, the first three of which in aggregate are referred to as life achieved operating profit: new business contribution written during the year including value added between the point of sale and end of year: the profit from existing business equal to: the expected return on the value of the in-force business at the beginning of the period, experience variances caused by the differences between the actual experience during the period and expected experience based on the operating assumptions used to calculate the start of year value, the impact of changes in operating assumptions including risk margins: the expected investment return on the shareholders net worth, based upon assumptions applying at the start of the year: investment return variances caused by differences between the actual return in the period and the expected experience based on economic assumptions used to calculate the start of year value: and the impact of changes in economic assumptions in the period.

Operating assumption changes include the impact of reducing the risk margins in the US in line with the directors views of the risks associated with this in-force portfolio.
The impact of this change was 13 million.
In 2001, operating assumption changes included the impact of reducing risk margins in the Netherlands and the Poland life and pensions operations.
The impact of the change in the Netherlands was 17 million.
The impact was 22 million in the Poland life operation and 6 million in the Poland pensions operation.
Exceptional items in 2001 comprised integration costs.
New business contribution The following table sets out the contribution from new business written by the long-term business operations.
The contribution generated by new business written during the period is the present value of the projected stream of after-tax distributable profit from that business.
Contribution before tax is calculated by grossing up the contribution after-tax at the full corporation tax rate for UK business and at appropriate rates of tax for other countries.

The total profit recognised over the lifetime of a policy is the same as under the modified statutory basis of reporting, but the timing of recognition is different.
Distributable profits from long-term businesses arise when they are released to shareholders following actuarial valuations.
These are carried out in accordance with statutory requirements designed to ensure and demonstrate solvency in long-term business funds.
Future distributable profits will depend on experience in a number of areas such as investment return, discontinuance rates, mortality and administration costs.
Using realistic assumptions of future experience, we can project releases to shareholders arising in future years from the business in-force and associated minimum statutory solvency margin.
The life achieved profit reflects current performance by measuring the movement, from the beginning to the end of the year, in the present value of projected releases to shareholders from the business in-force and associated minimum statutory margin, together with the movement in the net assets of the long-term operations, adjusted for any amounts released from or invested in life operations.
The present value of the projected releases to shareholders is calculated by discounting back to the current time using a risk discount rate.
The risk discount rate is a combination of a discount rate to reflect the time value of money and a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years may differ from the assumptions referred to above.
The calculations are carried out on an after-tax basis and the profits are then grossed up for tax at the full rate of corporation tax for the United Kingdom and at an appropriate rate for each of the other countries.
b Embedded value The shareholders interest in the long-term business operations is represented by the embedded value.
The embedded value is the total of the net assets of the long-term operations and the present value at risk discount rates which incorporate a risk margin of the projected releases to shareholders arising from the business in-force, less a deduction for the effect of holding the minimum statutory solvency margin.
This effect of solvency margin is the difference between the nominal value of the solvency margin and the present value at risk discount rates of the projected release of the solvency margin and investment earnings on the assets deemed to back the solvency margin.
For with-profit funds in the United Kingdom and Ireland, for the purpose of recognising the value of the estate, it is assumed that terminal bonuses are increased to exhaust all of the free assets over the future lifetime of the in-force with-profit policies.
Principal economic assumptions Economic assumptions are derived actively based on market yields on risk-free fixed interest assets at each period end.
Margins are applied on a consistent basis to risk free yields to obtain investment return assumptions for ordinary shares and property, and risk discount rates.
The reductions in assumptions in 2002 reflect the fall in actual risk-free yields for example, in the UK the 15-year gilt over the year in each territory.
Risk margins remain unchanged in all our key businesses.
The economic assumptions for the pension business are identical with the exception of the risk discount rate which is 13.8% 2001: 16.9%: 2000: 17.3%.
96 Aviva plc Annual report accounts 2002 Principal economic assumptions continued Spain 2002 2001 2000 Risk discount rate 7.7% 8.3% 8.4% Pre-tax investment returns: Base government fixed interest 4.6% 5.3% 5.4% Ordinary shares 7.6% 8.3% 8.4% Property 6.1% 6.8% 6.9% Future expense inflation 3.0% 3.2% 4.0% Tax rate 35.0% 35.0% 35.0% Other assumptions Current tax legislation and rates have been assumed to continue unaltered, except where changes in future tax rates have been announced.
Assumed future mortality, morbidity and lapse rates have been derived from an analysis of Avivas recent operating experience.
The management expenses of Aviva attributable to long-term business operations have been split between expenses relating to the acquisition of new business and to the maintenance of business in-force.
Certain expenses of an exceptional nature have been identified separately and the discounted value of projected exceptional costs has been deducted from the value of in-force business.
A realistic estimate of future fund management expenses that will be charged to long-term businesses by Group companies not included in the long-term business covered by the achieved profits method has been included within the value of in-force business.
It has been assumed that there will be no changes to the methods and bases used to calculate the statutory technical provisions and current surrender values.
The value of in-force business allows for future premiums under recurring single premium business where collection of future single premiums is expected and where the receipt of further single premiums is not regarded as new business at the point of receipt.
It does not allow for future premiums under non-contractual increments, or for future Department of Social Security DSS rebate premiums, and the value arising therefrom is included in the value of new business when the premiums are received.
The value of the in-force business has been determined after allowing for the effect of holding solvency margins equal to the minimum EU solvency requirement or equivalent for non-EU operations.
Solvency margins relating to with-profit business are assumed to be covered by the surplus within the with-profit funds and no effect has been attributed to shareholders.
Bonus rates on with-profit business have been set at levels consistent with the economic assumptions and Avivas medium-term bonus plans.
The distribution of profit between policyholders and shareholders within the with-profit funds assumes that the shareholder interest in conventional with-profit business in the United Kingdom and Ireland continues at the current rate of one-ninth of the cost of bonus.
Alternative assumptions Economic assumptions The table below shows the sensitivity to a one percentage point increase in interest rates and in the discount rate for new business contribution and embedded value.
New business contribution Embedded value Interest rates Discount rate Interest rates Discount rate m m m m United Kingdom 25 45 225 275 Europe excluding UK France 7 8 60 65 Ireland 3 3 5 15 Italy 2 2 10 Netherlands including Belgium and Luxembourg 7 7 70 110 Poland 1 15 Spain 2 8 15 15 Other 1 1 5 International 5 5 15 43 80 380 525 Profits are affected by a change in underlying interest rates.
When interest rates change, expected future investment returns will also change and this in turn will affect projected cash flows.
A change in interest rates will also result in a change in the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the projected cash flows.
The impact of an increase of one percentage point in interest rates incorporates all such changes.
In addition, the impact on embedded value includes the impact of the reduction that would occur in the market value of fixed interest investments if interest rates increased by one percentage point.
Market values of other asset classes are assumed to reduce in proportion to movements in the market value of fixed interest investments of an appropriate term.
The impact of an increase of one percentage point in the discount rate is calculated with all other assumptions remaining unchanged.
Non-economic assumptions Sensitivity calculations have been performed to identify the non-economic assumptions to which new business contribution and the value of in-force business within embedded value are particularly sensitive.
The calculations have been based on similar percentage movements in each assumption from the base assumption used to calculate the published new business contribution and value of in-force business.
Based on this, the Groups new business contribution is most, and broadly equally, sensitive to changes in future maintenance expenses and discontinuance rates, whereas the value of in-force business is most sensitive to changes in levels of future maintenance expense.
