37 Long-term business a The Group underwrites long-term business in a number of countries as follows: i In the United Kingdom mainly in with-profit funds of CGNU Life, Commercial Union Life, Norwich Union Life & Pensions and the Provident Mutual fund, where the with-profits policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits, the shareholders receiving the balance: non-profit funds of Norwich Union Annuity, Norwich Union Life & Pensions and Norwich Union Linked Life, where shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits.
Shareholder profits on unitised with-profit business written by Norwich Union Life & Pensions and on stakeholder unitised with-profit business are derived from management fees and policy charges, and emerge in the non-profit funds.
ii In France, where the majority of policyholders benefits are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
In addition, a substantial number of policies participate in investment returns, with the balance being attributable to shareholders.
iii In the Netherlands, where the balance of profits, after providing appropriate returns for policyholders, accrues for the benefit of the shareholders.
The bases for determining returns for policyholders are complex, but are consistent with methods and criteria followed generally in the Netherlands.
In addition, a substantial number of policies provide benefits which are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
iv In other overseas operations, using methods similar to those described above.
b The directors have been advised by the Groups reporting actuary that the assets of each of the long-term operations were at least sufficient to meet their respective liabilities at 31 December 2002.
38 Long-term business provision The long-term business provision is calculated separately for each life operation, mainly using the net premium method.
The provisions for overseas subsidiaries have generally been included on the basis of local regulatory requirements, modified where necessary to reflect requirements of the Companies Act.
Material judgement is required in calculating the provisions and is exercised particularly through the choice of assumptions where there is discretion over these.
The assumptions used to calculate the long-term business provision depend on the circumstances prevailing in each of the life operations.
The principal assumptions in the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands are: Interest % Mortality tables used United Kingdom Assurance: With-profit 3.2 to 3.5 AM92 AF92 or A67 70 adjusted Non-profit 3.2 to 4 AM80 AF80 or AM92 AF92 or TM92 TF92 adjusted for smoker status Pure endowment and deferred annuity: Pensions business in deferment 3.5 to 5.5 Nil or AM80 AF80 or AM92 AF92 adjusted General annuity business from vesting 4 IM80 IF80 or IM92 IF92 adjusted plus allowance for mortality improvement Pensions business from vesting 4 to 4.5 PMA80 PFA80 or PMA92 PFA92 adjusted plus allowance for future mortality improvement Annuity in payment: General annuity 4.8 to 5.3 IMA80 IFA80 adjusted plus allowance for future mortality improvement Pensions 5 to 5.3 PMA80 PFA80 adjusted plus allowance for future mortality improvement Allowance for future mortality improvements reflect the medium cohort projection from the CMIB working paper published in December 2002, adjusted for females and for a higher rate of improvement at very old ages.
80 Aviva plc Annual report accounts 2002 38 Long-term business provision continued For unitised with-profit business, the provisions are valued initially by determining the lower of the current non-guaranteed surrender value and the bid value of units.
This result is then compared with a prospective valuation and the higher result is taken.
The provisions held in respect of guaranteed annuity options are a prudent assessment of the additional liability incurred under the option on a basis and method consistent with that used to value basic policy liabilities, and includes a prudent assessment of the proportion of policyholders who will choose to exercise the option.
Interest % Mortality tables used France Life assurances: Up to eight years 3.5 to 4.5 TD 88 90 Eight years and over 2.5 to 3.5 TD 88 90 Annuities 2.5 to 4.5 TPRV prospective table Netherlands Life assurances 3 to 4 GBM 61-65, 76-80, 80-85 GBM V 85-90, 90-95 Annuities in deferment and in payment 3 to 4 GBM V 76-80, 80-85, 85-90, 90-95, Coll 1993 and DIL 98 plus further allowance for future mortality improvement In all countries, local generally accepted interest rates and published standard mortality tables are used for different categories of business as appropriate.
The tables are based on relevant experience and show mortality rates, by age, for specific groupings of people.
39 Provisions for outstanding claims a The ultimate cost of general business outstanding claims is estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques, such as the Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods.
Such methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurred claims, average costs per claim and ultimate claim numbers for each accident year, based upon the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios.
The main assumption underlying these techniques is that past claims development experience can be used to project ultimate claims costs.
Judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in future, for example to reflect public attitudes to claiming, economic conditions or varying levels of claims inflation.
The approach adopted takes into account, inter alia, the nature and materiality of the business and the type of data available.
Large claims are usually separately assessed, either by being measured at case estimate face value or separately projected in order to reflect their future development.
Case estimates are generally set by skilled claims technicians applying their experience and knowledge to the circumstances of individual claims.
Additional qualitative input, such as allowance for one-off occurrences or changes in legislation, policy conditions or portfolio mix, is also used in arriving at the estimated ultimate cost of claims, in order that it represents the most likely outcome, from a range of possible outcomes, taking account of all the uncertainties involved.
Provisions are calculated allowing for reinsurance recoveries and a separate asset is recorded for the reinsurers share, having regard to collectability.
b Claims on certain classes of business are discounted as follows: Rate Mean term of liabilities Class 2002 2001 2002 2001 Netherlands Permanent health and injury 3.5% 3.5% 12 years 12 years Net of reinsurers share, the outstanding claims provisions before discounting were 9,508 million 2001: 9,700 million.
The period of time which will elapse before the liabilities are settled has been estimated by modelling the settlement patterns of the underlying claims and related reinsurance recoveries.
40 Equalisation provision An equalisation provision has been established in the Group accounts as explained in accounting policy T on page 46.
This had the effect of reducing Group and Company shareholders funds by 314 million at the year end 2001: 272 million.
The change in the equalisation provision during the year comprised a reduction of 57 million 2001: 56 million in the balance on the general business technical account and the profit on ordinary activities before tax, offset by 15 million representing the equalisation provision of a subsidiary company sold during the year.
