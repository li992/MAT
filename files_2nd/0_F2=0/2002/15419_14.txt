Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with applicable UK Accounting Standards.
The transitional arrangements of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits have been adopted, which require additional disclosures in respect of retirement benefits, as set out in note 19.
FRS 19 Deferred Taxation has been adopted in these financial statements.
The adoption of this standard represents a change in accounting policy, however the effect is not material and therefore comparative figures have not been restated.
A summary of the principal group accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, is given below.
Basis of consolidation The group financial statements consolidate the results of Taylor Nelson Sofres plc and its subsidiary undertakings up to 31 December 2002.
The results of all subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of are accounted for under acquisition accounting rules and are included in the profit and loss account from the effective date of control.
Intra-group sales and profits are eliminated on consolidation.
Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are those entities in which the group holds a long-term interest and which are jointly controlled by the group and one or more venturers under a contractual agreement.
Joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method of accounting.
Associates are those undertakings, other than subsidiaries and joint ventures, in which the group holds a long-term participating interest and exerts a significant influence.
The groups share of profits losses of associates is included in the group profit and loss account and the groups share of their net assets, together with goodwill arising on acquisition, is included in the group balance sheet.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on consolidation for acquisitions made since 1 January 1998 is amortised in equal annual instalments over its estimated useful economic life of up to 20 years, and charged to the profit and loss account.
Goodwill is subject to an impairment review at the end of the first full year following an acquisition and at any other time, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Foreign currencies Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Transactions in foreign currencies are converted at rates of exchange prevailing at the date the transactions were made.
Foreign exchange differences are dealt with through the profit and loss account, except for differences arising on the retranslation of loans taken out to finance overseas subsidiaries, which are dealt with through reserves.
Financial statements of overseas operations are translated using the closing rate net investment method, except that profits and losses of overseas operations are translated at the average exchange rate applicable to the period.
Differences arising on translation of the net assets of overseas operations are dealt with through reserves and are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Revenue recognition Revenue and profits on short term projects are recognised on the completion of the project.
Costs incurred on projects up to completion are included within work-in-progress.
Revenue and profits on long term or continuous projects are recognised on the satisfactory completion of each phase of the project.
Costs incurred on projects are included within work-in-progress until completion of each phase.
Amounts invoiced to clients in advance of revenue and profits being recognised are shown as payments received on account within creditors.
Provisions are made for losses on projects as soon as they are identified.
Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provisions for any permanent diminution in the value of investments.
Tangible and intangible fixed assets Fixed assets are stated at original cost or, where appropriate, fair value when acquired, less accumulated depreciation.
Assets under construction consist of costs directly attributable to purchasing and installing tangible fixed assets ahead of their productive use.
External and internal costs are capitalised to the extent that they enhance the future economic benefits of the business.
26 TNS annual report 2002 Internal costs are only capitalised if they are also incremental to the group.
Provisions are made where the value of assets has been impaired in relation to their value-in-use to the business and charged to the profit and loss account.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows: Freehold land no depreciation Freehold buildings 33 years Short leasehold land and buildings period of lease Patents, licences and other 20 years or remaining life if shorter Goodwill 20 years or estimated useful economic life if shorter Software and databases 15 years or remaining life if shorter Leasehold improvements 10 years or period of lease if shorter Fixtures, fittings, equipment and motor vehicles 3 10 years No depreciation is charged on assets under construction until they are brought into use by the business.
Finance and operating leases Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised and depreciated over their useful lives, or the term of the lease if shorter, at the rate applicable to fixed assets of a similar category owned by the group.
Rentals under operating leases are charged directly to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Work-in-progress Work-in-progress is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct costs incurred on incomplete client projects and an appropriate element of specifically attributable overheads.
Pension arrangements The group operates a number of contributory pension plans.
The majority of employees participate in defined contribution plans that are set up through insurance companies.
Contributions are also made to personal pension plans at equivalent rates.
Payments in respect of such current service contributions are charged in the financial statements as they fall due.
The group also operates defined benefit plans which provide pensions based on final salaries.
The expected cost of pensions in respect of these plans is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the service lives of employees in the plans.
Variations from the regular cost are spread over the expected remaining service lives of current employees in the plan.
The pension cost is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified independent actuaries.
Employee share ownership plans and QUEST Shares in Taylor Nelson Sofres plc held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP and the Employee Benefit Trust EBT have been included within fixed asset investments and are stated at cost less provisions for any permanent diminution in value.
Net operating income from the plans is included under interest receivable and similar income in the groups consolidated profit and loss account.
Costs of administration are included in the profit and loss account as they accrue.
Profits arising on the disposal of shares held by the EBT as a result of the exercise of options are taken to other reserves.
Contributions made by the company to the QUEST in respect of SAYE options exercised during the year are charged directly to reserves.
Deferred consideration Where acquisitions involve further payments that are deferred or contingent on levels of performance achieved in the years following acquisition, the profit and loss account is charged with notional interest to eliminate the benefit which the group is temporarily saving.
The notional interest charged is calculated by reference to the period of deferral, current interest rates and the amount of the likely payments.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Tax deferred or accelerated by the effect of timing differences is accounted for to the extent that a transaction or event that has occurred at the balance sheet date gives rise to an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax in the future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that suitable taxable profits will arise from which the reversal of the asset can be deducted.
Bank facility arrangement fees Bank facility arrangement fees are capitalised and charged to the profit and loss account in equal annual instalments over the life of the bank facilities.

The amount waived in respect of the 2002 interim dividend was 22,000 2001 24,000 and the maximum to be waived in respect of the 2002 final dividend on shares currently held by the ESOP is 39,000 2001 44,000.
The trustees of the EBT have also waived their right to all but 0.001p per share of the dividends due on the 7,467,266 shares the EBT holds at 31 December 2002, until further notice.
The amount waived in respect of the 2002 interim dividend was 67,000 2001 77,000 and the maximum to be waived in respect of the 2002 final dividend on shares currently held by the EBT is 127,000 2001 137,000.

9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share have been calculated on the profit after taxation and minority interests of 12.4m 2001 15.9m and on 380,639,215 shares 2001 373,724,213, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the ESOP and the EBT, which are treated as cancelled.
The diluted earnings per share have been calculated in accordance with the provisions of FRS 14, with the weighted average number of shares in issue being adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares for the period they were outstanding.
Shares held by the ESOP and the EBT which are under performance-based options are included in the diluted weighted average number of shares, as the performance conditions are deemed to have been met for the purposes of this calculation.
The diluted weighted average number of shares is 386,581,928 2001 383,693,389.
Adjusted earnings per share before goodwill charges have been calculated on the profit after taxation and minority interests of 32.6m 2001 29.8m, which excludes goodwill charges of 20.2m 2001 13.9m and on the basic weighted average number of shares.
The directors believe that earnings per share before goodwill charges assists in understanding the underlying performance of the group.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year for the purpose of these calculations is as follows: 2002 2001 Weighted average number of shares millions Share capital 390.4 388.6 Shares held by ESOP 2.6 3.3 Shares held by EBT 7.2 11.6 Basic earnings per share denominator 380.6 373.7 Dilutive effect of share options 6.0 10.0 Dilutive earnings per share denominator 386.6 383.7 32 TNS annual report 2002 10 Intangible fixed assets Patents and Goodwill licences Other Total Group m m m m Cost At 1 January 2002 218.8 5.0 1.4 225.2 Exchange differences 12.9 0.1 0.1 12.7 Additions see note 12 18.3 0.1 18.4 Disposals 10.1 0.2 10.3 At 31 December 2002 214.1 5.1 1.4 220.6 Amortisation At 1 January 2002 20.5 1.6 1.1 23.2 Exchange differences 0.9 0.1 0.8 Charge for year 13.3 0.4 13.7 Impairment 6.3 6.3 Disposals 0.3 0.1 0.4 At 31 December 2002 38.9 2.1 1.0 42.0 Net book value At 31 December 2002 175.2 3.0 0.4 178.6 At 31 December 2001 198.3 3.4 0.3 202.0 In accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill, the carrying value of the goodwill held in respect of a number of the groups subsidiary undertakings has been compared to their recoverable amounts represented by their value in use to the group.
The review has resulted in impairment charges of 4.3m in respect of Indetec and 2.0m in respect of Tellex, a UK media intelligence business 2001 impairments of 4.9m.

Provisions for contingent deferred consideration have been discounted where the effect is material, using discount rates comparable with bank lending rates available to the group.
Deferred consideration represents amounts that the group is contractually bound to pay in the future for acquisitions.
The amounts are determined by future results of the acquired businesses.
The provisions are determined with reference to the latest information available and are expected to be paid within one to five years of the balance sheet date.
Pension provisions are calculated from actuarial valuations of defined benefit plans or retirement benefit plans across the group.
The provisions will be satisfied over the current service lives of employees.
Other provisions consists of liabilities arising as a result of ongoing litigation or claims and other amounts that are not individually material to the group.
The amounts are expected to be paid within one to five years.
The deferred tax asset has been transferred to debtors see note 15.
40 TNS annual report 2002 18 Financial instruments Taylor Nelson Sofres operates a central treasury function providing services to the group.
It arranges loans and funding, invests surplus liquidity and manages financial risk.
Group Treasury is not a profit centre and no speculative trades are permitted or executed.
It operates within specific policies, agreed by the board, to control and monitor financial risk within the group and reports regularly to the board against these policy requirements.
Monthly reports to the board summarise new Treasury activity and measures of effectiveness.
Prudent and controlled use is made of financial instruments where appropriate, principally to reduce fluctuation in interest costs.
Forward exchange contracts and options are used to reduce fluctuation in exchange rates.
Transactions are effected with relationship banks as counter parties.
For the purposes of the disclosures which follow in this note, short term debtors and creditors and provisions which arise directly from the groups operations have been excluded as permitted under FRS 13.
The disclosures therefore focus on those financial instruments that play a significant medium to long term role in the financial risk profile of the group.
An analysis of the carrying value of all financial assets and liabilities is given in the fair value table on page 43.
Currency risk The groups principal exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise on the translation of overseas net assets and profits into sterling for accounting purposes.
The principal foreign currencies for the group are euro and US dollar.
The groups transactional foreign exchange exposure results mainly from sales and purchases of services between members of the group and is hedged by matching cash flows through a netting process.
Any minor residual exposures are covered on a short term basis by spot or forward exchange contracts.
Translation exposures arising on consolidation of the groups overseas net assets are minimised by broadly matching assets with borrowings in each major foreign currency.
This provides a hedge against currency fluctuations by matching currency loans with the underlying assets in the same currency.
The net movement in exchange reserves after the effect of hedging is a loss of 6.6m after taxation 2001 loss of 3m.
The risk of currency translation of profits denominated in foreign currency is partly mitigated by the use of option contracts.
In 2002 the financial effect of such items was immaterial.
Interest rate risk The group has an exposure to variations in interest rates on its borrowings and manages these by fixing debt through drawings of loans for extended periods and the use of interest rate hedging products such as swaps and forward rate agreements.
Group Treasury policy requires between 25% and 75% of borrowings to be maintained at fixed rates.
However, to benefit from the current low levels of interest rates, the board has approved an increase in the maximum level of fixed rate debt to 100%.
Cash held by the group was invested in short term cash deposits with relationship banks, at interest rates based on LIBID.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings.
Receipts and payments on such instruments are recognised on an accruals basis, over the life of the instrument.
A 1% rise in interest rates would effect the overall interest charge as follows: UK, 0.2m reduction 2001 0.1m reduction : US, 0.4m increase 2001 0.2m increase : euro, 0.2m increase 2001 0.5m increase.
Liquidity risk The group maintains a balance between certainty of funding and a flexible, cost effective structure.
Policy therefore dictates at least 20% capacity based on current debt profile be maintained.
At 31 December 2002, 250m 2001 250m of committed facilities and 60m 2001 58m of uncommitted facilities were available to the group.

com 43 Notes to the financial statements 19 Pensions and similar obligations The group operates a number of pension plans for its employees throughout the world, as well as complying with local laws and regulations relating to the payment of retirement benefits.
The assets of all pension plans are held separately from those of the group.
There were no prepayments or accruals in respect of any of the groups pension plans in the current or previous year.
UK The pension plans in the UK are primarily defined contribution plans and the groups contribution to such plans ranges from 4% to 8% of salary, rising with the age of employees.
There are two defined benefit plans which are closed to new members.
Both plans were valued by independent qualified actuaries in 2001 using the projected unit method.
The market value of assets of these plans was 3.6m, which represented 172% of the benefits which have accrued to members.
The principal assumptions used were a discount rate of 5.8% and that salary increases would be 3.0% per annum.
The cost in the year for defined contribution plans was 2.0m 2001 1.8m and for defined benefit plans was nil 2001 nil.
France Companies in France participate in state compulsory arrangements.
Regulations in France require that a lump sum is paid to employees on retirement, based on their final salary and the number of years service.
The provision required to meet these amounts was assessed by independent qualified actuaries in 2002 and full provision has been made for the 1.5m 2001 1.5m liability identified.
Movements in the liability are charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year they are identified.
US There are defined contribution pension plans in operation in the US, where the group undertakes to pay a contribution based on amounts paid by employees up to a maximum.
Costs are charged to the profit and loss account in the period they are incurred.
The group also operates a defined benefit plan.
The plan was valued by independent qualified actuaries in 2002 using the unit credit method.
The market value of assets of this plan was 1.2m, which represented 175% of the accrued benefits.
The cost in the year for defined contribution plans was 0.1m 2001 0.3m and for defined benefit plans was nil 2001 nil.
Netherlands The group operates a defined benefit plan in the Netherlands.
This plan is insured, although indexation increases to pensions in payment remain the responsibility of the company.
Provision for these indexation increases is made based on actuarial assessments made by independent qualified actuaries.
The cost in the year was 0.6m 2001 0.1m.
Other countries Where there are local requirements to provide lump sum payments at the time employees retire, provision has been made based on actuarial assessments.
FRS 17 disclosures On 30 November 2000, the Accounting Standards Board introduced a new standard, FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, replacing SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
FRS 17 is fully effective for periods ending on or after 1 January 2005, though disclosures are required in the transitional period.
The second year of disclosures is set out below.

Various group companies are party to legal actions and claims, the most significant of which are associated with property 0.8m and employment-related matters 3.0m.
Although there is uncertainty regarding the final outcome of these claims, the directors believe that adequate provision has been made for anticipated liabilities.
The group is also involved in various other legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business.
The directors believe that the outcome of these proceedings is uncertain but is unlikely to have a material effect on the groups financial position.
