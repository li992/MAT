Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
Set out below is a summary of the principal accounting policies adopted by the group.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts incorporate the accounts of the company, its subsidiary undertakings and undertakings where the group exercises dominant influence, after eliminating the effects of intra-group transactions.
Where the group or the company owns a non-controlling interest, held for the long term, in the equity share capital of another company or the equity of a partnership and is in a position to exercise significant influence over that company or partnership, the interest is equity accounted and the company or partnership treated as an associated undertaking.
Where the group or the company owns a non-controlling interest in the equity share capital of another company and is not in a position to exercise significant influence, it is held as an investment and stated in the balance sheet at cost.
The results of subsidiary and associated undertakings acquired during the year are incorporated from the effective date of acquisition.
Turnover Turnover represents income from subscriptions, advertising, sponsorship and delegate fees, net of value added tax.
Subscription revenues are recognized in the profit and loss account over the period of the subscription.
Revenue invoiced but relating to future periods is deferred and treated as deferred income in the balance sheet.
Derivatives and other financial instruments The group uses various financial instruments to manage financial risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency movements.
These include currency swaps, forward foreign currency contracts, interest rate swaps, caps and collars.
Currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts are used to convert foreign currency funds into sterling to meet sterling costs.
Realized exchange gains and losses are recognized in the profit and loss account.
The premium or discount on interest rate instruments is recognized as part of net interest payable over the period of the contract.
Interest rate swaps, caps and collars, currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts are not revalued to fair value or shown in the group balance sheet at the year end as all transactions derive from hedging activities.
Interest rate swaps are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction or, if hedged forward, at the rate of exchange of the related foreign exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Page 34 Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Notes to the Accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Profit and loss accounts for overseas subsidiary undertakings are converted into sterling at the average daily rate of exchange for the year, with the year end adjustment to closing rates taken to reserves.
Gains and losses arising on the retranslation of the net assets of overseas subsidiary undertakings at closing rates are shown as a movement on reserves together with exchange differences arising on related foreign currency borrowings used to finance the group investment in such overseas companies.
Changes in the sterling value of outstanding foreign currency loans which finance certain fixed assets are taken to reserves together with the differences arising on the translation of the related foreign currency denominated assets.
All other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Leased assets Where the group has entered into finance leases, the obligations to the lessor are shown as part of the borrowings and the corresponding assets are treated as fixed assets.
Leases are regarded as finance leases where their terms transfer to the lessee substantially all the benefits and burdens of ownership other than the right to legal title.
Depreciation is calculated in order to write-off the amounts capitalized over the estimated useful lives of the assets by equal annual installments.
Rentals payable under finance leases are apportioned between capital and interest, the interest portion being charged to the profit and loss account and the capital portion reducing the obligations to the lessor.
Other leases are regarded as operating leases whose rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line or other systematic rational basis as allowed by SSAP 21 Accounting for Leases and Hire Purchase Contracts.
Pensions Contributions to pension schemes in respect of current and past service, ex-gratia pensions, and cost of living adjustments to existing pensions are based on the advice of actuaries.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account when amounts become payable on the accruals basis.
For the defined benefit scheme there is no material difference at present between this basis and using a basis that spreads the expected cost of providing pensions over the employees working lives with the group.
The group currently accounts for pensions under SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
Under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, the group is required to provide additional disclosures relating to its pension schemes as set out in note 5.
Earnings per share The earnings per share calculations in note 10 follow the provisions of FRS 14 Earnings per Share, after calculating the dilution effect of the exercise of all ordinary share options granted by the company and excluding the ordinary shares held by the Euromoney Employees Share Ownership Trust.
Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Page 35 Notes to the Accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Depreciation Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is provided on the straight-line basis over their expected useful lives at the following rates per year: Motor vehicles 20% Office equipment 25% - 33% Short-term leasehold premises over term of lease Freehold premises 2% Goodwill The group capitalizes all goodwill arising on consolidation for those acquisitions made after October 1 1998.
Such goodwill is amortized to the profit and loss account over its estimated useful economic life on a straight line basis up to a maximum of 20 years.
Goodwill arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions made prior to that date remains eliminated against the profit and loss reserve, but is reinstated and charged to the profit and loss account on subsequent disposal of the business to which the goodwill relates.
Where the company has divisionalized the unincorporated businesses of its subsidiaries, the investment in the subsidiary then has the substance of goodwill and is reclassified accordingly.
Goodwill arising in these circumstances is not amortized in the company where the directors are of the view that the goodwill has an indefinite economic life, but is reviewed annually for impairment.
The non-amortization of goodwill represents a departure from the Companies Act 1985 but is necessary to give a true and fair view under the provisions of FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
It is not possible to quantify the impact of this departure, as it would depend on the life adopted.
As at September 30 2002 and 2001, the total of such goodwill was 7,100,000.
Deferred taxation Following the issue of FRS 19 Deferred Taxation, deferred taxation is now provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when the timing differences crystallize based on current tax rates and law.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences on un-remitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Following an updated review of FRS 19 timing differences arising on tax deductible goodwill written off to reserves are now recognized.
The company believes it appropriate to discount the resultant deferred tax liabilities over an indefinite period because the businesses are expected to be held for the long term.
The discounting effect on short-term timing differences is not significant.
The prior year effect of these changes is not material.
Closed businesses form part of continuing operations.

4 Exceptional profit loss on disposal closure of businesses In March 1999, the group sold its investment in 100% Design Limited for a cash consideration of 743,000 and a performance based deferred consideration.
During 2002, the group received the final element of the deferred consideration amounting to 1,772,000.
The group closed its Technology Media Limited business in the period which resulted in a goodwill write off of 239,000.
During the previous year the group closed three of its non-performing businesses resulting in an exceptional charge of 3,250,000.
5 Staff costs i Directors emoluments 2002 2001 000s 000s The emoluments of the directors of Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC were as follows: Fees 271 266 Management remuneration 5,502 5,646 Pension contributions 423 420 6,196 6,332 Details of directors remuneration are set out in the Report by the Board to Shareholders on Directors Remuneration on pages 19 to 26. ii Number of staff 2002 2001 Average Average United Kingdom 656 780 North America 531 629 Rest of World 398 471 1,585 1,880 Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Page 39 Notes to the Accounts continued 5 Staff costs continued iii Staff costs 2002 2001 000s 000s Salaries, wages and incentives 56,331 62,511 Social security costs 4,856 5,683 Pension contributions 1,029 1,066 62,216 69,260 iv Pension contributions The company operates the Euromoney Pension Plan in the UK and the Euromoney Institutional Investor Inc. Retirement Savings Plan in the US.
It also participates in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme, which is operated by Daily Mail and General Trust plc.
The pension charge for the year ended September 30 comprised: 2002 2001 000s 000s Harmsworth Pension Scheme 224 220 Euromoney Pension Plan 251 205 Private schemes 554 641 1,029 1,066 Harmsworth Pension Scheme The Harmsworth Pension Scheme is a defined benefit scheme providing service-related benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the scheme are held independently from the companys finances and are administered by a Trustee company.
Pension costs are assessed on the advice of an independent qualified actuary following triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
This scheme is no longer offered to new employees of the company.
A valuation of this scheme was carried out as at March 31 2001.
The assumptions having the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are shown in the following table: Price inflation 2.5% p. a.
The contribution rate paid by employees is 5% of pensionable salaries and the companys cash contribution is 12% of pensionable salaries.
The surplus identified from the last valuation of the scheme will be amortized over a period of 11 years using the straight line method.
The pension cost to the company of this scheme over the estimated average service life of employees is 10.4% of pensionable salaries.
The next valuation of the scheme will be carried out as at March 31 2004.
The effect of UITF 6 Accounting for Post-Retirement Benefits other than Pensions is not material.
Page 40 Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Notes to the Accounts continued 5 Staff costs continued FRS 17 Retirement Benefits The company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme since the scheme includes members from other companies within the Daily Mail and General Trust group.
The ratio of assets to liabilities in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme, calculated according to the requirements of FRS 17, was 80% at the year end 2001: 102%.
If calculated on this basis and reflecting current market conditions, it is anticipated that the pension charge by the company would be around 24% of pensionable salaries for 2003.
However, an interim valuation of this scheme as at March 31 2002 on the normal funding basis indicated only a marginal reduction in solvency compared with a year earlier.
Following this review, the actuary confirmed that there was no particular need to adjust the company cash contribution rate of 12%.
However this position will be closely monitored going forward.
Euromoney Pension Plan The Euromoney Pension Plan is a defined contribution scheme under which contributions are paid by the employer and employees.
The assets of the plan are invested under trust with Scottish Widows in funds selected by members and are held independently from the companys finances.
Overseas Pension Plans Institutional Investor, Inc. contributes to a 401k savings and investment plan for its employees which is administered by an independent investment provider.
Employees are able to contribute up to 15% of salary with the company matching up to 50% of the employee contributions, up to 5% of salary.
Stakeholder Pensions The company provides access to a stakeholder pension plan for relevant employees who are not eligible for other pension schemes operated by the group.

The current tax charge for the year is different from 30% of profit before tax for the reasons set out in the following reconciliation: 2002 2001 000s 000s as restated Profit on ordinary activities before tax 20,646 13,671 Tax at 30% 6,194 4,101 Factors affecting credit charge: UK goodwill amortization 1,838 1,785 Non-taxable items and additional deductible UK items 1,836 US goodwill amortization 3,184 1,250 US state taxes 270 524 Disallowable expenditure 2,590 764 Depreciation in excess of capital allowances 20 56 Lower rates of tax on overseas profits 149 531 Utilization of losses brought forward 532 169 Overseas losses for which no relief is currently available 366 Release of prior years tax provisions 6,754 Over provisions in prior years 68 621 Current tax credit charge or the year 1,611 5,025 see note 1.
Page 42 Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Notes to the Accounts continued 8 Tax on profit on ordinary activities continued Included within the corporation tax credit charge for the year is a tax credit of nil 2001: 121,000 in respect of exceptional items shown in the profit and loss account after operating profit see note 4.
The exceptional items in 2002 do not give rise to any tax charge or credit due to the availability of brought forward capital losses and the non-deductible nature of UK goodwill amortization on share acquisitions.
The tax credit in 2001 arises on closure costs in relation to UK businesses.
The release of prior year tax provisions of 6,754,000 relates to tax provisions no longer required following agreement of certain open issues with the relevant tax authorities in relation to the groups US acquisition structure.

These comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the group which are not denominated in the operating currency of the operating unit involved, but exclude certain non-sterling borrowings which are matched by equivalent group assets or are treated as hedges of net investments in overseas operations.
The amounts shown take into account the effect of currency swaps, forward contracts and other derivatives entered into to manage these exposures.
Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Page 51 Notes to the Accounts continued 18 Treasury continued As at September 30 2002 these exposures were as follows: Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities Sterling US dollars Other Total 000s 000s 000s 000s Functional currency: Sterling 6,165 1,070 7,235 US Dollar 167 167 Other 70 836 7 773 Total 97 7,001 1,077 8,175 As at September 30 2001 these exposures were as follows: Net foreign currency monetary assets Sterling US dollars Other Total 000s 000s 000s 000s Functional currency: Sterling 10,457 1,020 11,477 US Dollar 72 72 Other 764 422 1,186 Total 72 11,221 1,442 12,735 Fair values of financial assets and liabilities Set out below is a comparison of book values to fair values of all the groups financial assets and liabilities as at September 30 2002.
Market values have been used to determine the fair value of all swaps, caps and foreign currency contracts.

These instruments take the form of forward exchange rate contracts to sell US dollars in exchange for sterling to meet the excess of sterling costs over sterling revenues as well as dividends paid to shareholders.
The group also uses interest rate swaps and interest rate cap and collar derivatives to minimize interest rate fluctuations.
On September 25 2002 the group entered into a tax equalization swap to hedge the cash effect of tax on unrealized foreign currency gains and losses on the companys net dollar liabilities.
This was achieved by a sale of US$14 million in exchange for sterling maturing on March 27 2003.
In the previous year the group hedged this same risk by entering into a tax equalization swap achieved by a sale of US$11 million in exchange for sterling maturing on September 27 2002.

A deferred tax asset of 1,182,000 2001: nil has been recognized in respect of depreciation in excess of UK capital allowances and other short-term timing differences.
The directors are of the opinion that based on recent and forecast trading, the level of profits in future years are more likely than not to be sufficient to enable the asset to be recovered.
A deferred tax asset of 7,800,000 has not been recognized in respect of overseas tax losses 2001: 5,500,000 as there is insufficient certainty in current global markets to be able to say that the group will be more likely than not to generate sufficient suitable overseas taxable profits within the immediate future.
The group is able to obtain tax relief in the US for the cost of goodwill arising on its acquisitions of some businesses.
In certain cases the goodwill was written off to reserves under the transitional rules set out in FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
Utilization of the available tax relief in the US gives rise to a timing difference as set out above.
The potential timing difference will only reverse on a sale of the relevant businesses.
As the relevant businesses are considered core to the group there is currently no intention to sell them.
The potential reversal is therefore so far into the future that, after discounting, the potential liability becomes insignificant.
The effect of discounting the groups other deferred tax assets and liabilities is not material.
