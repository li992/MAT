This investigation was prompted by the filing of a qui tam complaint by a private party in 1997 and involves allegations of improper submissions of claims to the Medicare and Medicaid programmes.
The Company and federal and state authorities are in the process of negotiating a potential settlement of the civil and criminal claims at issue in the investigation.
As a result, although no final agreement has been concluded, the Company believes it appropriate to accrue $350m to cover estimated settlement costs.
The integration and synergy programme initiated in 1999 was completed during 2001, with further exceptional charges of $202m 2000 $322m, principally for manpower related costs, IT costs, and contractors.
The Group took an exceptional charge of $137m in 2000 to provide for impairment of its 50% interest in the seeds company Advanta BV, including a write off of $49m of related goodwill previously taken to reserves.
The costs related to the demerger of Zeneca Agrochemicals and formation of Syngenta AG included advisors fees, the costs of separating computer systems, employee related costs and environmental and occupational health provisions.
The exceptional charge was reduced by the gain on disposal of products whose sale was required by the competition authorities as a condition of the creation of Syngenta AG.
Tax relief on the net exceptional costs was more than offset by the provision for capital taxes arising out of the restructuring of the business in preparation for demerger, resulting in a net tax cost of $50m.

UK and overseas taxation has been provided at current rates on the profits earned for the periods covered by the Group financial statements.
To the extent that dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are expected to result in additional taxes, appropriate amounts have been provided.
No deferred tax has been provided for unremitted earnings of Group companies overseas as these are, in the main, considered permanently employed in the businesses of these companies and, in the case of joint ventures and associates, the taxes would not be material.
Cumulative unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and related undertakings totalled approximately $9,141m at 31 December 2002.
Unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas taxes and or UK taxation after allowing for double taxation relief if they were to be distributed as dividends.

Statement of total recognised gains and losses In certain circumstances, tax charges or credits on currency differences on borrowings are taken to reserves via the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The tax charge on such currency translation differences amounted to $2m in 2002 2001 $6m, 2000 $42m, and has been reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Factors affecting future tax charges As a group involved in worldwide operations, AstraZeneca is subject to several factors that may affect future tax charges, principally the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, transfer pricing policies and tax levels imposed.

com 83 20 Financial instruments A discussion of the Groups objective, policy and strategy in respect of risk management and the use of financial instruments is included in the Financial Review on pages 30 to 43.
The following disclosures exclude all short term trade related debtors and creditors.
Interest rate risks of financial assets and liabilities The interest rate profile, after taking account of interest and currency swaps, of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group as at 31 December 2002 was: Financial Weighted Weighted assets liabilities average average on which fixed period for Floating Fixed no interest is interest which rate rate rate paid received Total rate is fixed $m $m $m $m % Years Financial liabilities US dollar 782 8 126 916 12.8 9.6 Sterling Euro Other 35 19 54 6.3 2.2 817 27 126 970 Financial assets US dollar 4,354 4,354 Euro 71 71 Sterling 114 46 160 SEK 33 33 Other 70 22 92 4,642 68 4,710 Financial liabilities on which no interest is paid comprise deferred payments due relating to the reacquisition of certain marketing rights.
The floating rate financial liabilities comprise largely of fixed rate debt that has been swapped into floating rate debt.
One long dated $300m USD bond reverts back to a fixed rate in 2009.
The financial liabilities also include $202m of short term bank borrowings and overdrafts, bearing interest at rates fixed by reference to local interbank rates.
Financial assets on which no interest is received comprise equity investments held by the Group.
The financial assets principally comprise cash on overnight deposit and short term investments with an average maturity of 67 days.
These include deposits where the interest rate is fixed until maturity but, as the original maturity is less than one year, they are classified as floating rate financial instruments.
The benchmark rates for financial assets are the LIBID rate for euro and US dollar liquidity balances and the average Federal Funds effective rate for US dollar overnight balances.
Financial assets include $46m of other fixed asset investments on which no interest is received.
com 84 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 20 Financial instruments continued Currency exposures 100% of the Groups transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three months, are hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
As a result, as at 31 December 2002, there were no material monetary assets or liabilities in currencies other than the functional currencies of the Group companies concerned, having taken into account the effect of forward exchange currency contracts that have been utilised to match foreign currency exposures.
Additionally, approximately 50% of forecast future foreign currency transaction exposures extending for 12 months are selectively hedged.
The principal currency exposures sterling, Swedish kronor, euro, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars and yen are hedged using a mixture of purchased currency options and forward foreign exchange contracts.
As at 31 December 2002 the Group held forward and option contracts to hedge the following forecast foreign currency transaction exposures: 2002 2001 Hedged Hedged amount amount $m $m Sterling payables 1,316 1,324 SEK payables 503 401 Euro receivables 713 591 Yen receivables 153 89 AUD receivables 81 73 CAD receivables 168 128 Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, other than short term creditors such as trade creditors and accruals, at 31 December 2002 was as follows: 2002 2001 Analysis by year of repayment Loans Other Total Loans Other Total $m $m $m $m $m $m After five years 308 308 314 314 From five to four years 13 13 14 14 From four to three years 9 9 From three to two years 7 7 From two to one years 7 7 291 120 411 Due after more than one year 328 328 635 120 755 Due within one year 314 328 642 107 356 463 642 328 970 742 476 1,218 Other financial liabilities comprise deferred payments to re-acquire certain distribution rights, short term borrowings and finance leases.
Borrowing facilities The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it, the majority of which offer a currency option of US dollars, euros or sterling.
Unused short term credit facilities both committed and uncommitted totalled approximately $0.5bn at 31 December 2002.
Included in this were undrawn committed facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date as follows: 2002 2001 $m $m Expiring in one year or less 75 375 Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years Expiring in more than two years 75 375 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F 2002 Financial Statements www.
com 85 20 Financial instruments continued Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying values and fair values of all the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities as at 31 December 2002 and 2001.

The Group has a standby letter of credit covering these financial liabilities which is collateralised by high grade government securities.
The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments are as follows: a.
Short term investments the fair value of listed investments is based on year end quoted market prices.
For unlisted investments carrying values approximate fair value.
Fixed asset investments excluding equity investments in joint ventures and associates the fair value of listed investments is based on year end quoted market prices.
c. Loans the fair value of publicly traded debt is based on year end quoted market prices: the fair value of floating rate debt is nominal value, as market to market differences would be minimal given frequency of resets: the fair value of remaining debt is estimated using appropriate zero coupon valuation techniques based on rates current at year end.
d. Forward foreign exchange contracts the Group has forward foreign exchange contracts to sell currency for the purpose of hedging nondollar commercial transaction exposures which existed at the date of the balance sheet and to hedge anticipated, but not firmly committed, non-dollar commercial transactions for 2003.
The majority of the contracts for existing transactions had a maturity of six months or less from year end.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is based on market forward foreign exchange rates at year end.
e. Foreign currency option contracts the Group has foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated, but not firmly committed, nondollar commercial transactions for 2003.
The fair value of option contracts is estimated using Black-Scholes valuation techniques as adapted by Garman and Kohlhagen.
f. Interest rate and cross-currency swaps AstraZeneca uses interest rate and cross-currency swaps to hedge the Groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange movements on borrowings in accordance with a formal risk management strategy.
The fair value is estimated using appropriate zero coupon valuation techniques based on rates current at year end.
com 86 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 20 Financial instruments continued The above financial instruments are subject to credit and market risk.
AstraZeneca contains credit risk through the use of counterparty and product specific credit limits and by ongoing review procedures.
All financial instruments except the letter of credit are transacted with commercial banks and, in line with standard market practice, are not backed with cash collateral.
The notional principal values of off balance sheet financial instruments do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and are not a measure of the credit risk to the Group of these instruments.
The credit risk of these instruments is limited to the positive fair values of such contracts.
Market risk is the sensitivity of the value of financial instruments to changes in related currency and interest rates.
The Group is not exposed to material market risk because gains and losses on the derivative financial instruments are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying assets, liabilities and transactions subject to hedge.
Hedges The Groups policy is to hedge 100% of transactional currency exposures and 50% of forecast future transaction exposures using forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts.
It also uses cross-currency and interest rate swaps to manage its borrowings profile.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are as follows: Total net Gains Losses gains $m $m $m Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 January 2002 54 4 50 Gains and losses arising in previous years that were recognised in 2002 31 4 27 Gains and losses arising in previous years that were not recognised in 2002 23 23 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 31 December 2002 108 108 Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2003 56 56 Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2004 or later 52 52 21 Provisions for liabilities and charges Environmental, litigation Integration Employee and other Deferred and synergies benefits provisions taxation Total restated restated $m $m $m $m $m At 1 January 2001 as previously reported 25 754 204 85 1,068 Prior year adjustment page 62 549 549 25 754 204 634 1,617 Profit and loss account 156 103 14 329 602 Net amounts paid or becoming current 148 306 55 509 Acquisitions 1 1 Other movements, including exchange 18 23 15 55 111 At 31 December 2001 restated 15 529 148 908 1,600 Profit and loss account 89 43 305 437 Net amounts paid or becoming current 11 279 31 321 Other movements, including exchange 10 34 16 3 57 At 31 December 2002 14 373 176 1,210 1,773 Employee benefit provisions comprise pension, post-retirement and other employee benefit provisions.

com 93 32 Post-retirement benefits Pensions Background The Group continues to account for pension costs in its primary Financial Statements in accordance with the UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
In addition, disclosures have been presented below in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard No.
The Company and most of its subsidiaries offer retirement plans which cover the majority of employees in the Group.
Many of these plans are defined contribution where the company contribution and resulting profit and loss account charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
However, several plans, mainly in the UK, US and Sweden, are defined benefit, where benefits are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
All of the major plans are funded through legally separate trustee administered funds.
The major defined benefit plans, apart from the Swedish plan, have been closed to new entrants since 2000.
The cash funding of the plans, which may from time to time involve special payments, is designed, in consultation with independent qualified actuaries, to ensure that present and future contributions should be sufficient to meet future liabilities.
SSAP 24 The cost of defined benefit plan pensions in a year can notionally be divided into the regular cost and variations from the regular cost.
Under SSAP 24 the regular cost is based on actuarial assumptions and charged to the profit and loss account in the year it is paid whilst any variations, which arise where the experience of the scheme varies from the assumptions made by the actuary, are charged or credited over the estimated remaining service lives of the employees.
Costs of defined contribution plan pensions are charged to the profit and loss account immediately.
On these bases, the total pension cost for the Group under SSAP 24 for 2002 was $220m 2001 $194m, 2000 $184m.
In the Group balance sheet at 31 December 2002, accrued pension costs included in other creditors amounted to $53m 2001 $76m : prepaid pension costs of $114m 2001 $47m are included in debtors.
Provisions for unfunded pension obligations, included in provisions, amounted to $235m 2001 $357m.
With regard to the Groups main UK defined benefit fund, the latest actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 March 2002 and the pension cost assessed using the projected unit credit method.
The key accounting assumptions for the purposes of SSAP 24 were that, against a background long term UK price inflation averaging 2.5% pa, investment returns would average 6.5% pa, salary increases 4.3% pa and pension increases 2.5% pa.
The market value of the funds assets at the valuation date was 2,161m $3,477m equivalent, representing 94.6% of the liabilities using these assumptions.
The regular cost for accounting purposes equates to 18.8% of pensionable salaries.
At the same time, the valuation was carried out for ongoing funding purposes, with assumptions slightly more conservative than those used for SSAP 24 purposes.
The market value of the funds assets at the valuation date represent 90.1% of the liabilities on a funding basis.
The Company has indicated to the trustee of the UK fund its intention to target a solvency ratio of 91% following the 2003 actuarial valuation, with a longer term aim of restoring solvency over a period of around 15 years.
Any cash contributions made to the fund would be treated as a prepayment and taken into account in the actuarially assessed contributions to the fund charged to the profit and loss account.
The US defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2002 when plan obligations were estimated to amount to $812m and plan assets were $665m.
The US typically makes contributions to provide for plan benefit deficits on a regular basis.
PRI Pensionstjnst AB, a joint company for Swedish industry, administers the Swedish plan for salaried employees and Alecta establishes benefit levels and actuarial assumptions.
During 2002 AstraZeneca AB has established separate trustee administered funds to support its pension liabilities: prior to 2002 the plan was unfunded.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions In the US, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, AstraZenecas employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired employees.
Some 6,920 retired employees and covered dependants currently benefit from these provisions and some 13,383 current employees will be eligible on retirement.
AstraZeneca accrues for the present value of such retiree obligations over the working life of the employee.
The cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions for the Group in 2002 was $22m 2001 $16m, 2000 $25m.
Provisions and creditors set aside for the benefit obligations at 31 December 2002 amounted to $32m 2001 $248m, 2000 $233m.
Other than this provision there were plan assets amounting to $133m in the US at 31 December 2002.
These benefit plans have been included in the disclosure of post-retirement benefits under FRS17.
com 94 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 32 Post-retirement benefits continued FRS 17 Full implementation of FRS 17 had originally been intended for accounting periods ending on or after 22 June 2003 but has been deferred by the Accounting Standards Board until accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2005.
However, the requirements for disclosure under FRS 17 between its issue and full implementation dates remain and this information is set out below.
When fully adopted, the objective of FRS 17 is to reflect the fair value of post-retirement plan assets and liabilities and associated charges in the Financial Statements.
FRS 17 specifies how key assumptions should be formulated and applied: these assumptions are often different to the funding bases established by the pension funds trustees or actuaries.
The accounting requirements of FRS 17 are broadly as follows: Post-retirement scheme assets are valued at market values at the balance sheet date: Post-retirement scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of equivalent term and currency to the liability: and The movement in the scheme surplus deficit will be split between operating charges and financing items in the profit and loss account and, in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, actuarial gains and losses.
Financial assumptions Qualified independent actuaries have updated the actuarial valuations of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group to 31 December 2002.
The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long term nature of the scheme, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
These assumptions were as follows: 2002 2001 Rest of Rest of UK Group UK Group Inflation assumption 2.2% 2.1% 2.5% 2.7% Rate of increase in salaries 4.0% 4.0% 4.3% 4.6% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.2% 0.5% 2.5% 0.5% Discount rate 5.6% 5.8% 5.8% 6.2% Long term rate of return expected at 31 December Equities 8.3% 8.4% 7.6% 9.7% Bonds 4.9% 6.1% 5.3% 6.1% Others 3.7% 3.6% 4.0% 8.7% AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F 2002 Financial Statements www.
com 95 32 Post-retirement benefits continued Post-retirement scheme deficit The post-retirement scheme deficit set out below under FRS 17 is as if this standard were fully applied.
However, under the current accounting methodology SSAP 24 there are prepayments and provisions including deferred tax within the balance sheet at 31 December 2002 that would offset the effect on net assets of this deficit in the event of a restatement under FRS 17.
The assets and liabilities of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group at 31 December 2002 as calculated in accordance with FRS 17 are shown below.
The fair values of the schemes assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present value of the schemes liabilities is derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are thus inherently uncertain.
If FRS 17 had been adopted for the year ended 31 December 2002 the Groups reported net assets see page 60 would be reduced by $637m 5.7% to $10,589m.
Further explanation of this adjustment is included below: Value at 31 December 2002 Value at 31 December 2001 Rest of Rest of UK Group Total UK Group Total $m $m $m $m $m $m Scheme assets Equities 1,186 708 1,894 1,255 409 1,664 Bonds 2,097 464 2,561 1,831 214 2,045 Others 75 102 177 59 131 190 Total fair value of assets 3,358 1,274 4,632 3,145 754 3,899 Present value of scheme liabilities 4,200 1,665 5,865 3,569 1,472 5,041 Deficit in the scheme 842 391 1,233 424 718 1,142 Related deferred tax asset 253 151 404 127 248 375 Net post-retirement deficit under FRS 17 589 240 829 297 470 767 Adjustments for assets and provisions under SSAP 24 Prepayment, net of related deferred tax 177 56 Accrual, net of deferred tax 36 143 Provision, net of deferred tax 333 296 Adjusted post-retirement deficit, net of related deferred tax 637 384 Net assets as currently disclosed restated see page 60 11,226 9,629 Net assets as adjusted if FRS 17 were fully adopted 10,589 9,245 Profit and loss account disclosures On full compliance with FRS 17, on the basis of the above assumptions, the amounts that would have been charged to the consolidated profit and loss account and statement of total recognised gains and losses in respect of defined benefit schemes for the year ended 31 December 2002 are set out below: Rest of UK Group Total $m $m $m Operating profit Current service cost 100 69 169 Past service costs 2 8 6 Settlement and curtailment 24 24 Total operating charge 102 37 139 Finance expense Expected return on post-retirement scheme assets 197 52 249 Interest on post-retirement scheme liabilities 210 98 308 Net return 13 46 59 Loss before taxation 115 83 198 Consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses Actual return less expected return on the post-retirement schemes assets 301 91 392 Experience losses gains arising on the post-retirement schemes liabilities 108 8 100 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the post-retirement schemes liabilities 58 27 31 Actuarial loss recognised 351 110 461 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F 2002 Financial Statements www.

The Directors believe that, together with the basic salary system, the Groups employee incentive schemes provide competitive and marketrelated packages to motivate employees.
They should also align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, as a whole, through long term share ownership in the Company.
The Groups current UK, Swedish and US schemes are described below: other arrangements apply elsewhere.
The AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan Employees of participating AstraZeneca UK companies are invited to participate in this bonus plan which rewards good performance at corporate, function business and individual team levels.
Depending upon performance and upon which level it is measured, bonuses may be paid partly in the form of free Ordinary Shares in the Company under the Inland Revenue approved AstraZeneca All-Employee Share Plan and up to a maximum annual value of 3,000 and partly in cash.
A tax efficient share retention scheme, under which employees leave their bonus shares in trust for three to five years, forms part of the All-Employee Share Plan.
In 2002, for the first time the Company offered UK employees the opportunity to buy Partnership Shares Ordinary Shares under the All-Employee Share Plan.
Employees may invest up to 125 per month over a 12 month accumulation period and purchase Partnership Shares in the Company with the total proceeds at the end of the period.
The purchase price for the shares is the lower of the price at the beginning or the end of the 12 month period.
A tax efficient share retention scheme is also available in respect of Partnership Shares.
At the Companys AGM in 2002, shareholders approved the issue of new shares for the purposes of the All-Employee Share Plan.
The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme This scheme is a performance bonus scheme for Directors and senior employees who do not participate in the AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan.
Annual bonuses are paid in cash and reflect both corporate and individual performance measures.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to reduce or withhold bonuses if business performance falls sufficiently short of expectations in any year such as to make the payment of bonuses inappropriate.
The AstraZeneca Savings-Related Share Option Scheme UK employees may make regular monthly savings contributions over a three or five year period and may apply for options to acquire AstraZeneca shares.
Further details are set out below.
The AstraZeneca Share Option Plan This is a share option plan for employees of participating AstraZeneca Group companies which was approved by shareholders at the Companys AGM in 2000.
The first grant of options occurred in August 2000.
The main grant of options in 2002 under the plan was in March, with a further, smaller grant in August.
The Remuneration Committee sets the policy for the Companys operation of the plan.
Sweden In Sweden an all employee performance bonus plan is in operation.
The plan rewards good performance at corporate, function and individual team level.
Bonuses for corporate and function performance are always paid in the form of AstraZeneca Ordinary Shares.
Bonuses for individual team performance may be paid in Ordinary Shares or in cash, at the employees discretion.
Existing Ordinary Shares are used to pay bonuses awarded under the plan.
These are purchased in the market.
They must be left in trust for three years.
The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme and the AstraZeneca Share Option Plan both operate in respect of relevant AstraZeneca employees in Sweden.
US In the US, there are four senior staff incentive schemes, under which either AstraZeneca ADSs or stock appreciation rights related to AstraZeneca ADSs are awarded to participants.
There are currently approximately 146 participants in these schemes.
AstraZeneca ADSs necessary to satisfy the awards under these schemes are purchased in the market and no subscriptions for new Ordinary Shares have been involved.
The AstraZeneca Share Option Plan operates in respect of relevant AstraZeneca employees in the US.
com 98 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 33 Employee costs and share option plans for employees continued Share Option Plans At 31 December 2002, there were options outstanding under the Zeneca 1993 Senior Staff Share Option Scheme, the Zeneca 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme, the Astra Shareholder Value Incentive Plan, the AstraZeneca Savings-Related Share Option Scheme and the AstraZeneca Share Option Plan.
1 Summary of the Zeneca 1993 Senior Staff Share Option Scheme The Zeneca 1993 Senior Staff Share Option Scheme was introduced at the time of the demerger of Zeneca from ICI in 1993.
The last date for the grant of options was 19 May 1994 and the scheme was replaced by the Zeneca 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme.
2 Summary of the Zeneca 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme The Zeneca 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme was introduced in 1994.
The last date for the grant of options was 16 March 2000 and the scheme has been replaced by the AstraZeneca Share Option Plan.
Options granted under the 1994 scheme will normally be exercisable between three and 10 years following grant, provided the relevant performance condition has been satisfied.
Options may be satisfied by the issue of new shares or by existing shares purchased in the market.
Options will not normally be exercisable unless a performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee has been satisfied.
The performance condition is that earnings per share must grow by at least the increase in the UK Retail Price Index over three years plus 3% per annum.
Satisfaction of this condition is tested annually by reference to the audited financial statements.
Once the condition is satisfied in respect of any rolling three year period beginning no earlier than the end of the financial year prior to the grant of the option, then it need not be satisfied again in respect of that option.
The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance conditions at intervals to ensure that they continue to be appropriate.
3 Summary of the Astra Shareholder Value Incentive Plan In 1996, Astra established a stock option plan for some 100 Astra employees in key senior positions.
The plan is no longer used for the grant of options and has been superseded by the AstraZeneca Share Option Plan.
On completion of the merger with Zeneca, options in Astra shares granted under the plan were replaced by options to acquire a number of AstraZeneca shares based on the exchange ratio used in the exchange offers used to effect the AstraZeneca merger.
The ratio of AstraZeneca options granted in respect of former Astra options was 0.5045 AstraZeneca options for each Astra option held and the table shown on page 100 has been restated throughout accordingly.
4 Summary of the AstraZeneca Savings-Related Share Option Scheme Eligibility UK resident employees of participating AstraZeneca companies are automatically eligible to participate.
Grant of options Invitations to apply for options may be issued within six weeks after the announcement by the Company of its results for any period and at other times in circumstances considered to be exceptional by the Directors.
No invitations may be issued later than 10 years after the approval of the scheme by shareholders.
Options may only be granted to employees who enter into UK Inland Revenue approved savings contracts with the savings body nominated by the Company, under which monthly savings of a fixed amount currently not less than 5 nor more than 250 are made over a period of three or five years.
The number of shares over which an option is granted will be such that the total amount payable on its exercise will be the proceeds on maturity of the related savings contract.

Sales of the products to which these milestones relate could give rise to additional payments, contingent upon the sales levels achieved.
Guarantees and contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, for which no security has been given, are not expected to result in any material financial loss.
Commitments AstraZeneca is required to pay approximately $800m over at least a five-year period which commenced in 1999, under the terms of an agreement with Schering-Plough.
With effect from 1 January 1999, in connection with this agreement, AstraZeneca obtained a stand-by letter of credit in the amount of $608m.
This letter of credit is collateralised by high-grade government securities which are not available to AstraZeneca to the extent of the outstanding balance of the letter of credit.
The amount outstanding under the letter of credit is automatically reduced with each payment made by AstraZeneca to Schering-Plough.
Under the terms of this agreement AstraZeneca reacquired the rights to market omeprazole under the Losec trade mark and felodipine under the Prevex and Perfudal trade marks in Italy and Spain.
The total discounted liability and associated asset were recognised in 1999.
Payments under this agreement in 2002 totalled approximately $146m.
The final payment will be made in 2003.
In 1998, Astra and Merck & Co. Inc restructured their joint venture the restructuring which had been established some years earlier for the purpose of selling and marketing certain Astra products in the US.
Under the terms of the 1998 restructuring, the merger between Astra and Zeneca in 1999 triggered two one-time payments from AstraZeneca to Merck: a Lump Sum Payment of $809m, which was charged to profit and loss account, as a result of which Merck relinquished any rights to Zeneca products: and an Advance Payment of $967m.
This Advance Payment was calculated as the then net present value of $2.8bn discounted from 2008 to the date of payment at a rate of 13% per annum and led Merck to relinquish any rights to future Astra products with no existing or pending US patents at the time of the merger.
AstraZeneca makes ongoing payments to Merck based on sales of certain AstraZeneca products in the US the contingent payments on the agreement products as well as certain other partnership distributions, the latter of which are not material to the Group.
As a result of the 1999 merger, these contingent payments excluding those in respect of Prilosec and Nexium are subject to defined minimum amounts ranging from $125m to $225m between 2002 and 2007.
Payments under these arrangements have exceeded the minimum level in 2002.
The terms of the 1998 restructuring also provide for the following events: Partial Redemption First Option Second Option Partial Redemption In 2008, there will be a partial redemption of Mercks limited partnership interest which will end Mercks rights to contingent payments in respect of certain of the agreement products by distribution to Merck of an amount calculated as a multiple of the previous three years contingent payments on the relevant products, plus $750m.
First Option In 2008 a calculation will be made of the Appraised Value, being the net present value of the future contingent payments in respect of all other agreement products not covered by the Partial Redemption other than Prilosec and Nexium.
Payment of this amount to Merck in 2008 is, however, contingent on Mercks exercise of the First Option.
Exercise of the First Option will require AstraZeneca to re-purchase Mercks interest in these products.
Should Merck not exercise this option in 2008, AstraZeneca may exercise it in 2010 for a sum equal to the 2008 Appraised Value.
If neither Merck nor AstraZeneca exercise the option, the contingent payment arrangements in respect of these agreement products will continue and the Appraised Value will not be paid.
com 102 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 34 Assets pledged, commitments and contingent liabilities continued In addition, in 2008 there will be a true up of the Advance Payment.
The calculation of this will be based on a multiple of the previous three years contingent payments in respect of all the agreement products with the exception of Prilosec and Nexium, plus other defined amounts, which are then reduced by the Appraised Value whether paid or not, the Partial Redemption and the Advance Payment.
This could result in a further payment by AstraZeneca to Merck or a payment by Merck to AstraZeneca.
The precise amount of settlements with Merck under the Partial Redemption and the First Option cannot be determined at this time, as some of the payments are based on calculations based on sales between 2005 and 2007, and another is contingent upon Merck exercising the First Option.
However, if Merck does exercise this option, the combined effect will involve a minimum amount payable to Merck in 2008 of approximately $4.7bn.
If AstraZeneca exercises this option in 2010, the combined effect will involve a minimum aggregate payable to Merck in 2008 and 2010 of approximately $4.7bn.
Finally, in 2008 Merck will repay to AstraZeneca a loan in the amount of $1.4bn made at the time of the restructuring.
Second Option A Second Option exists whereby AstraZeneca has the option to re-purchase Mercks interests in Prilosec and Nexium in the US.
This option is exercisable by AstraZeneca two years after the exercise of the First Option in either 2008 or 2010.
Exercise of the Second Option by AstraZeneca at a later date is also provided for in 2017 or if combined annual sales of the two products fall below a minimum amount provided, in each case only so long as the First Option has been exercised.
The exercise price for the Second Option is the fair value of these product rights as determined at the time of exercise.
If the Second Option is exercised, Merck will have no further rights to contingent payments from AstraZeneca.
Environmental costs and liabilities The Groups expenditure on environmental protection, including both capital and revenue items, relates to costs which are necessary for meeting current good practice standards and regulatory requirements for processes and products.
They are an integral part of normal ongoing expenditure for maintaining the Groups manufacturing capacity and product ranges and are not separated from overall operating and development costs.
There are no known changes in environmental, regulatory or other requirements resulting in material changes to the levels of expenditure for 2000, 2001 or 2002.
In addition to expenditure for meeting current and foreseen environmental protection requirements, the Group incurs substantial costs in investigating and cleaning up land and groundwater contamination.
In particular, AstraZeneca has environmental liabilities at some currently or formerly owned, leased and third party sites in the US and Europe.
AstraZeneca, or its indemnitees, have been named under US legislation the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended as potentially responsible parties PRP in respect of 32 sites although AstraZeneca expects to be indemnified against liabilities associated with nine of these sites by the seller or owner of the businesses associated with such sites and, where appropriate, actively participates in or monitors the clean-up activities at sites in respect of which it is a PRP.
Stauffer Management Company, a subsidiary of AstraZeneca established in 1987 to own and manage certain assets of Stauffer Chemical Company which was acquired that year, has identified 28 sites including 18 for which an AstraZeneca indemnitee has been named a PRP for which it may have responsibility that will, in aggregate, require significant expenditure on clean-up and monitoring.
Liabilities are generally more likely to crystallise where a contaminated site is to be sold, its use changed or where a regulatory authority imposes a particular remedial measure.
Costs of these liabilities may be offset by amounts recovered from third parties, such as previous owners of the sites in question or through insurance.
The future level of investigation and clean up costs will depend on a number of factors, including the nature and extent of any contamination that may ultimately be found to exist, the need for and type of any remedial work to be undertaken and the standards required by applicable current and future environmental laws and regulations and the number and financial viability of other PRPs.
The relative importance of these factors varies significantly from site to site.
Many sites are at different stages in the regulatory process or at different stages in the process of evaluating environmental damage or alternative remediation methods.
It is therefore difficult to form meaningful ranges of estimates for such costs.
AstraZeneca had provisions at 31 December 2002 in respect of such costs in accordance with the accounting policies on page 64.
Although there can be no assurance, management believes that, taking account of these provisions, the costs of addressing currently identified environmental obligations, as AstraZeneca currently views those obligations, is unlikely to impair materially AstraZenecas financial position.
Such contingent costs, to the extent that they exceed applicable provisions, could have a material adverse effect on AstraZenecas results of operations for the relevant period.
com 103 Legal proceedings Losec Prilosec omeprazole In June 1997, the German Federal Patent Court declared invalid a previously granted supplementary protection certificate which extended protection for omeprazole, the active ingredient contained in Losec, from 1999 to 2003.
The decision was appealed and on 1 February 2000, at AstraZenecas request, the German Supreme Court decided to refer the case to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling.
The court heard the case on 8 November 2001 and its decision is pending.
The case does not involve any financial claims.
In March 2000, the German Federal Patent Court declared that AstraZenecas formulation patent for omeprazole was invalid.
The decision has been appealed to the German Supreme Court.
As a consequence, all pending infringement actions in Germany have been stayed awaiting the outcome of the appeal.
There is one interlocutory injunction in force against ratiopharm GmbH based on the formulation patent.
If the final decision on the validity of the formulation patent goes against AstraZeneca, ratiopharm may claim damages for lost sales due to the interlocutory injunction.
In 1998, Astra filed suits in the US against Andrx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Genpharm, Inc.
This followed the filing of abbreviated new drug applications by Andrx and Genpharm with the US Food and Drug Administration FDA concerning the two companies intention to market generic omeprazole products in the US.
During 1999, Astra also filed suits against Kremers Urban Development Company and Schwarz Pharma, Inc. and against Cheminor Drugs Ltd. Reddy-Cheminor Inc. and Schein Pharmaceuticals, Inc. During 2000, AstraZeneca filed further suits against Lek Pharmaceutical and Chemical Company d. d, Impax Laboratories Inc. Eon Labs Manufacturing Inc. and Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. During 2001, AstraZeneca filed further suits against Torpharm, Inc. and Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Ivax.
The basis for the proceedings is that the actions of all the companies infringe several patents relating to omeprazole Prilosec in the US.
The cases are proceeding under the US Hatch-Waxman legislation.
AstraZeneca filed additional patent infringement suits during 2001 against Andrx and Genpharm in respect of one other omeprazole patent outside the Hatch-Waxman legislation.
The trial against Andrx, Genpharm, Kremers Urban Development Company and Cheminor started in December 2001 and ended in July 2002.
In October 2002, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that two AstraZeneca patents 230 and 505 relating to the formulation of omeprazole are valid until 2007, that Andrx, Genpharm and Cheminor all infringed both patents but that Kremers Urban Development Company did not infringe either patent.
The court did not rule on the 281 patent relating to a manufacturing process for omeprazole formulations in respect of which AstraZeneca has sued Andrx only.
AstraZeneca has appealed the judgement with regard to non-infringement and Kremers Urban Development Company.
Andrx, Genpharm and Cheminor have appealed the decision with regard to infringement and validity of the patents.
In April 2001, Andrx filed a case in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York against AstraZeneca, Merck & Co. Inc. and the FDA alleging that the listing of certain patents in the FDAs Orange Book was improper and constituted violations of certain provisions of the Sherman Act, the US federal anti-trust legislation, and a state statute analogous to the federal anti-trust laws.
Andrx seeks injunctive relief compelling the parties to delist omeprazole-related patents it claims were improperly listed in the Orange Book and prohibiting the defendants from using patents to delay the effective date of the FDAs approval of Andrxs ANDA for omeprazole.
AstraZeneca and Merck have filed motions to dismiss the case, which are pending.
AstraZeneca and Merck & Co. Inc. were named as defendants in three class actions: two in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York and one in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey.
The plaintiffs are consumers and third party payers who have alleged that they and others who are similarly situated have been forced to pay higher prices for omeprazole as a result of agreements that AstraZeneca and Merck entered into that resulted in unreasonable restraints of trade and competition.
Furthermore, the plaintiffs have alleged that AstraZeneca and Merck engaged in conduct designed to extend their monopoly power beyond the lawful boundaries of their patents.
The plaintiffs are seeking declarative, equitable and injunctive relief enjoining AstraZeneca and Merck from continuing their alleged illegal activities, costs of suit, reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and any other relief determined by the court.
AstraZeneca filed a motion in March 2002 to dismiss the two class actions before the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, which was granted in June 2002.
The plaintiffs did not appeal.
The plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the New Jersey case also in June 2002.
In October 2000, the Federal Court of Australia Full Court handed down a patent ruling pertaining to omeprazole in connection with a dispute between AstraZeneca and the generic company, Alphapharm Pty Ltd.
The court declared that AstraZenecas formulation patent was invalid.
In November 2001, AstraZeneca applied for special leave to appeal the decision to the High Court of Australia and this application was granted in December 2001.
The appeal was heard by the High Court in May 2002 and in December 2002 the High Court reversed the judgement of the lower court.
The High Court ruled that AstraZenecas formulation patent is valid and that the case should be returned to the lower court for determination of the remaining issues.
During 2000, AstraZeneca was granted interlocutory injunctions based on certain of AstraZenecas omeprazole patents and supplementary protection certificates against the generic company, Scandinavian  AB Scand Pharm, in Sweden, Denmark and Norway.
In October 2000, the District Court of Stockholm ruled that Scand Pharm had infringed one of AstraZenecas supplementary protection certificates for omeprazole.
Scand Pharm has appealed this decision.
In October 2001, Oslo City Court in Norway found that Scand Pharm had infringed AstraZenecas formulation patent for omeprazole.
At the same time, the court declared AstraZenecas formulation patent valid.
As a result of the Norwegian case, Scand Pharm cannot sell its omeprazole product in Norway, nor can it do so in Sweden or Denmark pending the outcome of the main actions in the cases in these countries.
If the final decisions in these cases are against AstraZeneca, Scand Pharm may claim damages for lost sales due to the interlocutory injunctions.
com 104 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 34 Assets pledged, commitments and contingent liabilities continued In March 2002, the Patents Court in the UK handed down a ruling invalidating certain of AstraZenecas formulation patents for omeprazole.
AstraZeneca applied for leave to appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal and this application was granted.
The appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal in October 2002 and the court affirmed the original decision of the Patents Court invalidating the formulation patents.
In the Netherlands, Pharmachemie BV has filed a claim against two AstraZeneca companies alleging that AstraZeneca has misused its exclusive rights in the Netherlands in relation to the expiration date for AstraZenecas supplementary protection certificate for omeprazole.
AstraZeneca denies the allegations and is defending the case.
Other court cases relating to omeprazole patents are pending worldwide.
However, the financial impact if AstraZeneca loses is not considered to be material.
In February 2000, the European Commission commenced an investigation relating to certain omeprazole intellectual property rights, and associated regulatory and patent infringement litigation.
The investigation is pursuant to Article 82 of the EC Treaty, which prohibits an abuse of a dominant position.
The investigation was precipitated by a complaint by a party to a number of patent and other proceedings involving AstraZeneca and relates to a limited number of European countries.
AstraZeneca has, in accordance with its corporate policy, co-operated with the Commission.
AstraZeneca remains of the view that the complaint is unfounded and that it has complied with all relevant competition laws.
In particular, it considers that the matters raised by the complaint are more properly dealt with by the courts in the context of the litigation in which the complainant is involved.
The Commission has recently requested certain factual patent and regulatory information from AstraZeneca and AstraZeneca will continue to co-operate with the Commission.
Zoladex goserelin acetate implant investigation The US Department of Justice has been conducting a civil and criminal investigation into the sale and marketing of Zoladex goserelin acetate implant.
The investigation was prompted by the filing of a qui tam complaint by a private party in 1997 and involves allegations of improper submissions of claims to the Medicare and Medicaid programmes.
Plendil felodipine In August 2000, AstraZeneca LP received a letter from Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. Inc. informing AstraZeneca of Mutuals intention to market a generic version of AstraZenecas felodipine extended release tablets Plendil prior to the expiration of AstraZenecas patent covering the extended release formulation.
AstraZeneca filed a patent infringement action against Mutual in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
Mutual responded and filed counterclaims alleging non-infringement and invalidity.
Expert discovery is due to close in March 2003.
A trial date has not yet been set.
In May 2001, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP received a similar letter from Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and in July 2001, AstraZeneca filed a patent infringement action against Zenith in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey.
Zenith responded and filed counterclaims alleging non-infringement.
Fact discovery is due to close in May 2003.
Nolvadex tamoxifen AstraZeneca is a co-defendant with Barr Laboratories, Inc. in numerous purported class actions filed in federal and state courts throughout the US.
All of the state court actions were removed to federal court and have been consolidated, along with all of the cases originally filed in federal court, in a federal multi-district litigation proceeding pending in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York.
Some of the cases were filed by plaintiffs representing a putative class of consumers who purchased tamoxifen.
The other cases were filed on behalf of a putative class of third party payers including health maintenance organisations, insurers and other managed care providers and health plans that have reimbursed or otherwise paid for prescriptions of tamoxifen.
The plaintiffs allege that they paid supra-competitive and monopolistic prices for tamoxifen as a result of the settlement of patent litigation between Zeneca and Barr in 1993.
The plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, treble damages under the anti-trust laws, disgorgement and restitution.
In April 2002, AstraZeneca filed a motion to dismiss the cases for failure to state a cause of action.
The courts decision is awaited.
In August 2002, AstraZenecas US distribution agreement with Barr Laboratories, Inc. for non-branded tamoxifen expired, as did AstraZenecas patent for Nolvadex tamoxifen.
At the same time, a six month period of market exclusivity, awarded by the US Food and Drug Administration in connection with the successful completion of certain paediatric testing with the product, commenced.
Barr thereafter commenced litigation against the FDA in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the FDAs refusal to grant Barr final approval for its own generic tamoxifen prior to expiration of AstraZenecas exclusivity period.
Barr also declined AstraZenecas offer to extend the distribution agreement through the end of the exclusivity period.
Therefore, in October 2002, AstraZeneca began shipping its own non-branded tamoxifen to customers to ensure an uninterrupted supply to patients.
In December 2002, the Court held that Barr could not obtain final FDA approval for its own generic tamoxifen prior to the expiration of AstraZenecas paediatric exclusivity for Nolvadex.
In January 2003, Barr made a claim that AstraZeneca improperly thwarted Barrs entry into the tamoxifen market and caused Barr monetary damages.
com 105 Zestril lisinopril In 1986, AstraZenecas predecessor company and Merck & Co. Inc. entered into licence agreements under which AstraZeneca was granted the right to make, use and sell lisinopril Zestril, in return for which AstraZeneca agreed to pay royalties to Merck.
In April 2002, AstraZeneca commenced arbitration proceedings against Merck under one of the licence agreements.
In the arbitration, AstraZeneca is seeking repayment of approximately $38m of prior royalty amounts and a prospective reduction in the royalty rate going forward, based on a provision of the licence agreement which reduces the royalty rate if sales of lisinopril by third parties exceed a certain level.
The case is currently progressing under the arbitration rules of the International Chamber of Commerce.
Retail pharmacies drug purchasers actions Since October 1993, several thousand retail pharmacies and certain retail drug purchasers have commenced purported class actions and individual actions in various federal and state courts throughout the US alleging that, with respect to brand name prescription drugs, manufacturers and wholesalers engaged in discriminatory pricing practices, discriminatory discounting and rebate practices, and or conspired with one another to fix prices and artificially maintain high prices to the plaintiffs in restraint of trade and commerce.
More than 20 brand name prescription drug manufacturers and eight wholesalers have been named defendants in some or all of these suits.
AstraZeneca entered into a settlement agreement with the retail class plaintiffs whose anti-trust claims were consolidated in a federal multidistrict litigation proceeding pending in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
AstraZeneca also reached settlements with numerous independent and chain pharmacies that opted out of the federal class action, although there are still actions brought by certain chain and independent pharmacies pending in federal court.
AstraZeneca has settled or been dismissed from all of the state cases except for a consumer case pending in state court in Alabama.
AstraZeneca has consistently denied liability and continues to believe it has meritorious defences to all of these claims.
However, it believes that entering into these settlements is the prudent course of action given the inherent risks and costs of litigation and to avoid further business disruption.
Average wholesale price class action litigation In January 2002, AstraZeneca was named as a defendant along with 24 other pharmaceutical manufacturers in a class action suit, in Massachusetts, brought on behalf of a putative class of plaintiffs alleged to have overpaid for prescription drugs as a result of inflated wholesale list prices.
The suit seeks to recover unspecified damages.
AstraZeneca has also been named as a co-defendant with various other pharmaceutical manufacturers in similar class action suits filed in five other states.
Most of these suits have been consolidated with the Massachusetts action for pre-trial purposes pursuant to federal multi-district litigation procedures.
AstraZeneca believes that it has meritorious defences to all of these claims.
Additional government investigations into drug marketing practices As is true for most, if not all, major prescription pharmaceutical companies operating in the US, AstraZeneca is currently involved in multiple additional US federal and state criminal and civil investigations into drug marketing and pricing practices.
AstraZeneca has received subpoenas from the US Attorneys Office in Boston requesting production of documents relating to the sale and promotion of Prilosec to the New England Medical Center in Boston.
A separate subpoena from the same office requests documents relating to Prilosec purchasing and services agreements with AdvancePCS, the pharmacy benefits management company.
AstraZeneca has also received a subpoena from the Massachusetts Attorney Generals Office seeking documents relating to the sale and promotion of five products Prilosec, Seroquel, Rhinocort Aqua, Toprol-XL and Zestril within Massachusetts.
AstraZeneca has received an investigative demand from the Missouri Attorney Generals Office seeking documents and information relating to agreements with drug retailers doing business within Missouri.
Most recently, AstraZeneca has received a Civil Investigative Demand from the US Federal Trade Commission for certain information concerning AstraZenecas advertising and marketing of Nexium.
AstraZeneca is cooperating with these investigations.
It is not possible to predict the outcome of any of these investigations, which could include the payment of damages and the imposition of fines, penalties and administrative remedies.
General AstraZeneca is also involved in various other legal proceedings considered typical to its businesses, including some remaining US retail pharmacy anti-trust class and individual actions outside the scope of the settlements described above and litigation relating to employment, product liability, commercial disputes, infringement of intellectual property rights and the validity of certain patents.
Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the legal proceedings or investigations referred to in this Note 34 to the Financial Statements, AstraZeneca does not expect them to have a materially adverse effect on AstraZenecas financial position or profitability.
