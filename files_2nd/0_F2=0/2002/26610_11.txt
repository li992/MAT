Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors The directors responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the accounts in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in the statement of directors responsibilities included in the Directors Report.
Our responsibility is to audit the accounts in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements, United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the accounts give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors Report is not consistent with the accounts, if the Company or Group has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law or the Listing Rules regarding directors remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the accounts.
The other information comprises only the Chairmans Statement, the Chief Executives Strategic Review, the Operating Review, the Finance Directors Review, the Corporate Social Responsibility Report, the Directors Report which includes the Corporate Governance Statement and the Remuneration Report.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the Companys and Groups compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the Boards statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys or Groups corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with UK Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the accounts.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the accounts, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Companys or Groups circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the accounts are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the accounts.
Opinion In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 31 March 2002 and of the profit and cash flows of the Group for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
Chartered Accountants and Registered Auditors London, England 23 May 2002 41 Man Group plc Annual Report 2002 Man Group accounts WACE 13 6 02 5:14 pm Page 42 Accounting Policies Basis of accounting The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom and, except for the treatment of taking to the profit and loss account profits and losses arising on the revaluation of financial instruments, in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 the Act.
An explanation of this departure is given in the revenue recognition note below.
In the current year the Group adopted Financial Reporting Standard FRS 19 Deferred Tax, which did not require a restatement of the prior years figures as the effect is not material.
The Group has changed its accounting policy in respect of deferred tax.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits will be fully effective for the Groups year ending 31 March 2004.
The disclosures required by FRS 17 in 2002, which give an indication of its possible impact on the accounts when it is fully implemented, are set out in note 8 c on page 52.
The Group adopted FRS 18 Accounting Policies in 2001.
The Group continues to review and update its accounting policies, although there have been no significant changes in 2002.
However, there have been some changes to accounting presentation in 2002.
These are detailed in the paragraph below.
Changes in accounting presentation The Group profit and loss account format has been changed in two respects in 2002.
Firstly, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items are now shown in a separate column and as such one of the alternative earnings per share measures has been amended so that it is based on earnings before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
This has been done to present the profit and loss account and related measures in a more useful format.
Secondly, goodwill amortisation, which is more significant in 2002, has been split between operating expense and share of operating profit loss from joint ventures and associates.
In 2001, the aggregate amount was shown in operating expense note 3.
In addition, ordinary shares in the Company held by the employee trusts have been reclassified from current asset investments to fixed asset investments, and the comparative figures on the Group balance sheet, cash flow statement and related notes have been restated accordingly.
This has been done in light of current best practice which suggests that the holding of these shares to reward directors and employees over the longer term is more fairly represented by classifying them as fixed rather than current assets.
The book value of ordinary shares in the Company held by the employee trusts at 31 March 2002 was 38.5 million 2001: 27.2 million, 2000: 13.2 million.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts incorporate the accounts of Man Group plc and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 March 2002.
The results of subsidiaries disposed of in the period are incorporated up to the date control is transferred.
The results of subsidiaries acquired in the period are incorporated from the date control is acquired.
Certain US limited partnerships in which the Group is general partner are not consolidated because there are severe long-term restrictions on the rights of the general partners.
The Group accounts for the 1% general partnership interests as fixed asset investments.
Revenue recognition In Asset Management, management fees are recognised as earned, and performance fees are only recognised once they have been locked-in and cannot subsequently be reversed.
In Brokerage, net interest income, which is largely generated from client funds, is recognised as earned.
Execution and clearing commissions are recognised as earned.
Other operating income, which arises largely from foreign exchange, metals and energy trading activities where the Group acts as principal, is typically recognised on a fair value basis, whereby movements in the fair values of the trading instruments are recognised in the profit and loss account.
In accordance with accepted practice, those financial instruments including forward positions and derivatives held for trading purposes are marked-to-market and consequent gains and losses are taken to the profit and loss account.
This policy represents a departure from the statutory requirement to record positions and instruments at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The directors consider this to be necessary for the accounts to show a true and fair view.
It is not practical to quantify the effect on the accounts of this departure, since information on original cost, being of no continuing relevance to the business, is not available.
Turnover In the opinion of the directors, disclosure of turnover is most appropriately represented by net operating income, which comprises net fee and commission income, net trading interest income and other operating income.
These changes represent an adaptation of the profit and loss account format laid down in Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985 due to the special nature of the Groups business.
Sales commissions In Asset Management, sales commissions paid to intermediaries when a fund is first launched are charged on a 42 Man Group plc Annual Report 2002 Man Group accounts WACE 13 6 02 5:14 pm Page 43 straight-line basis to net operating income over the shorter of five years and the period during which fees are payable by the investor for early redemption.
Financial instruments Financial instruments, including derivatives are held for trading purposes or held as hedges.
Profits or losses on hedging instruments are accounted for in accordance with the policy described below.
Financial instruments and derivative financial instruments held for trading are marked-to-market, with the resulting gains and losses taken to the net operating income line on the profit and loss account.
The Group uses various financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risks, future commodity price risks and interest rate risks.
These include forward currency contracts and to a lesser extent currency options, commodity futures and options with recognised exchanges and interest rate swaps.
A financial instrument is considered to be used for hedging purposes when it alters the risk profile of an existing, or anticipated, underlying exposure of the Group in line with the Groups risk management policies.
Hedging instruments are matched with their underlying hedged item either individually or in aggregate as appropriate.
Each instruments gain or loss is brought into the profit and loss account and its fair value into the balance sheet, at the same time as the associated underlying assets, liabilities, income or cost.
For foreign exchange instruments, this will be in operating profit matched against the relevant purchase or sale, and for interest rate instruments, within interest payable or receivable over the life of the instrument or relevant interest period.
The profit or loss on an instrument may be deferred if the hedged transaction is expected to take place, or would normally be accounted for, in a future period.
If the matched underlying asset, liability, income or cost ceases to exist, or is no longer considered likely to exist in the future, the hedging instrument is closed out.
Any profit or loss on the sale is recognised in the profit and loss account immediately as part of operating profit.
Debt instruments are carried at cost.
The finance costs of debt instruments are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the debt.
Such costs include the costs of issue and any discount to face value arising on issue.
Currencies Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the undertaking concerned have been recorded at the rate appropriate at the time of accounting for the transaction.
Currency balances at the year-end have been converted at the rate ruling at that date except where covered by an open foreign exchange contract in which case the rate specified in the contract is used.
Assets and liabilities of those subsidiaries and associates which prepare accounts in currencies other than the Groups reporting currency have been translated at year-end rates.
The results and cash flows of these undertakings are translated at average rates for the year.
Differences on exchange arising from the translation of opening balance sheets of those subsidiaries and associates whose reporting currency is not sterling, together with the differences between the results of these undertakings translated at average rates for the year and year-end rates, are taken directly to reserves, together with differences on non-sterling borrowings used to hedge those investments.
All other gains and losses are taken to the profit and loss account.
Goodwill Positive goodwill arising on acquisitions since 1 April 1998 is capitalised, categorised as an asset on the balance sheet and amortised over its useful economic life.
The useful economic life of the goodwill is determined at the time of the acquisition giving rise to it by considering the nature of the acquired business, the economic environment in which it operates and period of time over which the value of the business is expected to exceed the values of the identifiable net assets.
The goodwill amortisation periods used by the Group typically range between 5 and 15 years, except for earn-outs in the Brokerage business which are typically amortised over 3 to 8 years.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 31 March 1998 was written off directly against Group reserves.
Goodwill previously eliminated against reserves has not been reinstated on implementation of FRS 10.
Adjustments to earn-outs relating to acquisitions prior to 31 March 1998 have been taken directly to Group reserves.
Upon the sale or closure of previously acquired businesses, any goodwill arising on acquisition that was written off directly to reserves or that has not been amortised through the profit and loss account is taken into account in determining the profit or loss on sale or closure.
Impairment Tangible fixed assets and goodwill are subject to impairment review in accordance with FRS 11 if there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount of the fixed asset or goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
The impairment review comprises a comparison of the carrying amount of the fixed asset or goodwill with its recoverable amount, which is the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
43 Man Group plc Annual Report 2002 Man Group accounts WACE 13 6 02 5:14 pm Page 44 Accounting Policies continued Net realisable value is calculated by reference to the amount at which the asset could be disposed of.
Value in use is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows obtainable as a result of the assets continued use, including those resulting from its ultimate disposal, at a market based discount rate on a pre-tax basis.
The carrying values of fixed assets and goodwill are written down by the amount of any impairment and this loss is recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which it occurs.
Subsidiary undertakings The Companys shares in subsidiary undertakings are stated in the balance sheet of the Company at the lower of cost and directors valuation.
Joint ventures and associates A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds a long-term interest and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other ventures under a contractual arrangement.
An associate is an undertaking, not being a subsidiary or joint venture, in which the Groups interest is substantial and for the long term and, having regard to the disposition of the other shareholdings, the Group is in a position to exercise a significant influence over its policies and participates in its commercial and financial decisions.
The Groups share of the profits less losses of joint ventures and associates is included in the consolidated profit and loss account on the equity accounting basis or, in the case of joint ventures, the gross equity accounting basis.
The Groups share of the attributable proportion of the reserves from the dates of acquisition of joint ventures and associates is included in the consolidated balance sheet.
Other investments Investments are classified as fixed assets where the intention is to hold the investment for the long-term or where the Groups ability to dispose of the investment is restricted.
Other investments are classified as current assets.
If an investment is being held as a fixed asset but subsequently it is decided to dispose of the investment, as there is no need or no intention to hold it for the long-term, then it is transferred to current asset investments.
Fixed asset investments are carried at their purchase price.
Where an investment has diminished in value the diminution is charged to the profit and loss account if it is permanent.
A temporary diminution in value may be charged to the profit and loss account.
If the circumstances giving rise to the diminution have reversed to any extent, the charge to the profit and loss account is written back to the extent that it is no longer necessary.
Current asset investments are marked-to-market and all revaluation gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Pensions The Group operates a number of defined benefit and contribution pension schemes.
The expected cost of these schemes is charged to the profit and loss account, on the advice of independent actuaries, so as to accrue the cost over the service lives of employees on the basis of a constant percentage of earnings.
Variations from regular cost are spread over the expected remaining service lives of current employees.
To the extent that such costs do not equate with cash contributions a provision or prepayment is recognised in the balance sheet.
Leases Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account in the period to which they relate.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off tangible fixed assets over their economic useful lives.
When determining the useful economic life of equipment, the Group takes into account the expected rate of technological developments and the intensity at which the assets are expected to be used.
The rates used are dependent on the circumstances in the countries in which subsidiaries operate and are as follows: Leasehold land and buildings life of the lease Equipment 3 to 10 years Segregated balances As required by the United Kingdom Financial Services and Markets Act and by the US Commodity Exchange Act, the Group maintains certain balances on behalf of clients with banks, exchanges, clearing houses, and brokers in segregated accounts.
These amounts and the related liabilities to clients, whose recourse is limited to the segregated accounts, are not included in the Group balance sheet.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give rise to an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that it is likely that it can be recovered.
The Group does not discount its deferred tax provision as the effect would not be material.

The adjustments are the net effect of claims made under limited warranties given to the management buyout group.
These limited warranties were disclosed in the contingent liabilities note in the prior year, however during the year an agreement was reached whereby they have been terminated so that the Man Group will not be required to make any further payments.
As part of this agreement the management buyout group has also settled part of the loan note given to them by the Man Group, such that the outstanding amount of the loan note has been reduced from $100 million to $55 million as at the year-end.
In 2001, the loss on sale of the Agricultural Products businesses of 13.1million 12.9 million net of tax represents an adjustment of 11.3 million 11.3 million net of tax to the loss on sale reported in March 2000, and 1.8 million 1.6 million net of tax in respect of the sale of the US Nuts activities.
Further Agricultural Products restructuring costs of 1.9 million 1.9 million net of tax were also incurred, largely relating to termination payments.

The latest actuarial valuation of the largest scheme, the E D & F Man Limited Group Pension Fund, a defined benefit pension plan, was made at 31 December 1999 using the projected unit method.
This scheme covers most of the Groups UK employees.
The most significant actuarial assumptions were price inflation 3.0% per annum, wage and salary increases 5.5% per annum and investment return 7.1% per annum.
Actuarial valuations are conducted every three years.
At the date of the last actuarial valuation of the E D & F Man Limited Group Pension Fund, the market value of the assets of the scheme was 71.7 million.
The actuarial value of the assets of the scheme represented approximately 88% of the liabilities for the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The funding level on a Minimum Funding Requirement basis was 93%.
In August 2000 the Company made a payment of 7.5 million to make good the Minimum Funding Requirement shortfall.
A further payment of 3.2 million was made in December 2001.
Accrued pension costs amounting to 5.0 million 2001: 5.3 million are included in other creditors, this being the excess of the accumulated pension cost over the actual contributions paid.
Other than pensions, the Group does not operate any other form of post-retirement benefit schemes.
ii FRS 17 disclosures FRS 17 Retirement Benefits will be fully effective for the year ending 31 March 2004 when a change in accounting policy will be required to recognise on the Groups balance sheet an asset or liability with respect to the recoverable surplus or deficit, net of related deferred tax, on the defined benefit schemes and to recognise immediately actuarial gains and losses in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
In 2002, the standard requires disclosures to be made of the amount of the asset or liability that would have been recognised in the balance sheet if the standard had been implemented.
Additional disclosure will be made in 2003, including the amounts that would have been recognised in the profit and loss account and statement of total recognised gains and losses under the standard.
The valuation used for FRS17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation of the UK scheme at 31 December 1999.
The valuation of both the UK and US schemes were updated by a qualified independent actuary at 31 March 2002 to take account of the requirements of FRS17.
The main financial assumptions used in the actuarial valuations were: UK scheme US scheme % p. a.
Inflation 3.0 4.0 Rate of increase in salaries 5.5 5.0 The rate of increase for pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.0 0.0 The rate used to discount scheme liabilities 6.0 7.25 The value of the assets and liabilities of the schemes, the assumed long-term rates of return and the assets and liabilities as at 31 March 2002 were as follows: UK scheme US scheme Rate of Rate of return Value return Value %m % m Equities 7.8 45.8 8.5 8.8 Bonds 5.8 25.4 8.5 4.3 Other 6.6 30.5 8.5 0.8 Fair value of scheme assets 101.7 13.9 Present value of scheme liabilities 106.0 14.7 Net deficit in the schemes 4.3 0.8 52 Man Group plc Annual Report 2002 Man Group accounts WACE 13 6 02 5:14 pm Page 53 8 Staff costs and employees continued The deficits would be presented in the balance sheet as follows: Pension liability m Pension schemes deficit 5.1 Related deferred tax asset 1.6 Net pension liability 3.5 The effect that the net pension liability would have on the profit and loss account reserve if FRS 17 was implemented is as follows: 2002 m Profit and loss account reserve as per Group balance sheet 391.7 Net pension liability 3.5 Profit and loss account reserve including net pension liability 388.2 iii Stakeholder pensions Stakeholder pensions are a new pension product which became available from 6 April 2001.
In the UK the Group currently operates two main pension arrangements.
The final salary occupational scheme closed to new entrants on 31 May 1999 but a number of employees remain active members of the scheme and continue to accrue benefits.
From 1 June 1999, the Group Personal Pension Plan Man GPP was introduced and this arrangement meets the criteria required by the stakeholder legislation.
As a result, the Company has decided not to offer stakeholder pension arrangements to its employees.
It believes that the Man GPP is superior to a stakeholder pension for the following reasons: The Company contributes between 3% and 14% of pensionable salary to the Man GPP.
There is no requirement for the Company to contribute to stakeholder pensions: Most stakeholders will offer a more limited fund range than is available to members of the Man GPP: and Stakeholder pension arrangements are expected to carry a typical charge of 1% per annum on the fund value.
Members of the Man GPP generally enjoy a charge of below 1% per annum.

The Group has taken advantage of the exemption available, under FRS 13, for short-term debtors and creditors which are included in the Groups consolidated balance sheet at amounts which are not significantly different from their fair values.
This means that these amounts are excluded from the following tables except for note 21 c. a Fair values and book values of financial instruments The comparison of fair and book values of all the Groups financial instruments is set out below.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
