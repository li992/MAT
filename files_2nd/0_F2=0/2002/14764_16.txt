Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
Financial Reporting Standard 19 Deferred Taxation has been adopted see note g below and note 6 and prior year comparisons have been restated accordingly.
The particular accounting policies adopted are described below.
a Accounting convention The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention as modied by the revaluation of certain assets.
b Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all subsidiary undertakings for the fty two weeks to 2 August 2002 the financial year.
The previous accounting period was for the fty three weeks to 3 August 2001. c Goodwill In respect of business combinations entered into by the Group, the fair value of the purchase consideration given is allocated between the underlying net assets of the acquired businesses other than goodwill, on the basis of the fair value to the Group.
In the case of business combinations entered into after 31 July 1998, purchased goodwill is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful economic life.
Each acquisition is separately evaluated for the purposes of determining its useful economic life, which shall not exceed twenty years.
The useful economic lives are reviewed annually and revised if necessary.
Any goodwill arising from business combinations entered into prior to 31 July 1998 was written off directly to reserves.
Such goodwill shall be reinstated on disposal of those businesses and charged to the profit and loss account in the relevant period.
d Tangible xed assets Depreciation is not provided on freehold land or assets in the course of construction.
On other assets it is provided on cost or revalued amounts in equal annual instalments over the estimated lives of the assets with a minimum rate of 2 per cent.
The annual rates of depreciation are as follows: Freehold buildings 2% 4% Leasehold properties Period of lease Leasehold improvements 10% 20% 1 Plant and machinery 10% 33 3% 1 Fixtures, ttings and equipment 20% 33 3% Motor vehicles 20% 25% As permitted by Financial Reporting Standard 15 Tangible Fixed Assets, those freehold buildings valued at 31 July 1985 continue to be carried at that value, subject to depreciation.
e Investments Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are revalued to directors valuation and are stated at net asset value.
In the opinion of the directors this valuation policy gives a fair representation of the net worth of the Company.
30 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2002 f Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost represents materials, direct labour and appropriate production overheads.
g Deferred taxation In accordance with FRS19, deferred taxation is now provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more taxation, or a right to pay less taxation at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current taxation rates and law.
The effects of the adoption of FRS19 and the resultant change in accounting policies are set out in note 6.
The provision for deferred taxation in existence at 3 August 2001 has been restated in accordance with FRS19 and has been adjusted through reserves, and the taxation charge to the profit and loss account has been amended.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements.
Deferred taxation is not provided on timing differences arising from the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where there is no commitment to remit these earnings nor in respect of gains realised that have been rolled over into the acquisition costs of replacement assets.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.
h Regional grants Regional grants are provided for and amortised in equal annual instalments over the estimated lives of the assets to which they relate.
i Provisions for repairs Where the Group is committed under the terms of a lease to make repairs to leasehold premises, provision is made for the estimated cost of repairs over the lease period.
j Foreign currencies The results of the overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into Sterling at the average rates of exchange during the period.
The balance sheets of the overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into Sterling at the rates at the balance sheet date.
The resulting exchange differences are taken to reserves.
Where foreign currency borrowings have been used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in overseas subsidiaries, exchange gains or losses on the borrowings have been offset in reserves to the extent that they do not exceed the associated exchange differences arising on the retranslation of net investments.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the local currency at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates ruling at that date.
These exchange differences are included in profit on ordinary activities before taxation.

Pension costs The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP24 and the disclosures given in a are those required by that standard.
Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benets was issued in November 2000 and the transitional disclosures required by that standard, to the extent not covered in a, are set out in b below.
a The Group operates pension schemes which the majority of its UK employees are eligible to join.
The principal scheme, the St Ives Pension Scheme the scheme, is of the dened benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The scheme was closed to new entrants from 6 April 2002, but benets continue to accrue for existing active members.
A new dened contribution scheme has been established for joiners after 6 April 2002, to which the Group contributes 4 per cent of pensionable pay.
The pension cost for the Groups UK schemes was 4,120,000 2001 3,772,000.
The triennial valuation of the principal scheme was carried out as at 6 April 2002, using the projected unit method, by Jonathan Punter, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, Punter Southall & Co Ltd the schemes actuary, who is independent of the Group.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted for the purposes of both SSAP24 and determining the funding rate in the valuation were: a long term interest rate investment return of 7.0 per cent per annum before Normal Retirement Age NRA and 6.0 per cent after NRA: salary increases of 3.5 per cent per annum and limited price indexation of 2.5 per cent per annum.
Pension increases were allowed for in accordance with the rules of the scheme and past practice.
At the valuation date, the actuarial value of the assets on this basis was sufficient to cover 88 per cent of the benets that had accrued to members equivalent to a deficit of 12.6 million.
The market value of the schemes assets as at 6 April 2002 was 98.6 million.
For the purpose of the actuarial valuation, assets were taken at 97.7 per cent of the market value.
The schemes actuary recommended that the current contribution rate of 8.25 per cent of pensionable pay was appropriate, as this is designed to remove the deficit referred to above.
This recommendation has been accepted by the Company and the Trustee.
34 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2002 A creditor of 86,000 2001 89,000 prepayment, inclusive of interest accrued, is included in respect of the dened benefit schemes.
The pension cost relating to foreign schemes was 1,188,000 2001 1,095,000.
The foreign schemes are dened contribution schemes and are principally Section 401 k Plans in the USA.
b The FRS17 disclosures below have been based on the actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 6 April 2002 adjusted to allow for the assumptions and actuarial methodology required by FRS17 and updated to 2 August 2002 by the schemes actuary.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 2 August 2002 3 August 2001 % per annum % per annum Rate of increase in salaries 3.5% 4.0% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.5% 3.0% Discount rate 5.9% 6.0% Ination assumption 2.5% 3.0% The FRS17 assumptions are the same as those used for funding and the SSAP24 disclosures, except for the lower investment return assumption discount rate used of 5.9 per cent which is based on corporate bond yields.
This has the effect of increasing the value placed on the liabilities and thereby increases the deficit disclosed.
The higher investment return used for funding and SSAP24 purposes reects the higher return expected in the long-term by investing in asset classes other than corporate bonds, in particular equities.
The assets in the scheme and the expected rates of return were: Long-term Long-term rate of return rate of return expected at Value at expected at Value at 2 August 2002 2 August 2002 3 August 2001 3 August 2001 per annum 000 per annum 000 Equities 7.0% 57,462 7.0% 66,776 Bonds 5.7% 25,357 5.8% 24,613 Other 5.0% 3,125 5.0% 1,765 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Total market value of assets 85,944 93,154 Actuarial value of liability 123,507 107,667 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf deficit in the scheme 37,563 14,513 Related deferred tax asset 11,269 4,354 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Net pension liability 26,294 10,159 aaaasdf aaaasdf 35 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2002 N OTES TO THE F INANCIAL S TATEMENTS continuedC HAIRMAN S S TATEMENT continued 4.

Contributions for the year of 3,872,000 were paid at the recommended rate of 8.25 per cent of pensionable pay.
The Trustee has confirmed with the schemes actuary that, subject to review and, in particular, the market value of the schemes assets, the contribution rate should remain at 8.25 per cent until the next valuation of the scheme, which will be no later than as at 6 April 2005.
The scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 6 April 2002.
As a result, the current service cost calculated using the projected unit method will increase over time expressed as a percentage of pensionable pay but will be applied to a shrinking pensionable payroll.
The effect on the Groups balance sheet, had FRS17 been adopted at the year end in respect of the Groups UK schemes, would have been as follows: 2002 2001 Restated 000 000 Net assets: Net assets before pension liability 234,817 237,207 Net pension liability 26,294 10,159 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Net assets after pension liability 208,523 227,048 aaaasdf aaaasdf Reserves: profit and loss reserve before pension liability 177,807 182,145 Net pension liability 26,294 10,159 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf profit and loss reserve after pension liability 151,513 171,986 aaaasdf aaaasdf 2002 qqqqqqqaqqqqqqqqqqqa 000 % History of experience gains and losses: Difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets: Amount 20,711 Percentage of scheme assets 24 Experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities: Amount 1,064 Percentage of the present value of the scheme liabilities 1 Total amount recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses: Amount 22,294 Percentage of the present value of the scheme liabilities 18 37 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2002 N OTES TO THE F INANCIAL S TATEMENTS continuedC HAIRMAN S S TATEMENT continued 5.

This taxation would become payable if the replacement assets are sold and further rollover relief is not available.
The amount of taxation that would be payable by the group is 880,000 Company 1,268,000. d Effect of change in accounting policy The Group adopted FRS19 during the year and therefore provided for all nonpermanent timing differences which originated, but had not reversed by the balance sheet date.
This has resulted in a decrease in the group taxation charged in the previous year of 175,000 and a corresponding increase in profit after tax and has also increased deferred taxation provisions by 802,000 at 3 August 2001 and 627,000 at 2 August 2002.
Taxation and profit after tax for the fty two weeks ended 2 August 2002 would have been materially unchanged if FRS19 had not been adopted.

Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on profits after taxation as disclosed in the profit and loss account of 15,827,000 2001 41,831,000 as restated.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated by adding back exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, as adjusted for taxation, to the profit after taxation.
Basic earnings per share and adjusted basic earnings per share are calculated on a weighted average of 102,777,257 2001 104,067,152 ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The calculation of the diluted earnings per share is based on profit after taxation as disclosed in the profit and loss account and on a diluted weighted average of 103,011,170 2001 104,575,248 shares during the year.
The difference between the number of shares used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation is 233,913 2001 508,096 representing dilutive share options held but not yet exercised.
Dilution has been restricted to share options where the individual option price is less than the average market value of shares during the year, which was 414.39p 2001 435.77p.

Contingent liabilities Neither the Group nor Company had contingent liabilities at 2 August 2002 or at 3 August 2001.
Derivatives and other financial instruments a Interest rate risk The Group nances its operations through a mixture of retained earnings and bank borrowings and generally maintains a positive net funds position.
Group policy is to manage exposure risk to interest rate uctuations with bank borrowings, predominantly short-term, at oating rates with matching short-term deposits of surplus funds.
b Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to maintain exibility with respect to its liquidity position, by utilising short-term cash deposits and where necessary short-term bank borrowings for all working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
It is the Groups policy to utilise longer-term bank borrowings to finance acquisitions, thereby providing a hedge against net investments in overseas subsidiaries.
c Foreign currency risk The Group has overseas subsidiaries which operate in the USA, Germany and Holland and whose revenues and expenses are denominated exclusively in the relevant foreign currencies.
In order to provide some protection to the Groups Sterling balance sheet from the movements in these foreign exchange rates, the Group may, if appropriate, finance a part of its net investment in these subsidiaries by means of overseas borrowings subject to the interest cost of those borrowings.
The extent of this nancing at 2 August 2002 was 33 per cent of the gross investment in foreign currencies.
The Groups UK subsidiaries sales are principally with customers in the UK, and are denominated in Sterling.
d Financial instruments A discussion of the Groups objectives, policies and strategies with regard to derivative financial instruments, can be found in the accounting policies note on page 31.
The Groups position at 2 August 2002, in respect of derivatives and other financial instruments, is consistent with that adopted throughout the year.

g Currency analysis of monetary assets and liabilities After taking into account the effect of any hedging transactions undertaken to manage currency exposures there were no significant net foreign currency monetary assets or liabilities giving rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account at either 2 August 2002 or 3 August 2001.
Matched assets and liabilities are those that generate no gain or loss in the profit and loss account, either because they are denominated in the same currency as the Group operations to which they belong or because they qualify under Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 20 Foreign Currency Translation as a foreign currency borrowing providing a hedge against a foreign equity investment.
