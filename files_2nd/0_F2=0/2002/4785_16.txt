Prior year comparatives Deferred taxation is now stated on a full liability basis in accordance with FRS 19 and comparative financial information has been restated as necessary.
The impact of adopting FRS 19 was to decrease the tax charge for the year ended 30 September 2001 and the year ended 30 September 2002 by US$3.2 million and US$3.6 million respectively.
The cumulative impact to 1 October 2000 was to raise a deferred tax asset of US$3.2 million.
Accounting Policies Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries and its share of associates.
The results of subsidiaries are included from the effective dates of acquisition until the effective dates of disposal.
All significant intergroup transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation.
Turnover Turnover comprises the aggregate amounts invoiced for the sale of goods and installation, maintenance and service.
Maintenance revenue and licence fees Maintenance revenue and licence fees are brought to account over the relevant contract periods.
Research and development Research and development costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Goodwill Where an investment in a subsidiary, joint venture or associated company is made, any difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the attributable net assets is recognised as goodwill.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 October 1998 was set off against reserves in the year of acquisition.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions after 1 October 1998 is recognised within intangible fixed assets in the year of acquisition.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight line basis so as to write off the goodwill over its economic life, depending on the nature of the acquisition, for a period not exceeding seven years.
The unamortised balance is reviewed on a regular basis and, if an impairment in value has occurred, it is written off in the period in which the circumstances have been determined.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis at rates considered appropriate to reduce their book values to estimated residual values over the useful lives of the assets.
62 DIMENSION DATA ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following rates are applied: Leasehold land, buildings and improvements over the lease term.
Computer and workshop equipment 20-33.33% per annum.
Office furniture and equipment 10% per annum.
Associated companies Associated companies are those companies, other than subsidiaries, over which the Group exercises significant influence and in which it holds a long term equity interest.
The results of these companies are accounted for by means of the equity method, from the date they became investees, whereby the Groups share of the associated companies retained income for the year is included in the consolidated profit and loss account.
Attributable earnings or losses, less dividends received, are included with the book value of the investment in the consolidated balance sheet.
Provision is made where there has been an impairment in the carrying value of the investment.
Investments Investments other than investments in associates and joint ventures are reflected at the lower of cost and fair value in the balance sheet.
Fair value for unquoted investments represents the Directors valuation after taking into account any impairment.
Fair value of quoted investments represents market value.
Investments held by Protocol are stated at valuation in terms of the standards endorsed by the British Venture Capital Association.
Valuations are based on arms length transactions which took place and valuation surpluses or losses included in operating income.
Where no such transaction took place, the investment is assessed for impairment and any valuation losses written off to operating income.
No account is taken of valuation surpluses indicated by the impairment review.
In the case of listed investments, the quoted share price at year end is used to value the investment.
All subsidiaries of Protocol are consolidated in accordance with Group accounting policies.
Where investments are held with the intention of selling these to the Group at a later stage, the investments are accounted for in terms of the normal Group accounting policies for associates, subsidiaries and investments.
Investment in subsidiaries are carried in the parent company balance sheet at cost less provisions for permanent impairment in value.
Accounting for foreign investments The balance sheets of consolidated foreign subsidiaries, together with investments in overseas associated undertakings, are translated into US dollars at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The results of overseas subsidiaries and associated undertakings are translated at the weighted average rates of exchange for the year.
The exchange differences arising on the retranslation of the opening net investment and profit for the financial year at the closing rate, are taken to reserves.
Stock Stock is valued at the lower of the weighted average cost and net realisable value.
Redundant and slow-moving stocks are identified and written down with regard to their estimated economic or realisable values.
ANNUAL REPORT 2002 63 Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Foreign currency transactions Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currencies at the rates of exchange on the dates of the transactions or, if hedged, at the rates of exchange under the related forward exchange contracts.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year, or if hedged, at the forward contract rates.
The exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Operating leases Rentals are charged to the profit and loss account over the lease term.
Pensions Pension costs in the profit and loss account comprise contributions payable to the Groups various defined contribution schemes.

Financial Instruments Continued 28 d Hedging The Groups policy is to hedge all material transactional currency exposure and currency exposure on future expected purchases using forward currency contracts.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
There were no speculative positions in foreign currencies at the year ends, and there were no material gains or losses from such positions for any period presented.
The Group enters into forward exchange contracts to eliminate the currency exposure arising on sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies as soon as there is a firm contractual commitment.
It also uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate profile.
An analysis of the unrecognised gains and losses is as follows: Total net Gains Losses gains losses $'000 $'000 $'000 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 October 2001 84 826 742 Gains and losses arising in previous years that were recognised this year 84 826 742 Gains and losses arising before 1 October 2001 that were not recognised in the year - - - Gains and losses arising in the year to 30 September 2002 that were not recognised in that year 23 2,516 2,493 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 30 September 2002 expected to be recognised in the year to 30 September 2003 23 2,516 2,493 28 e Currency profile The main functional currency of the Group is the US dollar, being the currency in which the majority of purchases are denominated and to which most of the selling prices are linked.
Other major currencies are the South African rand, sterling, Australian dollar, Singapore dollar and the Euro.
Monetary assets and liabilities are hedged and therefore there are no transactional exposures which would give rise to net currency gains or losses in the profit and loss account.
Pension Schemes In most countries, the employing company provides either defined contribution or insured retirement plans to their employees.
The relevant company, and in some cases the employees, pay regular contributions to the plans.
Once contributions are made, the relevant company has no liability in respect of these plans.
Employees in France, Japan and Korea are entitled to lump-sum termination indemnity payments upon leaving.
Provisions have been established in respect of these liabilities.
