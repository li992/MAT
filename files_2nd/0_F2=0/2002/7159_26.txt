SEGMENTAL INFORMATION AFTER GOODWILL AMORTISATION AND OPERATING EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS CONTINUED The results of the clinical and French co-manufacturing operations have been reported as discontinued as a result of the disposal of these activities as described in note 23.
Discontinued operations in 2001 also included the chemicals, Spanish mail and retail installation businesses.
UK Logistics turnover excludes sales of 331.0 million 2001 285.5 million where the Group is obliged under certain logistics contracts to purchase goods on customers behalf and sell them on at cost.
There is no material difference between the geographical split of the Groups turnover by area of origin and area of destination.
Operating net assets are net assets excluding interest bearing assets and liabilities, restructuring and disposal provisions, goodwill, corporation tax and dividend balances.

The action claimed that certain services provided by Hays infringed Consignias fide facto postal monopoly.
On 18 March 2002 Hays agreed to settle Consignias claim in order to concentrate fully on developing products and services to meet the needs of clients in the deregulating market and to ensure an orderly market for the future.
Hays paid 5.5 million in damages and incurred a further 0.9 million in legal costs.

EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS CONTINUED ii Following a review of the IT Solutions business and the performance of certain contracts, management has concluded that goodwill and intangible assets totalling 35.7 million have insufficient future revenue prospects to justify continued capitalisation.
32.7 million of this relates to goodwill purchased in prior years and 3.0 million relates to intangible assets relating to the development of IT products.
The review of the IT Solutions business has resulted in the recognition of reorganisation costs of 17.3 million, the majority of which have arisen from existing property lease commitments.
iii Net reorganisation costs in the prior year principally relate to the reduction in the cost base of certain Logistics network operations and the reorganisation of the information management business, net of profits on disposal of associated properties.
iv During the year the Group completed the disposal of several non-core operations including its chemicals, retail installation, clinical and French co-manufacturing operations.
The loss in the prior year relates principally to an impairment charge relating to the chemicals business and disposal of the Spanish mail services operations.
Exceptional items in the year resulted in a cash inflow of 46.1 million and a tax credit of 6.4 million.
Net cash proceeds of 52.8 million were received from the disposal of businesses as disclosed in note 23 and cash payments of 6.7 million principally relate to the Consignia settlement which is reflected in cash from operating activities.

Money purchase benefits are funded by contributions from the employee and, for eligible employees, from the employer.
Employer contributions are in the range of 2% to 10% of pensionable salary depending on the length of pensionable service.
ii The Hays Pension Scheme, which is an approved defined benefit scheme, closed to new members since 1 July 2001. iii The Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme, which is a supplementary unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme for employees who are subject to the Inland Revenues earnings cap on pensionable salary.
As a consequence of acquisitions the Group also operates a number of other small pension arrangements in the UK.
Group policy is to consolidate these into the principal Hays schemes as soon as is practicable.
The majority of overseas arrangements are either defined contribution or government-sponsored schemes and these arrangements are not material in the context of Group results.
Regular pension costs under SSAP 24 i Group contributions to the Hays Stakeholder Pension Plan during the year were 0.2 million.
The accrual in the balance sheet at 30 June 2002 was nil.
ii Pension costs for the Hays Pension Scheme in the year were 9.4 million 2001 8.8 million, comprising a regular cost of 11.7 million less a variation of 2.3 million.
The variation arises in respect of the actuarial surplus, which is being spread as a level percentage of salaries over the average remaining working life of the membership 13 years.
The pension cost for the year is less than actual contributions paid of 11.4 million, resulting in a prepayment in the balance sheet at 30 June 2002 of 6.6 million 2001 4.2 million.
The Scheme actuary, an employee of Mercer Human Resource Consulting, assessed the Hays Pension Scheme as at 30 June 1999 using the projected unit method and a market based valuation approach to ascertain its cost to the Group.
The principal financial assumptions were that the rate of return would be 4% per annum higher than the rate of price inflation, that increases in past and future pensions would be in line with price inflation, and that future salary growth would exceed price inflation by between 1% per annum and 3% per annum, depending on salary levels at the valuation date.
Following the actuarial valuation it was agreed that the Group would pay an average contribution rate of 9.5% of annual salaries, subject to review at future valuations.
At the date of the latest actuarial valuation the market value of the assets of the Hays Pension Scheme was 183.8 million and the actuarial value of the assets was sufficient to cover 113% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in future earnings.
The next scheduled actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme will be as at 30 June 2002. iii The Group charges the cost of the Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme each period, as advised by the Groups actuary, to the profit and loss account and holds these amounts as a provision in the balance sheet.
The charge to the profit and loss account during the year amounted to 0.9 million 2001 1.1 million.
The provision in the balance sheet as at 30 June 2002 amounts to 5.0 million 2001 4.1 million.

STAFF COSTS CONTINUED FRS 17 disclosures In November 2000 the Accounting Standards Board ASB issued FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, replacing SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
In July 2002 the ASB published for comment an Exposure Draft which would, if implemented, allow an extension to the transitional arrangements of FRS 17.
The probability of implementation is uncertain and partly dependent upon proposals from the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
The Group will take advice to ensure that it continues to adopt best practice in respect of accounting for retirement benefits.
The Group is in the second year of the transitional arrangements under FRS 17 and the required disclosures are made below.
FRS 17 assumptions, asset, liability and reserves disclosures The actuarial valuations of the Hays Pension Scheme and Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme were updated to 30 June 2002 by the Scheme actuary, an employee of Mercer Human Resource Consulting.
The values of assets and liabilities in other schemes operated by the Group were also estimated in preparing the disclosures required under FRS 17.
The principal assumptions used are shown below: 2002 2001 Rate of increase in salaries 5.10% 4.50% Rate of increase of pensions in payment and deferment 2.58% 2.75% Discount rate 5.80% 6.27% Inflation assumption 2.58% 2.75% The assets and liabilities of the major schemes operated by the Group on an FRS 17 basis, along with the expected rate of return on scheme assets, are shown below.
The liabilities of the Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme, which were presented separately last year, have been included.

The Schemes assets principally comprise equities and these have been subject to significant market fluctuations.
During the year the FTSE-All-Share Index used as a benchmark for the Schemes assets fell by 17% from 2,728 to 2,263.
This reduction accounts for the majority of the 44.9 million difference between actual and expected return on assets.
The yield on the long-term AA bond index used to discount scheme liabilities fell from 6.27% to 5.80% during the year.
This movement accounts for approximately half of the impact of changes in assumptions relating to the present value of scheme liabilities of 37.0 million.
The assumption adopted in respect of future salary growth has been revised from 4.50% to 5.10%.
This has also had a material impact on the present value of the Schemes liabilities.
FRS 17 five year history The following disclosures will be built up over time as a five year history: In s million % of scheme 2002 assets liabilities Difference between actual and expected return on scheme assets 21% 44.9 Experience gains on scheme liabilities 0.3 Amount recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses 26% 81.6 Hays plc 54 Notes to the Accounts 6.
STAFF COSTS CONTINUED Future profile of the Hays Pension Scheme The Hays Pension Scheme closed to new members with effect from 1 July 2001.
This will result in the age profile of the active membership rising over time and hence, under the method required to calculate FRS 17 liabilities, the future cost in relation to this Scheme will reduce in the long-term.
The Group has considered the impact of the FRS 17 deficit in respect of the Group, its employees and pensioners.
The deficit arises mainly as a result of recent turbulence in the financial markets but also as a result of revising the assumption of likely growth in employee salaries to reflect a more conservative position than in the prior year.
In the context of the prudent funding structure of the Group, the Group is in a strong position to manage this long-term liability to the satisfaction and benefit of all stakeholders.

Hays plc 55 Notes to the Accounts 7.
TAX ON PROFIT ON ORDINARY ACTIVITIES CONTINUED c Factors that may affect future tax charges Provision has not been made for taxation that would arise in the event of certain overseas subsidiaries and associated companies distributing the balance of their reserves as the earnings are continually reinvested and, accordingly, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
The Groups overseas tax rates are generally higher than those in the UK.
No provision has been made for deferred taxation on gains recognised on the sale of properties where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
Such tax would only become payable if the properties were sold without being able to claim rollover relief.
The total amount unprovided is 10.2 million 2001 10.9 million.
At present it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
The Group provides for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that they will reverse in the future.
Some of the Groups overseas operations, particularly those in Germany, have generated tax losses in the past, the future utilisation of which is uncertain.
The Group has therefore not recognised a deferred tax asset of 10.2 million 2001 7.3 million in respect of tax losses of overseas companies.

Dividends in respect of these shares have not been waived.
During the year the Trust did not acquire any new shares but disposed of 832,652 shares on exercise of employee share options.
Ordinary shares of 1p each Own Shares are held in the balance sheet for the satisfaction of ESOS options at an average cost of 265p as at 30 June 2002.
To provide a hedge against fluctuations in the Companys share price over time, the Trust broadly matches options awarded with shares purchased by the Company.
Due to movements in the Companys share price during the year, the market value at 30 June 2002 of 154p was below the average cost of Own Shares.
In the opinion of the Directors no permanent diminution in value has occurred as the shares held are designed to hedge options exercisable between 2002 and 2011 which at 30 June 2002 had an average period of 6.3 years to expiry.
The Company also operates the Hays plc Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust the QUEST which holds shares issued by the Company in connection with the Hays plc Savings-Related Share Option Scheme and the Hays UK Sharesave Scheme.
