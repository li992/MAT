Chrysalis Annual Report and Accounts 2002 41 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31st August 2002 1 Accounting policies Basis of presentation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the periodic revaluation of certain fixed assets, and are in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The following principal accounting policies have been consistently applied throughout the year.
Consolidation The Group accounts include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 August 2002.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Goodwill For acquisitions prior to 1 September 1998 when FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets was first adopted, purchased goodwill being the excess of fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired has been written off directly to reserves in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No 22 Goodwill.
On any subsequent disposal or termination of the business, the attributable goodwill is reinstated and accounted for in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
For acquisitions since 1 September 1998, purchased goodwill has been capitalised and included within intangible fixed assets and is amortised on a straight line basis over its expected useful economic life, subject to maximum of 20 years.
Negative goodwill arising on acquisitions completed since 1 September 1998 is included within intangible fixed assets and released to the profit and loss account in the periods in which the fair values of the non-monetary assets purchased on the same acquisition are recovered, whether through amortisation, depreciation or sale.
Goodwill is subject to impairment review in the year following acquisition and in subsequent years when the circumstances require it.
Such reviews are carried out in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 11 Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a business acquired since 1 September 1998, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging crediting the unamortised amount of any related goodwill negative goodwill.
Fixed asset investments In the Companys financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings and participating interests in joint venture companies and associates are stated at cost less amounts written off.
Joint venture companies A joint venture is defined as an undertaking in which the Group has a long term interest and over which it exercises joint control.
The Groups share of results of joint venture companies is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest in their net assets is included in fixed asset investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
Associates Investments in associates are defined as those in which the Group holds a participating interest and exercises significant influence.
The Group includes investments in associates in the consolidated financial statements using the equity accounting method.
Turnover Turnover represents the amount receivable for goods and services supplied to third party customers excluding value added tax, together with record, video production and publishing royalties, television and film licensing and distribution income and sales commissions.
Record royalties excluding record producer services and music publishing royalties Royalty income is included on a receivable basis calculated on sales of records arising during each accounting period as reported by licensees.
Royalties payable are expensed on an accruals basis.
Royalty advances payable are expensed on a paid basis except that they are carried forward and recognised as an asset where such advances relate to current unreleased products and where it is estimated that sufficient future royalties will be earned for recoupment from those products.
Advances received in respect of individual albums are carried forward and recognised as income over the expected life of each individual licence.
42 Chrysalis Annual Report and Accounts 2002 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31st August 2002 1 Accounting policies continued Music publishing royalties and record producer services Music publishing royalties received are accounted for on a notified earnings basis, with any unrecouped royalty advances carried forward until the end of the relevant contract period.
This accounting policy was changed with effect from the year ended 31st August 2001, full details of which are set out in the Annual Report and Accounts for 2001.
Royalties received for record producer services are accounted for on a cash basis.
Royalties payable are expensed on an accruals basis except that music publishing royalty advances are carried forward and recognised as an asset where such advances relate to proven artists or songwriters and where it is estimated that sufficient future royalties will be earned for recoupment of these advances.
Book publishing Sales of books supplied to customers are recognised at the point that the books are despatched to the customer.
Royalty advances payable are expensed on a paid basis, except that they are carried forward and recognised as an asset where such advances relate to current unpublished books, or where it is estimated that sufficient future royalties will be earned for recoupment of these advances.
Film and broadcasting licensing and distribution income Revenue from the licensing or distribution of film, broadcast or exhibition rights is recognised from the date of release for distribution or broadcast.
Television productions Turnover and attributable profits on television programmes produced for commissioning broadcasters are recognised on television production contracts which are incomplete at the end of the year in the proportion that costs incurred to date bear to estimated ultimate costs after making provision for anticipated losses.
Investment in television rights Investment in television rights is stated at cost and included in intangible assets in the Group balance sheet.
They are amortised in the profit and loss account in the proportion that revenue bears to the estimated ultimate revenue after making provision for any anticipated shortfall.
Investment in music publishing catalogues and book publishing rights Investment in acquired music publishing catalogues and acquired book publishing rights is stated at cost and included in intangible fixed assets in the Group balance sheet.
They are amortised in the profit and loss account on the basis outlined below.
Annual impairment tests are carried out on acquired music publishing catalogues where they have useful economic lives of more than 20 years.
Investment in internally generated music copyrights and catalogues in the form of advances payable under music publishing contracts is not included in intangible fixed assets in the Group balance sheet but is written off as described above.
Similarly, investment in internally generated book publishing rights is not included in intangible fixed assets but is written off on the first publication of the book.
Deferred television programme development expenditure Pre-contract development expenditure is written off in the period in which it is incurred except where it relates to a clearly defined project, the outcome of which has been assessed with reasonable certainty as to its success and commercial viability.
In such cases the expenditure is deferred to the extent that its recovery can be reasonably regarded as assured and the cost is written off against revenue over the period of the contract.
Depreciation and amortisation Depreciation and amortisation are provided on a straight line basis in order to write off the cost of tangible and intangible fixed assets over their expected useful economic lives, on the following basis: Tangible fixed assets Freehold and long leasehold 50 years Short leasehold properties Over the period of the lease Furniture, fixtures, plant and equipment 3-10 years Motor vehicles 3-5 years Intangible fixed assets Acquired music publishing copyrights Up to 50 years maximum Acquired goodwill Up to 20 years maximum Acquired book publishing rights Up to 20 years maximum Other intangible assets Up to 20 years maximum In the case of acquired music publishing copyrights, useful lives of periods of more than 20 years are used when the acquired rights extend for such longer periods.
Chrysalis Annual Report and Accounts 2002 43 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31st August 2002 1 Accounting policies continued Stock and work in progress Stocks of CDs, videos, DVDs and published books are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Cost includes all direct costs incurred in bringing the stocks to their present location and condition, including in the case of the initial print run of books published by group subsidiary undertakings, the proportional allocation of all editorial, origination and printing costs relating to such stock.
Stocks of books which have been held for more than one year are written off on a straight line basis over a twenty four month period to reflect their diminishing net realisable value.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred on disposal.
Work in progress in the case of books includes all the costs incurred in bringing a book to publication.
Work in progress on books is carried forward until the book is published or a decision is taken to abort production.
Once a book is published, the costs incurred in bringing the book to publication are written off as part of the cost of the first print run, and only carried forward within the stock value to the extent that any books from the initial print run remain in stock.
Leases Where the Group enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
The asset is recorded in the balance sheet as a tangible fixed asset and is depreciated over its estimated useful life or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter.
Future installments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included within creditors.
Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the profit and loss account, and the capital element which reduces the outstanding obligation for future installments.
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss accounts on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Pension costs Pensions relating to current and past service are funded by annual contributions to the Chrysalis Group PLC Retirement Benefits Scheme.
Contributions to the final salary section of the scheme are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
These contributions are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the attained age method.
Contributions to the defined contribution section of the scheme are charged to the profit and loss account in the period the contributions are payable.
In accordance with the transitional arrangements under FRS 17 paragraph 94, additional performance and balance sheet disclosures for the year ended 31 August 2002 are set out in note 32.
Taxation Deferred tax is recognised without discounting, in respect of all material timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have not reversed by the balance sheet date except as otherwise required by FRS 19 Deferred tax.
Advance corporation tax recoverable by deduction from future corporation tax is carried forward within deferred taxation or as ACT recoverable within debtors as appropriate.
Tax charges or credits arising on the retranslation of foreign currency borrowings used to finance or provide a hedge against equity investments in foreign enterprises are taken to the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses together with the exchange differences on the borrowings themselves.
Translation of foreign currencies Assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings and the Groups share of the post-acquisition retained reserves of overseas joint venture companies are translated to Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of each accounting period and exchange variances on the opening net investment in those subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are dealt with through reserves.
The results of overseas subsidiary undertakings and overseas joint venture companies are translated to Sterling at the average rate of exchange ruling during the accounting period and variances compared with exchange rates at the balance sheet date are dealt with through reserves.
Long term incentive plans The cost of long term incentive plans for Directors and senior executives are charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the plan or the service contract of the individual concerned.
The expense is calculated based on the forecast capital values.
Cash and liquid resources Cash for the purpose of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts payable on demand.
Liquid resources are current asset investments which are disposable without curtailing or disrupting the business and are either readily convertible into cash at or close to their carrying values or traded in an active market.
Its results were previously included in the results of other businesses.
In addition, the results of the Groups wholly owned subsidiary company, Lasgo Chrysalis Limited, which distributes music audio and video products, have also been included in the results of the Groups Music Division which allows the financial performance of the Groups book publishing and distribution activities to be disclosed separately.
Previously, the activities of Lasgo Chrysalis Limited and our book publishing and distribution companies together formed the Media Products Division.
The comparative figures have also been amended accordingly.

58 Chrysalis Annual Report and Accounts 2002 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31st August 2002 25 Financial instruments and derivatives i Currency and interest rate analysis As at 31st August 2002 the currency and interest rate profile of the Groups financial liabilities after taking into account the effect of interest rate collars were as follows: Floating rate Fixed rate liabilities liabilities Total 000 000 000 Sterling 52,165 631 52,796 Euro 654 - 654 At 31st August 2002 52,819 631 53,450 Sterling 41,250 623 41,873 Euro 329 - 329 At 31st August 2001 41,579 623 42,202 Floating rate borrowings bear interest with reference to bank rates and, in respect of the securitisation, to the prevailing rates in the US Commercial paper market.
The weighted average interest rate on fixed borrowings is 8.1% 2001: 8.8% and the weighted average time for which the rate is fixed was 12.8 years 2001: 13.8 years.
The maturity of borrowings is shown in note 21.
The above figures excludes all current monetary assets and liabilities.
ii Currency exposure As at 31st August 2002 the currency exposures of the Group were as follows: Functional currency of Group operations Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities Australian New Zealand Canadian Swedish Dollar Dollar Dollar Euro Krone US Dollar Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Sterling 1,036 128 363 790 379 8,328 11,024 Euro -- -- - 123 123 At 31 August 2002 1,036 128 363 790 379 8,205 10,901 Sterling 253 - 25 441 31 1,977 1,783 Euro -- -- - 135 135 At 31 August 2001 253 - 25 441 31 1,842 1,648 iii Comparison of book value and fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities At 31st August 2002, the book value of interest rate collars used to manage the Groups interest rate exposure was nil 2001: nil.
The fair value of interest rate collars at 31st August 2002 indicated a technical deficit to the Group of 2,680,000 2001: 1,100,000 and arises because at the year end, the prevailing interest rate had fallen below the contractual floor rate in the collar.
The fair value was calculated by reference to prevailing market interest rates.
The book value of forward foreign exchange contracts at 31st August 2002 was nil 2001:nil and the fair value indicated a technical surplus of 358,000 2001: 13,000. iv Hedging At 31 August 2002 the Group held forward foreign exchange contracts taken out to hedge foreign currency transactions arising from operations, and also royalty income used to repay securitisation borrowings.

Chrysalis Annual Report and Accounts 2002 63 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31st August 2002 32 Pension costs The UK Group operates a pension scheme with a final salary section and a defined contributions section.
The final salary section was closed to new entrants after 1 July 1994.
The assets of the scheme are held under trust separately from the Companys assets, and are invested by external fund managers.
Contributions to the final salary section of the scheme are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the attained age method.
The key assumptions affecting the results of the 1st September 1999 valuation were: investment returns would be 7.5% per annum salary increases would average 5.5% per annum The Groups consulting actuaries, Aspen PLC, are currently preparing the triennial valuation as at 1st September 2002, the results of which will be available in early 2003.
The pension charge for the year was 986,000 2001: 866,000, after allowing for 588,000 2001: 526,000 in respect of the amortisation of past service surpluses that are being recognised over the average remaining service lives of employees.
At 31st August 2002, the outstanding pension contributions relating to the final salary section of the Scheme were 69,279 2001: 44,979.
The most recent actuarial valuation, as at 1 September 1999, showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 12,256,000 and the actuarial value of those assets represented 92% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The deficit, which amounted to 1,100,000, and which relates to both current and deferred members of the scheme, is being funded by temporarily increased contributions by the Group in respect of the 18 remaining members, equivalent to 65.6% of their pensionable salaries.
