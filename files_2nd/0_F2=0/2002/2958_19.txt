Notes to the financial statements 1Accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Group.
Basis of preparation of financial statements The Group financial statements comprise the consolidation of the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiaries and incorporate the Groups interest in its joint ventures.
The accounts of its subsidiaries and joint ventures are made up to December 31.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom U. K. GAAP under the historical cost convention, and in accordance with applicable U. K. accounting standards.
These principles differ in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U. S. GAAP.
Application of U. S. GAAP would have affected shareholders funds at December 31, 2002 and 2001 and profit attributable to shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, to the extent summarised in note 28, additional information for U. S. investors.
Basis of consolidation P&O Princess Cruises plc acquired the cruise business of The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company P&O on October 23, 2000.
The acquisition was effected by the issue of ordinary shares in P&O Princess Cruises plc to the holders of deferred stock in P&O in settlement of a dividend declared by P&O.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using merger accounting principles as if the businesses comprising P&O Princess Cruises had been part of P&O Princess Cruises for all periods presented, since they have been under common control throughout this period.
Businesses acquired from or disposed of to third parties during the periods presented have been accounted for using acquisition accounting, from or to the date control passed.
Prior year adjustment on implementation of FRS19 The Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Reporting Standard No.
The standard is effective for accounting periods ending on or after January 23, 2002.
The standard requires full provision to be made for deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from most types of timing difference between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in a tax computation.
Deferred tax assets are, however, only to be recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
P&O Princess Cruises has adopted the standard as of January 1, 2002 resulting in the restatement of comparative data from partial provisioning for deferred tax to the full provision basis.
As a result of the implementation of FRS19, the balance sheet as at December 31, 1999 was restated to reflect full provision for deferred tax, an increase in deferred tax liabilities of $92.0m.
The net effect on net assets and shareholders funds as at December 31, 2000 as a result of implementing FRS19 is a reduction of $108.1m with a charge to the profit and loss account for the year of $16.1m.
The tax credit in the profit and loss account for the year to December 31, 2001 has increased by $96.8m to reflect the elimination of the majority of future potential tax liabilities upon P&O Princess Cruises election to enter the U. K. tonnage tax regime.
This is consistent with the elimination of the partially provided deferred tax in the 2001 audited financial statements.
The net effect on net assets and shareholders funds as at December 31, 2001 as a result of implementing FRS 19 is a reduction of $11.3m.
Use of estimates Preparation of financial statements in conformity with U. K. GAAP and U. S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of turnover and expenses for an accounting period.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions Goodwill arising on business acquisitions being the difference between the fair value of consideration compared to the fair value of net assets acquired represents the residual purchase price after allocation to all identifiable net assets.
Goodwill is included within intangible fixed assets and is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated to write off goodwill on a straight line basis over its expected useful life, which can be up to 40 years.
A life of more than 20 years is adopted when the directors consider the period for which the value of the underlying business acquired exceeds the value of the identifiable net assets is demonstrably longer than 20 years.
Goodwill with an expected useful life of more than 20 years is reviewed annually for any impairment, by comparing carrying value with discounted cashflows.
Joint ventures A joint venture is an entity in which the Group has a long term interest and shares control with one or more co-venturers.
Joint ventures are stated at P&O Princess Cruises share of underlying net assets.
P&O Princess Cruises share of the profits or losses of joint ventures is included in the consolidated profit and loss account on an equity accounting basis.
Investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings are held at cost less provisions for impairment.
Shares in P&O Princess Cruises plc held for the purpose of long term incentive plans LTIPs are held within fixed asset investments.
To the extent that these shares have been identified for bonus awards, provision is made for the difference between the book value of these shares and their residual value, if any.
2002 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC 47 Notes to the financial statements 1Accounting policies continued Tangible fixed assets Ships are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Subsequent ship improvement costs are capitalised as additions to the ship, while costs of repairs and maintenance are accounted for as dry docking costs.
Properties and other fixed assets, including computer hardware and software, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Interest incurred in respect of payments on account of assets under construction is capitalised to the cost of the assets concerned.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost to estimated residual value on a straight line basis over the expected useful life of the asset concerned as follows: Cruise ships 30 years Freehold buildings 40 years Other fixed assets 3 16 years Freehold land and ships under construction are not depreciated.
Dry-docking costs Dry-docking costs are capitalised and expensed on a straight line basis to the date of the next scheduled drydock.
Impairment of fixed assets P&O Princess Cruises reviews all fixed assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable based on estimated future cash flows.
Provision for impairment in value of fixed assets is made in the profit and loss account.
Stocks Stocks consist of provisions, supplies, fuel and gift shop merchandise and are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Cash and borrowings Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, money market deposits and certificates of deposit.
All cash equivalents have original maturities of 90 days or less.
Cash and cash equivalents at the balance sheet date are deducted from bank loans and overdrafts where formal rights of set-off exist.
Turnover Turnover comprises sales to third parties excluding VAT and similar sales taxes.
Turnover includes air and land supplements and on board sales and is taken before deducting travel agents commission.
Deposits received on sales of cruises are initially recorded as deferred income and are recognised, together with revenues from shipboard activities and all associated direct costs of a voyage, on a pro rata basis over the period of the cruise.
Marketing and promotion costs Marketing and promotion costs are expensed over the period of benefit, not exceeding one year from the end of the year the cost is incurred.
Leases Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised and the outstanding future lease obligations are shown in creditors.
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Pension costs Contributions in respect of defined contribution pension plans are charged to the profit and loss account when they are payable.
Contributions in respect of defined benefit pension plans are calculated as a percentage, agreed on actuarial advice, of the pensionable salaries of employees.
The cost of providing defined benefit pensions is charged to the profit and loss account on a systematic basis over the periods benefiting from the services of employees, and is calculated with the advice of an independent qualified actuary, using the projected unit method.
This is in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for pension costs, the basis on which the Group accounts for pension costs.
Additional disclosure as required by FRS17 is also provided.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS19.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Derivatives and other financial instruments P&O Princess Cruises uses currency swaps, interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts to manage its exposure to certain foreign currency and interest rate risks and to hedge major capital expenditure or lease commitments by businesses in currencies other than their functional currency.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Foreign currencies The functional and reporting currency of the Group is the U. S. dollar as the majority of its trade and assets are denominated in that currency.
Transactions in currencies other than a business functional currency are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Profits and losses of subsidiaries, branches, and joint ventures which have functional currencies other than U. S. dollars are translated into U. S. dollars at average rates of exchange.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the year end exchange rates.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net assets of subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures which have currencies of operation other than U. S. dollars and any related loans are taken to reserves, together with the differences arising when the profit and loss accounts are translated at average rates and compared with rates ruling at the year end.
Other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.

K. tonnage tax regime which eliminated future potential tax liabilities on its profits in the U. K. The regime includes provision whereby a proportion of capital allowances previously claimed by the Group may be subject to tax in the event that a significant number of vessels are sold and not replaced.
This contingent liability decreases over the first seven years following entry into tonnage tax to nil.
The contingent tax liability at December 31, 2002 was $186.3m 2001: $262.0m assuming all vessels on which capital allowances had been claimed were sold for net book value and not replaced.
No provision has been made as no liability is expected to arise.
$10.7m of contingent consideration, payable in cash in relation to the purchase of 49% of AIDA Cruises Limited in November 2000, has been released as the condition requiring its payment did not arise.
The total estimated amount contingently payable is unchanged, but the whole of the remaining consideration is payable in cash or shares at the Companys option, and therefore an adjustment has been made to shares to be issued.

The shares issued in respect of the initial consideration have been accounted for in accordance with the merger relief provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
The outstanding consideration is mainly dependent on the future results of the Seetours business and may be payable between 2003 and 2006.
The Company has the option to settle the outstanding consideration in either cash or new P&O Princess Cruises plc ordinary shares.
The purchase agreement provides that in the event of a change in control of P&O Princess Cruises plc payment of the outstanding consideration can be accelerated by the vendor of AIDA Cruises Limited.
In such an event, the minimum amount payable would be approximately 59m $61.9m, payable in cash.

22 Pensions P&O Princess Cruises is a contributing employer to various pension schemes, including some multi-employer merchant navy industry schemes.
In the UK, P&O Princess Cruises operates its own defined benefit pension scheme, the assets of which are managed on behalf of the trustee by independent fund managers.
This scheme is closed to new membership.
As at March 31, 2001, the date of the most recent formal actuarial valuation, the scheme had assets with a market value of $60.9m, representing 102 per cent of the benefits accrued to members allowing for future increases in earnings.
Approximately 70 per cent of the schemes assets are invested in bonds and 30 per cent in equities.
The principal valuation assumptions were as follows: % Rate of salary increases 4.0 Rate of pension increases 2.5 Discount rate 5.25 Expected return on assets 5.25 The Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund MNRPF is a defined benefit multi-employer scheme in which sea staff employed by companies within the P&O Princess Cruises group have participated.
The scheme has a significant funding deficit and has been closed to further benefit accrual.
Companies within the P&O Princess Cruises group, along with other employers, are making payments into the scheme under a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding to reduce the deficit.
Payments by P&O Princess Cruises group companies to the scheme in 2002 totalled $2.0m, which represented 7 per cent of the total payments made by all employers.
As at March 31, 2002, the date of the most recent formal actuarial valuation, the scheme had assets with a market value of $814m, representing 84 per cent 2002 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC 59 Notes to the financial statements 22 Pensions continued of the benefits accrued to members.
Approximately 68 per cent of the schemes assets were invested in bonds, 25 per cent in equities and 7 per cent in property.
The valuation assumptions were as follows: % Rate of salary increases 4.0 Rate of pension increases where increases apply 2.5 Discount rate 5.8 Expected return on assets 5.8 The Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund MNOPF is a defined benefit multi-employer scheme in which officers employed by companies within the P&O Princess Cruises group have participated and continue to participate.
The share of the contributions being made to the scheme by P&O Princess Cruises group companies based on the year to December 31, 2002 was approximately 7 per cent.
However, the extent of each participating employers liability for any deficit in the scheme is uncertain.
Accordingly, P&O Princess Cruises accounts for the scheme on a contributions paid basis, as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
The scheme is divided into two sections the New Section and the Old Section.
As at March 31, 2000, the date of the most recent formal actuarial valuation, the New Section had assets with a market value of $2,680m, representing approximately 100 per cent of the benefits accrued to members.
The valuation assumptions were as follows: % Rate of salary increases 4.0 Rate of pension increases where increases apply 2.5 Discount rate 5.75 Expected return on assets 5.75 At the date of the valuation, approximately 77 per cent of the New Sections assets were invested in equities, 14 per cent in bonds and 9 per cent in property and cash.
As a result of this asset distribution, it is expected that the fall in equity markets since March 2000 will have resulted in the New Section now showing a significant funding deficit.
The estimated current position is discussed below with the additional information presented under FRS17.
The Old Section has been closed to benefit accrual since 1978.
As at March 31, 2000, the date of the most recent formal actuarial valuation, it had assets with a market value of $2,233m representing approximately 111 per cent of the benefits accrued to members.
The assets of the Old Section are substantially invested in bonds.
Contributions from P&O Princess Cruises group companies to the MNOPF during the year to December 31, 2002 were $1.2m.
P&O Princess Cruises also operates a number of smaller defined benefit schemes in the U. S. which are unfunded, other than assets in a Rabbi Trust held on the Groups balance sheet, and makes contributions to various defined contribution schemes in various jurisdictions.
The pension charges arising from the schemes described above were: 2002 2001 2000 U. S. $m U. S. $m U. S. $m The P&O Princess Cruises Pension Scheme 5.5 4.3 4.0 Merchant Navy pension funds 2.8 2.7 2.7 Overseas plans 3.8 2.8 3.0 12.1 9.8 9.7 in 2000 the P&O Princess Cruises Pension Scheme figure includes $3.1m in respect of payments to the P&O Pension scheme prior to demerger in October 2000 Differences between the amounts charged and the amounts paid by P&O Princess Cruises are included in prepayments or creditors as appropriate.
At December 31, 2002 total prepayments amounted to $6.3m 2001 $7.3m, and total creditors amounted to $14.3m 2001 $13.1m, giving a net pension liability in the balance sheet of $8.0m.
Additional information presented under FRS17 Retirement Benefits Whilst the group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension Costs, under FRS17 Retirement Benefits the following additional information has been presented in respect of the P&O Princess Cruises Pension Scheme, P&O Princess Cruises share of the MNRPF and the unfunded U. S. defined benefit schemes.
In accordance with FRS 17, the MNOPF is not included in this analysis as P&O Princess Cruises share of its underlying assets and liabilities cannot be identified with certainty.
However, some additional information on the overall funding position of this scheme is provided.
The actuarial valuations of the P&O Princess Cruises schemes and P&O Princess Cruises share of the MNRPF were updated to December 31, 2002 and 2001 by P&O Princess Cruises qualified independent actuary.
The assumptions used are best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
Using weighted averages, these assumptions for the U. K. and U. S. schemes together were: 2002 2001 % % Rate of increase in salaries 4.1 4.1 Rate of increase in pensions where increases apply 2.5 2.5 Discount rate 5.2 5.6 Expected return on assets only relevant for U. K. schemes 5.1 5.5 60 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC 2002 Notes to the financial statements 22 Pensions continued The aggregated assets and liabilities in the schemes as at December 31, 2002 and 2001 were: 2002 2002 2001 2001 Expected rate Expected rate Value of return Value of return U.

This compares with the net pension liability accounted for under SSAP 24 of $8.0m.
On full compliance with FRS17, the amounts that would have been charged to the consolidated profit and loss account and consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses for these schemes for the year ended December 31, 2002 are set out below: 2002 U. S. $m Analysis of amounts charged to operating profits: Current service cost 7.3 Past service costs - Total charged to operating profit 7.3 Analysis of amount credited to other finance income: Interest on pension scheme liabilities 8.9 Expected return on assets in the pension schemes 7.0 Net charge to other finance income 1.9 The total profit and loss charge of $9.2m compares with $12.1m under SSAP 24.

The Annual Report of the MNOPF for the year ended March 31, 2002 showed that the market value of the assets of the New Section at that date was $2,404m, of which 66 per cent was invested in equities, 22 per cent in bonds and 12 per cent in property and cash.
P&O Princess Cruises actuary has estimated the deficit in the New Section at December 31, 2002 based on the estimated movement in assets since March 31, 2002 and in liabilities since March 31, 2000, and applying a discount rate 2002 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC 61 Notes to the financial statements 22 Pensions continued to the liabilities of 5.1% in accordance with FRS 17.
As noted above, the extent of each employers liability with respect to the deficit in the fund is uncertain.
Based on the share of current contributions made to the scheme by the P&O Princess Cruises group, its share of the estimated deficit would be approximately $85m, although the appropriate share of the deficit actually attributable to the P&O Princess Cruises group is believed to be lower than this.
On full adoption of FRS17 Retirement benefits, in future years the difference between the fair value of the assets held in the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and the value of the schemes liabilities measured on an actuarial basis, using the projected unit method, will be recognised in the balance sheet as a pension scheme asset or liability, as appropriate, which would have a consequential effect on reserves.
The carrying value of any resulting pension scheme asset would be restricted to the extent that the Group is able to recover the surplus either through reduced future contributions or refunds.
The pension scheme asset or liability would be recognised net of any related deferred tax.
However, this is expected to be minimal due to the tax structure of the group.
Movements in the defined benefit pension scheme asset or liability would be taken to the profit and loss account or directly to reserves.
23 Related party transactions Mr Horst Rahe, a non-executive director of the Company, has an interest in a deferred consideration arrangement relating to the Groups purchase of AIDA Cruises Limited in November 2000.
Amounts provided for as at December 31, 2002 in respect of this deferred consideration were $57.5m in aggregate 2001 $57.0m see note 17.
In July 2002, P&O Princess Cruises International Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, entered into, on an arms-length basis, a lease on an office property in Germany with a company in which Horst Rahe, a director of the Company, has an interest.
The lease is for a term of 10 years, commencing in 2004, with options to extend.
The rent payable under the lease each year varies over the term of the lease, within the range 350,000 to 500,000.
These figures are net of relevant regional government grants.

Generally these bonds are required by travel industry regulators in the various jurisdictions in which P&O Princess Cruises operates.
An Italian subsidiary of P&O Princess Cruises made a claim for a tax allowance for the 1995 financial year under the Italian Tremonti law, reducing taxable profits by just over 250 billion Lire.
Qualification for the allowance is dependent on ownership of relevant assets.
The subsidiary in question bare-boat chartered a vessel it owned to a fellow subsidiary.
In December 2001, the Italian tax authorities submitted an assessment for tax of 70.7m $74 m with penalties of 70.7m $74 m on the grounds that the subsidiary had finance leased, rather than chartered, the vessel and therefore did not qualify for such an allowance.
The Italian subsidiary has appealed against the assessment and the outcome of court proceedings in the Low Tax Court of Palermo is awaited.
The P&O Princess Cruises board, which has been so advised by its Italian advisers, believes that the relevant assets were owned and not the subject of a finance lease and that the allowance is due.
Princess Cruises is party to a purported class action litigation relating to alleged inappropriate assessing of passengers with certain port charges in addition to their cruise fare.
The plaintiffs have not claimed a specific damage amount but settlement of this litigation had been agreed in principle with the plaintiffs for coupons for future travel in amounts between $5 and $24 with a total face value of approximately $13.4m.
However, on January 17, 2002, a Los Angeles Superior Court Judge ruled that he would not consider the class-wide settlement agreed by the parties on the grounds that he had previously ruled that there was no appropriate class.
As a result of this ruling, the case remains pending.
Notwithstanding this development, the P&O Princess Cruises board does not believe that a material liability will arise with respect to this case and no provision has been made in the accounts for this contingency.
However, if there is a settlement, there can be no guarantee that it would be of an amount previously indicated.
In the normal course of business, various other claims and lawsuits have been filed or are pending against P&O Princess Cruises.
The majority of these claims and lawsuits are covered by insurance.
P&O Princess Cruises management believes the outcome of any such suits, which are not covered by insurance, would not have a material adverse effect on P&O Princess Cruises financial statements.

S. dollar currencies with the result that P&O Princess Cruises U. S. dollar consolidated balance sheet, and in particular shareholders funds, can be affected by currency movements.
P&O Princess Cruises partially mitigates the effect of such movements by borrowing in the same currencies as those in which the assets are denominated.
An analysis of financial liabilities by currency is shown below.
2002 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC 63 Notes to the financial statements 26 Financial instruments continued In addition, approximately 30% of P&O Princess Cruises operating profit is currently generated by businesses with functional currencies other than U. S. dollars.
The results of these businesses are translated into U. S. dollars at average exchange rates for the purposes of consolidation.
The impact of currency movements on operating profit is mitigated partially by some interest costs being incurred in non U. S. dollar currencies.
P&O Princess Cruises businesses generally generate their turnover and incur costs in their main functional currency.
Exceptions to this include: Princess Cruises generates some revenue in Canadian dollars and in sterling.
Princess Cruises incurs some costs in euros.
U. K. German and Australian businesses incur costs in U. S. $, including fuel and some crew costs.
The following table shows P&O Princess Cruises currency exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of P&O Princess Cruises that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit concerned, excluding certain non U. S. dollar borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in non U. S. dollar functional currency operations.

Fixed rate financial assets include deferred consideration relating to the sale of fixed assets.
Liquidity risk At December 31, 2002 P&O Princess Cruises had committed financing arranged of $1,210m 2001 $1,657m to fund the delivery payments on four of its five ocean cruise ships on order, of which $475m relates to ship deliveries in 2003 and $735m to ship deliveries in 2004.
In addition, at December 31, 2002 it had $444m 2001 $605m of undrawn committed bank facilities with a weighted average life of five years and a further $162.1m 2001 $120.4m of cash available for general corporate purposes, including ship purchases.
Credit risk Management does not consider there to be any significant concentration of credit risk.
Potential concentrations comprise principally cash and cash equivalents and trade debtors.
P&O Princess Cruises enters into derivative transactions and maintains cash deposits with several major banks.
Management periodically reviews the credit rating of the institutions and believes that any credit risk is minimal.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade debtors is limited due to the large number of debtors comprising P&O Princess Cruises customer base.
The immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments that have a positive fair value at December 31, 2002.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities A comparison by category of book value and fair value of P&O Princess Cruises financial assets and liabilities is as follows: At December 31 2002 2001 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value U. S. $m U. S. $m U. S. $m U. S. $m Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance P&O Princess Cruises operations: Notes and bonds 1,120.9 1,177.2 1,066.2 957.0 Other loans 1,498.6 1,510.9 473.9 484.0 Cash 162.1 162.1 120.4 120.4 Bank overdrafts 14.5 14.5 16.7 16.7 Other investments and deferred consideration 4.6 4.6 6.9 6.9 Derivative financial instruments held or issued to hedge currency exposure on expected future transactions: Forward foreign currency contracts - 16.7 - 208.5 Interest rate swaps - 49.6 - 13.6 2,467.3 2,503.0 1,429.5 1,525.3 The notional principal amount of derivative financial instruments held as hedges against currency exposures on ship capital expenditure is $690.2m 2001 $924.2m in respect of forward foreign currency contracts and $798.3m 2001 $741.8m in respect of currency and interest rate swaps providing hedges against currency and interest rate exposure on loans.
The fair value of notes and bonds is based on quoted market price or if these are not available the quoted market price of comparable debt.
Other loans, which include short term borrowings and bank term loans, are largely at variable interest rates and therefore the book value approximates to the fair value.
The fair value of cash and bank overdrafts approximates to the book value due to the short term maturity of the instruments.
2002 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC 65 Notes to the financial statements 26 Financial instruments continued The fair value of other investments and deferred consideration is based on the estimated recoverable amount.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments are discounted to the net present value using prevailing market rates and foreign currency rates at the balance sheet date.
Hedging When P&O Princess Cruises businesses enter into capital expenditure or lease commitments in currencies other than their main functional currency, these commitments are normally hedged using forward contracts and currency swaps in order to fix the cost when converted to the functional currency.
The most significant of P&O Princess Cruises foreign currency commitments of this nature are in respect of certain cruise ships under construction.
The periods of the forward contracts match the expected cash flows of the capital commitments, usually between three and five years.
Other cruise ships have been ordered in currencies matching the main functional currencies in which these ships will generate their revenue.
Unrecognised gains and losses on currency swaps, interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts are as follows: Net gains Gains Losses losses U. S. $m U. S. $m U. S. $m At January 1, 2002 18.1 213.0 194.9 Gains losses arising before January 1, 2002 that were recognised during the year ended December 31, 2002 1.5 57.9 56.4 Gains losses arising before January 1, 2002 that were not recognised during the year ended December 31, 2002 16.6 155.1 138.5 Gains losses arising in the year that were not recognised during the year ended December 31, 2002 62.7 108.7 171.4 Gains losses at December 31, 2002 79.3 46.4 32.9 Of which: Gains losses expected to be recognised in less than one year 9.4 43.9 34.5 Gains losses expected to be recognised after more than one year 69.9 2.5 67.4 Gains losses at December 31, 2002 79.3 46.4 32.9 Of which: Gains losses on contracted capital expenditure on ships 27.6 42.7 15.1 Gains losses on other hedges 51.7 3.7 48.0 Gains losses at December 31, 2002 79.3 46.4 32.9 The underlying commitments, after taking these contracts into account, are reflected within note 24.

66 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC 2002 Notes to the financial statements 28 Additional information for U. S. investors Accounting principles These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U. K. GAAP, which differs in certain significant respects from U. S. GAAP.
A descriptionof the relevant accounting principles which differ materially is given below.
Treasury stock Under U. K. GAAP, the Companys shares held by employee share trusts are included at cost in fixed asset investments and are written down to the amount payable by employees over the vesting period of the options.
Under U. S. GAAP, such shares are treated as treasury shares and are included in shareholders equity.
Depreciation Under U. K. GAAP, until December 31, 1999 certain freehold properties were not depreciated.
Under U. S. GAAP useful economic lives have been applied to these properties and a depreciation expense recorded based on these lives.
Goodwill and contingent consideration Under U. K. GAAP, if an acquirer can satisfy contingent consideration by the issue of shares at its option, this element of the consideration is not a liability as there is no obligation to transfer future economic benefits.
Consequently this element of the purchase price is accounted for within shareholders funds.
Under U. S. GAAP this consideration is not recognised until the consideration is settled.
In June 2001 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
141 Business Combinations and SFAS No.
142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations.
141 specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognised and reported separately from goodwill.
142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortised, but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.
The Group adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
Goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortised.
Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before July 1, 2001 continued to be amortised through to December 31, 2001.
Amortisation of such assets ceased on January 1, 2002 upon adoption of SFAS No.
Accordingly, goodwill amortisation recognised under U. K. GAAP from January 1, 2002 has been reversed for the purposes of U. S. GAAP.
142, the Group was required to evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in purchase business combinations, and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new classification criteria SFAS No.
141 for recognition separate from goodwill.
The Group was also required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangibles acquired and to make any necessary amortisation period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption.
For intangible assets identified as having indefinite useful economic lives, the Group was required to test those intangible assets for impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.
142 within the first interim period.
Impairment is measured as the excess carrying value over the fair value of an intangible asset with an indefinite life.
The results of this analysis did not require the Group to recognise an impairment loss.
In connection with the SFAS No.
142 transitional goodwill impairment evaluation, the Statement required the Group to perform an assessment of whether there was an indication that goodwill is impaired as of date of adoption.
To accomplish this the Group was required to identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units as of January 1, 2002.
The Group was required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it with the carrying value of the reporting unit within six months of January 1, 2002.
This transitional impairment test upon the adoption of SFAS No.
142 did not result in an impairment charge.
The Group performed the annual impairment test in December 2002 and determined that goodwill was not impaired.
Marketing and promotion costs Under U. K. GAAP, marketing and promotion costs have been expensed over the period of benefit, not exceeding one year from the end of the year the cost is incurred.
U. S. GAAP requires that these costs are expensed in the financial year incurred.
Relocation costs The Group had accrued expenses relating to the relocation of employees which under U. K. GAAP are recognisable as liabilities.
Under U. S. GAAP these costs may not be recognised until incurred by the employees.
Employee share incentives THE EXECUTIVE SCHEMES Under U. K. GAAP the intrinsic value of shares or rights to acquire shares when the rights are granted, less contributions by employees, is charged in arriving at operating profit.
If this forms part of a long term incentive scheme the charge in the profit and loss account is spread over the period to which the schemes performance criteria relate, otherwise recognition occurs when shares or rights are granted.
Under U. S. GAAP, compensation expense is recognised for the difference between the market price of the shares and the exercise price for performance and variable plans.
The amount of compensation expense is adjusted each accounting period based on the value of the shares for both types of plan and also upon the estimated achievement of the performance criteria for the performance plans, until the date at which the number of shares and the exercise price are known.
SAYE SCHEME When employed by P&O, certain employees of P&O Princess Cruises were eligible to participate in the P&O save as you earn SAYE share option scheme.
P&O Princess Cruises does not operate a SAYE scheme.
U. K. GAAP does not recognise the cost of SAYE discounts in financial statements.
U. S. GAAP requires the full discount given to employees on the market price of shares provided as part of a non-compensatory plan such as the SAYE scheme to be charged to the profit and loss account when it is greater than that which would be reasonable in an offer of shares to shareholders or others.
Pensions Under U. K. GAAP, pension costs include the regular cost of providing the benefits as a level percentage of current and expected future earnings of the employees covered.
Variations from the regular pension cost are spread on a systematic basis over the estimated average remaining service lives of current employees in the plans.
U. S. GAAP requires that the projected benefit obligation pension liability be compared with the market value of the underlying plan assets, and the difference may be adjusted to reflect any unrecognised obligations or assets in determining the pension cost or credit for the period.
The actuarial method and assumptions used in determining the pension expense can be significantly different from that computed under current U. K. GAAP.
U. S. GAAP also requires the actuarial valuation to be prepared as at a more recent date than U. K. GAAP.
2002 P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC 67 Notes to the financial statements 28 Additional information for U. S. investors continued During 2001, one of the multi-employer schemes in which the Group participates, the MNRPF, closed its fund for future benefit accrual.
Under U. K. GAAP, the Group is recognising this liability over the period in which the funding deficit is being made good which approximates to expected remaining service lives of employees in the scheme.
Under U. S. GAAP, the Group has accounted for its share of the schemes net pension liability with an expense of $3.7m being recognised in 2002 2001: $15.1m.
Derivative instruments and hedging activities Under U. K. GAAP, gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Under U. S. GAAP, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be recognised in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of related hedged items or, for forecast transactions, deferred and recorded as a component of other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur and are recognised in earnings.
The ineffective portion of a hedging derivatives change in fair value is recognised immediately in earnings.
This statement became effective for P&O Princess Cruises on January 1, 2001, and a transition adjustment of $9.0m was debited to reserves on implementation as the cumulative effect of the U. S. GAAP accounting policy change.
In accordance with SFAS No.
133, U. S. GAAP assets are increased by $68.7m and liabilities by $80.3m as at December 31, 2002 2001 U. S. GAAP assets increased by $214.3m and liabilities by $219.3m.
Cash flow hedges, of $3.3m have been taken to other comprehensive income.
Taxes DEFERRED TAX Following the implementation of FRS 19 Deferred tax, under both U. K and U. S. GAAP deferred taxes are accounted for on all temporary differences.
Deferred tax can also arise in relation to the tax effect of the other U. S. GAAP adjustments.
During 2001, the Group elected to enter the U. K. tonnage tax regime, as a result of which temporary timing differences in respect of fixed assets within the scheme became permanent differences.
The deferred tax liabilities in respect of these assets have therefore been released under both U. K. and U. S. GAAP.
IMPLEMENTATION OF FRS 19 DEFERRED TAX Following the implementation of FRS 19 Deferred tax, as detailed in note 1, the reconciliation of U. K. profit and shareholders funds to U. S. GAAP has been restated for 2001 and 2000.
In 2001, the impact on the U. S. GAAP reconciliation is a decrease in the Taxes U. S. GAAP adjustment to profit of $96.8m and an increase of $11.3m in the Taxes U. S. GAAP adjustment to shareholders funds.
In 2000, the effect is a reduction in the Taxes U. S. GAAP adjustment to profit of $16.1m and a reduction in the Taxes U. S. GAAP adjustment to shareholders funds of $108.1m.
OTHER TAXES The Group incurred income tax in 2001 as a result of taxable gains on intercompany transactions that were undertaken to maximise its tax efficiency.
Under U. K. GAAP, this was charged to the profit and loss account.
Under U. S. GAAP, income taxes paid on intercompany profits on assets remaining within the Group must be deferred.
This deferred charge is being amortised over 25 years.
Dividends Under U. K. GAAP dividends are accounted for in the period to which they pertain, which may be earlier than the date of declaration.
Under U. S. GAAP dividends are accounted for in the period in which they are declared.
Transaction costs In 2001, it was expected that the proposed dual listed company transaction with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. would be accounted for under U. K. GAAP using merger accounting principles with the costs of carrying out the combination being expensed to the profit and loss account when the combined group came into existence.
When the P&O Princess Cruises Board withdrew its recommendation for this proposed transaction in October 2002, these costs were expensed under U. K. GAAP.
Under U. S. GAAP, it was intended that the proposed transaction would be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting with P&O Princess Cruises being treated as the acquiree.
Accordingly, under U. S. GAAP the costs incurred by P&O Princess Cruises in connection with the proposed combination were expensed to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Assets and liabilities Current assets under U. K. GAAP of $20.4m 2001 $8.6m would be reclassified as non current assets under U. S. GAAP.
Provisions for liabilities and charges under U. K. GAAP of $nil 2001 $0.2m would be reclassified as Creditors - amounts falling due within one year under U. S. GAAP Deferred financing costs of $17.6m included within Creditors amounts falling due after more than one year under U. K. GAAP would be reclassified as other assets under U. S. GAAP.
