19 Financial instruments Financial instruments The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise debentures, preference shares, bank borrowings loans and overdrafts, other loans, finance leases and cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations, which have not been included in the following disclosures.
The Group only enters into interest rate swaps and other interest rate hedging instruments.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, debentures and bank borrowings.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The Groups aim is to reduce the risk of exposure to market rate fluctuations in interest movements in the medium term.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to ensure continuity of funding and in particular to ensure that debt requirements for the medium term are available through committed facilities.
In addition, having regard to the longevity of the Groups assets, secured debentures are regarded as being suitable debt instruments.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities and other uncommitted facilities.
Currency risk The Group has no material exposure to currency rate risk.
