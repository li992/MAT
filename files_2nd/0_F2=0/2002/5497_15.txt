On 20 February 2002 the Group announced new financing arrangements to replace the existing multi-currency revolving credit facility.
This included a new committed senior credit facility consisting of a five year amortising $300m term loan, a six year $70m term loan, a five year $85m revolving multi-currency facility and a 10 year 150m bridge facility.
3 On 26 March 2002 the Company received the proceeds of a 100m senior subordinated note issue, priced at 10 8%, maturing in April 2012.
The net proceeds were applied in part repayment of the bridge facility.
On 9 April 2002, the Company completed a gross 75.1m three for five underwritten rights issue.
The net proceeds were applied in part to repay in full the balance of the bridge facility and in part against the senior credit facility.
Full syndication of the senior credit facilities was completed in July 2002.
During the year the $300m term loan has been reduced to $153.7m by applying $23m from the rights issue proceeds, $115.1m from the net proceeds of disposals and $8.2m from operating cash flow in accordance with the schedule of repayments against the facility.
The Group enters into interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to change a portion of its floating rate debt into fixed rate debt and so reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on the Groups interest charge.
At 28 September 2002, the Group had interest rate swaps outstanding with an aggregate value of $183.0m of which $43.0m have not yet commenced.
The Group has also entered into cross-currency swaps to change the underlying currency profile of the debt.
Two contracts have been entered into to exchange an aggregate of 60.0m for US dollars and Euros, such that the currency profile of the debt more closely matches the currency profile of the assets.
Other loans consist primarily of 10.7m of Industrial Revenue Bonds IRBs 2001: 11.3m offset by a favourable revaluation of cross currency swaps used to hedge debt of 2.3m.
The IRBs are at favourable rates of interest, set periodically by reference to market rates.
These bonds incurred rates of interest between 1.9% and 6.1% during the period.

All other fair values shown above have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair value of short-term deposits and borrowings approximates the carrying amount because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of the long-term borrowings approximates the carrying value due to the debt being subject to floating rates or short-term fixed rates.
e Hedging As explained in the Financial Review on pages 20 to 23, the Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures: Interest rate risk using interest rate swaps, caps and collars and forward rate agreements.
Balance sheet translation risk using cross currency swaps and borrowings in functional currencies.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is likely to be recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are as follows: Gains Losses 2002 2001 2002 2001 m m m m Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges to the period end 2.3 4.3 5.0 4.9 f Currency profile The main functional currencies of the Group are Sterling and US$.
The following analysis of net monetary assets and liabilities shows the Groups currency exposures after the effects of forward contracts used to manage currency exposure.
The amounts shown represent the transactional exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.

The ESOP trust was established in 1994 when Mourant & Co. were appointed as trustees to purchase shares in the Company to meet some of the future obligations under employee option schemes.
Shares are distributed to employees upon exercise of options held by them and payment by them of the exercise price.
The Company finances the ESOP trust by way of an interest free loan note 13 of 2.4m.
The ESOP trust has waived the right to receive dividends on all shares held.
Costs are borne by the sponsoring company and written off in the period in which they are incurred.
Subject to performance conditions being achieved.
The number of options as at 29 September 2001 have been restated to reflect the adjustment applied during the year pursuant to the rules of the schemes following the rights issue announced by the Company on 20 February 2002.
The maximum aggregate number of shares over which options may currently be granted under all schemes cannot exceed 10% of the nominal share capital of the Company on the date of grant.

The Group currently accounts for pensions and other post retirement benefits under SSAP24.
Under the transitional arrangements for FRS17, the Group is required to provide additional disclosures relating to its pension and other post retirement medical schemes.
These follow the SSAP24 disclosures below.
The pension costs and balance sheet entries included in the accounts and disclosed in the notes to the financial statements have been prepared by independent, qualified actuaries.
SSAP24 a A number of the Groups full time UK employees as at 28 September 2002 are members of defined benefit arrangements with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The principal defined benefit scheme in the UK is the Berisford 1948 Pension Scheme the Berisford Scheme.
A valuation was carried out by a qualified independent actuary at 31 March 2001 using the attained age method.
Following the valuation it was agreed that the employer would pay contributions at the rate of 0% of pensionable salaries.
The main financial assumptions used in the valuation are set out below: Investment returns 5.5% p. a.
Present and future pensions 5.0% p. a.
The total market value of the Berisford Schemes assets at the last valuation date was 86.4m.
The funding level after allowing for future increases in earnings, and using a market value of assets, was 117.9%.
b Enodis Corporation maintains a 401 k plan which covers most of its employees.
This is a defined contribution arrangement.
c Scotsman Industries maintains a number of pension and 401 k plans which cover substantially all of its employees.
Benefits under defined benefit plans for hourly paid employees are based on a fixed multiple of the length of service and for salaried employees are based on a percentage of earnings during the period of their employment.
All pension plans have been funded in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
The last valuation of the main defined benefit plan was as at 1 January 2001.
No employer contributions are currently being paid to this arrangement.
The following main assumptions were used to develop net pension costs for pension plans in the USA in the 52 weeks ended 28 September 2002: Discount rate 8.5% p. a.
Future salary increases not applicable Future pension increases nil The total market value of the total US plan assets as at 28 September 2002 was 22.5m.
The funding level of the funded US plans as a percentage of accrued benefits, after allowing for future increases in earnings, and using a market value of assets, was 88%.
d Scotsman Industries also operates two post retirement medical plans.
Pension expense for the year has been calculated using the FRS17 assumptions as at 29 September 2001 disclosed below.
FRS17 In the UK, the figures for the Berisford Scheme have been based on a full actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2001, and the figures for the Whitlenge Drink Equipment Limited Retirement Benefit Scheme have been based on a full actuarial valuation as at 28 June 2002.
For the pension and post retirement medical plans in the US, the figures have been based on full actuarial valuations as at 1 January 2002, updated to the current year end.
All valuations have been updated to the year end.

Consolidated, for the debts and other liabilities of Consolidated.
Consolidated designed and manufactured home furnaces.
Enodis Corporation sold Consolidated to an unrelated party in 1998.
Shortly after the sale, Consolidated commenced bankruptcy proceedings.
The plaintiffs in these actions include Daniel L. Freeland, in his capacity as trustee of the bankruptcy estate of Consolidated, Amana, LLC, Bard Manufacturing Company, KB Home, Shapell Industries, Inc. and Shea.
In addition to the alter ego claim Freeland asserts a variety of bankruptcy and equitable claims seeking to recover up to $30m paid by Consolidated to Enodis Corporation between 1988 and 1998 and an additional $30m representing the principal amount of a promissory note issued by Consolidated to Enodis which was never paid but which was contributed in full back to the capital of Consolidated.
The actions brought by Bard and Amana are scheduled for mediation in December 2002 and for trial in April 2003.
The actions by the Trustee are scheduled for two trials, one to commence in January 2003 and the other in February 2003.
The parties recently filed cross motions for summary judgment on the claims to be tried in January 2003.
Enodis Corporation has thoroughly investigated all these claims and believes that they are without merit, and is defending them vigorously.
On February 21, 2002, Consolidated entered into a Court monitored settlement of one of the lawsuits, a California class action relating to 153,000 furnaces.
The settlement remains subject to termination until January 2003, but if it is implemented, the previous potential exposure of Consolidated of up to $600m in respect of these furnaces would be substantially eliminated.
The issue of whether Consolidated and or Enodis Corporation has insurance coverage for some or all of these contingent liabilities is the subject of reservation of rights by a number of insurance carriers and is the subject of litigation, though the carriers are co-operating in attempts to resolve the lawsuits.
Based upon its current assessments of these lawsuits and claims, the Enodis Group believes that the defence and the ultimate resolution of these lawsuits and claims would not exceed, by a material amount, the aggregate of the amounts currently accrued in respect of them.
Therefore, the defence and resolution of these lawsuits should not have a material effect on its financial condition.
However, the damages alleged in the lawsuits substantially exceed the estimate of, and accruals for, the potential exposure.
ii There are customary tax and other warranties and indemnities in respect of companies and businesses sold in previous years.
