GlaxoSmithKline is instrumental in improving the lives of Bettina and Philippe Bartels Bettina Bartels, a physiotherapist from Munich, Germany, has lived with asthma from the age of seven.
Her condition affected her involvement in sport and she also found it difficult to breathe during her favourite hobby, horse riding.
She now controls her asthma with an inhaler millions and is able to take part in activities such as swimming with her son, Philippe.
Philippe, who is nearly eight, has been able of people around the to take advantage of more modern inhalers and also understands his condition much better as a result of attending a special asthma school world every day.
where the disease and its effects are explained.
A keen footballer, Philippe plays three times a week for a local team.
When I was seven, there was not a great deal of information about asthma and how to live with it.
Today the situation has changed considerably and Philippe is able to deal much better with his asthma, said Bettina.
PATIENTS AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT GlaxoSmithKline has a tradition of creating significant improvements in asthma healthcare.
We pioneered the early standard treatments such as Ventolin in the early 1970s and in the last few years have delivered another major leap forward with Seretide Advair, the first product to treat the two main components of asthma, inflammation and bronchoconstriction, in one easy-to-use inhaler.
Development of our inhaled asthma treatments Despite these continuous advances, however, millions of people still suffer from asthma and, whilst their quality of life has improved, there is still a lot of work to do.
Whats more, the worldwide incidence of asthma is increasing.
1970s Ventolin bronchodilator 1970s Becotide Beclovent GlaxoSmithKline is still pushing the boundaries of science to learn more corticosteroid about asthma.
An exciting example of this work is the recent publication 1990s Serevent bronchodilator by our scientists of the detailed structure of a vital part of the human glucocorticoid receptor.
This receptor is known to control the response 1990s Flixotide Flovent corticosteroid to common asthma medicines and so an understanding of its structure Today Seretide Advair may lead to still more innovative therapies.

The number of asthmatics in the USA has leapt by over 60 per cent since the early 1980s and deaths have doubled to 5,000 a year.
In Western Europe, cases of asthma have doubled in ten years.
There are three million asthmatics in Japan.

ANNUAL REVIEW 2002 06|07 Over ONL10 Y % of all drugs that reach clinical trials in the pharmaceutical industry make it to the market place.
15,000 An automated compound store houses hundreds of thousands of compounds.
A number of R&D staff are based at these will interact with drug targets during screening and become potential medicines.
more than 20 sites in GlaxoSmithKline aims to have one of the largest and, more importantly, the highest quality collection in the eight countries.
The compound store pictured here at Stevenage in the UK holds nearly half a million compounds.
Work has just been completed on a stateof-the-art compound store at Tres Cantos in Spain which has capacity for over two million compounds.
Such investment in technology is already paying dividends.
GlaxoSmithKline has one of the strongest early stage pipelines in the industry.
There are currently 123 projects in clinical development.
R&D PRODUCTIVITY GlaxoSmithKlines aim is to become the most productive R&D organisation in the industry.
The merger that brought about GlaxoSmithKline accelerated a radical rethink in the way R&D is organised and conducted.
R&D at GlaxoSmithKline takes advantage of its size in areas such as genetics, molecular screening and clinical research, where scale is important.
However, in some areas of drug discovery, GlaxoSmithKline has formed six therapy-area focused and entrepreneurial units known as Centres of Excellence for Drug Discovery CEDDs.
Their brief is to focus on just one thing advancing lead compounds to the point where a therapeutic concept has been demonstrated and large-scale clinical trials can begin.
The Group has also focused enormous amounts of energy and resource on automation to broaden the scope and quicken the pace of the search for new medicines.
High throughput technology, for example, increases the number of hits identified, improves the quality of the lead compounds and reduces the time taken to optimise them for further development.
Meanwhile, we are scrutinising each step in the discovery and development process to reduce the element of chance and identify potential problems earlier.
USING INNOVATIVE SCIENCE TO ENHANCE R&D The application of the latest scientific advances to the drug discovery and Kevin Kershner, pictured right, is a member of the Transcriptome development processes will ensure GlaxoSmithKlines leadership position.

SUMMARY INFORMATION UNDER US GAAP for the year to 31st December 2002 The following is a summary of the material adjustments to profit and shareholders funds which would be required if US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP had been applied instead of UK GAAP.
These adjustments have been reflected in the income statements and balance sheet presented in accordance with US GAAP.

A summary of the material differences between UK and US GAAP that apply to the Group is set out in the Annual Report 2002.
Changes arising in 2002 are as follows: During 2002 FRS 19 Deferred tax has been implemented by the Group under UK GAAP.
This FRS requires deferred tax to be accounted for on a full provision basis, rather than a partial provision basis as in 2001 and earlier years.
This change has been accounted for as a prior period adjustment for UK GAAP purposes and comparative adjustments to arrive at US GAAP have been restated as necessary.
This change has had no impact on US GAAP results.
The Group adopted SFAS 142, Goodwill and other Intangible Assets as of 1st January 2002.
The implementation of SFAS 142 resulted in no impairment of the Groups goodwill and a revised initial impairment of 173 million 127 million net of tax on indefinite lived assets.
This is shown as a cumulative effect of an accounting change.
In addition, during 2002 the Group decided to align the measurement date for all of its pension plans.
The impact, reflected as a cumulative effect of an accounting change, was a 37 million credit, net of tax, to income.
