c Factors that may affect future tax charges Based on current capital investment plans the Group expects to continue to be able to claim capital allowances in excess of depreciation in future years.
The Group has tax losses arising from the results of its French subsidiary of 3,500,000 that are available for a restricted amount of time for offset against the future taxable profits of that company.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses, as they may not be used to offset taxable profits due to the limited length of time that the loss remains available.
