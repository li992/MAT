We have benefited from our continuing focus on margin and cost control, lower nancing costs, the strength and commitment of our management team and employees, a healthy geographic mix and a clearly dened operating strategy.
Highlights of the year were an increase in margins in all our UK operations, accomplished through both price increases and operational efficiencies, and a greatly improved result in Australia.
These achievements have offset the effect of falling volumes in the USA and weaker markets in Asia.
Strategy The fundamentals of our strategy, which is reviewed annually by the board, remain unchanged.
We will continue to: focus on our core products of aggregates, ready-mixed concrete, concrete products and bricks invest further capital to reduce operating costs and increase efficiency make disciplined bolt-on acquisitions in markets with good demographics and structure enhance our long-term mineral reserves improve or dispose of underperforming assets The USA and UK will remain our principal markets.
The long-term outlook is good for both countries, in terms of population growth and the continuing need and support for infrastructure development.
These characteristics also underpin our business in Australia.

Operations Our operations, through the strength of the underlying asset base and our strong market positions, continue to generate powerful cash ow.
Free cash ow in 2002 was 479.3m, 7.6% up on the prior year.
We use this to pay dividends and reduce our borrowings: during the year we reduced net debt by 259.8m.
It also provides the capacity to supplement organic growth through Our strength is our consistent capital investment and bolt-on acquisitions.

This enables us to reduce demerger is meeting or exceeding pro-forma expectations.
We completed a further 10 acquisitions last year for debt, invest in the business a total of 152.7m.

Choctaw Inc, the US concrete pipe and products manufacturer bought for 92.5m is proceeding ahead Christopher Collins, Chairman of schedule.
There are still many more opportunities for industry consolidation, particularly in the USA, where the top six aggregates companies have an estimated one-third of the market.
After a period of relatively modest activity, reecting the desire to conserve our financial resources, investment for growth will be a key theme for 2003.
Careful management of our asset portfolio is also a priority.
We made a number of disposals during the year, including 4 Chairman and Chief Executives overview our 50% share in North Texas Cement Company for 78.8m.
These proceeds, received after the year end, further strengthen our financial position.
In view of the heightened interest in US asbestos-related claims, in November 2002 we felt it was appropriate to provide investors with further information regarding our situation.
We have provided updated information as at December 31, 2002 in the full Annual Report.
Assuming that current trends continue, we do not expect that the costs of resolving such claims will have a material financial effect on the groups operations.
Dividend The board recommends a final dividend of 10.85p 9.55p per share see the shareholder information section for payment details.
This, together with the interim dividend paid last September, makes a total of 15.4p 14.0p for the year.
The annual increase of 10%, which reects a change to our policy, demonstrates our progressive approach to your dividend and our confidence in the cash generative nature of the business.
Over the past five years we Outlook have demonstrated our ability Looking ahead, market conditions in the USA are likely to deliver value from bolt-on to remain difficult, although continued margin focus should help to mitigate weakness in volumes and exchange rates.

highway funding programme, but anticipate a slightly Alan Murray, Chief Executive higher six year plan to be enacted in due course.
Residential demand is likely to see a modest decline from the very high levels seen in recent years.
Industrial and commercial construction is not expected to recover during 2003.
Our operations in the UK and Australia will continue to provide some protection against short-term earnings pressure in the USA.
The UK Governments infrastructure programme should provide a welcome increase in expenditure.
Early indications are that we are beginning to see a gradual increase in activity in this area.
In Australia, residential demand has slowed in recent months but infrastructure and resource-related projects should increase during the year.
As a result, we would expect to see some further progress in our Australian operations in 2003.
We continue to work to high standards of corporate governance.
This means commitment to our stakeholders and full compliance with health and safety and environmental standards.
We have a clear vision, good prospects and the people and assets to take the business forward when the climate improves.
The fundamentals which underpin your company remain strong.

Hanson products 13 Ready-mixed concrete Operating and financial review Last year we said it would be difficult to predict the Increased profit from the UK prospects for 2002, particularly for our largest division and Australia helped to offset in the USA.
We therefore put in place early in the year a number of practical measures to help compensate the effect of falling volumes for the effects of potentially lower demand for our in the USA.
These prudent steps, which focused on cost control, operational efficiency and price improvement, paid off through the year and helped the group hold pre-tax, pre-exceptional profit at 350.3m, within 0.7m of the prior year, despite a 4.3% decline in total revenue and an adverse exchange effect of 9.0m.
Basic earnings per share before exceptional items were 35.1p 5.4%.
Continuing trading profit before goodwill and exceptional items of 495.7m was 2.8% below last year.
The slight decline in profit reects the benets of the geographic spread of our operations: volume-led declines in North America of 42.3m and Asia of 5.7m were largely offset by increases in Europe of 13.5m and Australia of 20.4m.

November and December as the weather returned to more normal patterns in comparison to a very mild 2001.
This impacted on volumes in Texas, California and the North East in particular.
However, our US earnings performance was creditable given the prevailing market conditions.
US heritage margins fell by only 1.2% to 16%, demonstrating our ability to manage our businesses in a period of falling demand.
Our businesses in Europe performed well, with earnings growth of 9.6% and heritage margin improvement of 0.4% achieved.
The largest division, UK aggregates, contributed earnings growth of 5.1% and a heritage margin increase of 0.4% before reorganisation costs, despite a decline in overall product volumes of 4.1%.
14 Operating and financial review Demand tailed off from the middle of the year after a strong start, reecting general economic conditions and the impact of the UK Governments aggregates levy.
The 1.60 a tonne levy, introduced in April 2002 on all construction aggregates, was recovered in full but had an impact on sales of some lower grade products.
profit and margin growth was also achieved in Spain and the newly-restructured UK building products division, which brought together the concrete products and brick businesses.
The notable progress made in Australia was very welcome after a difficult year in 2001.
Volume and price gains across all products contributed to a significant increase in profitability, but earnings from our Asian operations were curbed by difficult market conditions, particularly in Hong Kong.
Acquisition contributions came, in the main, from the concrete pipe and products businesses Centennial in Canada and Choctaw in the USA.
In addition UK We are well placed to make acquisitions comprised a bagged aggregates operation, a soft mud brick factory and additional hollow-core further strategic bolt-on ooring operations.
In Continental Europe we acquired new quarry operations in Spain and the Czech Republic.
acquisitions and to increase All of these acquisitions complement and enhance our capital investment.
existing operations in key markets, consistent with our growth strategy.
These strategic bolt-ons are proving to be excellent additions to the current portfolio and have already exceeded initial expectations.
Alongside our acquisition programme, we continued with the disposal of underperforming and non-core assets, realising 120.7m.
The most notable of these were the sale of our Continental European bricks business for 39.3m and the sale of our 50% share in North Texas Cement Company in January 2003 to our joint-venture partner for 78.8m.
As expected, and despite the difficult trading environment in our major US markets, we have made significant progress again this year in reducing our net debt.
The strong cash ow generated by our assets has enabled us to increase our spend on bolt-on acquisitions.
We continue to invest in plant and equipment and mineral reserves whilst at the same time reducing our net debt by 259.8m to 1,169.9m.
We have now rebuilt fully our balance sheet ratios following the acquisition of Pioneer in 2000 and are therefore well placed to re-focus on investing in our operations in 2003.
2003 will be another demanding year for Hanson.
We are planning for marginally lower volumes in the USA, but expect to extract further value from the reorganised UK operations and continue the positive trends in Australia.
We will also be looking to accelerate our bolt-on acquisition programme and increase value-adding capital investment.
Our continuing strong cash ow provides significant capacity to execute this strategy in a disciplined manner.

Additionally, the opportunity for The measures taken at the start of the year, in consolidation in the industry is particular in aggregates, to mitigate potential volume excellent and this supports our declines, along with a good performance in the other businesses, were the drivers behind the divisions continued focus on this market.
These measures included modifying work schedules and reducing stock levels, overtime and maintenance programmes.
HBMA ended the year with trading profit before goodwill of 291.3m down 12.7% on sales of 1,824.2m down 6.2% reecting a drop in US construction activity and a weakening dollar.
Excluding the effects of exchange, trading profit was down 9%.

The depletion of our highly profitable Radum quarry in California 9.5m and the adverse impact of exchange 13.6m also had a major impact.
In 2002, volumes for the US aggregates industry declined for the first time since 1991, when ISTEA the landmark federal funding legislation took effect.
This decline was not unexpected given the cyclical nature of the construction materials business.
Nonetheless, demand for heavy building materials over the long term is expected to continue to grow, reecting favourable underlying demographic trends and the growth in the overall economy.
Against that backdrop HBMA is well positioned, with a broad geographic base and considerable reserves to build on.

Against this background, prices inevitably came under pressure in the second half, although the headline gure for the year showed an excellent 3% increase.

Overall, shipments improved by 2.6% but prices fell, reecting weaker demand as commercial development plummeted.
Recovery in 2003 will be difficult, particularly with the challenges facing the technology sector which had previously fuelled economic growth in the region.
Pipe and products Pipe and products saw profit slip 2.6% to 100.8m, including acquisitions, reecting a decline in heritage volumes and the adverse effects of the exchange rate.
Regionally, the performance was mixed, with generally stronger results in our principal markets in Texas and Arizona.
The Eastern and South Eastern markets, in particular, suffered from lower demand and the mid-West was highly competitive.
As a result, and with poor weather in the second half of the year also playing a part, heritage volumes were down 5.7%, but prices moved ahead 2.7%.
Pressure pipe slipped back from a record year in 2001, due mainly to lower volumes and the delay of a major project in Dallas, but good progress was made with prices across most of the regions.
The acquisitions of Centennial in Canada and Choctaw in the South Eastern USA also made an important contribution, pushing overall volumes up by 12.7%.
Overall, our order book remains relatively healthy and we expect pressure pipe to recover lost ground, aided by an expansion in production capacity which will be operational from mid-2003.

Forecasts suggest that the housing market will slow in 2003 from the very high levels seen in 2002.
However, the brick and tile division should have another good year as benets from the recent reorganisation and significant capital investment are realised.
Outlook Looking ahead, we expect volumes in most markets to be slightly lower in 2003.
It was encouraging to see some stability in the fourth quarter in our important Eastern USA and California markets, but demand in Texas dipped late in the year across all products, and the indications are that this important market will remain challenging throughout the year.

UK aggregates A major reorganisation of the UK aggregates business was completed in 2002.
This has been a significant development for the business with the establishment of a national administration centre serving seven geographical areas.
Reorganisation costs were incurred in 2002 and the benets, in particular improved customer service, will be realised in 2003.
Aggregates volumes remain a key driver to the divisions underlying results.
The encouraging start to the year was followed by an unexpected slowdown inuenced, to some extent, by the introduction of the aggregates levy in April.
This, along with a combination of poor weather in November and December and 20 Review of operations Hanson Building Materials Europe a lack of major contract work, led to overall volumes UK aggregate volumes 2002 % change over prior year period dropping by 5.6% on 2001.

There was continued buoyant demand in all our major markets, particularly Barcelona and Madrid.
The aggregates business was expanded with the acquisition of two adjoining limestone quarries near Madrid and a pair of neighbouring sand and gravel operations near Valladolid.
Our other Continental European operations increased profit by 3.8m.
Israel continued to make steady progress in a difficult economic and political environment, while there was an improvement in Germany resulting from the ongoing disposal of a number of loss-making concrete operations.
The Czech Republic benefited from heritage gains and the acquisition of two quarries in May.
Outlook The outlook for HBME is heavily inuenced by the UK.
Despite some weakness in the final quarter of 2002, we expect general market conditions to stay broadly at current levels for 2003.
The continuing stability anticipated in the housing market and growth, albeit at low levels, in the private sector should benefit our UK bricks and aggregates businesses.
In addition, our aggregates business in particular will benefit from new major infrastructure projects.
Internally, benets from the newly reorganised operations will continue to materialise.

Whilst average prices have risen by around 7% across strong population growth the year, importantly prices rose by over 15% in is expected.
the nine months to December 31, 2002 following the initial price increase on April 1. profit increased by 20.4m to 34.9m and heritage margins were up by 4.1% a welcome recovery from 2001 and a good basis for further improvement in 2003.
The prime driver for the improvement in performance was the strength of the Sydney metropolitan market, triggered by growing infrastructure, residential and commercial work, and a strong second half in the Western region, where volumes were also ahead.
In the Southern region, aggregates and concrete volumes moved forward in Melbourne and there Hanson Australia were strengthening sales in most country markets 12 months to December 31, 2002 as infrastructure spending picked up in these areas.

Looking ahead, we expect demand for our products to remain strong throughout 2003, supported by infrastructure projects in New South Wales and Victoria and resource-related projects in Western Australia and Queensland.
The substantial Sydney market looks positive, with the promise of large volumes from the cross-city tunnel and Western orbital highway towards the end of the year.
Overall, we remain committed to building on the success of 2002 and achieving acceptable returns for the division through continuing strong demand coupled with further improvement in selling prices and cost control.

The downturn in construction activity in Hong Kong, our largest operation, was the principal reason behind this performance.
Other key markets of Malaysia and Singapore remained at the depressed levels experienced in 2001.
The one notable exception to the trend was in Thailand, where a good year-on-year improvement was driven by a strong performance from the concrete operations.
In August we acquired the remaining 50% of the Sunway ready-mixed concrete joint-venture to give us a market-leading position in aggregates, asphalt and ready-mixed concrete in Malaysia.

The segmental analysis in note 1 to the accounts on page 51 of the Annual Report provides a detailed breakdown of this profit.
A description of the contribution from our four divisions is described in the preceding Review of operations on pages 16 to 25.
2002 was a challenging year, particularly in North America.
Throughout the world, we have concentrated on managing our businesses as efficiently as possible.
Cost control in declining markets is fundamental and this has been reected in our ability to restrict the reduction in margins from signicantly lower volumes in the USA.
We have benefited from the geographic spread of our operations and have seen good improvements in profitability in the UK and Australia.
Cash ow remains one of the key strengths of this group and as our balance sheet ratios were restored, we were able to renew our focus on bolt-on acquisitions.

Cash ow Operating cash ow was 585.9m, or 79.6p per share in 2002.
The cash ow generated by the operations, in difficult economic conditions, is one of the key strengths of this group.
We have successfully restored our balance sheet ratios after the acquisition of Pioneer in April 2000.
Whilst net debt has been reduced, we have still continued to invest in the infrastructure of our business and in our programme of bolt-on acquisitions.
In total, we invested 152.7m of cash in new businesses in 2002.
In addition, we have continued to invest in plant and equipment with a total spend of 143.2m, 58.2% of which was in North America and 28.9% in our European operations.

For example, in the UK a central computerised system is being used to monitor energy use at all 15 of our brick factories.
The system is the most developed in the UK brick industry and can track gas and electricity wastage and highlight possible leaks.
Its findings have been used to introduce more energy-efficient procedures.
In Australia, four ready-mixed concrete plants were honoured in the Australian Pre-mixed Concrete Associations environmental performance awards.
The awards recognise excellence in the area of environmental management.
In abandoned caverns at our Jamesville property in New York State, a hibernating colony of the Indiana brown bat was discovered.
Hanson employees worked with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation and Natural Resources and staff and students from Cornell University to ensure the safety of these mammals was guaranteed.
Blasting procedures during the hibernation period from September to May were modied to minimise shock transfer to the caverns and a seismographic monitoring programme was introduced.
We will ensure that our Jamesville property continues to provide a safe haven for the Indiana brown bat and other wildlife which inhabit the property.
One of the rarest butteries in the UK is being protected at Builth Wells quarry in Wales.

To the fullest extent permitted by the law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Companys members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Ernst & Young LLP Registered Auditor London February 20, 2003 Independent auditors statement to the members of Hanson PLC 39 Extracts from the remuneration report The full Remuneration Report, which complies with the Companies Act and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, is contained in the Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2002.
Remuneration Committee membership and terms of reference The Remuneration Committee the Committee is comprised exclusively of independent non-executive directors and its members are The Rt Hon.
Lord Baker of Dorking CH Chairman, W F Blount and The Baroness Noakes DBE.
The role of the Committee is to consider and make recommendations on the framework of executive remuneration the policy for approval by the board.
In accordance with the policy agreed, the Committee will consider, recommend as appropriate and approve the conditions of service of the executive directors, including the duration of any service agreements, and the emoluments and other benets payable under such agreements, including pension entitlements and participation in incentive arrangements.
It also oversees the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan and option schemes.
The Committee appointed Mercer Human Resource Consulting to act on behalf of the Committee in providing independent market information and remuneration advice on an ongoing basis.
The fees payable to the Chairman and the independent non-executive directors are determined by the board as a whole within the limits set by the articles of association.
The Chairman and the independent non-executive directors do not participate in or vote on any discussion relating to their own remuneration.
Remuneration policy Hanson operates in competitive and international markets.
To continue to compete successfully it is essential that the Company attracts, develops, retains and motivates talented high-calibre executive directors in the best interests of shareholders.
To ensure that its remuneration rates are competitive, whilst not being excessive, the Committee keeps remuneration under regular review in light of emerging best practice.
The remuneration policy is designed to provide packages, which take account of individual performance: i in the knowledge of what comparable, in terms of size and complexity, UK and international companies are paying: ii in the context of packages offered throughout Hanson: and iii to include short and long-term performance related elements, potentially a significant portion of total rewards, to motivate the highest performance and to align the interests of directors and shareholders.
Share incentives are considered to be an important part of the incentive policy for directors.
While there is no specic shareholding requirement for directors, shares arising from share-based incentive plans are expected to be retained.
Basic salary In setting the basic salary for each executive director, the Committee reviews relevant market data and considers the directors experience, performance and responsibilities.
Basic salaries are generally reviewed on an annual basis or following a significant change in responsibilities.
Annual bonus scheme The annual bonus scheme for the executive directors and other senior executives is aligned with changes in shareholder value through the economic value added methodology.
The main principle of economic value added is to recognise that over time a company should generate returns in excess of its operating costs and the cost of capital the return that lenders and shareholders expect of the Company each year.
The annual bonus scheme is calibrated by reference to target levels of bonus.
Each year the participant receives one-third of an accumulated bonus bank, which is updated for the years performance compared to target.
The bonus bank has two main functions: rstly it ensures that individuals do not make short-term decisions such as deferring essential expenditure from one year to the next and receive a bonus for doing so.
Secondly, the bonus bank can help as a retention tool.
Performance targets under the annual bonus scheme are set by the Committee, after taking advice from Mercer.
Long-term incentives The long-term incentive arrangements in which the directors participate are performance-related.
Under the Long Term Incentive Plan the LTIP, participants are conditionally awarded shares at nil cost in the Company with the proportion of shares which may vest subject to the achievement of performance targets over a performance period set by the Committee.
Under the Share Option Plan, participants are granted options over a number of shares in the Company but the proportion of those shares under option which may be exercised is again subject to the same performance criteria as for the LTIP.
For the conditional awards under the LTIP and grants under the share option plan, the Committee determined that 50% of the award grant should be subject to the attainment of an economic value added target and 50% to a total shareholder return TSR target.
The Committee chose these performance measurements as it believed they correlate clearly with the creation of shareholder value.
Performance review The following graph shows the TSR performance of the Company and that of the FTSE Construction & Building Materials Index over the five-year period to December 31, 2002.

Comparison of UK and US accounting principles The groups Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom UK GAAP, which differ in certain significant respects from those applicable in the United States US GAAP.
These differences relate principally to the following items, and the effect of each of the adjustments to profit available for appropriation and shareholders equity that would be required under US GAAP is set out above.
The 2001 numbers have been restated as required by APB20 to reect changes to the provisions for deferred taxes totalling 197.6m which were identied in the year ended December 31, 2001 and previously reected as a movement in shareholders equity, with consequential adjustments to goodwill and goodwill amortisation.
Goodwill Under UK GAAP prior to January 1, 1998, goodwill arising on acquisitions was written off directly to reserves.
Since January 1, 1998, all acquired goodwill has been capitalised and amortised over a period not exceeding 20 years.
On disposal of a business, the profit or loss on disposal is determined after incorporating the attributable amount of any purchased goodwill, including any previously written off to reserves.
Under US GAAP prior to January 1, 2002, goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to July 1, 2001, was capitalised and amortised over its estimated useful life, not exceeding 40 years.
Under the transition provisions of SFAS142 Goodwill and other intangible assets, goodwill which arose during the period subsequent to July 1, 2001 is capitalised, however, has not been amortised.
From January 1, 2002, goodwill is no longer amortised, but is reviewed annually for impairment.
As a result of the implementation of SFAS142, the group has recognised a charge net of tax of 8.1m of 900.4m as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
Employee Share Option Plans ESOPs Under UK GAAP, shares held by ESOPs are recorded as xed asset investments at cost.
Under US GAAP, these shares would be treated as treasury stock and deducted from shareholders equity.
Asset recognition Under UK GAAP contingent assets become recognisable in accordance with the criteria set out in Financial Reporting Standard 12 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
However, there are certain circumstances under US GAAP where an asset can only be recognised if additional criteria are met.
Pensions The cost of post-retirement benets is based on consistent percentages of employees pensionable pay as recommended by independent actuaries.
Under US GAAP, the pension cost or credit is determined by reference to the pension liability and the market value of the underlying plan assets, after adjustment to reect any previously unrecognised pension obligations or assets.
For certain pension plans within the USA, the accumulated benefit obligation at December 31, 2002 exceeded the fair value of related plan assets.
Where a pension plan has an unfunded accumulated benefit obligation, US GAAP requires such amount to be recognised as a liability in the balance sheet.
The adjustment resulting from the recognition of any such minimum liability, including the elimination of amounts previously recognised as a prepaid benefit cost, is reported as an intangible asset to the extent of unrecognised prior service cost with the remaining amount reported in comprehensive income.
Experience surpluses or deficiencies, which may result where the actual performance of the scheme differs from previous actuarial assumptions, are dealt with on an aggregate basis.
The group applies the 10% corridor test at the beginning of the year, to determine whether amortisation of the gain or loss is necessary.
Where the gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligations or the market related value the schemes assets, this is amortised over the active participants average remaining service periods.
The group also provides post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benets, mainly in the USA, under plans to certain groups of its retired and active employees.
The group conforms with the provisions of the UITF6 Accounting for post-retirement benets other than pensions, which require accruals of these costs over the period during which employees become eligible for such benets.
UITF6 permits UK parent undertakings with US subsidiaries to adopt the cost of post-retirement benets calculated for SFAS106 Employers accounting for post-retirement benets other than pensions in their SSAP24 calculations under UK GAAP, therefore there is no reconciling item in respect of the groups US post-retirement benets.
Reconciliation to US accounting principles 43 Comparison of UK and US accounting principles Comparison of UK and US accounting principles continued Deferred tax Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences, except those that relate to revaluations where no sale is in process, or where it is probable that rollover relief or losses will be applied to the gain, and also to the remittance of retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, except where no dividends have been accrued as receivable at the balance sheet date.
Under US GAAP deferred taxation liabilities are provided on all differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities.
Deferred taxation assets under US GAAP and UK GAAP are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realised.
Discontinued operations Discontinued operations are those clearly distinguishable operations and activities which either ceased or left the group in the accounting period or soon thereafter.
Under US GAAP, following the implementation of SFAS144 Accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets on January 1, 2002, the group had no differences between UK and US GAAP in respect of discontinued operations.
Acquisition accounting US GAAP requires that a deferred tax asset or liability be raised to reect the difference between the tax basis of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and their fair values at the time of acquisition.
The recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities affects the amount of goodwill recognised on acquisition.
Net income under US GAAP will differ from UK GAAP to the extent that the pattern of reversal of the temporary differences acquired differs from the pattern of goodwill amortisation.
Under UK GAAP, on acquisition, provisions for reorganisation costs are not included in the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, but are included in post-acquisition costs.
Certain reorganisation provisions under US GAAP are allowed to be included within the fair value at the time of acquisition.
Under UK GAAP, the inventories in acquired companies are valued at the lower of replacement cost and net realisable value.
Under US GAAP, inventories are recognised at the time of acquisition on the basis of expected net sales proceeds, and are amortised over its period of use.
Joint-ventures and associates Operating profit, interest and taxation in respect of joint-ventures and associates are included in the accounts separately under each appropriate heading.
Under US GAAP, profit after tax of joint-ventures and associates are included on a single line within the profit and loss account.
The main adjustments that would have been necessary to reconcile the joint-ventures and associates not domiciled within the United States to US GAAP would have been in respect of deferred tax, pensions and goodwill.
The group has not included a reconciling item for these adjustments, as the effect on net income is not material.
Dividends Under UK GAAP, final ordinary dividends are provided in the year in respect of which they are proposed on the basis of recommendation by the directors, although this requires subsequent approval by the shareholders.
Interim dividends are provided for in the period for which they are declared by the directors.
Under US GAAP, dividends are not provided until the dividend is formally declared.
Accounting for stock-based compensation The group operates an Inland Revenue approved Sharesave Scheme open to all employees, which gives a 20% discount on the fair value of its shares.
Under UK GAAP no cost is recognised on awards under such a scheme.
Under US GAAP, the 20% discount should be expensed over the vesting period.
All plans from 2000 are impacted.
The group also operates two schemes which incorporate performance criteria, the Hanson Share Option Plan and the Long Term Incentive Program LTIP.
Under UK GAAP, the cost is recognised over the performance period, based on a reasonable expectation of the extent to which the performance criteria will be met.
Adjustments to this cost are made as estimates of the final cost are updated.
Under US GAAP, the plans are treated as variable compensatory plans and the expense is based on the intrinsic value at each balance sheet date, spread over the performance period.
Under US GAAP, the group applies the methodologies set out in APB25 Accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations, and are permitted to adopt the disclosure only option under SFAS123 Accounting for stock-based compensation.
The pro forma disclosures have been omitted, as the application of SFAS123 effects earnings per share by less than 0.01p per share.
Derivative instruments and hedging activities The group enters into derivative instruments to limit its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
Under UK GAAP, these instruments are measured at cost and accounted for as hedges, whereby gains and losses are deferred until the underlying transaction occurs.
Under US GAAP, derivative instruments, whether designated as a hedge or not, are required to be recognised on the balance sheet at fair value.
As the group has elected not to adopt hedge accounting under SFAS133 Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, the net income statement fully includes the changes in fair value of the derivatives.
In addition, transition adjustments were required to include the fair value of derivatives on the balance sheet on the adoption of SFAS133 at January 1, 2001.
For those derivatives considered as fair value hedges, the January 1, 2001 opening fair value of 17.1m was shown as current assets and liabilities derivatives and as an adjustment to debt.
The adjustment to debt is being subsequently amortised through the income statement over the residual life of the debt.
For those derivatives considered as cash ow hedges, the January 1, 2001 opening value of 0.5m was shown as current assets and liabilities derivatives and as an adjustment to other comprehensive income.
The amounts in other comprehensive income are recognised as adjustments to interest expense in future periods as the related cash ows are recognised.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on disposal of business Under UK GAAP, cumulative foreign exchange gains and losses on disposal are adjusted within reserves.
Under US GAAP, these gains and losses are included in determining the profit or loss on disposal of the business.
