The nature of the DLC On 29 June 2001, BHP Billiton Plc previously known as Billiton Plc, merger has resulted in the inclusion of amounts attributable to the a UK listed company, and BHP Billiton Limited previously known as shareholders of both BHP Billiton Plc and BHP Billiton Limited in capital BHP Limited, an Australian listed company, entered into a Dual Listed and reserves on the balance sheet, and in attributable profit.
This was effected by contractual arrangements between the companies and amendments to their constitutional The substance of the DLC merger of BHP Billiton Plc and BHP Billiton documents.
Limited required that merger accounting was applied in accounting for the combination.
This is because: The effect of the DLC merger is that BHP Billiton Plc and its subsidiaries the BHP Billiton Plc Group and BHP Billiton Limited and its subsidiaries No party has ever been portrayed as either the acquirer or the acquired, the BHP Billiton Limited Group operate together as a single economic either by its own Board or management during the process: entity the BHP Billiton Group, with neither assuming a dominant role.
All the parties to the combination clearly participated, on a consensual Under the arrangements: basis, in establishing the management structure of and key positions in The shareholders of BHP Billiton Plc and BHP Billiton Limited have a the combined entity: common economic interest in both groups: Neither party dominates the other and this has been borne out in The shareholders of BHP Billiton Plc and BHP Billiton Limited take key practice since the merger: decisions, including the election of Directors, through a joint electoral Consideration was wholly equity shares in the BHP Billiton Group: and procedure under which the shareholders of the two companies effectively vote on a joint basis: Neither set of shareholders retained an interest in the future performance of only part of the combined Group.
BHP Billiton Plc and BHP Billiton Limited have a common Board of Directors, a unified management structure and joint objectives: Subsequent events continue to bear this out: Dividends and capital distributions made by the two companies are The initiation and continuation of the combined BHP Billiton name, equalised: and logo and trademarks as the approved nomenclature of the merged Group: BHP Billiton Plc and BHP Billiton Limited each executed a deed poll guarantee, guaranteeing subject to certain exceptions the contractual The creation of a new Customer Sector Group segment structure within obligations whether actual or contingent, primary or secondary of the the BHP Billiton Group reflecting a new approach to management of other incurred after 29 June 2001 together with specified obligations customer-based groupings of assets, which reflects neither the previous existing at that date.

Whilst this might indicate that BHP Billiton The DLC merger did not involve the change of legal ownership of any Limited would dominate the BHP Billiton Group, BHP Billiton rebuts the assets of BHP Billiton Plc or BHP Billiton Limited, any change of ownership UK GAAP presumption of dominance on the grounds that the initial of any existing shares or securities of BHP Billiton Plc or BHP Billiton composition of the Board and the formally constituted Committees of the Limited, the issue of any shares or securities or any payment by way of Board indicated that BHP Billiton Plc had a greater degree of influence than consideration, save for the issue by each Company of one special voting its proportion of voting rights would demand, and the Nominations share to a trustee company which is the means by which the joint electoral Committee which comprises two legacy BHP Billiton Limited Directors and procedure is operated.
In addition, to achieve a position where the two legacy BHP Billiton Plc Directors effectively blocks the ability of the economic and voting interests of one share in BHP Billiton Plc and one legacy BHP Billiton Limited Directors to alter the balance of legacy BHP share in BHP Billiton Limited were identical, BHP Billiton Limited made a Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc Directors on the Board of the merged bonus issue of ordinary shares to the holders of its ordinary shares.

Treatment of the DLC merger for accounting purposes The Board is of the view that there has clearly been no dominance Under UK generally accepted accounting principles GAAP, the DLC or attempts to exert a dominant influence in practice since the merger is treated as a business combination because a single economic announcement of the merger.
Actions since the merger continue to entity has been formed, even though BHP Billiton Plc and BHP Billiton support the view that the substance of the transaction was that of Limited remain separate legal entities.
statements of BHP Billiton Plc therefore include those of BHP Billiton Limited and its subsidiary companies in accordance with the requirements of s227 5 of the Companies Act 1985.
77 Financial Statements BHP Billiton Plc Dual Listed Companies Structure and Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements continued BHP Billiton Limiteds plans for the business now referred to as BHP Steel were part of a strategy for its entire steel business.
This had prior to the DLC merger included the spin-out of another part of the steel business, this was OneSteel in October 2000, and the closure of a major steel works in Australia in September 1999.
BHP Billiton, in making the announcement about its plans for the demerger, did not make this a condition of merger nor was it a related arrangement.
The shareholders of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc were not asked to vote on the BHP Steel demerger at the time of the votes on the DLC merger.
This demerger transaction was some way off at the time of merger and was conditional on shareholder votes by both BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc shareholders and the approval by the courts in Australia.
The demerger resulted in the shareholders of both BHP Billiton Plc and BHP Billiton Limited receiving their share of the value of BHP Steel upon demerger albeit that the shareholders of BHP Billiton Plc received this in the form of a greater share of the remaining BHP Billiton Group and BHP Billiton Limited shareholders received it in the form of shares in BHP Steel.
Both shareholder groups enjoyed the economic benefits of ownership of BHP Steel from the consummation of the merger to the date of demerger.

The Directors present earnings per share data based on earnings excluding exceptional items as this is a less volatile measure of the performance of the BHP Billiton Group.
Under the terms of the DLC merger, the rights to dividends of a holder of an ordinary share in BHP Billiton Plc and a holder of an ordinary share in BHP Billiton Limited are identical.
Consequently, earnings per share has been calculated on the basis of the aggregate number of ordinary shares ranking for dividend.
The weighted average number of shares used for the purposes of calculating basic earnings per share is calculated after deduction of the shares held by the share repurchase scheme and the Billiton Employee Share Ownership Trust and adjusting for the BHP Billiton Limited bonus issue effective 29 June 2001.
The weighted average number of shares used for the purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share can be reconciled to the number used to calculate basic earnings per share as follows: 2002 2001 2000 Number of shares Million Million Million Basic earnings per share denominator 6 029 5 944 5 725 BHP Billiton Limited options 11 12 6 BHP Billiton Limited partly paid shares 2 35 BHP Billiton Plc executive share awards 14 Diluted earnings per share denominator 6 042 5 973 5 736 106 13 INTANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS Negative Negative Goodwill goodwill Total Goodwill goodwill Total 2002 2002 2002 2001 2001 2001 US$M US$M US$M US$M US$M US$M Cost At beginning of year 114 46 68 220 60 160 Additions 51 51 Disposals 13 13 136 14 122 a Other movements 38 38 Exchange variations 21 21 At end of year 63 46 17 114 46 68 Amortisation At beginning of year 19 10 9 93 7 86 Amortisation for year 6 3 3 9 3 6 Disposals 4 4 72 72 Exchange variations 11 11 At end of year 21 13 8 19 10 9 Net book value at end of year 42 33 9 95 36 59 Net book value at beginning of year 95 36 59 127 53 74 a Refer note 26.

53 884 402 ordinary shares were purchased in the two years ended to 30 June 2000 at an aggregate purchase price of US$118 million, which were funded by the BHP Billiton Group.
The cost of purchasing these shares was deducted from shareholders funds.
There was no intention to trade these shares and no dividends were paid in respect of them outside the BHP Billiton Group.
Normally, The Companies Act 1985 requires that interests in own shares be included in the balance sheet as an asset.
However, in this case the Directors considered that the arrangements were such that the shares owned by Strand Investment Holdings Limited had effectively been repurchased by the BHP Billiton Group and so did not constitute an asset of the BHP Billiton Group and that to show them as such would fail to show a true and fair view.
During the year ended 30 June 2001 these shares were reissued and no shares were held by Strand Investment Holdings Limited at that date.
Nor are any such shares held by Strand Investment Holdings Limited at 30 June 2002.
Strand Investment Holdings Limited was consolidated as part of the BHP Billiton Group in each of the years described.

28 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS The BHP Billiton Group operates or participates in a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The more significant schemes relate to businesses in Australia, South Africa, the US and Canada.
2002 2001 2000 US$M US$M US$M The pension charge for the year is as follows: Defined contribution schemes 61 66 45 Industry-wide schemes 18 21 25 Defined benefit schemes Regular cost 59 48 111 Variation cost 14 13 22 Interest cost 18 4 134 126 159 To the extent that there is a difference between pension cost and contributions paid, a prepayment or creditor arises.
The accumulated difference provided in the balance sheet at 30 June 2002 gives rise to a prepayment of US$225 million 2001: prepayment of US$191 million: 2000: prepayment of US$208 million.
The assets of the defined contribution schemes are held separately in independently administered funds.
The charge in respect of these schemes is calculated on the basis of contributions due in the financial year.
The industry-wide schemes in South Africa are accounted for on the basis of contributions due in the financial year.
The remaining pension schemes are defined benefit schemes.
Some of the defined benefit schemes have their assets held separately in independently administered funds and others are unfunded.
The pension costs and funding for these schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of professionally qualified actuaries based on the most recent actuarial valuations available.
The actuarial valuations for SSAP 24 purposes determined pension costs using the projected unit method for most schemes.
There are exceptions for some schemes that are closed to new members where the attained age method was used.
The assumptions used varied by scheme.
For the purposes of calculating the accounting charge, surpluses or deficiencies will be recognised through the variation cost component in future accounting periods as a level percentage of payroll.
130 28 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS continued Of the significant funded schemes there were 19 with funding levels ranging from 61 per cent to 167 per cent.
These funding levels are based on a mix of market values and actuarial values of the assets.
At the date of the most recent actuarial valuations, the combined market value of these schemes assets was US$1754 million.
For the four largest schemes, the main economic assumptions used, market and actuarial value of assets and funding levels at the respective dates of the most recent formal actuarial valuations are as follows: Pension Plan BHP Billiton for Hourly Employees BHP USA Retirement New Zealand Superannuation Fund of BHP Copper Inc Income Plan Steel Pension Fund Country Australia USA USA New Zealand Date of valuation 1 July 2000 1 Jan 2001 1 Jan 2001 31 March 2001 Investment return 9.0% 8% 8% 6% Salary growth 6.0% n a 4.5% 4% Pension increases 0% 0% 0% 0% Asset valuation method Market value Market value 5-year smoothing Market value Market value of fund US$ million 801 208 150 42 Actuarial value of fund US$ million 801 208 141 42 Funding level 120% 121% 113% 64% The BHP Billiton Group provides healthcare benefits, which are not pre-funded, for retired employees and their dependants in South Africa, the US, Canada and Suriname.
The post-retirement benefit charge, net of employees and retirees contributions paid, in respect of these benefits was US$2 million 2001: US$6 million including exchange variations of US$14 million 2001: US$9 million.
The charge has been calculated in accordance with UK applicable accounting standards.
Where there is a surplus or deficiency between the accrued liability and the provision recorded, the resulting amount is spread forward over future working lifetimes through the variation cost component as a level percentage of payroll.
The main actuarial assumptions used in the most recent actuarial valuations of these benefits are as follows: South Africa US Canada Suriname Ultimate healthcare inflation rate 8% 5.5% 3% 5% Discount rate 12% 7.75% 6.5% 6.5% FRS17 Retirement Benefits Whilst the SSAP24 disclosure and measurement principles have been applied in accounting for pensions and post-retirement medical benefits in these financial statements, additional disclosures are provided under FRS 17 Retirement benefits.
The eventual aim of FRS 17 is to move from a long-term approach under SSAP24 to a market-based approach in valuing the assets and liabilities arising from an employers retirement benefit obligations and any related funding.
Currently, FRS17 only has to be applied to disclosures.
This is the second year that disclosures have been made for the BHP Billiton Group under FRS17, and this year they extend to performance statement information for the first time.
The BHP Billiton Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes in Australia and New Zealand, Canada, the US, Europe, South Africa and South America.
Full actuarial valuations for most schemes were carried out as at 30 June 2002 by local actuaries.
For a minority of plans it has been necessary to roll forward liabilities calculated using earlier data.

Under this Act, surpluses in pension funds have to be used in a manner specified under Regulations to the Act, to improve current and former members benefits prior to the employer obtaining any benefit from the surpluses.
Consequently, it is considered unlikely that any BHP Billiton Plc Group companies will obtain any benefit from the surpluses in the South African schemes.
Therefore the reduction in the recognised surpluses in South Africa is recognised as an actuarial loss in the STRGL.

Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidated sale.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
When market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
The estimated fair values have been determined using market information and appropriate valuation methodologies, but are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the BHP Billiton Group could realise in the normal course of business.
The fair value of the BHP Billiton Groups financial instruments is as follows: Book value Fair value Book value Fair value 2002 2002 2001 2001 US$M US$M US$M US$M Primary and derivative financial instruments held or issued to finance the BHP Billiton Groups operations Short-term borrowings 2 895 2 915 2 145 2 162 Long-term borrowings and other creditors 5 658 5 978 6 886 6 921 Cross currency contracts Principal 189 189 375 375 Interest rate 57 45 Finance lease swap 26 28 26 34 Interest rate swaps 10 9 8 338 8 609 8 630 8 620 Cash and money market deposits 1 499 1 499 1 285 1 285 Loans to joint ventures and associates 488 488 438 438 Current asset investments 11 7 1 1 7 215 237 Fixed asset investments excluding investment in own shares 496 516 473 483 Investment in exploration companies refer note 15 11 5 Other debtors to be settled in cash 435 413 311 276 Derivative financial instruments held to hedge the BHP Billiton Groups exposure on expected future sales and purchases Forward commodity contracts 2 10 Forward foreign currency contracts 162 615 5 303 5 729 5 908 6 501 Foreign currency assets and liabilities that are hedged using currency contracts are translated at the forward rate inherent in the contract.

Ok Tedi, Papua New Guinea The BHP Billiton Group completed its withdrawal from the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua New Guinea in February 2002 with the transfer of its 52 per cent equity stake to PNG Sustainable Development Program Limited Program Company, a development fund that will operate for the benefit of the Papua New Guinean people.
The Program Company will operate independently and will utilise future dividend payments arising from the BHP Billiton Groups transferred shareholding in Ok Tedi Mining Limited OTML to fund current and long-term sustainable development projects in Papua New Guinea, particularly the Western Province.
Following the transfer of BHP Billitons shareholding, the equity participants in OTML are: PNG Sustainable Development Program Limited 52 per cent : the State of Papua New Guinea 30 per cent and Inmet Mining Corporation 18 per cent.
OTML will continue to operate the mine on behalf of the shareholders.
Additionally the withdrawal agreement requires cash provisioning by OTML for mine closure and provides a scheme for retention of a responsible and skilled mine management team including transfer of existing BHP Billiton Group Ok Tedi staff to OTML.
The BHP Billiton Group will also provide financial support to the Program Company by way of a fully repayable, interest free funding facility of US$100 million for a period of three years until it has built up its own fund with repayment arrangements if these are used.
As any allocations from the funding facility are fully repayable, BHP Billitons assessment is that these arrangements do not require provisioning in the BHP Billiton Groups accounts.
The financial support provided by the BHP Billiton Group will ensure the Program Company has immediate access to finance for environmental remediation or other capital requirements, in accordance with its shareholder obligations, prior to the accumulation of sufficient funds in the Program Company from future dividend flows.
Following the equity transfer, the BHP Billiton Group will no longer benefit financially from the Ok Tedi mine operations and, as a result, the BHP Billiton Group negotiated the agreement for its withdrawal to provide protection from any future liabilities including legal claims.
The legal arrangements encompass a series of legal releases, indemnities and warranties that safeguard the BHP Billiton Groups interests following its formal exit from the project.

Our reserves have been calculated using the economic interest method and represent our net interest volumes after deduction of applicable royalty, fuel and flare volumes.
Our reserves have been subjected to economic tests specified in Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 69 to demonstrate their commerciality under prices and costs existing at the time of the estimates.
Our reserves include certain quantities of oil, condensate and LPG which will be produced under arrangements that involve us in upstream risks and rewards but do not transfer ownership of the products to us.
Our reserves also include volumes calculated by probabilistic aggregation of certain fields that share common infrastructure.
These aggregation procedures result in enterprise-wide proved reserves volumes, which may not be realised upon divestment on an individual property basis.

b Predominantly includes the effect of a change in policy for providing expenditure for restoration and rehabilitation.
At 30 June 2001, this policy was changed such that a provision for full cost expected to be incurred at the end of the life of each asset on a discounted to net present value basis is recognised at the beginning of each project and capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
The capitalised cost is amortised over the life of the operation and the annual increase in the net present value of the provision for the expected cost is included in expenses from ordinary activities.
c Amounts shown exclude general corporate overheads, interest income and borrowing costs, and downstream processing of oil and gas into products for resale and, accordingly, do not represent all of the operations attributable to the petroleum segment presented in note 4.

172 35 SUPPLEMENTARY OIL AND GAS INFORMATION UNAUDITED continued Standardised Measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves Standardised Measure unaudited The purpose of this disclosure is to provide data with respect to the estimated future net cash flows from future production of proved developed and undeveloped reserves of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas.
The Standardised Measure is based on the BHP Billiton Groups estimated proved reserves, as presented in the section Reserves and this data should be read in conjunction with that disclosure, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this section.
The Standardised Measure is prepared on a basis which presumes that year end economic and operating conditions will continue over the periods in which year end proved reserves would be produced.
The effects of future inflation, future changes in exchange rates and expected future changes in technology, taxes and operating practices have not been included.
The Standardised Measure is prepared by projecting the estimated future annual production of proved reserves owned at period end and pricing that future production at prices in effect at period end to derive future cash inflows.
Future price increases may be considered only to the extent that they are provided by fixed contractual arrangements in effect at period end and are not dependent upon future inflation or exchange rate changes.
Future cash inflows are then reduced by future costs of producing and developing the period end proved reserves based on costs in effect at period end without regard to future inflation or changes in technology or operating practices.
Future development costs include the costs of drilling and equipping development wells and construction of platforms and production facilities to gain access to proved reserves owned at period end.
They also include future costs, net of residual salvage value, associated with the abandonment of wells, dismantling of production platforms and restoration of drilling sites.
Future cash inflows are further reduced by future income taxes based on tax rates in effect at period end and after considering the future deductions and credits applicable to proved properties owned at period end.
The resultant annual future net cash flows after deductions of operating costs including resource rent taxes, development costs and income taxes are discounted at 10 per cent per annum to derive the Standardised Measure.
There are many important variables, assumptions and imprecisions inherent in developing the Standardised Measure, the most important of which are the level of proved reserves and the rate of production thereof.
The Standardised Measure is not an estimate of the fair market value of the BHP Billiton Groups oil and gas reserves.
An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves, anticipated future changes in prices, costs and exchange rates, anticipated future changes in secondary tax and income tax rates and alternative discount factors representing the time value of money and adjustments for risks inherent in producing oil and gas.

6 Change in the Ore Reserve tonnages during the year results from depletion through production: changes in the geological model: more rigorous resource classification: change in recovery factors due to the implementation of new long-term metallurgical performance predictive models: and recalculation of economic pit shells and associated cut-off grades, using a combination of copper price and cost scenarios applicable to the expanded Escondida operation.
Low Grade Ore is now renamed LG Float Ore, a Mixed Ore reserve is reported for the first time, reflecting inclusion of this ore stream in the mine plan: Mixed Ore initially will be processed though the existing Oxide leach facilities.
Measured resource for Mixed has been downgraded to Probable reserve to reflect uncertainty in some of the modifying factors.
Ore reserves quoted are generated using Measured, Indicated and Inferred resources for Sulphide and Oxide material types only.
This practice allows the maximum size of the pit to be used in strategic mine planning activities and reasonably reflects the future mining potential of the deposit, subject to future infill drilling.
Reported Proved and Probable Reserves are derived from Measured and Indicated resources only within the Ultimate Pit, after modifying factors have been applied.
The ultimate pit obtained by removal of Inferred resources from the pit optimisation is smaller, and as a result has a lower reserve base.
Proved and Probable Reserves in this smaller pit are reduced to: Sulphide Ore: 1 443 Mt at 1.25 per cent TCu, LG Float Ore: 456 Mt at 0.60 per cent TCu, Mixed Ore: 45 Mt at 1.08 per cent TCu and 0.46 per cent SCu, and Oxide Ore: 202 Mt at 0.70 per cent SCu.
Stockpiled material above respective cut-offs is included as Proved Ore. 7 Tintaya Sulphide production was temporarily halted in November 2001 as a reaction to oversupply in the global copper market, and the oxide operation was commissioned during the year.
8 The mining and processing of 29.5 million tonnes of ore during the year depleted the Ore Reserve.
A new pit design and phase sequencing has added 15.6 million tonnes at 0.5 per cent Cu and 0.5 g t Au to the Ore Reserve.
The Proved Reserve includes 104.4 million tonnes at 0.4 per cent Cu, 0.4 g t Au of Medium and Low-Grade material stockpiled for future treatment.
Identified Mineral Resources are estimated using Ordinary Kriging interpolation to a geologically constrained block model from an assay database comprising some 53 000 metres of diamond drilling and 14 000 metres of reverse circulation drilling.
Ore Reserves are based on a life-of-mine production schedule generated from pit optimisation studies on the resource block model and are reported on the basis of a payable copper equivalent cut-off grade of 0.28 per cent, with the equivalent grade taking into account copper and gold grades and metallurgical recoveries.
The recoverable copper equivalent grade of 0.28 per cent represents in situ copper and gold grades generally in the range of 0.15 per cent Cu, 0.40 g t Au to 0.25 per cent Cu, 0.24 g t Au.
Mineralisation outside the current life-of-mine plan ultimate pit shell is no longer reported as Mineral Resource additional to the Ore Reserve.
On current projections of likely technical and economic conditions, reasonable prospects for mining to extend outside the LOM ultimate pit are not considered to exist.
Consequently, this mineralisation is no longer reported, in compliance with 1999 JORC Code and Guidelines.
Primary sulphide mineralisation comprises disseminated, vein and fracture controlled chalcopyrite in altered Dacite and Andesite host rocks, with chalcocite and covellite in the enriched zone.
9 The Pering reserve estimate is as at 1 January 2002.
The reserves include stockpile material totalling 0.04Mt at 1.15 per cent Zn and 0.52 per cent Pb, and as has been announced the mine will close in approximately six months.
