Therefore, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 s. 275, diminutions on certain fixed assets have been treated as unrealised losses.
In order to reflect this, a transfer of 68m 2001: 170m in respect of these diminutions has been made to the profit and loss account from the revaluation reserve.
Subordinated liabilities On 18 November 1996 FP Finance PLC, a wholly owned subsidiary undertaking, issued 215m of 9.125% Undated Subordinated Guaranteed Bonds guaranteed by FPLO.
Redemption is at the option of FP Finance PLC and is not generally allowable prior to 25 November 2006.
The bonds were guaranteed on a subordinated basis by FPLO after the claims of FPLOs senior creditors, including all policyholder liabilities.
On 9 July 2001, under the Scheme, FPLP replaced FPLO as the guarantor.

The amount of reinsurance cover at 31 December 2002 was 530m 2001: 600m.
Included within the reinsurers share of long-term business provision of 806m for 2001 was an amount of 702m, representing the estimated amount recoverable in the event of a claim under the stoploss contract including the recovery of 400m of future premiums payable over the lifetime of the contract.
As the contract only pays out in the event of the company having failed to generate sufficient future surpluses to meet its final life policy claim payments, deferred acquisition costs, which are deferred only to the extent that they are recoverable out of future margins, to the value of 302m, were not recognised in the consolidated balance sheet for 2001.
In 2002, no amount is included within the reinsurers share of long-term business provision in respect of the stoploss contract.
Accordingly, deferred acquisition costs have been recognised in full in the consolidated balance sheet.
This change in presentation has no effect on the fund for future appropriations.

Long-term business provision The long-term business provision is calculated on the basis of recognised actuarial methods with due regard to actuarial principles and best practice.
The methodology takes into account risks and uncertainties of the particular classes of long-term business written and the results are certified by the professionals undertaking the valuations.
Calculations are made on an individual policy basis, however where any global provisions are made these are calculated using statistical or mathematical methods.
These results are expected to be approximately the same as if an individual liability was calculated for each long-term contract.
Specific material uncertainties arise in respect of guaranteed annuity options, where the option will only be of value to the policyholder if the economic conditions assumed exist at the time of retirement.
The long-term business provision is sensitive to the principal assumptions in respect of interest rates and mortality, although the relative sensitivity will vary depending on the class of long-term business.
The principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the long-term business provision are set out below: Valuation interest rates 31 Dec 2002 31 Dec 2001 %% Class of Business Life Fund: Conventional With Profit 3.4 2.7 Unitised With Profit 3.2 3.3 Unit-linked 3.2 3.5 Term assurance 3.2 3.5 Income protection 4.0 4.8 Pension business and annuity funds: With Profit deferred annuities for the self-employed 4.3 3.3 Deferred annuity under pension schemes: With Profit main series 3.9 4.0 With Profit UK Provident series 4.3 3.3 Unitised With Profit 3.9 4.0 Annuities in payment 4.8 5.2 The valuation interest rates for some classes of With Profit business for which there is no longer any net reinvestment have been set having regard to the yield on the backing assets.
Cashable deferred annuities are valued at the greater of the value of the cash option or the annuity discounted at 4.4% 2001: 4.5% per annum in payment.
Where a guaranteed annuity option is more valuable than the cash equivalent, it is assumed that 15% to 23% of the benefit is taken as tax free cash.
Single premium income protection contracts have been valued as 90% of the last three years premiums plus an allowance for outstanding claims in respect of earlier premiums.
The provision for linked contracts is equal to the value of units.
A non-unit liability consisting mainly of a sterling reserve calculated by carrying out cash flow projections on appropriate basis, including allowance for future expenses, is included within the long-term business provision.
Accumulating With Profit business main series With Profit deferred annuities and unitised With Profit business is valued in a similar way to linked business and includes an allowance for future bonuses and surrender values.

The remaining terms of the leases are up to 12 years.
Assumptions as to whether each leasehold property may be sub-let or assigned in the future have been made.
The discount rate applied to expected future cash flows is 5%.
Other The recategorisation to debtors arising out of insurance operations intermediaries, relates to the recategorisation of an amount recoverable from intermediaries of 18m 2001: 6m.
The recoverable amount in 2001 was offset against, and therefore reduced, the related provision for the repayment of premium rebates to reinsurers included within other provisions.

Provision for pension transfers and opt-outs In accordance with guidance issued by the Financial Services Authority and the Personal Investment Authority, FPLP, FP Life Assurance Limited and Friends Provident Pensions Limited formerly Friends Provident Corporate Pensions Limited have reviewed the appropriateness of advice given to policyholders who effected personal pensions contracts after 1988.
These reviews have now been substantially completed.
51m 2001: 73m remains within the long-term business provision in respect of residual associated costs and contingencies.
Capital expenditure for which provision has not been made in the financial statements of the Group is estimated as follows Company: Nil : Property Other Property Other 2002 2002 2001 2001 m m m m Contracted for 3.6 1.2 8.4 b.
The Group had annual commitments under non-cancellable operating leases for which no provision had been made in the financial statements, as follows Company: Nil : Land and Land and buildings Other buildings Other 2002 2002 2001 2001 m m m m Operating leases which expire: within one year 1.4 2.7 1.1 2.5 in the second to fifth years inclusive 1.0 0.9 after five years 8.4 7.1 c. The obligations under finance leases for the Group fall due Company: Nil : 2002 2001 m m within one year 0.5 0.8 in the second to fifth years inclusive 0.5 1.5 Commitments under non-cancellable leases represent 1.1m of obligations under finance leases and 0.1m of prepaid finance charges.
Contingent liabilities Market falls during 2002 have led to a considerable increase in the number of complaints received by the industry in respect of endowment policies.
All such complaints received by the Group, and an estimate of complaints not yet received, have been provided for at an estimate of the likely cost of settling such complaints.
Future regulatory actions or statements could increase the estimated costs.
The impact of such potential future actions cannot be estimated with reliability.
Provisions for liabilities in connection with policyholder contracts are based on best estimate assumptions, using historical experience but adjusted where there is reasonable cause to expect future experience to be different.
However, actual experience may differ from that assumed.
Regulatory action, legal judgments, future economic conditions or other unforeseen events may impact ultimate settlements made.
On 23 December 2002 the Inland Revenue issued a press release announcing measures to improve the effectiveness and fairness of the tax rules for life insurance companies.
The draft clause and schedule to be included in the Finance Bill 2003 was issued on 21 January 2003.
The Inland Revenue proposals as finally enacted may have an impact on Friends Provident Life and Pensions Limited FPLP.
However, as discussions are continuing between the Inland Revenue and the Industry on the measures proposed, there remains uncertainty over the nature and extent of the measures.
As a consequence, the directors are unable to quantify the corporation tax impact on FPLP.
