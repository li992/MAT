Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated accounts 87 Unilever Group 17 Pensions and similar obligations Description of Plans In most countries the Group operates dened benefit pension plans based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
The majority of these plans are externally funded: for the unfunded plans, provisions are maintained in the Group balance sheet.
The Group also provides other post-retirement benets, mainly post-retirement medical benets in the United States.
These plans are predominantly unfunded, with provisions maintained in the Group balance sheet.
The Group also operates a number of dened contribution plans, the assets of which are held in independently administered funds.
The pension costs charged to the profit and loss account in respect of these plans represent the contributions payable by the Group to these funds.
Accounting policies The Group currently accounts for pensions under the United Kingdom accounting standard SSAP 24.
The objective of the standard is to spread pension costs systematically over the service lives of employees and for the regular costs to be a reasonably stable percentage of pay.
Other post-retirement arrangements are currently accounted for in accordance with United States accounting standards SFAS 106 and SFAS 112 which apply principles similar to those for pensions in the UK.
All plans are subject to regular actuarial review using the projected unit method, either by external consultants or by actuaries employed by Unilever.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligations vary according to the country in which the plan is situated.
In line with the accounting objective, assumptions are generally set reecting long-term expectations and asset values are smoothed relative to market values.
The UK Accounting Standards Board also requires companies to provide disclosures based on FRS 17, the objective of which is to present the pension and other post retirement benefit plans assets and liabilities at their fair value at the balance sheet date.
Unilever will fully adopt FRS 17 as the basis for pension accounting from 1 January 2003.
FRS 17 disclosures are given on pages 89 to 91.

The results of the valuations for the principal pension plans that represent 90% of all dened benefit pension plans by market value of assets and net provisions have been updated to the year end to provide the following aggregated information: million million million million 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2002 2001 2002 2001 Other post retirement Pension plans benefit plans Actuarial value of assets at the last valuation date 15 515 16 762 2 3 Provisions 3 147 3 318 1 073 1 284 Prepayments 840 917 Liabilities 16 590 16 306 1 042 1 210 a Financing level % 107% 118% 103% 106% Actual market value of assets 12 725 16 976 2 3 a Actuarial value of assets plus net provision as % of liabilities.
The actuarial value of assets is generally a smoothed market value determined by spreading gains and losses relative to the actuarial basis over a three-to-five-year period.
Assumptions The long-term average assumptions used for valuing the principal pension plans, weighted by liabilities, were: 31 December 31 December 2002 2001 Interest rate 6.0% 7.0% Ination 2.4% 3.0% Salary increases 3.7% 4.3% Pension increases 2.2% 2.9% Assumptions for the remaining dened benefit plans vary considerably depending on the economic conditions of the country where they are situated.
For the most significant plans representing over 75% of all dened benefit plans by liabilities the assumptions at 31 December 2002 were: United Kingdom Netherlands United States Germany Interest rate 5.4% 6.5% 6.5% 5.8% Ination 2.2% 2.5% 2.5% 2.0% Salary increases 3.7% 3.3% 4.5% 2.8% Pension increases 2.5% 2.5% 0.0% 2.0% Pension contributions to funded pension plans are reviewed regularly.
Following the latest reviews in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany, decisions have been made to recommence contributions in both the UK and Germany and the cash impact of this is expected to be 46 million in 2003.
Unilever Annual Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated accounts 89 Unilever Group 17 Pensions and similar obligations continued FRS 17 Disclosures With the objective of presenting pensions and other post retirement benefit plans assets and liabilities at their fair value on the balance sheet, assumptions for FRS 17 are set by reference to market conditions at the balance sheet date.
As such, there will be differences between the assumptions used in SSAP 24 and those under FRS 17 and the values placed on assets and liabilities.
Assumptions The major market-based actuarial assumptions, weighted by liabilities, used to value the principal dened benefit pension plans and plans providing other post-retirement benets and the expected long-term rates of return on assets, weighted by asset value, were: 31 Dec 2002 31 Dec 2001 31 Dec 2000 Principal Other Principal Other Principal Other dened benefit post retirement dened benefit post retirement dened benefit post retirement pension plans benefit plans pension plans benefit plans pension plans benefit plans Discount rate 5.70% 6.50% 6.00% 7.25% 6.20% 7.50% Ination assumption 2.30% n a 2.25% n a 2.50% n a Rate of increase in salaries 3.60% 4.30% 3.50% 4.50% 3.80% 4.50% Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.20% n a 2.00% n a 2.10% n a Rate of increase for pensions in deferment where provided 2.60% n a 1.50% n a 2.30% n a a Long-term medical cost ination n a 4.90% n a 5.00% n a 5.00% Expected long-term rates of return: Equities 8.20% 9.00% 8.40% Bonds 4.90% 5.50% 5.30% Others 5.40% 6.00% 5.30% a The valuations of other benefit plans generally assume a higher initial level of medical cost ination, which falls from 10% to the long-term rate within the next five years.
Assumptions for the remaining dened benets plans vary considerably depending on the economic conditions of the country where they are situated.
For the most significant pension plans, representing over 75% of all dened benefit plans by liabilities, the assumptions at 31 December 2002 were: United Kingdom Netherlands United States Germany Discount rate 5.50% 5.40% 6.50% 5.40% Ination assumption 2.25% 2.25% 2.50% 2.00% Rate of increase in salaries 3.75% 3.00% 4.50% 2.75% Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.50% 2.25% 0.00% 2.00% Rate of increase for pensions in deferment where provided 2.50% 2.25% 0.00% 0.00% Expected long-term rates of return: Equities 8.00% 8.30% 8.30% 8.30% Bonds 4.90% 4.70% 4.30% 4.70% Others 5.80% 5.60% 4.30% 4.90% Unilever Annual Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 90 Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 17 Pensions and similar obligations continued Balance Sheet The assets, liabilities and surplus deficit position of the pension and other post retirement benefit plans and the expected rates of return on the principal plan assets, at the balance sheet date, were: million million % million million % 31 December 2002 31 December 2001 Other post Long-term Other post Long-term retirement rates of retirement rates of Pension benefit return Pension benefit return plans plans expected plans plans expected Assets of principal plans: Equities 7 281 8.2% 10 494 9.0% Bonds 3 383 4.9% 4 138 5.5% Other 1 644 5.4% 1 808 6.0% Assets of other plans 417 2 8.2% 536 3 8.0% Total plan assets 12 725 2 16 976 3 a Present value of liabilities: Principal plans 15 305 15 547 Other plans 1 675 1 042 1 781 1 171 Total present value of liabilities 16 980 1 042 17 328 1 171 Aggregate net surplus deficit of the plans 4 255 1 040 352 1 168 b Irrecoverable surplus 87 265 Related deferred tax asset liability 1 058 388 74 467 Net pension asset liability 3 284 652 691 701 Of which in respect of Funded plans in surplus: Aggregate surplus 677 2 454 b Irrecoverable surplus 87 265 Related deferred tax liability 209 740 Net pension asset 381 1 449 Funded plans in deficit: Aggregate deficit 2 575 607 Related deferred tax asset 808 199 Net pension liability 1 767 408 Unfunded plans: Aggregate liability 2 357 1 040 2 199 1 168 Related deferred tax asset 459 388 467 467 Net pension liability 1 898 652 1 732 701 a The basis for valuation of risk benets has been changed following the issue of UITF 35.
The effect has been to increase the liabilities of the principal plans by 500 million as at 31 December 2002 2001: 508 million.

The accounting methodology however is not the same as under FRS 17 since certain cost items are amortised rather than recognised immediately.
The following tables summarise the balance sheet impact, as well as the benefit obligations, assets, funded status and economic assumptions associated with the key dened benefit pension plans and the other post retirement benefit plans as computed in accordance with SFAS 87 and SFAS 106.
At 31 December 2002 these key dened benefit pension plans key pension plans represented approximately 90% 2001: 76%: 2000: 76% of all pension plans while 100% of the other post retirement benefit plans are represented 2001: 100%: 2000: 100%, based on the market value of the funds plus the provisions held in the Groups accounts.

The Group also maintains a number of smaller dened benefit plans.
Approximately 1 129 million 2001: 1 685 million is provided for on their behalf in the Group balance sheet.
In 2002, 158 million 2001: 202 million: 2000: 151 million was charged in the accounts.
These amounts would not have been materially different under SFAS 87.
In addition to the special termination benets included in the table above, during 2002, the Group also charged 96 million 2001: 49 million: 2000: 56 million in respect of pension or similar obligations arising on terminations of employment.
Expected return on plan assets Beginning 1 January 2002 the Group changed its method for determining the expected return on plan assets under US GAAP by changing the value placed on the plan assets.
The value now used is the fair value at the balance sheet date instead of a market related value calculated by smoothing asset gains and losses over a five year period.
Management believe that using the actual fair value at the balance sheet date provides a better representation of the financial position of the Group.
The impact of this change in methodology on reported results is given on pages 114 and 121.
Post-retirement health care benets Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans.
