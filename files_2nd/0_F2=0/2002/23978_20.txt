Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31st December 2002 A SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN APPLIED CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, IS SET OUT BELOW.
Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of investments and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial statements of investment trust companies the SORP.
Valuation of investments Quoted investments are valued at middle market prices.
Where trading in the securities of an investee company is suspended, the investment is valued at the Boards estimate of its net realisable value.
Realised surpluses or deficits on the disposal of investments and permanent impairments in the value of investments are taken to capital reserve realised and unrealised surpluses and deficits on the revaluation of investments are taken to capital reserve unrealised.
Income Income from investments is included in the revenue account on an ex-dividend basis.
Income from debt securities is accrued on a time apportionment basis in accordance with the guidelines in the SORP.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividend in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in capital reserve realised.
Unfranked income is included in the revenue account gross before deduction of income tax.
Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged through the revenue account except as follows: expenses which are incidental to the acquisition of an investment are included in the cost of the investment.
expenses which are incidental to the disposal of an investment are deducted from the proceeds of the investment.
expenses are charged to capital reserve realised where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
The management fee has been allocated 65% to capital reserve realised and 35% to the revenue account, in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income respectively, from the investment portfolio of the Company.
v. Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and in accordance with the provisions of Financial Reporting Standard 4 Capital Instruments.
Finance costs of debt insofar as they relate to the financing of the Companys investments or to financing activities aimed at maintaining or enhancing the value of the Companys investments are allocated 65% to capital reserve realised and 35% to the revenue account, in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income respectively, from the investment portfolio of the Company.
Taxation Deferred tax is recorded in accordance with FRS19 Deferred Tax.
The adoption of this standard has had no impact on current or prior year results.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable.
Franked dividends are accounted for net of any tax credits.

Financial instruments The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares with UK exposure.
These are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies: Bank loan and debenture stock in sterling, for which the main purpose is to provide finance for the Companys operations: Short-term debtors, creditors and cash amounts arising directly from its operations: Derivative transactions which the Company also enters into principally interest rate swaps the purpose of which is to manage the interest rate risk arising from the Companys bank loan.
As an investment trust, the Company invests in securities for the long-term.
Accordingly it is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Companys policy that no short-term trading in investments or other financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risk arising from the Companys financial instruments is market price risk which incorporates interest rate risk.
The Boards policy for managing these risks is summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the year to which these accounts relate.
Fleming Claverhouse 39 Notes to the Accounts continued 20.
Financial instruments continued Market Price Risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Board meets on at least five occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio in order to minimise the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
An individual fund manager has responsibility for monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk-reward profile.
As all of the Companys assets are denominated in sterling there is no currency risk.
Interest Rate Risk Where the Company finances its operations through bank borrowings, the Company currently borrows at a floating rate of interest.
Further details can be found in note 11 on page 37.
Liquidity Risk The Companys assets comprise mainly realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
Interest Rate Risk Profile of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities All the Companys financial assets are equity shares or other investments which neither pay interest nor have a maturity date.
Liabilities The Company has one bank loan of 15m.
A 10m loan was repaid during the year.
The interest rate on the 15m loan is at a floating rate of interest.
The Company also has a total of 45m debenture stock which has been secured by floating charges over the Companys assets.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments Financial assets and liabilities are included in the balance sheet at values which represent fair values except in respect of the items disclosed below.
The fair value of the loan, which is stated after the effect of interest rate swaps, has been calculated by estimating the breakage costs of the loan and the swap.
Market values have been used to determine the fair value of the debenture stock.
