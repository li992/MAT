This will be the case where the holding is not effectively connected with a permanent establishment or fixed base in the UK and provided that the shareholder is not subject to the special rules of the Income Tax Convention such as those applying to US tax-exempt entities and certain investment or holding companies where 25 per cent of the capital is held directly or indirectly by persons who are not individual residents or nationals of the US.
Thus, a US holder receiving a dividend of 90 will be treated as receiving taxable income of 100 less UK withholding tax of 10.
No refund of UK tax is available.
Dividends received by a US holder will be foreign source income for US federal income tax purposes in the amount equal to the US dollar value of the gross dividend that is the sum of the dividend and the associated tax credit, on the date of such payment.
Generally dividends will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to US corporations under the Code.
Subject to certain limitations, the UK tax treated as withheld from payments will be available as a credit against US tax.
Taxation of capital gains Generally, a US holder who is not resident or ordinarily resident in the UK for tax purposes will not be subject to UK tax on any gain from the disposal of ADSs, but will be subject to US tax on any capital gain realised on the sale or other disposal of ADSs.
US information reporting and backup withholding Dividend payments with respect to ADSs and proceeds from the sale or other disposal of ADSs may be subject to information reporting to the US Internal Revenue Service and backup withholding at a current rate of 30 per cent.
Holders should consult their own advisors as to the application to them of the information reporting and backup withholding rules.
Stamp duty In practice no UK stamp duty is payable on the transfer of an ADS, provided that the separate instrument of transfer is not executed in, and always remains outside of the UK.
No stamp duty reserve tax is payable on an agreement to transfer ADSs.
Estate and gift tax Under the Estate Tax Convention, a US holder generally is not subject to UK inheritance tax.
Exchange controls and other limitations affecting security holders There are currently no exchange controls or other limitations in the UK affecting security holders.
