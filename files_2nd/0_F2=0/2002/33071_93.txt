Unilever Annual Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 74 Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 1 Segmental information continued Additional segmental information as required by US GAAP Segmental information is provided in accordance with SFAS 131 on the basis of product categories.
For management reporting purposes Unilever uses a number of measures of segment performance at constant average rates of exchange that is, the same rates as in the preceding year.
The internal management measure of profit which is most consistent with operating profit reported in the accounts is Trading Result.
This measure differs from operating profit, mainly because it excludes amortisation of goodwill and intangibles and certain exceptional items and includes depreciation on the basis of replacement cost.
There are a number of additional adjustments, including the application of an ination charge on working capital and certain other statistical items which are added back in order to arrive at operating profit.
Tangible xed assets are measured at depreciated replacement cost for management reporting purposes.
