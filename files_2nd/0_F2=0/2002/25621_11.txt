2002 2001 Total pension cost 000 000 UK 9,327 8,552 Overseas 4,303 3,971 13,630 12,523 Until the 31st January, 1998 the two main schemes that the Company participated in were the Jardine Lloyd Thompson Pension Scheme and the Lloyd Thompson Pension and Assurance Scheme.
With effect from 1 February, 1998, the Lloyd Thompson Pension and Assurance Scheme was merged into the Jardine Lloyd Thompson Pension Scheme.
The combined scheme continues as the Jardine Lloyd Thompson Pension Scheme.
The Jardine Lloyd Thompson Pension Scheme is based in the UK and provides benefits based primarily on Final Pensionable Salary.
The assets of the scheme are held in a trustee administered fund separate from the Company.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives with the Company.
The contributions are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of regular valuations using the projected unit credit method.
The last formal valuation of the Jardine Lloyd Thompson Pension Scheme was undertaken at 1st January, 2001 by a qualified actuary employed by a Group Company.
At that date, the market valuation of the schemes assets, excluding insured annuities, was 210,644,000 and the actuarial value of these assets represented 99% of the value of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in salary.
The most influential assumptions underlying the valuation of the scheme were that investment return would exceed the annual rate of increase in pensionable salaries by 2.5% per annum and that pensions would increase in accordance with the scheme rules.
A valuation of the scheme on the statutory MFR basis was carried out as at 1st July, 2002 and indicated that the schemes assets represented 91% of its accrued liabilities on that basis.
As a result the Company will be increasing its contributions with the objective of eliminating the disclosed deficiency over a 10 year period.
A provision of 4,650,000 has been made at the balance sheet date and represents the excess of the accumulated pension costs over the amount funded.
The cost of contributions to the defined benefit scheme for the year was 7,608,000, net of the amortisation of the pension provision amounting to 1,476,000.
The contribution rate has been determined using the projected unit credit method.
The principal overseas schemes are: a The JLT USA Incentive Savings Plan which is a defined contribution scheme.
Employees may contribute up to 50% of their salary up to a maximum allowed by law $11,000 in 2002 and the Group contributes at a rate of 75% of each 1% contributed by the employee up to a maximum employee contribution of 4%.
b The JLT USA Employee Retirement Plan which is a defined benefit scheme.
Pension cost is assessed in accordance with the advice of professionally qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The latest actuarial valuation was undertaken at 31st December, 2001, at which date the main assumption used to set the contribution rate was that the annual rate of investment return exceeded the annual rate of increase in pensionable earnings by 4.5%.
The aggregate market value of the schemes assets was US$35,591,937 and the actuarial value of these assets represented 109% of the accrued liabilities at that date.
A provision of 2,431,000 has been made at the balance sheet date and represents the excess of the accumulated pension costs over the amount funded.
The cost of the defined benefit scheme for the year was 309,000.
Since the dates of the last formal valuations, stock markets have fallen very significantly and the assets of the schemes have not been immune to this general trend.
The liabilities of the schemes are valued using discount rates which reflect market levels at the date of the valuations.
The fall in the schemes assets does not, in itself, change the estimate of the cost of providing the pension benefits promised which was based on the last formal valuations.

The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise cash, short term deposits, money market funds, negotiable money market investments, short stated bonds, borrowings, finance leases, loan notes and provisions in respect of property commitments.
Short-term debtors and creditors other than borrowings have been excluded from the following disclosures.
As explained on pages 23 and 24 of the Financial Review and pages 36 and 37 of the Directors Report, the Group enters into derivative transactions to manage the fluctuations in currency and interest earnings that arise from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts, currency options, forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps and interest rate options matched by underlying investments and revenue flows to manage these risks.
The Group finances its operations principally by the cash generated by operating companies and to a lesser extent by the use of borrowings and finance leases.
Interest rate and currency profile of financial assets financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities consist of borrowings, finance leases, loan notes and provisions to cover property commitments.

The fair value of cash, short-term deposits, negotiable money market investments, money market funds, bank borrowings and overdrafts are based on the carrying value of the instruments.
Short dated bonds are valued at market bid price.
The fair value of forward rate agreements, interest rate options, foreign exchange options and foreign exchange forward contracts are based on the mid market prices as at the balance sheet date.
Currency exposures As explained on page 23 of the Financial Review, the Groups major transaction exposure arises in respect of the US dollar revenue earned in the UK, where it accounts for approximately 52% 2001: 53% of total UK revenue.
The Group therefore adopts a prudent approach to the management of this exposure by maintaining a rolling hedging programme using forward contracts and options.
The currency exposure of the Groups net monetary assets liabilities is shown in the table below.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
