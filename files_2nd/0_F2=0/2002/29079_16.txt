TAXATION continued b Factors affecting current tax charge for the year: The tax assessed for the period is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK for a large company 30%.
The differences are explained below: For the For the For the For the year ended year ended year ended year ended 30 June 2002 30 June 2002 30 June 2001 30 June 2001 Group Company Group Company 000 000 000 000 deficit return before taxation 1,448 1,121 2,798 2,565 Corporation tax at 30% 434 336 839 770 Effects of: Overseas taxation written off 133 116 141 141 Overseas tax claimed as an expense 86 Non deductible expenses 54 40 366 366 Taxable dividend credited to capital 274 274 Unutilised current year expenses carried forward 250 22 Venture funds expenses utilised in year 1,136 1,136 Income of subsidiary not taxable 58 69 40 Prior year adjustment corporation tax 64 Current tax charge for the year Note 8 a 69 116 141 141 c Factors affecting future tax charges The Group currently has and expects to generate surplus tax losses.
A deferred tax asset in respect of these surplus losses is not recognised because their utilisation is considered unlikely in the foreseeable future.
DIVIDENDS No dividend has been proposed in respect of the current financial year.
For the year ended 30 June 2001 a dividend of 1.80p per share was declared based on 102,265,699 ordinary shares in issue.

The capital return per ordinary share is based on the net return for the year of 7,770,000 2001: deficit of 45,067,000 and on 102,265,699 ordinary shares 2001: 102,265,699 being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.

The capital return per ordinary share is based on the net return for the year of 7,976,000 2001: deficit of 44,836,000 and on 102,265,699 ordinary shares 2001: 102,265,699 being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
The diluted returns per ordinary share for the year ended 30 June 2002 have been calculated in accordance with FRS 14 under which the 40 million 4.5% convertible bonds are regarded as dilutive if, on conversion, the increased returns attributable to equity shareholders arising from the interest saved less taxation, divided by the increased weighted average number of shares, are less than the basic returns per ordinary share.
These calculations assume that conversion of dilutive potential ordinary shares takes place on 21 November 2001, the date the bonds were issued at an exercise price of 410p.
Based on an average fair value for the Companys shares of 340.8p for the period 21 November 2001 to 30 June 2002, there are no potential dilutive ordinary shares in respect of the convertible bonds.
The diluted returns per ordinary share have also been calculated assuming the exercise of all potential dilutive ordinary shares arising from the share options in issue see note 20.
On this basis, the weighted average number of options exercisable during the year would have been 18,087, resulting in an increased weighted average number of shares of 102,283,786 used for calculating the diluted returns.
41 There is no difference between the returns for the financial year used in the basic and diluted returns per share calculations.
Diluted returns have not been calculated for the prior year as there were no convertible bonds in issue during the year ended 30 June 2001.
In addition, the exercise price of options granted on 21 June 2001 exceeded the fair value of the Companys shares, calculated in accordance with FRS 14, and the options were therefore not dilutive.

These bonds are convertible, at any time, into ordinary shares at an initial conversion price of 410p per share.
However, the terms of the bonds provide that the conversion price is subject to adjustment 21 days after the publication of the 2002 annual report and accounts by the amount that the net asset value per ordinary share falls below 407p at either 31 December 2001 or 30 June 2002 rounded down to the nearest penny.
As a result, 21 days after publication of this annual report and accounts, the conversion price of the bonds will be 399p, based on the NAV at 31 December 2001.
In accordance with FRS4 Capital Instruments, issue costs are charged to the revenue account over the term of the capital instrument.
FRS 13 requires disclosure of the fair value of debt.
The convertible bonds were not listed at 30 June 2002 and therefore a quoted market value is not available at the balance sheet date.
The bonds obtained a listing on the London Stock Exchange on 5 July 2002, with UBS Warburg and Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein DKW appointed as market makers.
On 8 July 2002, DKW were quoting a bid-offer spread of 1 to 2.

NET ASSET VALUE PER ORDINARY SHARE Calculation of the net asset values per share are based on Group net assets of 423,087,000 2001: 416,872,000, Company net assets of 423,611,000 2001: 416,872,000 and on 102,265,699 2001: 102,265,699 ordinary shares in issue at the year end.
The Group and Company diluted net asset values per share assume the 40 million convertible bonds are converted at the balance sheet date at an exercise price of 410p into 9,756,097 new shares.
48 The Group and Company diluted net asset values per share also assume that share options with a strike price lower than the undiluted net asset value per share are exercised at the balance sheet date.
This results in the issue of an additional 4,253,363 ordinary shares note 20 for consideration of 16,371,930.
Therefore the calculation of the diluted net asset values per share are based on Group net assets of 479,459,000, Company net assets of 479,983,000 and on 116,275,159 ordinary shares in issue at the year end.
For information, as described in note 17, the conversion price of the bonds will be adjusted downwards from 410p to 399p with effect from 21 days after publication of this annual report and accounts.
Had the diluted net asset value per share assumed the 40 million convertible bonds are converted at the balance sheet date at an exercise price of 399p into 10,025,062 new shares, it would have resulted in diluted net asset values per share of 411.4p for the Group and 411.8p for the Company.
The exercise price of options granted on 21 June 2001 exceeded the basic net asset value per share at 30 June 2001.
As a result diluted net asset values per share at 30 June 2001 exceeded basic net asset values per share and are therefore not dilutive.
In addition, the convertible bonds were not issued until November 2001 and therefore have no impact on the prior year calculations.

Schroder Ventures International Investment Trust plc Notes to the Accounts continued 31.
RISK The following disclosures relating to the risks faced by the company are provided in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 13, Derivatives and other financial instruments disclosures.
Financial instruments and risk prole The Companys principal investment objective is to achieve capital appreciation by investing primarily in an international portfolio of buy-out and development capital funds, which are managed or advised by Schroder Ventures or Permira.
These investments are typically illiquid.
In addition, the Company holds treasury bills, cash and short-term deposits and various items such as debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
These financial instruments held by the Company are generally liquid.
The holding of securities, investing activities and associated nancing undertaken pursuant to this objective involves certain inherent risks.
Events may occur that would result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of revenue profits available for dividend.
As an investment trust, the Company invests in securities for the long term.
The Company has not taken out any derivatives contracts to date.
Currency risk 50 The Company is exposed to currency risk directly since the majority of its assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currency and their sterling value can be signicantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
The Company does not normally hedge against foreign currency movements affecting the value of its investments, but takes account of this risk when making investment decisions.
Interest rate risk The Companys revenue will be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates since the majority of its income derives from treasury bills and bank deposit interest.
The effect of interest rate changes on the valuation of investments forms part of valuation risk, which is considered separately below.
RISK continued The oating rate assets consist of short-term deposits.
The non-interest bearing assets represent the Funds and co-investments, and other short-term debtors.
The fixed rate assets comprise treasury bills, net of outstanding redemptions, and can be further analysed as follows: Fixed rate financial assets 30 June 2002 30 June 2001 Weighted average Weighted average Weighted average Weighted average Interest period on which Interest period on which rate rate is based rate rate is based Euro 3.00% 30 days 4.26% 58 days US dollars 1.50% 23 days 3.43% 68 days Sterling 3.16% 24 days 4.56% 45 days Financial liabilities of the Group The Company issued 40 million nominal of 10 year 4.5% subordinated convertible bonds in November 2001.
The Company does not have any other borrowings at the year end, although it does have in place an unutilised loan facility of 225 million with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc.
51 The main risk arising from the Companys financial instruments is valuation risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policy for managing this risk as summarised below.
This policy has remained substantially unchanged since the launch of the Company.
Valuation risk The Companys exposure to valuation risk comprises mainly movements in the value of its underlying investments.
A breakdown of the Fund portfolio is given on pages 17 to 20 and a detailed analysis of the twenty largest underlying companies is given on pages 12 to 16.
In accordance with the Companys accounting policies, set out on pages 34 to 36, all underlying investments are valued by the Directors in accordance with the current guidelines issued by the British Venture Capital Association BVCA, adopting the overriding BVCA principle that the value should be a fair one.
The Company does not hedge against movements in the value of these investments.
Uncertainty arises as a result of future changes in the valuation of the Companys underlying investments, the majority of which are unquoted, and the effect changes in exchange rates may have in the sterling value of these investments.
Development Stage Equity Investments and Early Stage Equity Investments, by their nature, involve uncertainty as to the ultimate value likely to be realised on the disposal of those investments, particularly as their unquoted nature means that a ready market may not exist for them.
The Companys sensitivity to valuation risk will be affected by changes in levels of borrowing and liquidity, as approved by the Board.
At 30 June 2002, a 10% movement in the valuation of the Groups Fund portfolio and co-investments would result in a 11% change in net asset value per share.
The Directors believe that the diversied nature of the Companys portfolio and the number of underlying investments in the Funds signicantly reduces the risks normally associated with making investments in the buy-out and development capital markets.
Holdings risk In certain circumstances, the Company may wish to transfer its holdings in particular Funds.
In a majority of the Funds in which the Company will invest, the general partner, trustee or manager has the ultimate right, similar to that exercisable by a board of a private company, to refuse to register the transfer of an interest.
While the Company has no reason to believe that any request for the transfer of an interest would be refused, it is of course conceivable that the general partners, trustees or managers overriding duciary duty could result in its refusing to register a particular transfer proposed by the Company.
If as a consequence of a failure to pay a call, the Company is treated as a defaulting investor under the relevant Fund, it will suffer a resultant dilution in interest and possibly the compulsory sale of its interest.
