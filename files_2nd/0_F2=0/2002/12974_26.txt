19 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS A description of the policies relating to financial instruments is set out in the operating and financial review on page 31, and also in the accounting policies on page 49.
Short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures other than within the currency risk disclosures.
a Interest risk management Financial liabilities Some 39% of the Groups loan capital and borrowings is at xed rates of interest with a weighted average interest rate of 7.0% 2001 7.1% and a weighted average term of 4.3 years 2001 5.9 years.
At 31 December 2002, the Groups net debt was predominantly denominated in US dollars.
Gross borrowings include loan capital and borrowings of 506.3m note 18, and the effect of currency and interest rate swaps is to give a total of 767.3m.
After taking account of interest rate and currency rate swaps, the currency and interest rate exposure of gross borrowings as at 31 December 2002 was: Fixed rate borrowings Weighted Floating Weighted average time Gross rate Fixed rate average for which borrowings borrowings borrowings interest rate rate is xed 2002 m m m % years Sterling 213.9 86.3 127.6 7.3 5.2 US Canadian dollar 441.7 372.9 68.8 6.8 5.6 Other currencies net 111.7 111.7 767.3 570.9 196.4 7.0 5.3 Fixed rate borrowings Weighted Floating Weighted average time Gross rate Fixed rate average for which borrowings borrowings borrowings interest rate rate is fixed 2001 m m m % years Sterling 134.4 6.8 127.6 7.3 6.2 US Canadian dollar 383.1 296.7 86.4 6.9 5.6 Other currencies net 92.8 92.8 610.3 396.3 214.0 7.1 5.9 Floating rate borrowings incur interest based on relevant LIBOR equivalents.
In addition to the amounts disclosed in the above tables, the following meet the definition of financial liabilities: the Groups sterling denominated convertible preference shares of 226.9m 2001 227.2m are xed rate liabilities with a weighted average interest rate of 8.3% 2001 8.3% and a weighted average period over which the rate is fixed of 4.6 years 2001 5.6 years.
the Groups provisions of 24.8m 2001 27.9m for vacant leasehold properties note 21 are considered to be oating rate financial liabilities.
This is because in establishing the provisions, the cash flows have been discounted using a discount rate which is re-appraised at each half-yearly reporting date to ensure it reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
23.0m 2001 25.3m of the balance is denominated in sterling and the remainder are US dollar denominated.
Nil 2001 17.5m of the Groups provisions on disposals note 21.
22.3m 2001 32.4m of the Groups contract advances which are payable after more than one year.
No interest is payable on these US dollar denominated financial liabilities.
26.8m 2001 Nil of deferred consideration payable after more than one year in respect of the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings.

b Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity of loan capital and borrowings is given in note 18 above.
The Companys convertible preference shares of 226.9m 2001 227.2m have a final redemption date of 2007.
For other financial liabilities, note 21 gives an indication of the nature of the underlying liabilities in respect of provisions.
The maturity profile of these liabilities together with deferred consideration and contract advances is as follows: Onerous Contract Deferred 2002 2001 contracts advances consideration m m Within one year or on demand 9.0 9.0 22.9 Between one and two years 0.5 9.1 17.6 27.2 13.5 Between two and five years 0.4 13.2 6.4 20.0 15.5 Over five years 14.9 2.8 17.7 25.9 24.8 22.3 26.8 73.9 77.8 c Exchange risk management After taking into account the effect of forward exchange contracts, there are no material net monetary assets liabilities of Group companies denominated in currencies other than the relevant Group companys own functional currency.
The Group operates a prudent hedging policy relating to its cross currency business trading cash flows.
Currency exposures are netted by currency and hedged forward for up to five years using forward foreign exchange contracts.
At the year end at least 80% of anticipated core currency transaction exposures for the following 12 months had been hedged.
The fair value of these hedges is set out in section d below.
d Fair values The estimated fair values of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December 2002 and 2001 are set out below.
The fair value of quoted borrowings is based on year end mid-market quoted prices.
The fair values of other borrowings and the derivative financial instruments are estimated by discounting the future cash ows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the year end.
The fair value of the convertible preference shares is calculated by reference to the open market value at year end.

The remaining 20% is owned by Ritek Corporation, a manufacturer of optical discs.
Total consideration for the acquisition was 33.8m, of which 19.6m is deferred.
Of the unconditional deferred consideration of 19.6m, 9.8m was paid on 3 January 2003 with the final instalment of 9.8m due on 1 January 2004.
No information is available in respect of the book values of assets and liabilities contributed by Ritek Corporation to DGMS and accordingly book values have not been disclosed.
Pre-acquisition results of the acquired business are not material.
Other acquisitions During 2002, three new bingo clubs were acquired in Madrid, Barcelona and Seville in Spain for a total consideration of 16.7m of which 5.8m is deferred.
The deferred consideration is payable in instalments between 2003 and 2006.
On 21 February 2002 the Group acquired Vision Entertainment Inc for a cash consideration of 3.2m.
On 8 November 2002, the Group acquired 100% of the net assets of Capital FX Holdings Limited, a laser sub-titling and digital effects company in the UK.
Total consideration was 9.6m, of which 6.0m is deferred.
3.5m of the deferred consideration is contingent upon achieving pre-defined earnings targets in the five calendar years from 2004 to 2008.
The remainder is payable in instalments from 1 March 2004 to 1 March 2008.
On 29 November 2002, the Group acquired 95% of the net assets of Image SA, a film laboratory in Barcelona, Spain.
Total consideration was 6.7m, of which 0.4m is deferred.
On 31 December 2002, the Group acquired the remaining 50% of the common stock of Entertainment Transportation Specialists, Inc ETS.
All 14.2m consideration for ETS is deferred.
Of the deferred consideration 1.6m is contingent upon achieving pre-defined earnings targets in the three calendar years from 2004 to 2006.
The remainder is payable in instalments between 2003 and 2007.
66 The Rank Group Plc 26 ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS CONTINUED Prior to becoming a subsidiary, ETS was accounted for as a joint venture.
In accordance with FRS 2 and in order to give a true and fair view, purchased goodwill has been calculated as the sum of the goodwill arising on each purchase of the identifiable assets and liabilities attributable to the interest purchased.
This represents a departure from the statutory method, under which goodwill is calculated as the difference between cost and fair value on the date that ETS became a subsidiary.
The statutory method would not give a true and fair view because it would result in the Groups share of ETSs retained reserves, during the period that it was an associate, being characterised as goodwill.
The effect of this departure is to increase retained profit by 2.4m and to increase purchased goodwill charged to intangible assets by 2.4m.
There is no material difference between the book value and fair value of other acquisitions.

FRS 17 Retirement Benets was issued in November 2000 but will not require full implementation for the Group and Company until the year ended 31 December 2005.
Prior to this, phased transitional disclosures are required from 31 December 2001.
The disclosures required are presented in b below.
a Provision for pension and similar obligations UK The Group has two pension schemes for UK employees, both of which are contracted out of the State Second Pension arrangements.
The schemes are externally funded under separate trusts and the funds assets are held separately from Group assets.
The accounts of both schemes for the year ended 5 April 2002 have been reported upon by their auditors without qualification.
The Rank Pension Plan the Plan is a dened benefit scheme with pensions xed by reference to final pay and length of service.
The market value of the Plans assets at 5 April 2002 was 575.2m 2001 589.9m.
Formal actuarial valuations of the Plan are carried out at least triennially by an independent actuary, Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited.
The most recent valuation has an effective date of 5 April 2001 and has been used to determine the pension charge for the year to 31 December 2002.
68 The Rank Group Plc 30 EMPLOYEES CONTINUED The main actuarial assumptions adopted were: Valuation method attained age Rate of return on investments pre retirement 6.25% p. a post retirement 5.25% p. a Rate of increase of pensionable remuneration 3.75% p. a Rate of discretionary pension increases 1.50% p. a Rate of pensions in payment increases 2.50% p. a Pensions in payment are entitled to increases in line with price inflation subject to a maximum of 5% per annum.
In prior years, the Plan has been valued under the projected unit method.
Following the closure of the Plan to new entrants, the attained age valuation method has been adopted since 2001.
Assets were taken at their market value.
As at the actuarial valuation date the value of the assets was sufficient to cover 109% of the accrued benefits allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The pension charge for the year to 31 December 2002 was 0.6m 2001 1.9m.
The charge was determined after recognising a credit of 4.9m resulting from spreading the expensing surplus of 36.5m as at 1 January 2001 over the average remaining service lives of the active members of the Plan.
The decline in stock market values since the actuarial valuation of the Plan on 5 April 2001 and the increase in accrued liabilities as a result of changes in financial conditions have resulted in a deficit in the fund at 31 December 2002, calculated in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17.
Under current accounting policies these matters are not required to be reected in the pension charge until the next formal actuarial valuation, which will take place no later than 5 April 2004.
At 31 December 2002 there was a prepayment in debtors of 15.1m 2001 11.0m resulting from the difference between pension costs charged in the accounts and the amounts funded to date.
The Rank Money Purchase Pension Scheme is a defined contribution scheme with benefits which depend on the contribution levels and the emerging investment performance.
The market value of its assets at 5 April 2002 was 35.4m 2001 37.8m.
Group contributions to this scheme in the year to 31 December 2002 totalled 1.3m 2001 0.9m.
US The Group operates defined contribution schemes in the US.
Group contributions to these schemes totalled 3.9m 2001 3.3m.
b FRS 17 Retirement Benets The Group has continued to adopt FRS 17 Retirement Benefits under the phased transitional arrangements allowed by the standard.
The disclosures below relate to all retirement benefit plans in the UK.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 5 April 2001 and updated by an independent actuary to 31 December 2002.
The main actuarial assumptions used to calculate the Plans liabilities under FRS 17 are: 2002 2001 Valuation method projected unit projected unit Discount rate 5.50% 6.00% Inflation assumption 2.25% 2.50% Rate of increase in salaries 3.50% 3.75% Rate of increase of deferred pensions 2.25% 2.50% Rate of increase of pensions in payment increases 5% LPI increases 2.25% 2.50% The assets in the Plan and the expected rate of return were: Long term Long term rate of return Value at rate of return Value at expected at 31 December expected at 31 December 31 December 2002 31 December 2001 2002 m 2001 m Equities 7.0% 280.0 7.5% 361.5 Government bonds 4.5% 90.0 5.0% 106.0 Non-government bonds 5.5% 66.4 6.0% 71.6 Insurance policies 5.5% 13.3 6.0% 15.4 Cash 4.0% 16.0 4.0% 11.0 Total market value of assets 465.7 565.5 The Rank Group Plc 69 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 30 EMPLOYEES CONTINUED The following amounts at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001 were measured in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17.

The dispute centres upon the parties contentions in relation to the accounts and the profits of the businesses based upon which an additional purchase consideration may be payable.
The directors are strongly resisting the payment of any further sum.
At the present time the outcome to the Group cannot be determined and the potential liability cannot be quantied.
However, it is the opinion of the directors that it is unlikely that the outcome of this dispute will have a material effect on the Groups financial position.
Subsidiary undertakings are involved in actions, including class action suits, in the US.
These actions are being vigorously contested and the directors believe that none of these actions will result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Group.
Additional information required to be disclosed by FRS 12 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets is not disclosed on the grounds that it can be expected to prejudice the outcome of these matters.
