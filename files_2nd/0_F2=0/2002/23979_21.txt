Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2002 A SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS SET OUT BELOW.
Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of investments.
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial statements of investment trust companies SORP.
Valuation of investments Listed investments are valued at middle market prices.
Where trading in the securities of an investee company is suspended, the investment is valued at the Boards estimate of its net realisable value.
Unlisted investments are valued by the Board.
In making their valuations, the Board have taken into account, where appropriate, latest dealing prices, valuations from reliable sources, asset values and other relevant factors.
Realised surpluses or deficits on the disposal of investments and permanent impairments in the value of investments are taken to capital reserve realised, and unrealised surpluses and deficits on the revaluation of investments are taken to the capital reserve unrealised.
Year-end exchange rates are used to translate the value of investments, which are denominated in foreign currencies.
Income Income from equity investments is included in the revenue account on an ex-dividend basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in capital reserves.
Interest receivable on fixed interest stocks is recognised in the revenue account on an accruals basis.
Franked dividends and overseas dividends are accounted for net of any tax credits and of any tax credit on overseas income.
Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and in accordance with the provisions of Financial Reporting Standard 4 Capital Instruments.
Finance costs are charged through the revenue account.
Where the Company has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge its interest rate exposure the net interest payable by the Company is recognised on an accruals basis.
Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value or shown on the balance sheet at the year end.
v. Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged through the revenue account except as follows: expenses which are incidental to the acquisition of an investment are included within the cost of the investment: expenses which are incidental to the disposal of an investment are deducted from the proceeds of the investment.
Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the capital reserve, or in the revenue account depending on whether the gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature respectively.
Taxation Provision is made for deferred taxation, using the liability method, on all material timing differences to the extent that it is probable that a liability will crystallise.
Deferred tax is recorded in accordance with FRS19 Deferred Tax.
The adoption of this standard has had no impact on current or prior year results.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable.

Transactions with JPMorgan Fleming Details of the management contract are set out on page 24.
The terms make allowance for the exclusion of management charges on investments in funds managed by JPMorgan Fleming or any of its associated companies.
There were no amounts due to J. P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management UK Limited JPMFAM at the year end 2001: nil.
JPMFAM was paid 124,703 2001: 72,417 for a proportion of the administration costs of the marketing of wrapper products see page 46.
JPMFAM carries out some of its dealing transactions through other group subsidiaries.
These transactions are carried out at arms length.
The commission paid in the year was 4,690 2001: 14,173.
The Company has been informed that certain of its dealing transactions may be subject to soft commission arrangements.
Financial instruments The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares with European exposure.
These are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies: Bank loans denominated in Euros and Swiss Francs for which the main purpose is to raise finance for the Companys operations: Short-term debtors, creditors and cash amounts arising directly from its operations: Derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps, the purpose of which is to manage the interest rate risk arising from the bank loans.
As an investment trust, the Company invests in securities for the long-term.
Accordingly, it is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Companys policy that no trading in investments or other financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risk arising from the Companys financial instruments is market price risk which incorporates both foreign currency and interest rate risk.
The Boards policy for managing each of these risks is summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the year to which these financial statements relate.
Market Price Risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Board meets on at least five occasions to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio in order to minimise the risk associated with particular countries or industry sectors.
The Investment Manager has responsibility for selecting investments in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk-reward profile.
Interest Rate Risk The Company finances its incremental operations through bank borrowings and retained profits.
The Company borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and uses interest rate swaps to both generate the desired interest rate profile and, to manage the Companys exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
At the year end, all of the Companys borrowings were at fixed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps.
42 Fleming Continental European Notes to the Accounts continued 18.
Financial instruments continued Foreign Currency Risk The income and capital value of the Companys investments can be significantly affected by exchange rate movements as the majority of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling which is the Companys reporting currency.
The Board has identified three principal areas where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affect the value of investments and monetary assets and liabilities Movements in rates affect short term timing differences: and Movements in rates affect the income received During the year, the Company did not hedge the sterling value of investments that are priced in other currencies.
The Company may be subject to short-term exposure to exchange rate movement, for instance where there is a difference between the date an investment purchase or sale is entered into and the date when settled.
Liquidity Risk The Companys assets comprise mainly realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.

The Company has excluded short-term debtors and creditors from the following analysis.
Fleming Continental European 43 Notes to the Accounts continued 18.
Financial instruments continued Liabilities The Company has entered into interest rate swaps in relation to the loans of Euro 35 million and Euro 100 million.
