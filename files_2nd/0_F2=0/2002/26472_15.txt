38 Directors report and accounts Directors responsibility for the financial statements The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the auditors report on page 39, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the responsibilities of the directors from those of the auditors in relation to the financial statements.
Annual Report and accounts The directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare an Annual Report and financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss for the financial year.
Accounting policies The directors consider that in preparing the financial statements the Group has used appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, and that all applicable accounting standards have been followed.
Accounting records The directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Group keeps accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position of the Group and which enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
Safeguarding assets The directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the Groups website is the responsibility of the directors.
Information published on the internet is accessible in many countries: the legal requirements relating to the preparation and dissemination of financial statements in those countries are different from those applying in the United Kingdom.
