Taxation on Profit on Ordinary Activities continued FRS 19 Deferred Tax has been adopted for these accounts.
The standard requires full provision to be made for deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from timing differences, between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in tax computations, with the exception of timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets for which there is no binding agreement to sell or on the undistributed profits of overseas subsidiaries.
No provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates at which it is estimated the tax will arise.
The deferred tax provision has not been discounted to net present values.
The impact of this change in policy on the tax charge for the year to 29 September 2002 has been to increase the charge by 11,003,000.
The comparative amounts have been restated for the year to 30 September 2001 resulting in an increase in the tax charge of 4,940,000 for that year and a prior year adjustment of a credit to the profit and loss reserve of 3,681,000 in respect of earlier years.
The impact of the change to the balance sheet can be found in Note 18. iii Factors that may affect future tax charges The Group does not expect to pay any UK Corporation tax for the next three years as a result of the availability of tax losses carried forward and accelerated capital allowances on its ongoing capital expenditure programme.
As a result of deferred and overseas tax, the Group expects its tax charge for the forseeable future to remain at an effective rate close to the UK Corporation tax rate of 30%.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised where the likelihood of realisation fails to meet the more likely than not criterion.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing property or on the sale of properties where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
At the year end, the total unprovided deferred tax on assets if sold at book value would be 75 million 2001: 65 million and on gains rolled over into replacement assets nil 2001: 12 million.
Such tax would only become payable if the properties were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief and if expenditure on replacement assets were less than anticipated.
However, it is not expected that any capital gain will be crystallised in the foreseeable future.

Pensions a Pensions The Group operates a contracted-out defined benefit scheme, The Greenalls Group Pension & Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme, the assets of which are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The Scheme is now closed to new members.
Contributions are paid into the Scheme in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations.
The latest formal actuarial triennial valuation was carried out on 5 April 2000.
This disclosed that the value of the Schemes assets totalled 203 million at market value which represented 79% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The liabilities were valued on a market-related projected unit basis, under this basis the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
Following the disposal of the Pubs & Restaurants business in December 1999, and based on subsequent advice from the Groups actuaries, the Group undertook to improve the funding level of the ongoing scheme by contributing an additional 40 million to the Scheme payable over a four year period.
As the additional contribution requirement arose from the significant reduction in Scheme membership a liability was recorded immediately.
At the year end 27.5 million had been contributed.
The level of contributions required in the future will be reviewed at the next actuarial valuation in March 2003.
The Group also operates a contracted-in defined contribution scheme in which its liabilities are restricted to the level of contributions paid into the scheme.
The assumptions, which have had the most significant effect on the funding of the Scheme, are set out in the following table: % Price inflation 3.00 Pension increases non-guaranteed minimum pension 3.00 Return on investments net of investment costs and expenses 5.75 Increase in pensionable earnings 4.75 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 47 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Continued 17.
