Aggreko WEB pdf 14 3 03 11:40 am Page 42 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS For the year ended 31 December 2002 1 Accounting policies A summary of the more significant accounting policies is set out below.
i Accounting convention The Accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
ii Basis of consolidation The Group Accounts consolidate the Accounts of Aggreko plc and all its subsidiary undertakings for the year ended 31 December 2002. iii Turnover Turnover for the Group represents the amounts earned from the supply of temporary power, temperature control, oil-free compressed air and related services and excludes sales taxes and intra-group sales.
iv Intangible assets Purchased goodwill representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the separable net assets acquired is capitalised as an intangible asset and is amortised over a period of up to 20 years.
v Depreciation Freehold properties are depreciated on a straight line basis over 25 years.
Short leasehold properties are depreciated on a straight line basis over the terms of each lease.
Other xed assets are depreciated on a straight line basis at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of each asset over its useful life from the date it is available for use.
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
The principal periods of depreciation used are as follows: Rental eet 8 to 10 years Vehicles, plant and equipment 4 to 15 years vi Foreign currencies At individual company level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the day the transaction occurs or at the contracted rate if the transaction is covered by a forward exchange contract.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date or, if appropriate, at a forward contract rate.
Forward foreign currency contracts used to hedge intercompany purchases of tangible xed assets are taken out at the commitment stage.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at closing rates of exchange.
Income and cash ow statements are translated at average rates of exchange for the period.
Exchange differences resulting from the retranslation of net investments in subsidiary undertakings at closing rates, together with differences between income statements translated at average rates and closing rates, are dealt with in reserves.
vii Financial instruments Details of the accounting policies for financial instruments, including hedges, are given in Note 16 to the Accounts.
viii Taxation The charge for ordinary taxation is based on the profits for the year and takes into account full provision for deferred tax, using the approach set out in Financial Reporting Standard FRS 19 Deferred Tax in respect of timing differences on a non-discounted basis.
Such timing differences arise primarily from the differing treatment for taxation and accounting purposes of provisions and depreciation of xed assets.
Previously the provision for deferred tax was accounted for on the partial provisioning basis required by Statement of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP 15.
The effect of this change in accounting policy on the results and net assets on the current and previous financial years is disclosed in Note 18.
Comparative gures have been restated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and related Notes.
ix Stocks Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes an appropriate allocation of overheads.

The capital cost of ex gratia and supplementary pensions is charged to the profit and loss account, to the extent that the arrangements are not covered by the surplus in plans, in the accounting period in which they are granted.
Contributions to dened contribution pension plans are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they become chargeable.
The pension cost gures used in these Accounts comply with the current pension cost accounting standard, SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
Under the transitional arrangements permitted by FRS 17 Retirement Benets, the Group is required to disclose the information contained in Note 23, regarding the pension scheme and the gures that would have been disclosed under FRS 17 in the profit and loss account and balance sheet had FRS 17 been fully implemented.
xi Leased assets Rentals under operating leases are charged against operating profit on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.

ii Interest rate risk prole of financial liabilities The interest rate risk prole of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2002, after taking account of the interest rate swaps used to manage the interest prole, was: Fixed rate liabilities Weighted Weighted average period Floating Fixed average for which rate rate rate Total interest rate is xed Currency: million million million % Years Sterling 34.5 15.0 49.5 4.5 1.0 US Dollar 22.8 35.2 58.0 3.4 0.8 Euro 4.2 13.0 17.2 2.9 2.0 At 31 December 2002 61.5 63.2 124.7 Sterling 25.1 30.0 55.1 6.2 1.0 US Dollar 16.0 48.3 64.3 6.3 1.0 Euro 0.2 23.5 23.7 5.7 1.0 At 31 December 2001 41.3 101.8 143.1 The oating rate financial liabilities principally comprise debt which carries interest based on different benchmark rates depending on the currency of the balance.
The principal benchmark rates for oating rate financial liabilities are the relevant LIBOR London Interbank Offered Rate rates for sterling, US dollars and euros and liabilities are normally xed in advance for periods between one and three months.
All the Groups creditors falling due within one year other than bank and other borrowings are excluded from the above tables either due to the exclusion of short-term items or because they do not meet the denition of a financial liabilty, such as tax balances.
The effect of the Groups interest rate swaps is to classify 63.2 million 2001 101.8 million of borrowings in the above table as xed rate.
iii Interest rate risk of financial assets Cash at bank Short-term and in hand deposits Total Currency: million million million Sterling 0.4 0.4 US Dollar 1.7 0.2 1.9 Euro 1.9 1.9 Other currencies 2.2 1.1 3.3 At 31 December 2002 6.2 1.3 7.5 Sterling 0.6 0.5 1.1 US Dollar 3.3 0.6 3.9 Euro 2.1 2.1 Other currencies 2.1 0.7 2.8 At 31 December 2001 8.1 1.8 9.9 All of the above cash and short-term deposits are oating rate and earn interest based on relevant national LIBID London Interbank Bid Rate equivalents or government bond rates.
iv Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity prole of the carrying amount of the Groups financial liabilities, other than short-term creditors such as trade creditors and accruals, at 31 December 2002 was as follows: 2002 2001 million million Within 1 year, or on demand 1.5 3.0 Between 1 and 2 years Between 2 and 5 years 123.2 140.1 124.7 143.1 48 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 Aggreko WEB pdf 14 3 03 11:40 am Page 49 16 Borrowings continued v Borrowing facilities The Group has the following undrawn committed oating rate borrowing facilities available at 31 December 2002 in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date: 2002 2001 million million Expiring within 1 year Expiring between 1 and 2 years Expiring between 2 and 5 years 76.8 59.9 76.8 59.9 All facilities incur commitment fees at market rates.
vi Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December 2002.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
2002 2001 Book Fair Book Fair value value value value million million million million Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations: Short-term borrowings 1.5 1.5 3.0 3.0 Long-term borrowings 123.2 123.2 140.1 140.1 Short-term deposits 1.3 1.3 1.8 1.8 Cash at bank and in hand 6.2 6.2 8.1 8.1 Derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate prole: Interest rate swaps 0.7 0.1 vii Summary of methods and assumptions Interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts Fair value is based on market price of these instruments at the balance sheet date.
Short-term deposits and borrowings The fair value of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Long-term borrowings In the case of bank loans and other loans, the fair value approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the majority are oating rate where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
viii Currency exposures As explained in the financial review on pages 15 to 17, to mitigate the effect of the currency exposures arising from its net investments overseas the Group borrows in the local currencies of its main operating units.
Gains and losses arising on net investments overseas and the financial instruments used to hedge the currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The table below shows the extent to which Group companies have net monetary assets in currencies other than their local currency, after taking into account the effect of forward foreign currency contracts.
Foreign exchange differences on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account of the Group companies and the Group.

Currency risk using forward foreign currency contracts for foreign currency debtors and creditors.
Forward foreign currency contracts are also used for currency exposures on contracted sales and committed purchases.
The table below shows the extent to which the Group has off-balance sheet unrecognised gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning and end of the year.
It also shows the amount of such gains and losses which have been included in the profit and loss account for the year and those gains and losses which are expected to be included in next years or later profit and loss accounts.
All the gains and losses on maturity of the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged transactions or positions.

Previously deferred tax was provided for in respect of timing differences to the extent that it was probable that a liability would crystalise in the foreseeable future.
FRS 19 has been applied in preparing these Accounts and comparative gures have been restated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and related Notes.

52 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 Aggreko WEB pdf 14 3 03 11:40 am Page 53 23 Pension commitments United Kingdom The Group operates a pension scheme for UK employees.
The Aggreko plc Pension Scheme the Scheme is a funded, contributory, dened benefit scheme.
Assets are held separately from those of the Group under the control of individual Trustees.
The Scheme is subject to valuations at intervals of not more than three years by independent actuaries.
A valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2000 using the projected unit method to determine the level of contributions to be made by the Group.
The actuaries have adopted a valuation basis linked to market conditions at the valuation date.
Assets have been taken at market value.
The principal actuarial assumptions used were: Return on investments 6.5% Growth in average pay levels 4.5% Increase in pensions 2.5% At the valuation date, the market value of the Schemes assets was 15,395,011.
