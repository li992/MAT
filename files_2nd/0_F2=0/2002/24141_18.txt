Achieved profit results The achieved profit results on pages 92 to 98 are unaudited, but the Life & Pensions results have been subject to a review by B&W Deloitte, consulting actuaries see page 98.
Basis of preparation In order to identify the value being generated by the Groups business, the directors use the achieved profit basis of reporting in respect of the Life & Pensions business combined with the modified statutory solvency MSS basis for the remainder of the business.
The achieved profit basis of reporting is designed to recognise profit as it is earned over the term of a life assurance policy.
The total profit recognised over the lifetime of the policy is the same as that recognised under the MSS basis of reporting, but the timing of the recognition is different.
The consolidated profit and loss account on an achieved profit basis has been prepared in accordance with the methodology and disclosure requirements contained in the guidance Supplementary reporting for long-term insurance business the achieved profits method issued by the Association of British Insurers ABI in December 2001.
Previously the achieved profit basis results were prepared in accordance with draft guidance issued in December 1999.
Comparative results for 2001 have not been restated for the change in methodology as the differences are not material to the result.
The guidance aims to provide a realistic method of recognising shareholder profits from long term business.
The guidance states that achieved profit should be calculated net of tax and then grossed up at the effective rate of shareholder tax.
The full standard rate of corporation tax has been used to gross up after tax profits.
Achieved profit is determined as the change in the Groups embedded value during the period adjusted for any dividends paid or capital injected.
Prior to 9 July 2001, the parent company of Friends Provident Group was Friends Provident Life Office FPLO, a mutual company.
It is possible, for comparative purposes, to show achieved profit results for the first half of 2001.
However, these comparatives exclude the impact of the new capital and a proportion of the contribution from new business attributed to With Profit policyholders prior to 9 July 2001.
After that date all contribution from new business accrues to shareholders.
An embedded value provides an estimate of the value of the shareholders interest in a life assurance business excluding any value which may be generated from future new life and pensions business.
The embedded value is the sum of shareholders net worth and value of existing business.
The shareholders net worth is the net assets attributable to shareholders and excludes items such as acquired goodwill and the present value of acquired in-force business.
The value of existing business is the present value of the projected stream of future after tax distributable profit available to shareholders from the existing business at the valuation date, adjusted where appropriate for the cost of holding the minimum statutory solvency margin.
The embedded value of the Friends Provident Group consists of the following: i the Groups share of its investment in the Asset Management business at market value: ii the net pension liability asset of FPPS on an FRS17 basis net of deferred tax : iii shareholders invested net assets: and iv the present value of the future profits attributable to shareholders from existing policies of the Life & Pensions business.
Life & Pensions achieved operating profit a.
Contribution from new business The contribution from new business for the year ended 31 December 2002 is calculated using economic assumptions at the beginning of the year.
The contribution from new business before the cost of solvency capital and pension service charge using end of period economic assumptions amounted to 61m for the year ended 31 December 2002.
The contribution from new business for prior periods is calculated using economic assumptions at the end of those periods.
The contribution from new Life & Pensions business before tax is calculated by grossing up the contribution from new Life & Pensions business after tax at the full standard rate of corporation tax.
In respect of stakeholder style pensions business, where a regular pattern in the receipt of premiums has been established the business has been treated as regular premium business.
The contribution between the point of sale and the end of the period is included within the contribution from new business for 2002 and the second half of 2001 but for the first half of 2001 it is included within profit from existing business.
Profit from existing business Profit from existing Life & Pensions business comprises the expected return on the value of in-force business at the start of the period plus the impact of any changes in the assumptions regarding future operating experience, changes in the reserving basis other than economic assumption changes and profits and losses caused by differences between the actual experience for the period and the assumptions used to calculate the embedded value at the end of the period.
c. Development costs Development costs represent investment in the following strategic development: service automation and improvement, stakeholder systems, and e-commerce capabilities.

Asset Management Asset Management has been treated as a separate reportable segment and thus the profit on investment management fees charged to the Life & Pensions business, approximately 4m for the year ended 31 December 2002, is included within Asset Management operating profit.
Expected return on shareholders net assets a.
Expected return on corporate net assets The expected return on corporate net assets is the longer-term rate of investment return on assets held by Friends Provident plc and its non-life subsidiaries.
It excludes the return on the net pension liability asset and the result of the Asset Management business which are shown separately in the summary consolidated profit and loss account.
Expected return on shareholders net assets within the Life & Pensions business The expected return on shareholders net assets held within the Life & Pensions business comprises the return on the shareholders net assets held by the life assurance companies within that business, using the investment return assumptions used to calculate the embedded value at the beginning of the period.
Operating exceptional items: Integration costs Operating exceptional items in 2002 comprises 19m of Asset Management integration expenses relating to the acquisition of Royal & SunAlliance Investments and 3m after grossing up for shareholder tax of Life & Pensions integration expenses relating to the acquisition of Friends Provident International Limited formerly Royal & SunAlliance International Financial Services Limited as referred to in note 34 to the financial statements.
Exceptional items relating to Asset Management operations Exceptional items in 2001 relate to Asset Management operations, and comprise Nil relating to the disposal of Ivory & Sime Asset Management Limited for a net consideration of 9m less net assets transferred of 2m and less goodwill reinstated of 7m: and a charge of 2m relating to the closure of overseas offices.
Effect of economic assumption changes The effect of economic assumption changes reflect the impact of changes in the expected level of future investment returns, asset mix, economic reserving basis, expense inflation and the risk discount rate used to calculate the value of existing business.
Basic and operating earnings per share Earnings per share have been calculated based on operating profit before amortisation of goodwill and operating exceptional items, after tax, and on the loss attributable to shareholders, as the directors believe the former earnings per share figure gives a better indication of operating performance.

Sensitivity analysis The table below shows the contribution from new Life & Pensions business, before the cost of solvency capital and the pension service charge before tax, and the value of existing Life & Pensions business, assuming a 1% increase in the rate of investment return on equities and properties and, separately, a 1% increase in the risk discount rate all other assumptions remaining unchanged.

When interest rates change, expected future investment returns will also change and this in turn will affect projected cash flows.
A change in investment assumptions may also result in a change to the risk discount rate used to calculate the present value of the projected cash flows.
Principal assumptions The table below sets out the principal economic assumptions used in the calculation of the value of the existing business and the contribution from new business new business written in 2002 has been valued using the economic assumptions used to value the existing business at 31 December 2001.
31 December 31 December 2002 2001 %% Risk discount rate 7.0 7.5 Investment returns before tax: Government fixed interest 4.5 5.0 Other fixed interest 5.0 5.5 5.5 6.1 Equities 7.0 7.5 Properties 7.0 7.5 Future expense inflation 3.3 3.6 Corporation tax rate 30 30 Future bonus rates have been set at levels which would fully utilise the assets supporting the in-force With Profit business over its lifetime, after providing for an estimate of the cost of guaranteed benefits calculated on a stochastic basis, and are consistent with the economic assumptions and the companys bonus policy.
The assumed rates of mortality, morbidity, lapse, surrender, conversion to paid-up and early retirement, which are reviewed annually, have been derived from analyses of the Groups recent operating experience and industry studies.
An allowance has been retained for the impact of the introduction of stakeholder pensions.
Maintenance expenses are assumed to increase in the future at a rate of 1% per annum in excess of the assumed long-term rate of retail price inflation.
Allowance for commission is based on the Groups recent experience.
The value of existing business makes no allowance for the payment of future premiums on recurring single premium contracts except for stakeholder style pensions in which case, if a regular pattern in the receipt of premiums is established, the business is treated as regular premium business or for non-contractual increments on existing policies.

Contingent liabilities On 23 December 2002 the Inland Revenue issued a press release announcing measures to improve the effectiveness and fairness of the tax rules for life insurance companies.
The draft clause and schedule to be included in the Finance Bill 2003 was issued on 21 January 2003.
The Inland Revenue proposals as finally enacted may have an impact on Friends Provident Life and Pensions Limited FPLP.
However, as discussions are continuing between the Inland Revenue and the Industry on the measures proposed, there remains uncertainty over the nature and extent of the measures.
As a consequence, the directors are unable to quantify the corporation tax impact on FPLP and no allowance has therefore been made for the possible impact on the achieved profit results.
REPORT TO FRIENDS PROVIDENT PLC ON THE GROUP EMBEDDED VALUE AND SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT ON AN ACHIEVED PROFIT BASIS FOR THE FRIENDS PROVIDENT GROUP THE GROUP Opinion In B&W Deloittes opinion, the methods and assumptions used to determine the embedded value at 31 December 2002, the contribution from new Life & Pensions business and the achieved profit for Life & Pensions business for the year ended 31 December 2002 are reasonable, consistent with the Groups recent operating experience and in accordance with the structure and operation of the Group following demutualisation and listing.
The methods and assumptions have been consistently applied and, in the case of determining embedded values, comply with generally adopted principles.
The method used in calculating the achieved profit is, in all material respects, in accordance with the methodology and disclosure requirements contained in the guidance on Supplementary reporting for long-term insurance business the achieved profits method, issued by the Association of British Insurers in December 2001.
