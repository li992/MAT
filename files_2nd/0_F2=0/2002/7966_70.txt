51 7Taxation continued c Factors that may affect future tax charges The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of c. 26.0m that may improve the rate in future years.
The majority of these relate to losses, mainly arising in the UK with a smaller proportion relating to accelerated capital allowances and other short term timing differences.
These assets are not recognised because they arise in statutory entities that are currently not forecast to make taxable profits.
There are further potential deferred tax assets, relating to losses, of c. 20.0m that are not recognised and are not considered to have any impact on the future tax charge because the possibility of accessing them is considered so remote.
The assets mentioned in this paragraph will only become recognisable if the statutory entities which hold them begin to generate sufficient taxable profits.
There are also losses in Belgium for which an asset of 0.7m has been recognised, based on current forecast profits.
The remaining asset of 2.5m has not been recognised but should it be demonstrated that sufficient taxable profits are likely to be generated in the relevant company, then the asset will be increased.
No deferred tax has been recognised for deferred tax on gains recognised in revaluing properties to market value.
The total amount not recognised is 1.4m.
Such tax would become payable only if the properties were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief.
At present, it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
