N BROWN BACK END 2002 28 5 02 9:51 am Page 43 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies The principal accounting policies of the group are set out below and are consistent with the previous year, as amended for the requirements of Financial Reporting Standard 19 Deferred Taxation.
a Basis of accounting The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of certain listed investments and certain freehold properties, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
b Accounting period Throughout the accounts, the notes to the accounts and the directors report and financial review, reference to 2002 means at 2 March 2002 or the 52 weeks then ended: reference to 2001 means at 3 March 2001 or the 53 weeks then ended.
c Basis of consolidation The group accounts consolidate the accounts of the company, all of its subsidiary undertakings, the Employee Share Ownership Trust and the No.
2 Employee Share Ownership Trust the employee trusts which are made up to a date co-terminous with the financial period of the parent company.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passed.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method.
All unrealised internal profits are eliminated on consolidation where material.
d Turnover Turnover represents the total amount receivable in the ordinary course of business for goods and services supplied and excludes VAT and intra-group sales.
e Tangible fixed assets and finance leases Land and buildings are stated at original cost or subsequent valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment as set out in note 12.
The group has adopted FRS15 and has followed the transitional provisions to retain the book value of certain freehold properties which were revalued in 1994, but not to adopt a policy of revaluation in the future.
Other fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Computer software costs relating to major projects are capitalised.
Assets held under finance leases are included in tangible fixed assets at a value equal to the original cost incurred by the lessor less depreciation, and obligations to the lessor are shown as part of creditors.
The interest element is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the leases to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
f Depreciation No depreciation is charged on freehold land.
Depreciation of all other tangible fixed assets is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation over their estimated useful lives.
In this respect the following annual depreciation rates apply: On freehold buildings 2% of cost or valuation.
On leasehold property and improvements equal annual amounts over the unexpired years of the lease.
On motor vehicles 20% of cost.
On computer equipment and software 20% of cost.
On plant and machinery between 5% and 20% of cost.
On all other tangible fixed assets between 10% and 20% of cost.
g Capitalisation of interest Interest incurred on funding for major capital projects is capitalised as part of the cost of the assets up to the time that they come into use.
The interest rate applied is calculated by reference to the actual rate payable on borrowings utilised for the project.
h Web site development costs Design and content development costs are capitalised only to the extent that they lead to the creation of an enduring asset delivering benefits at least as great as the amount capitalised.
If there is insufficient evidence on which to base reasonable estimates of the economic benefits that will be generated in the period until the design and content are next updated, the costs of developing the design and content are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
N Brown Group plc 43 N BROWN BACK END 2002 28 5 02 9:51 am Page 44 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies continued i Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is capitalised and amortised through the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period which the group expects to derive an economic benefit, which is currently twenty years.
Purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 March 1998 was charged against reserves in the year of acquisition in accordance with the accounting standard then in force.
As permitted by the current accounting standard the goodwill previously written off to reserves has not been reinstated in the balance sheet.
Any goodwill previously charged against reserves will be written back through the profit and loss account in the year of disposal.
Other intangible fixed assets are capitalised and amortised through the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period which the group expects to derive economic benefit, which is currently five years.
j Investments In the company accounts, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
N Brown Group plc shares held by the employee trusts are stated at cost.
Other listed investments are included in the balance sheet at their mid-market value on the relevant balance sheet date.
Surpluses or deficits arising on revaluations are reflected by a movement on the revaluation reserve, which is non-distributable.
In the group accounts, investments in associated undertakings are accounted for using the equity method.
The groups share of the profits less losses is included in the group profit and loss account and the groups share of the net assets is included in the group balance sheet.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associated undertakings is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out above.
Any unamortised balance of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in associated undertakings.
k Operating lease rentals Assets leased from third parties under operating leases are accounted for by charging costs to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease.
lStocks Stocks have been valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value means estimated selling price less all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
m Taxation Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current rate.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
n Treasury and foreign currency The group uses financial instruments to hedge a portion of its interest and foreign currency exposure.
Profits and losses on financial instruments are recognised in the profit and loss account as they arise.
A more detailed description of the groups treasury policy is given in the financial review.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Other transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
All resulting exchange differences are taken directly to the profit and loss account.
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and the results of overseas operations are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
All other exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account.
o Pension costs The group operates a number of pension schemes.
Money purchase scheme contributions are charged against profits as they accrue.
Contributions in respect of the defined benefits scheme are charged to the profit and loss account, based on the advice of an independent actuary, to spread the expected cost of providing pensions over the employees working lives within the scheme, and further details are given in note 30.

24 Prior year adjustment The introduction of FRS 19 requires deferred taxation to be accounted for on a full provision basis instead of a partial provision method previously adopted by the group.
This change in accounting policy has been recognised in the accounts as a prior year adjustment and comparative figures for the 53 weeks ended 3 March 2001 have been restated.

30 Pensions The group operates a defined benefit scheme, the N Brown Group Pension Fund, which provides benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The assets of the scheme are held separately in trustee administered funds.
The pension cost charged to the profit and loss account is calculated by a qualified actuary so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives within the scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuation was undertaken as at 30 June 2000 using the projected unit method.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
It was assumed that the investment return would be 2.4% per annum higher than the rate of annual salary increase and 2.4% higher than the rate at which present and future pensions would increase.
The next actuarial valuation is due to take place as at 30 June 2003.
N Brown Group plc 55 N BROWN BACK END 2002 28 5 02 9:51 am Page 56 Notes to the accounts 30 Pensions continued At 30 June 2000 the market value of the assets of the scheme was 25,186,000 and the actuarial value of these assets represented 105% of the benefits that had accrued to members to the valuation date based on salaries projected to retirement or earlier exit.
There is no material difference between the calculated pension cost to be charged to the profit and loss account and the contributions paid to the scheme.
The group operates a number of much smaller pension schemes.
These schemes are not material in relation to the groups accounts.
Additional disclosures regarding the groups defined benefits pension scheme are required under the transitional provisions of FRS 17 Retirement benefits and these are set out below.
The disclosures relate to the first year of transitional provisions.
They provide information which will be necessary for full implementation of FRS 17 in the year ending 28 February 2004.
The actuarial valuation described above has been updated at 2 March 2002 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of FRS 17.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
The major assumptions used for the actuarial valuation were:.
2002 % Rate of increase in salaries 4.0 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.5 Discount rate 6.0 Inflation assumption 2.5 The fair value of the assets in the scheme, the present value of the liabilities in the scheme and the expected rate of return at the balance sheet date were: Long-term rate of return expected at Value at 2 March 2002 2 March 2002 % 000 Equities 6.95 19,386 Bonds 4.95 4,136 Cash 3.00 330 Total fair value of assets 23,852 Present value of scheme liabilities 29,413 Deficit in the scheme 5,561 Related deferred tax asset 1,668 Net pension liability 3,893 The company has agreed with the trustees to pay 10.0% of Scheme Salaries in respect of normal members, and an additional 1.4% of Scheme Salaries for all members in respect of the Executive and Senior Executive members benefits.
These rates will be subject to review at the date of the next certification of the Schedule of Contributions.
The scheme is a closed scheme and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost would be expected to increase as the members of the Scheme approach retirement.
