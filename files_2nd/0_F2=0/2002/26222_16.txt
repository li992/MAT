Earnings Per Share Earnings per share have been calculated in accordance with FRS 14, Earnings per share using the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue and the loss for the financial year.
Following the adoption of FRS 19 and the Rights Issue in October 2002, 2001 gures have been restated.
The reconciliation between the loss for the financial year and earnings per share and the diluted loss for the financial year and related earnings per share is as follows: 2002 2001 Weighted average Earnings Weighted number per average Earnings of shares share number per restated for restated for of shares Profit loss share 2002 rights issue Profit loss 2002 rights issue mm p mm p Operating profit after tax on continuing operations 5,868 345 5.88 5,609 353 6.29 Operating profit after tax on discontinued operations 40.07 3 0.05 Variation from longer term investment return 54 0.92 55 0.98 Change in equalisation provision 3 0.05 4 0.07 Profit on sale of Banking operations 36 0.61 Profit on sale of Fairmount Group plc 8 0.14 Change in SRC 508 8.66 449 8.00 Loss for the financial year 5,868 180 3.07 5,609 144 2.57 Net shares under options allocable for no further consideration 14 14 Convertible bonds outstanding 285 11 285 1 Diluted loss for the financial year 6,167 169 3.07 5,908 143 2.57 These shares are antidilutive as they would decrease the net loss per share, and are therefore ignored along with their associated revenue impact in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.

The principal impact is the recognition of deferred tax in respect of unrealised appreciation and depreciation of investments and future tax relief for acquisition expenses.
It is estimated that profits after tax for 2002 reduced by 13m 2001: increased by 47m and at 31 December 2002 Shareholders funds increased by 102m 2001: 115m and the Fund for future appropriations reduced by 76m 2001: 405m.
Deferred tax provisions have not been discounted.
As a result of the adoption of FRS 19 the comparative gure for the tax on loss on ordinary activities for 2001 has been restated from the previously reported charge of 42m to a charge of 30m.
The comparative gure for the tax attributable to the long term business fund for 2001 has been restated from the previously reported charge of 76m to a credit of 121m.
The impact of adopting FRS 19 on the 2002 tax attributable to long term business for 2002 is a reduction of the tax charge by 286m.
The impact of adopting FRS 19 on the 2002 tax on loss on ordinary activities is a reduction of the tax charge by 30m.
Although the SRC has been recognised as profit in these financial statements, there has been no corresponding recognition in the FSA regulatory returns, on which the taxation of life assurance business is currently based.
As the payment of incremental tax on this profit depends upon a future event, the occurrence of which is under the Groups control, no event giving rise to the need to provide deferred tax has occurred.
Accordingly no additional deferred tax has been provided.
The maximum amount of such deferred tax not provided was 655m 2001: 768m.
Factors which may affect future tax charges: a No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
b The Group has unrelieved trading losses carried forward of 35m 2001: 30m in its overseas operations.
No deferred tax asset has been provided in respect of these losses as at 31 December 2002 or 31 December 2001, as it is considered more likely than not that there will be no suitable profits emerging in future periods against which to relieve them.
These trading losses cannot be carried forward indefinitely.
In order to obtain relief for them, there must be suitable and sufficient taxable profits emerging in each of the accounting periods ending 31 December 2003 to 2007.
The potential deferred tax asset unprovided as at 31 December 2002 is 12m 2001: 11m.

d The Group has surplus expenses of management carried forward of 42m 2001: 17m.
No deferred tax asset has been provided in respect of these expenses as at 31 December 2002 or 31 December 2001, as it is considered more likely than not that there will be no suitable profits emerging in future periods against which to relieve them.
Relief for these expenses will only be obtained if there are suitable profits arising in future periods.

e The Group has realised and unrealised capital losses as at 31 December 2002 of 42m 2001: 13m.
Relief for these capital losses could only be obtained if there were suitable capital gains arising in the Group in future periods and in the case of unrealised losses the losses were also crystallised by the investments being sold.
The potential deferred tax asset unprovided as at 31 December 2002 is 13m 2001: 4m.

The reported asset mix does not reect the use of derivatives.
The effect of outstanding futures contracts is to change the mix as if: i For long term business the value as reported for shares, variable yield securities and unit trusts increased by 174m 2001: 82m : and ii For shareholders and general insurance funds the value as reported for shares, variable yield securities and unit trusts increased by 457m 2000: 54m.
In both cases deposits would be decreased by corresponding amounts.
The effect of other derivatives is not considered significant enough to be reported separately.
