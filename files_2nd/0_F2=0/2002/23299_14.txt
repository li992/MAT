They have also been prepared on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
a Revenue, expenses and interest payable Income from equity investments, including taxes deducted at source, is included in revenue by reference to the date on which the investment is quoted ex-dividend.
Foreign income is converted at the exchange rate applicable at the time of receipt.
Interest receivable on fixed interest securities, short term deposits, expenses and interest payable are treated on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged to capital where they are incurred in connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments.
In this respect the investment management fee and relevant finance costs are allocated between revenue and capital, in line with the boards expectation of returns from the companys investments over the long term in the form of revenue and capital respectively.
b Investments Listed investments are valued at market prices, foreign currencies being converted at the rates of exchange ruling at the relevant balance sheet date.
Unlisted investments are valued by the directors taking account of latest dealing prices, brokers valuations and other available accounting information as appropriate.
c Realised capital reserves Gains and losses on realisation of investments and differences on exchange are dealt with in the realised capital reserves.
The capital element of the investment management fee along with the associated irrecoverable VAT and relevant finance costs are charged to this reserve.
Any associated tax relief is credited to this reserve.
d Unrealised capital reserves Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held are dealt with in the unrealised capital reserve.
e Taxation Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences to the extent that liabilities are likely to arise in the foreseeable future.

These have been generated because such a large part of the companys income is derived from dividends from UK companies.
Such dividend income does not fall to be taxed within the corporation tax regime and the company therefore has very little income against which to deduct its expenses and finance costs.
These losses are not recognised as a deferred tax asset because the company is not expected to generate taxable income in a future period in excess of deductible expenses for that future period and, accordingly, is unlikely to be able to reduce future tax liabilities by offsetting these losses.

The analysis of total shareholders funds on the face of the balance sheet does not reflect the rights, under the articles of association, of the ordinary shareholders on a return of assets.
These rights are reflected in the net asset value and the net asset value per share attributable to ordinary shareholders at the year end, adjusted to reflect the deduction of the debenture stock at par.

Risk management The major risks associated with the company are market, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
The company has established a framework for managing these risks which is evolving continually as the companys investment activities change in response to market developments.
The directors have provided the manager with guidelines and limits for the management of gearing, investments and financial instruments.
Market risk arises from changes in interest rates, valuations accorded to equities, movements in prices and the liquidity of financial instruments.
Market price risk is managed through investment guidelines agreed by the board with the manager and is discussed at each board meeting.
It is the companys policy to increase its exposure to equity market price risk through the investment of borrowings, thus increasing the opportunity for growth of assets in rising markets but also the risk when markets fall.
The downside risk may be reduced by increasing the level of cash balances through the sale of equities or by the utilisation of derivatives.
All of the companys long term debt is fixed rate which exposes the company to changes in market value in the event that the debt is repaid before maturity.
The debenture stocks in issue provide secure long term funding while short term flexibility is achieved through overdraft facilities.
Information on the debenture stocks is provided in note 12.
Financial assets and liabilities The company's financial instruments comprise equity investments, derivative contracts, treasury bills, AAA money market funds, cash balances, debenture stocks and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations: for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement.
AAA money market funds are open ended investment companies OEICs which provide stability of capital, daily liquidity and income comparable to sterling short dated money market rates.
Short term debtors and creditors are excluded from disclosure as permitted by FRS 13.
Fixed asset investments with a listing see note 9 are valued at middle market prices which equate to their fair values.
The fair values of all other assets and liabilities are represented by their carrying values in the balance sheet.
There were no derivative contracts entered into during the year.
