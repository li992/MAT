Any foreign income is converted at the exchange rate applicable at the time of receipt.

Expenses are charged to capital when they are incurred in connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of investments.
In this respect, the investment management fee and relevant finance costs are allocated between revenue and capital, in line with the boards expectation of returns from the companys investments over the long term in the form of revenue and capital respectively see note 3.
Investments Listed investments are valued at market prices, foreign currencies being converted at the rates of exchange ruling at the relevant balance sheet date.
Unlisted investments are valued by the directors, taking account of latest dealing prices, brokers valuations and other available accounting information as appropriate.
Realised capital reserves Gains and losses on realisation of investments and differences on exchange are dealt with in the realised capital reserves.
The capital element of the investment management fee along with the associated irrecoverable VAT and relevant finance costs are charged to this reserve.
Any associated tax relief is credited to this reserve.
Unrealised capital reserves Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held are dealt with in the unrealised appreciation reserve.

The fee is subject to VAT at the appropriate rate.

The management agreement between the company and Edinburgh Fund Managers plc is terminable by either party on a sliding 2 year period, reducing to 1 year, effective 12 June 2002.

The chairman, who was the highest paid director, received 15,500 200114,000 per annum.
The emoluments of each of the other directors were 10,500 20019,500 per annum.
At the year end, the company has surplus management expenses and loan relationship losses of 34,702,575 200125,136,879 which are not recognised as a deferred tax asset.
This is because the company is not expected to generate taxable income in a future period in excess of deductible expenses for that future period and, accordingly, is unlikely to be able to reduce future tax liabilities by offsetting these losses.

These rights are reflected in the net asset value and the net asset value per share attributable to ordinary shareholders at the year end, adjusted to reflect the deduction of the debenture stock at par.

Risk management The major risks associated with the company are market risk, gearing risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
The company has established a framework for managing these risks which is evolving continually as the companys investment activities change in response to market developments.
The board has provided the manager with guidelines and limits for the management of gearing, investments and financial instruments.
Market risk arises from changes in interest rates, valuations accorded to equities, movements in prices and the liquidity of financial instruments.
Market price risk is managed through investment guidelines agreed by the board with the manager and is discussed at each board meeting.
It is the companys policy to increase its exposure to equity market price risk through the investment of borrowings, thus increasing the opportunity for growth of assets in rising markets but also the risk when markets fall.
The downside risk may be reduced by increasing the level of cash balances through the sale of equities or by the use of derivatives.
All of the companys long term debt is fixed rate, which exposes the company to changes in market value in the event that the debt is repaid before maturity.
The debenture stocks in issue provide secure long term funding while short term flexibility is achieved through overdraft and short term borrowing facilities.
Information on the debenture stocks is shown in note 11.
Financial assets and liabilities The companys financial instruments comprise equity investments, derivative contracts, treasury bills, cash balances, debenture stocks and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations: for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement.
Fixed asset investments see note 8 are valued at middle market prices which equate to their fair values.
The fair values of all other assets and liabilities are represented by their carrying values in the balance sheet.
