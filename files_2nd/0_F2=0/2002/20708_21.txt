From this date the Group began selling Legal & General long-term assurance products, and as part of the new arrangements the entire share capital of Alliance & Leicester Life Assurance Company Ltd was sold to Legal & General on 3 September 2002 for 83.8m cash of 71.3m and deferred consideration of 12.5m, resulting in a loss on disposal of 4.7m in the Group accounts.
The value of long-term assurance business attributable to shareholders included in the consolidated balance sheet comprised: 2002 2001 m m Group Net tangible assets of life assurance company including surplus retained within the long-term assurance funds 50.7 Value of policies in force 32.1 Long-term assurance business attributable to shareholders 82.8 The long-term assurance assets attributable to policyholders are: Investments 323.5 Value of policies in force 32.1 Net current liabilities 42.5 313.1 Less: Long-term assurance business attributable to shareholders 82.8 Long-term assurance assets attributable to policyholders 230.3 The increase in value of the Groups long-term assurance business included in the profit and loss account within Other operating income up to the date of sale amounted to 8.6m before tax 2001: 10.9m and 6.5m after tax 2001: 7.7m.
The value placed on long-term assurance business is calculated by discounting estimated future ows of statutory profits from in-force business at a discount rate that includes a risk margin.
The future ows are based on prudent assumptions about long-term economic and business experience determined with the advice of a qualied actuary.
The risk margin is designed to reect uncertainties in expected future ows.
The key assumptions used are: 2002 2001 Risk discount rate net of tax 8.5% 8.5% Economic assumptions Growth of unit-linked funds p. a. gross of tax 7.0% 7.0% Growth of non-linked funds p. a. gross of tax 5.0% 5.0% Policyholder taxation life 22% 22% Shareholder taxation life 30% 30% Expense ination p. a.
The security given is in the form of bond investments.

Therefore, the Group is not subject to any structural currency exposures.
40 Pensions Pension costs relating to dened benefit and dened contribution sections of the Scheme can be analysed as follows: 2002 2001 a SSAP 24 Disclosures Group m m Regular cost 17.1 18.3 Variations from regular cost i 4.9 1.9 Notional interest on prepayment 1.5 1.6 Total 20.5 14.8 i Variations from regular cost arise from the scheme deficit surplus being spread on a basis changing in line with pensionable payroll over the average expected future working life of the membership 15 years.
The Alliance & Leicester Pension Scheme the Scheme comprises funded dened benefit sections which became closed to new entrants on 31 March 1998.
New employees joining the Group on or after 1 April 1998 were eligible to join a dened contribution section of the Scheme.
The principal scheme is an exempt approved pension scheme under which retirement and death benets are provided for Group employees.
The funds of the Scheme are administered by trustees independently of the nances of the participating employers.
In addition benets are provided by the Company on an unfunded unapproved basis to a number of senior staff recruited since June 1989 whose benets would otherwise be restricted by the Finance Act 1989 earnings cap.
The pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualied actuaries using the projected unit method.
The latest actuarial valuation was made as at 31 March 2002.
The significant assumptions in these valuations were that salaries increase on average by 2.0% p. a. above ination, long-term return on investments is 7.0% p. a. in the period before members reach retirement and 5.5% p. a. in the postretirement period, and that pensions increase at 2.5% p. a.
Assets were valued at their market value as at 31 March 2002.
At 31 March 2002 the market value of the assets of the dened benefit section of the Scheme was 727.7m and this was sufficient to cover 92% of the liabilities for benets due to members in respect of service prior to that date.
As explained in b i of this note, the Group will be making additional contributions to the Scheme in 2003 to address this shortfall.
Contributions to the Scheme in 2002 amounted to 18.1m 2001: 11.8m.
The excess of 2.4m of the dened benefit pension charge over the contributions has reduced the prepayment of 21.8m at the start of the year.
An asset of 19.4m representing total net accumulated prepaid contributions is included in the Group balance sheet as at 31 December 2002.
Post-retirement benets The Group provides post-retirement medical benets to certain pensioners and active employees.
The liability has been assessed by an independent qualied actuary as at 31 December 2002, using the projected unit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in the valuation were a discount rate of 6.0% and medical benefit cost ination of 8.0% for 2 years gradually reducing to 4.35% over 5 years and remaining at 4.35% thereafter.
The charge in the year for post-retirement medical benets in the Group accounts is 1.6m 2001: 1.4m.
b FRS 17 Retirement Benets: Group accounts i Dened benefit section The following disclosures are provided under the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 which requires certain disclosures only for periods ending subsequent to 22 June 2002.
The amounts disclosed under these transitional arrangements, which apply to both the funded and unfunded Schemes, are not included in the Groups financial statements.
If FRS 17 were to be fully adopted, the impact on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, profit and Loss Account and Statement of Total Recognsied Gains and Losses would be as set out below.
The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2002 and updated by an independent qualied actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme as at 31 December 2002.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2002.

Under FRS 17, a discount rate of 5.5% would be used, increasing the provision to 22.0m 2001: 20.2m.
Other assumptions would be unchanged.

Therefore, under the projected unit method, the current service cost will increase as the members of the Scheme approach retirement.
The Group made contributions of 15.0m during the year being 15.4% of pensionable salary 2001: 9.3m being 9% of pensionable salary.
It has been agreed with the trustees that the contribution rate for 2003 will be 17.5%, plus an additional 1.5m per month.
ii Dened contribution section Employer contributions payable during the year were 2.9m 2001: 2.5m.
There were no unpaid contributions at 31 December 2002 or 31 December 2001. c Company accounts It is not possible, on a reasonable basis, to identify the Companys share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Groups dened benefit section of the Scheme and accordingly the Company will account for the Scheme as a dened contribution scheme in accordance with paragraph 9 b of FRS 17.
The Company contributions payable during the year to the defined benefit section were 10.0m 2001: 6.5m.
There were no unpaid contributions at 31 December 2002 or 31 December 2001.
The Company contributions payable during the year to the defined contribution section were 2.3m 2001: 1.9m.

The transaction subsequently resulted in reduced corporation tax paid by the Group of approximately 30m.
The Group has taken legal advice and does not believe that any additional tax liability should arise from these discussions.
However, if any additional liability were to arise, there are indemnities and legal rights, which should enable recoveries from third parties.
Therefore no provision is necessary.
Litigation Certain Group undertakings are engaged in litigation, involving claims by and against them which arise in the ordinary course of business.
The directors, after reviewing the claims pending and threatened against Group undertakings and taking into account the advice of the relevant legal advisers, are satisfied that the outcome of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the net assets of the Group.

i Interest rate repricing analysis The following table provides a summary of the interest rate repricing prole of the Groups assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2002.
Assets and liabilities have been allocated to time bands by reference to the earlier of the next interest rate reset date and the contractual maturity date.
The table takes account of derivative financial interests whose effect is to alter the interest basis of Group assets and liabilities.
The trading book and non-interest bearing balances have been included in a separate column: the interest rate risk of the trading book is analysed under ii below.
Differences between the balance sheet and the totals below for 2001 arise due to the exclusion of life assurance assets and liabilities from the interest rate repricing analysis.

72 Alliance & Leicester Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Notes to the Accounts continued 43 Risk management continued ii Trading book The Groups trading activities are conducted through the Groups Treasury division.
Material trading assets comprise debt securities for which the carrying value is equal to the fair value at 31 December 2002 and 2001.
Dealing profits are disclosed in note 3.
The bank uses a variety of techniques to measure market risk in the trading book, including calculating the sensitivity of the market value of positions to hypothetical changes in interest rates.
The following table sets out the change in the value of the trading book arising from a 1% change in market interest rates, for the year ended 31 December 2002, with all other variables remaining constant: Change in value m m 2002 2001 Highest exposure 0.9 1.0 Lowest exposure 0.3 0.0 Average exposure 0.5 0.4 Exposure as at 31 December 0.5 0.4 The sensitivity analysis technique used by the Group measures the change in the fair value of the Groups trading book arising from hypothetical changes in market rates.
Actual results in the future could differ from these projected figures if fluctuations in interest rates exceeded the hypothetical 1% shift.
The Groups trading book is not materially exposed to other market risks.
iii Fair values The table below compares the book and fair values of some of the Groups financial instruments by category at the balance sheet date.
Where available, market prices have been used to determine fair values.
Where market prices are not available, fair values have been calculated for options by using option-pricing models and for other financial instruments by discounting cash ows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
Minor changes in assumptions used could have a significant impact on the resulting estimated fair values, and, as a result, readers of these financial statements are advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Groups financial position.
The concept of fair value assumes realisation of financial instruments by way of sale.
However, in many cases, the Group intends to realise assets through collection over time.

Thus it excludes mortgages, leases, personal loans and retail savings accounts whose book and fair values differ.
These gures represent accrued interest at the year-end.
73 Alliance & Leicester Annual Report & Accounts 2002 43 Risk management continued The tables below analyse the Groups derivatives portfolios by type of contract and maturity and shows the contract amount and the replacement cost.
Contract amount indicates the volume of business outstanding at the balance sheet date and does not represent amounts at risk.
The replacement cost represents the cost of replacing contracts, calculated at market rates current at the balance sheet date and reects the Groups exposure should counterparties default.
No account is taken of offsetting positions with the same counterparty.

Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging, and the movements therein, are as follows: Group 2002 Group 2001 Total net Total net Gains Losses gains losses Gains Losses gains losses m m m m m m Unrecognised gains losses on hedges at 1 January 2002 2001 249.1 134.6 114.5 199.6 112.3 87.3 Gains losses arising in previous years that were recognised in the year 74.9 45.9 29.0 80.0 56.0 24.0 Gains losses arising before 1 January 2002 2001 that were not recognised in the year 174.2 88.7 85.5 119.6 56.3 63.3 Gains losses arising in the year that were not recognised in the year 88.3 150.5 62.2 129.5 78.3 51.2 Unrecognised gains losses on hedges at 31 December 2002 2001 262.5 239.2 23.3 249.1 134.6 114.5 Of which: Gains losses expected to be recognised in the next year 32.3 44.9 12.6 74.9 45.9 29.0 Gains losses expected to be recognised after the next financial year 230.2 194.3 35.9 174.2 88.7 85.5 The above table shows the gains and losses on off-balance sheet derivative instruments used for hedging by the Group.
The gains and losses do not therefore represent absolute gains or losses expected by the Group as they will be substantially offset by corresponding losses or gains from on-balance sheet instruments.

Excess capital is held within Treasury & Group.
b Costs have been assigned to each sector based on resources consumed.
Corporate overheads not directly attributable to business units, including strategy costs of 50.6m 2001: 84.7m are included within Treasury & Group.
c The Group operates entirely within the banking and insurance business, and operations are not managed on the basis of an allocation of net assets.
The level of banking assets can uctuate throughout the year, therefore the information derived from the year end gures does not provide a picture representative of the year as a whole.
A more meaningful analysis of average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities by business sector is contained within the Business and Financial Reviews on pages 8 to 24. d No geographical analysis is presented because substantially all of the Groups activities are in the UK.
