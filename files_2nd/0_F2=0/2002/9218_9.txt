27 Pensions The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The major schemes are dened benefit funds, with assets held separately from those of the Group.
Although Hilton is responsible for the operation of these arrangements, professional advisors are appointed to run them.
The total pension cost for the Group in 2002 was 16.2m 2001: 10.3m, composed of dened contribution payments of 4.9m 2001: 2.9m, dened benefit regular cost of 11.1m 2001: 9.9m and a dened benefit variation cost of 0.2m 2001: 2.5m credit.
This variation has been calculated using the straight line spreading method, over the future working lifetime of current scheme members.
A valuation of this scheme at 30th June 2002 is currently in progress, but is not yet sufciently advanced to enable an estimate of any future dened benefit pension cost or credit.
The pension cost relating to the dened benefit schemes is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualied actuaries using the projected unit credit method or, where appropriate for closed schemes, the attained age method.
Hilton Group plc Annual Report 2002 41 Notes to the accounts continued 27 Pensions continued The major UK scheme is the Hilton Group Pension Plan.
The key assumptions used to calculate the pension cost for this scheme, which represents the majority of the Groups pension commitment, was that pre-retirement investment returns would exceed increases in earnings by 4% a year, and post-retirement investment returns would exceed 5% Limited Price Indexation by 4% and 3% Limited Price Indexation 1 by 4 4% a year.
The actuarial value of assets is based on a discounted income approach assuming the majority of the assets are invested 3 in a notional fund comprising 25% xed interest securities and 75% equities, with equity dividend growth of 1 4% in excess of ination.
The latest actuarial valuations of the principal funded dened benefit schemes were carried out between 1999 and 2002.
A valuation of the Hilton Group Pension Plan as at 30th June 2002 is currently in progress.
At the operative dates of the latest actuarial valuations the aggregate market value of the assets of these schemes was 280.5m 2001: 287.2m.
In aggregate the actuarial value of the assets represented 102% 2001: 103% of the value of the benets that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
For the funded plans, debtors include 16.8m 2001: 13.9m in respect of the excess of the accumulated contributions paid to the pension schemes over the pension cost charged to the profit and loss account.
In addition, unfunded liabilities exist: German partially unfunded and Swedish pension arrangements with liabilities of 7.3m and 4.0m measured in 2001 respectively and a post-retirement medical arrangement with liabilities of 1.5m 2001: 1.1m.
These schemes are included in the pension cost above and are represented on the balance sheet by a total accrual of 15.1m 2001: 12.0m.
The Group has no significant exposure to any other retirement obligations.
The actuarial valuations were updated to 31st December 2002, by an independent qualied actuary in accordance with the transitional arrangements of FRS 17.
In accordance with FRS 17, the dened benefit liabilities have been measured using the projected unit method.
Some of the Groups smaller schemes are closed and using this method will, in isolation, lead to the current service cost for these schemes increasing as their members approach retirement.
The following table sets out the key FRS 17 assumptions used for the UK dened benefit schemes and a weighted average of the key FRS 17 assumptions used for the non-UK dened benefit schemes.
The table also sets out as at 31st December 2001 and 31st December 2002, the fair value of assets, a breakdown of the assets into the main asset classes, the present value of the FRS 17 liabilities, the deficit of assets over the FRS 17 liabilities, the related deferred tax credit and the net pension liability.

It has been agreed with the Trustees that the Groups contributions will be 19% of pensionable salary until a revised rate is determined following the 2002 actuarial valuation.
In the Netherlands, the Groups employees participate in an industry wide dened benefit multi-employer scheme, where the employers share of the underlying assets and liabilities cannot be separately identied.
As at the end of 2002, on the local valuation basis, the total assets and liabilities were 748m and 752m respectively.
This deficit is taken into account in calculating the employers future contribution requirement.
Group net assets after removing the SSAP 24 net asset and including the FRS 17 balance sheet disclosed above, would be 2,394.3m at 31st December 2002 2001: 2,513.9m as restated.

The initial judgement in the penal case was given in Hiltons favour on 20th September 2002: however, the public prosecutor has appealed and the appeal is scheduled to be heard in April 2003.
The directors believe, on the basis of legal advice, that the company has strong defences and that the outcome of this matter should have no material impact on the Group.
