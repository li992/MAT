BG GROUP PLC 2002 81 notes to the accounts 1 THE IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, RE-PRESENTATION OF GAS TRADING ACTIVITY AND THE 2000 DEMERGER IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Although BG is still accounting for its pension costs using SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs, the transitional disclosure requirements of FRS 17 Retirement benefits are included in note 27, page 106.
RE-PRESENTATION OF GAS TRADING ACTIVITY As part of managing its gas supply portfolio within the UK gas market, BG undertakes gas trading activities the purchase and re-sale of third party gas.
In previous years, BG has presented these gas trading activities on a gross basis within the Exploration and Production segment, i. e. reported within both turnover and operating costs.
In view of the nature of these activities and as they have become more significant, BG believes a net basis of presentation is more appropriate and has restated prior periods accordingly.
The impact of this change is to reduce turnover and operating costs by 130m in 2001, 70m in 2000, 12m in 1999 and nil in 1998.
This restatement has no impact on operating profit.
The components of the results of gas trading activity, which are now presented on a net basis within operating costs in the Exploration and Production segment, are shown below.

These businesses included Transco and BGs property, leasing, technology and energy services businesses.
Transco was a separate reporting segment of BG, but the results of the other businesses transferred were previously reported within the Other activities business segment.
On demerger, the Company declared a dividend which was satisfied by the issue of shares in Lattice Group plc a dividend in specie.
The dividend in specie of 4 689m represented the net assets of the businesses transferred to Lattice on demerger.
The existing shareholders of BG Group plc were given shares in Lattice Group plc on a ratio of one share in Lattice Group plc for every one share held in BG Group plc.
The results of activities transferred to Lattice up to the date of demerger are reported as discontinued operations in these financial statements.
2 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS The reporting segments for BGs continuing operations in 2002 comprise Exploration and Production E&P, Liquefied Natural Gas LNG, Transmission and Distribution T&D, Power Generation Power and Other activities.

House of Lords judgment In 2001, the House of Lords judgment in favour of the Central Area Transmission System CATS partners BGs share 51.18% in their dispute with Teesside Gas Transportation Limited an Enron Corp. subsidiary gave rise to income of 34m included within the E&P operating segment and 17m interest receivable.
Restructuring costs In December 2000, Premier Power Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary undertaking, reached agreement with Northern Ireland Electricity on renegotiation of power purchase agreements in the light of construction of a new CCGT power plant.
The restructuring costs in respect of this project amounted to 29m, and were charged to operating profit attributable to the Power segment.
As at 31 December 2002 the timing of certain restructuring arrangements in the light of construction of the new CCGT power plant has yet to be concluded.
Impairment During 2000, a review of the carrying value of the UK storage assets resulted in a 200m exceptional charge to operating profit attributable to the Storage segment in respect of the impairment of the Rough offshore storage facility.
The review was based upon estimated value in use, calculated from forecast pre-tax cash flows discounted at 8%.
Forecast cash flows were based upon assumptions in respect of the UK and European gas markets, supported by external market commentary, which implied growth in storage revenue to 2007.
The net book value of Roughs fixed assets as at 31December 2000, following impairment, was 390m.
Demerger costs During 2000, BG incurred costs associated with the demerger, including corporate restructuring costs, of 85m of which 42m were attributable to continuing operations Other activities and 43m to discontinued operations.
In addition, BGs continuing operations Other activities bore a charge of 43m, which was more than offset by a related increase of 57m in shareholders funds, relating to the termination of the Sharesave Schemes upon demerger.
An additional impact of the early termination of the Sharesave Schemes on demerger was a 47m cash cost which was included in the dividend in specie and as such had no impact on the profit for that year.
DISPOSAL OF SUBSIDIARY AND ASSOCIATED UNDERTAKINGS AND FIXED ASSETS During 2002, BG disposed of its 100% investment in Iqara EcoFuels Limited, realising a loss of 7m on net assets of 7m.
In November 2001, BG disposed of BG Storage Limited and associated assets realising cash proceeds of 381m and a profit on disposal of subsidiary undertaking of 56m.
The associated assets sold included the remaining interest in the processing facilities at Easington, the Amethyst gas processing condensate transport agreement and BGs interest in the offshore York discovery, generating further proceeds of 40m and a profit on disposal of fixed assets of 22m.
Also, during 2001, BG disposed of a 24.5% share in its subsidiary undertaking, Phoenix Natural Gas Limited Phoenix, the Northern Ireland natural gas distribution company.
The sale reduced BGs interest in Phoenix to 51% and realised proceeds of 49m resulting in a 21m profit on disposal.
Included within the profit on disposal of subsidiary and associated undertakings in 2000 is 305m in respect of the sale of BGs interest in Dynegy Inc.
This profit includes the impact of the write-back of 24m of goodwill previously written off to reserves.
Proceeds of 466m arose on the sale.

a The 2002 tax charge incorporates the rate changes enacted in the Finance Act 2002, including a 10% surcharge on North Sea profits.
This led to a 51m charge relating to opening UK deferred tax balances and a 44m increase in the current year charge.

A brief description of each provision together with estimates of the timing of expenditure is given below: DECOMMISSIONING COSTS The estimated cost of decommissioning at the end of the producing lives of fields is based on engineering estimates and reports from independent experts.
Provision is made for the estimated cost of decommissioning at the balance sheet date.
The payment dates of total expected future decommissioning costs are uncertain, but are currently anticipated to be between 2004 and 2040.
PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT COSTS Pension costs represent the difference between the charge or credit to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and the contributions to the pension schemes see Principal Accounting Policies, page 71 and note 27, page 106.
Post-retirement costs relate to a healthcare plan in respect of Companhia fide Gas fide So Paulo S. A. Comgas.
LONG-TERM GAS CONTRACT LOSS PROVISIONS During the year to 31 December 2001, interests and obligations in two gas sales agreements, initially assigned to BG on the demerger of Centrica in 1997, were assigned to EdF Trading Limited, with BG paying 184m.
This sum was fully covered by a provision made at the time of the Centrica demerger.
DEFERRED PETROLEUM REVENUE TAX The provision for tax on gas and oil activities is calculated on a unit of production basis and represents liabilities expected to crystallise on certain North Sea fields.
The first payment is expected to be made in 2005.
The calculation is based upon estimated production from the period end to the end of field life.
Estimated production in this period is 115 mmboe.
DEFERRED CORPORATION TAX This represents the provision for the tax attributable to timing differences between profits and losses compiled for tax purposes and results as stated in the Financial Statements.
Deferred tax is provided for in full on certain timing differences.
The provision has been calculated as follows: THE GROUP 2002 2001 m m UK corporation tax at 30% and 40% 2001 30% : Accelerated capital allowances 735 506 Other timing differences 196 92 539 414 Overseas tax 82 17 621 431 BG GROUP PLC 2002 103 22 PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES AND CHARGES continued In the event of the distribution of the unappropriated profits or reserves of certain overseas subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associated undertakings, additional liabilities to UK and overseas tax of approximately 200m 2001 252m might arise.

A. and MetroGAS S. A. have recognised losses of 152m in their company profit and loss accounts resulting from the retranslation of their US$ borrowings to Argentine Peso on the devaluation of the latter currency.

F LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BG International Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary undertaking of BG, is one of seven companies collectively known as the Contractor holding interests under a Production Sharing Agreement the PSA with the Republic of Kazakhstan RoK with rights to drill in a sector of the north-east Caspian Sea.
BG International Limited currently has a one-sixth interest in the PSA.
In June 2002, the Kashagan discovery was declared commercial.
In December 2002, the Development Plan and Budget DP&B for the Kashagan Development was submitted to the RoK.
The RoK subsequently wrote to the Contractor alleging that the DP&B was non-compliant with the PSA and that this constituted a material breach of the PSA, which would entitle the RoK to terminate the PSA.
The Contractor has rejected these allegations.
In the event of any proceedings arising from these disputes the Contractor intends to contest vigorously these allegations.
However, the PSA contains provisions for amicable settlement of disputes and discussions have taken place.
First Gas Power Corporation FGPC, in which BG has a 40% shareholding, is in dispute with Siemens AG, Siemens Power Generation and Siemens Inc. collectively Siemens relating to Siemens construction for FGPC of the Santa Rita power station.
The dispute arises from delays in project completion.
FGPC is claiming liquidated damages of approximately 62m owing from Siemens to FGPC and has withheld approximately 59m from its milestone payments to Siemens.
Siemens is claiming that FGPC is not entitled to any remedy including liquidated damages for the delay in completion of the project and is seeking payment of the amounts withheld by FGPC and additional unspecified amounts for costs, loss of profit and finance charges arising from the delay.
Siemens made a formal request for arbitration in January 2003.
FGPC plans to contest vigorously all Siemens claims, including those claims that seek recovery of amounts withheld by FGPC as liquidated damages.
FGPC plans to seek the additional 3m approximately owed by Siemens in liquidated damages as well as additional amounts in counterclaims against Siemens.
In addition, various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
While the outcome of some of these matters cannot readily be foreseen, it is considered that they will be resolved without material effect on the net asset position as shown in these Financial Statements.

27 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The majority of the Groups UK employees participate in the BG Pension Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme was formed on 4 July 2001 by the transfer of assets, based upon a demerger report by independent actuaries, from the Lattice Group Pension Scheme.
Prior to that date, most of the Groups UK employees were members of the Lattice Group Pension Scheme.
Members who transferred from the Lattice Group Pension Scheme retained continuous service as if the BG Pension Scheme had always been in existence.
The Scheme is of the defined benefit type.
It is exempt approved and established under Trust.
The Trustee is BG Group Pension Trustees Limited.
The Scheme is funded to cover future pension liabilities in respect of service up to the balance sheet date.
It is subject to an independent valuation at least every three years, on the basis of which the qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers contributions which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the Schemes assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the Scheme.
Employees contribute to the Scheme at a rate of 3% of pensionable pay.
Participating employers contributions, including Scheme expenses, are certified by the Scheme actuary.
For the year ended 31 December 2002, for the majority of employees, the employers contribution rate was 10% of pensionable pay.
From 1 January 2003 this was increased to 19.9% of pensionable pay.
Higher paid employees may be subject to the earnings cap which is a restriction on the amount of pay which can be used to calculate pensions from a tax approved pension scheme.
The Company has agreed that on becoming capped, employees may, at the Companys discretion, be offered membership of the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme, an unfunded, unapproved arrangement under which their benefits including contingent death benefits would be increased to at least the level that would otherwise have been provided under the BG Pension Scheme had they not been subject to an earnings cap.
Provision has been made in respect of the additional obligations for those post-retirement benefits for members of the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme.
There is an unfunded post-retirement employee benefit plan for healthcare in respect of employees of Companhia fide Gas fide So Paulo Comgas.
The liabilities of this plan are fully provided.
The Group also has a number of defined contribution schemes for its local employees in overseas businesses.
These are not material in Group terms.
UK GAAP SSAP 24 ACCOUNTING FOR PENSION COSTS An independent valuation of the Scheme was undertaken as at 31 March 2002 using the Projected Unit valuation method.
Prior to the adoption of this valuation, the employers contributions payable from 1 July 2001 were set following an independent assessment of the assets and liabilities in respect of BG employees in the Scheme at the date of demerger, also using the Projected Unit valuation method.
The financial assumptions used in these valuations are as follows: Valuation Assessment 31 Mar at demerger 2002 2001 %% Rate of price inflation and pensions increase 2.5 2.5 Discount rate for Schemes accrued liabilities 6.15.4 Future increases in pensionable pay 4.5 4.5 Discount rate for future service costs 7.0 6.5 The independent valuation showed that the aggregate market value of the Schemes assets as at 31 March 2002 was 241m, representing some 99% of the accrued liabilities in respect of BG employees on the assumptions set out above.
The level of employers contributions from 1 January 2003 was adjusted to correct the funding level on a straight-line basis over time.
As at 31 December 2002, the value of the Schemes assets as a percentage of the accrued liabilities in respect of BG employees has been adversely impacted by investment market conditions.
BG GROUP PLC 2002 107 27 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued The costs of the Scheme, assessed in accordance with actuarial advice, together with unfunded and other schemes pension costs and the reconciliation to the balance sheet provision, were as follows: 2002 2001 m m Regular pension cost 19 15 Amortisation of surplus 6 8 13 7 Interest on balance sheet provision 3 3 Net pension charge 16 10 Contributions paid 14 16 Movement in provision 2 6 Transfer of provision in respect of other post-retirement benefits 16 Balance sheet provision as at 1 January 52 58 Balance sheet provision as at 31 December see note 22, page 101 70 52 FRS 17 RETIREMENT BENEFITS The following information in respect of the Scheme, the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme and the Comgas post-retirement healthcare plan has been provided in accordance with the transitional arrangements of FRS 17.

Recognition is on the basis of discounted cash flows of income generating units.
Under US GAAP, before the adoption of Financial Accounting Standard FAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, FAS 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, recognised impairments on the basis of undiscounted cash flows and measured on the basis of discounted cash flows.
The asset to which this adjustment related was disposed of in 2001 and the US GAAP adjustment therefore reversed.
b On 1 January 2002, BG adopted FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Under UK GAAP, prior to the publication of FRS 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, goodwill was taken to Group reserves immediately on acquisition.
As a result of the adoption of FRS 10, goodwill is now capitalised as an intangible fixed asset and amortised.
Before the adoption of FAS 142, goodwill under US GAAP was accounted for in line with FRS 10.
Under FAS 142, goodwill is no longer amortised but is instead reviewed annually for impairment and the UK amortisation charge for the period has therefore been reversed within US net income.
An impairment review of assets was undertaken in order to ascertain any transitional adjustment required.
No adjustment was considered necessary.
Had FAS 142 been implemented in 2001, the net income and earnings per ADS figures would have been 335m and 0.48, respectively.
c Under US GAAP, BG recognised goodwill relating to assets held in Argentina.
Following the devaluation of the Argentine Peso, this goodwill was reviewed and deemed irrecoverable from future cash flows.
d Under UK GAAP, prior to the publication of FRS 10, goodwill was taken to reserves immediately on acquisition.
In 2000, goodwill included 7m written off on the disposal of BGs share of Dynegy Inc.
The reversal of goodwill written off relates to the write-back of goodwill on this disposal.
e Adjustments relating to replacement expenditure relate to discontinued operations only.
Under UK GAAP, BG charged to the profit and loss account replacement expenditure on certain components of plant and equipment mains and services, which was incurred to maintain the operating capability of the Transco pipeline system and to ensure it remained in good repair.
Under US GAAP, such expenditure is capitalised and depreciated.
The adjustment also includes an adjustment to depreciation because assets purchased before 1975 which have always been depreciated under US GAAP were not depreciated under UK GAAP until the implementation of FRS 15 in 1999. f Under UK GAAP, pension costs credited charged against profits relating to the Companys pension schemes are accounted for in accordance with UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP 24, Accounting for pension costs.
Under US GAAP, FAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions prescribes the method and assumptions that may be used to calculate pension costs.
This method recognises the surplus deficit falling outside a 10% fluctuation corridor.
The supplementary disclosures required by FAS 87 and FAS 132, Employers Disclosure about Pensions and Other Post-retirement Benefits are given in note 27, page 106.
The US GAAP pension costs and disclosures incorporate the requirements of FAS 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Termination Benefits.
g Adjustments relating to the termination of zero coupon bonds relate to discontinued operations only.
Under US GAAP, hedges of zero coupon bonds terminated are expensed.
Under UK GAAP, the accounting treatment is not to record an expense because no economic loss has been incurred.
h Under US GAAP, as permitted under FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, BG accounts for stock options under Accounting Principles Board statement APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees as clarified by Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No.
44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation FIN 44 and FASB Interpretation No.
28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans.
In any ten year period, not more than 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company may be issued or issuable under all schemes.
Details of the BG Group Company Share Option Scheme CSOS are given on page 62.
In any ten year period, not more than 5% of the issued share capital of the Company may be issued or be issuable under discretionary share option schemes, including the CSOS.
Under UK GAAP, Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 17 UITF 17, there is no profit and loss account charge in respect of these options as the exercise price is the same as the market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant.
Under US GAAP, variable accounting is applied to this scheme and compensation expense, recognised rateably over the vesting period, is equal to the difference between the market value of the underlying share of the option and the exercise price.
At each reporting period, compensation expense is adjusted for subsequent changes in the market value of the shares since the date of grant.
No significant compensation expense has been recognised for any of the prior periods presented.
114 BG GROUP PLC 2002 notes to the accounts 29 US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES continued Details of the BG Group Sharesave Scheme are given on page 63.
In any five year period, not more than 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company may be issued or be issuable under all-employee share schemes.
Under UK GAAP, no profit and loss account charge is incurred in respect of this scheme as Save as You Earn schemes are exempt from the provisions of UITF 17.
In accordance with FIN 44, the 20% discount on the option price compared to the market price on the date of grant must be recognised as compensation expense over the saving period.
The fair value of the share options granted during the year are estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield of 1.55% 2001 1.15%: 2000 1.1%, volatility of 34% 2001 35%: 2000 35%, risk-free rate of 4.76% 2001 4.85%: 2000 5.25% and an expected life of 9.78 years 2001 4.0 years: 2000 4.1 years.
The average fair value of share options granted during the year was 1.25 per share 2001 2.65 per share: 2000 1.05 per share.
i FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities.
In general, FAS 133 requires that companies recognise all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value.
BG adopted FAS 133 for US reporting purposes on 1 January 2001.
BG uses derivative instruments to manage the risk of fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currencies.
The term of the instruments range between one and 16 years.
Commodity contracts accounted for as derivatives under FAS 133 are marked-to-market and the fair value has been determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate.
The 99m 2001 61m reconciling difference between net assets under UK and US GAAP in respect of the valuation of these contracts comprises assets of 8m 2001 94m offset by liabilities of 107m 2001 163m, nil 2001 8m of which is included within net assets under UK GAAP.
On adoption of FAS 133, the current US GAAP hedging relationships for BGs existing currency and interest rate swaps were fide-designated and marked-to-market.
The fair value of these instruments has been determined based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments.
The currency and interest rate derivative instruments are included within net assets under US GAAP as a 38m asset 2001 18m liability, comprising assets of 57m 2001 25m offset by liabilities of 19m 2001 43m.
Under UK GAAP, assets of 46m 2001 15m and liabilities of 2m 2001 33m have been recognised leading to a net asset of 44m 2001 18m liability.
There are a number of issues pending before the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which may have a material impact on the application of FAS 133: and BGs results under US GAAP will continue to see volatility due to the requirements of this standard to mark-to-market a number of instruments and contracts at a point in time.
j Under UK GAAP, currency translation adjustments on net borrowings are taken to reserves to offset the foreign exchange exposure on foreign investments.
Under US GAAP, the currency translation adjustment on certain borrowings would not be available for this offset and would be expensed through the income statement.
The impact of this accounting difference on BGs net income in 2000 was not significant.
k Under UK GAAP, provision for deferred income tax is required on a full provision basis in accordance with FRS 19, Deferred Tax.
BG adopted FRS 19 in 2001, resulting in a restatement of prior period results.
The impact of the restatement was to reduce net assets as at 1 January 2001 by 392m and to reduce the tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2000 by 23m: results above the profit before taxation line were not impacted.
US GAAP FAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes similarly requires deferred tax to be provided on a full liability basis.
Prior to the adoption of FRS 19, UK GAAP required deferred tax to be provided using the liability method, only to the extent that it was probable that timing differences would reverse, resulting in a tax payment or receipt.
The US GAAP adjustment allocated to continuing operations in 2000 was 165m benefit.
The balance sheet adjustment is calculated under FAS 109 and the deferred tax balances carried forward under US GAAP are shown below: as at 31 December 2002 2001 m m Capital allowances for property, plant and equipment 735 506 Timing differences in respect of US GAAP adjustments 96 53 Petroleum revenue tax 24 86 Other deferred tax liabilities 94 68 757 607 Deferred tax assets 217 156 Net deferred tax liabilities under US GAAP 540 451 Net deferred tax recognised under UK GAAP as published 621 488 Net US GAAP adjustment 81 37 l A reconciliation of basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share is arrived at by adjusting both the numerator and denominator with the adjustments given in note 9, page 93.
The EBITDA figures disclosed in note 9 represent net income plus depreciation, amortisation, interest and tax.
BG believes that EBITDA and related measures of cash flows from operating activities serve as useful financial indicators in measuring the operating performance of gas and oil companies.
EBITDA is not an alternative to UK or US GAAP measurements of net income as an indicator of BGs operating performance or cash flows from operating activities.
The calculation of EBITDA may vary significantly from company to company and by itself does not necessarily provide a basis for comparisons with other companies.
BG GROUP PLC 2002 115 29 US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES continued m Under UK GAAP, FRS 3, Reporting Financial Performance requires that the disposal of businesses meeting specific criteria be reported as discontinued operations.
Operations not satisfying all these conditions are classified as continuing.
Under US GAAP, the disposal of Iqara EcoFuels Limited, which was disposed of in 2002 see note 5, page 90, would have been treated as a discontinued operation.
n Under UK GAAP, Company shares held by employee share trusts are shown within current assets at cost, less amounts written off.
Under US GAAP, those shares not fully vested are regarded as treasury stock and recorded at cost as a reduction of shareholders equity.
o Under UK GAAP, dividends are recorded in the year in respect of which they are declared or proposed.
Under US GAAP, dividends are recorded only in the period in which they are formally declared.
EXPLANATION OF UK US RECONCILING DIFFERENCES NOT QUANTIFIED A Under UK GAAP, income and expenses from non-recurring and significant transactions arising other than in the course of the Groups ordinary activities are recorded as exceptional items.
Items classified as exceptional under UK GAAP see note 5, page 90 generally do not meet the definition of extraordinary under US GAAP and would be classified as operating expenses.
This difference does not result in a difference in net income under UK GAAP and US GAAP.
B In 2000, BG received proceeds of 168m in connection with the securitisation of receivables under the Premier Power CCGT transaction.
US GAAP treats these proceeds as debt compared to deferred revenue under UK GAAP.
No adjustment is required to the reconciliation of shareholders funds since the difference between the UK and US GAAP treatment is not significant as at 31 December 2002.
The debt of 174m, as at 31 December 2002, bears interest at a rate of 7.62% and matures in March 2012.
The increase in US GAAP interest expense would be offset by increased turnover.
C Under UK GAAP, the balance sheets are presented in ascending order of liquidity, whereas under US GAAP assets are presented in descending order of liquidity.
Also under UK GAAP, the balance sheet is analysed between net assets and shareholders funds.
Under US GAAP, the analysis is between total assets and total liabilities plus shareholders equity.
Certain items which are disclosed in the notes under UK GAAP would be disclosed on the face of the balance sheet under US GAAP.
Also under US GAAP, debtors due after more than one year of 93m 2001125m included within current assets in UKGAAP would be classified under long-term debtors.
D Under UK GAAP, BGs Financial Statements include a cash flow statement in accordance with FRS 1 revised 1996, Cash Flow Statements.
This statement presents substantially the same information as that required under FAS 95, Statement of Cash Flows.
FAS 95 only requires presentation of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
Set out below, for illustrative purposes, is a summary consolidated statement of cash flows under US GAAP: for the year ended 31 December 2002 20012000 m m m Net cash provided by operating activities 745 365 1 830 Net cash used in investing activities 1 311 448 760 Net cash provided by used in financing activities 623 110 1 043 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 57 27 27 Cash and cash equivalents at the start of the year 92 65 44 Other movements foreign exchange and 2000 demerger 8 6 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year 141 92 65 Cash and cash equivalents are cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand with a maturity or period of notice of 24 hours or one working day.
NEW US GAAP ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In July 2001, FAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, was issued, effective for years beginning after 15 June 2002.
The standard requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognised in the period in which it is incurred, if estimable, concurrent with an increase in the related assets carrying value.
The increase in this carrying value is then amortised over its useful life.
BG is currently assessing the effect of adopting this standard.
In June 2002, FAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, was issued effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after 31 December 2002.
This standard requires companies to recognise costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan.
The standard is applied prospectively upon adoption and BG does not expect it to have a material impact on its financial results.
02-03, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities, was issued in January 2002 and is effective from 25 October 2002 for all new contracts entered into after that date and for fiscal periods beginning after 15 December 2002 for contracts that remain in effect as of the date of the adoption of this standard.
EITF 02-03 replaces EITF Issue No.
The EITF addresses certain issues related to energy trading activities, including gross versus net presentation in the income statement, whether the initial fair value of an energy trading contract can be other than the price at which it was exchanged, mark-to-market accounting when a contract does not meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133 and additional disclosure requirements for energy trading activities.
BG does not expect the adoption of the standard to have a material impact on its financial results.
