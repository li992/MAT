Smith & Nephew 2002 31 Notes to the accounts Note 7 Taxation 2002 2001 million million Current taxation: UK corporation tax at 30% 2001 30% 8.9 9.5 UK adjustments in respect of prior years 2.3 1.5 6.6 8.0 Overseas tax 38.5 51.4 Overseas adjustments in respect of prior years 3.0 3.6 35.5 55.0 Share of joint venture tax charge 4.5 3.3 Share of associated undertaking tax charge 1.0 Total current taxation 47.6 66.3 Deferred taxation: Origination and reversal of timing differences 14.6 0.3 Adjustments to estimated amounts arising in prior periods 3.0 1.2 Share of joint venture deferred taxation 0.6 0.8 Total deferred taxation 18.2 2.3 65.8 64.0 The tax charge has been reduced by 12.7m 2001 6.0m, of which 0.6m 2001 1.4m arises in the joint venture, as a consequence of the exceptional costs of the write-off of the Advanced Tissue Sciences, Inc. investment and rationalisation and acquisition integration costs and increased by 16.9m 2001 17.7m as a result of the exceptional profit on disposal, leaving the tax charge on profits before exceptional items at 61.6m 2001 52.3m.
The standard rate of tax for the year is based on the UK standard rate of corporation tax of 30%.
The current tax charge differs from the standard rate as follows: 2002 2001 % % UK standard rate 30.0 30.0 Non-deductible non-taxable items 3.0 3.9 Prior year items 3.0 1.1 Overseas income taxed at other than UK standard rate 6.9 5.8 Fixed asset timing differences 3.3 0.2 Other timing differences 6.9 1.0 Total current tax rate 26.7 34.2 Factors that may affect future tax charges Tax rates on the groups overseas profits are generally higher than the UK corporation tax rate so changes in the proportion of profits earned overseas will affect the groups effective tax rate over time.
Tax rates may also be affected by differences between tax allowances and book depreciation.
No deferred tax is recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
However, no significant additional tax charges are expected to arise on amounts that are planned to be remitted in the foreseeable future.

38 Smith & Nephew 2002 Note 19 Financial instruments continued Foreign exchange and interest rate exposures As explained in the financial review on page 13, forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge trading payables and an element of anticipated purchases over the following 12 months.
The groups operating units hold no material unhedged monetary assets or liabilities other than in their functional operating currency.
There are therefore no currency exposures on monetary assets and liabilities that could give rise to material gains or losses in the profit and loss account.
The group also hedges forward its interest rate risk for up to two years using interest rate swap contracts.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts, taken out as hedges, are not marked to market.
Gains and losses thereon are recognised only when the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
The following table sets out the book and fair values of the groups derivative financial instruments.
Market rates have been used to determine the fair values of interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward contracts.

The deferred taxation and retirement healthcare provisions are long-term in nature, as is the timing of their utilisation.
Rationalisation and integration and other provisions are expected to be utilised within two years.
There are no provisions for contractual amounts and hence none are treated as financial instruments.
The movement in provisions for liabilities and charges within the parent company during the year from 6.1m to 2.6m represents utilisation of provisions and changes in deferred taxation.

Its assets are included in the groups balance sheet at fair value at the date of acquisition as follows: Net Fair value Fair value book value adjustments to group Net assets at date of acquisition: million million million Fixed assets 6.5 1.8 4.7 Intangibles 2.4 2.4 Stock 4.5 0.3 4.8 Debtors 6.1 0.2 5.9 Creditors due within one year 4.2 0.6 3.6 Provisions 3.9 3.9 Deferred taxation 15.2 15.2 Net assets 11.4 14.1 25.5 Goodwill arising on acquisition 165.7 191.2 Discharged by: Cash consideration 222.5 Cash acquired in ORATEC 39.1 Costs associated with acquisition 7.8 191.2 The fair value adjustments reflect the adoption of group accounting policies and deferred taxation arising due to trading losses in the acquired entity which are available for offset.
In 2001, ORATEC earned a profit after tax of 0.6m.
For the period 1 January 2002 to 28 March 2002, which was the effective date of acquisition, turnover was 7.9m and the loss after tax of 0.5m comprised 0.8m of operating loss and 0.3m of interest received.
There were no other recognised gains and losses in the three months ended 28 March 2002.
Since acquisition ORATEC has contributed 21.6m to the groups turnover, 3.8m to profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items and incurred a net operating cash outflow of 6.1m including capital expenditure of 0.7m.

Smith & Nephew 2002 45 Notes to the accounts Note 30 Post-retirement benefits The group sponsors pension plans for its employees in most of the countries in which it has major operating companies.
The plans are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds or insurance companies.
Pension plans are established under the laws of the relevant territory, with their assets held in separate trust funds or by insurance companies.
In those countries where there is no company-sponsored pension plan, state benefits are considered adequate.
Employees retirement benefits are the subject of regular management review.
For many years the groups major pension plans in the UK and US have been of the defined benefit type.
However, from 2003 all new employees will be provided with a defined contribution pension plan.
Existing employees will be given the opportunity to choose whether to remain in their existing plan or change to the new arrangements.
Under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members of the defined benefit plans approach retirement.
The pension cost for the groups major defined benefit plans in the UK and US has been determined by independent qualified actuaries, using the projected unit method to give a substantially level percentage cost on the current and expected future pensionable payroll.
The deficit of plan assets to plan liabilities is amortised, using the percentage of payroll method, over the weighted average of expected pensionable payroll and remaining service lives of current employees in the plan.
The actuarial assumptions are as follows: UK US % per % per annum annum Increase in pensionable earnings 4.6 5.0 Increase in pensions 2.6 nil Inflation 2.6 3.0 Net return on investments 7.0 8.0 Average remaining service lives 10 years 13 years At the dates of the most recent actuarial valuations in September and December 2001 the aggregate market value of the assets of the groups main defined benefit plans in the UK and US was 268m 2001 283m: valuations in September 2000 and January 2001 representing 93% of plan liabilities for accrued benefits, including allowance for projected future increases in salaries, resulting in a net deficit of 19.8m 2001 104% and a net surplus of 10.0m.
The estimated deficit of these plans as at 31 December 2002 was 80m.
The unamortised balance of the plan deficits was 22.7m 2001 surplus 8.9m.
The contributions made in the UK and US in the accounting period were 2.6m 2001 2.2m and 5.2m 2001 6.5m respectively.
The contribution rates for 2003 are expected to be 11% of pensionable earnings plus a supplementary payment of 4m in the UK and 4% of pensionable earnings plus a supplementary payment of 5m in the US.
Included in debtors due after more than one year is a prepayment of 5.3m 2001 5.6m and included in creditors is an accrual of 6.4m 2001 7.3m relating to the funding of certain group pension plans.
The group recharges the UK pension plan with the costs of administration and independent advisers.
The amount recharged in the year to 31 December 2002 was 0.4m 2001 0.7m.
The amount receivable at 31 December 2002 was 0.1m 2001 0.6m.
The cost of providing healthcare benefits after retirement of 0.8m 2001 0.1m is determined by independent qualified actuaries.
The unfunded liability of 9.4m 2001 9.2m in respect of the accrued healthcare benefits is included in provisions.
The principal actuarial assumptions in determining the cost of providing healthcare benefits are those in the UK and the US: UK US % per % per annum annum Interest rate 5.6 7.0 Medical cost inflation 6.6 8.0 46 Smith & Nephew 2002 Note 31 Post-retirement benefits FRS 17 The disclosures below show the effect on the groups financial statements had FRS 17 been adopted and relate to the major defined benefit retirement plans in the UK and the US.
