through radioactive implants chromatography a technique used to analyse or separate molecules, such as proteins and DNA coronary angiography a scanning procedure for visualising the arteries that supply the heart with blood CT computed tomography an X-ray technique that provides computer-generated sliced images of the body cyclotron machine in which positively charged particles are accelerated in a spiral path in a vacuum between poles of a magnet, energy being provided by a high frequency voltage across the vacuum used to produce radioisotopes for medical purposes 2D DIGE two-dimensional uorescence difference in-gel electrophoresis, a proteomics research technology for comparison of protein expression samples from normal and diseased tissues, and monitoring the effect of drugs on the tissues DNA the genetic material of most living organisms, which contains heritable characteristics packaged deoxyribonucleic acid in genes electrophoresis separation technique based on the movement of suspended particles through a uid under the action of an electric eld EMEA European Medicines Evaluation Agency, the regulatory authority in the European Union endocardial border visualisation of the surface of the heart muscle, for improved assessment of heart wall motion delineation in ultrasound imaging enzymes any of numerous complex protein substances that are produced by living cells and bring about or accelerate reactions: enzymology, the study of enzymes, their nature, activity and signicance external beam radiation treatment of cancer by irradiating the tumour from a source outside the body FDA Food and Drug Administration, the regulatory authority in the United States FDG uoro-deoxyglucose a sugar molecule labelled with the radioisotope uorine-18, a highly sensitive molecular diagnostic used in PET imaging gamma camera a scanning instrument that detects gamma rays emitted by radiopharmaceuticals, enabling the visualisation of organ function: see SPECT genomics the study of the genetic material on an organism-wide basis eg.
the human genome is the set of genes that code for a human being.
Genomics includes the analysis of gene function, gene expression see microarray and genetic variation see SNP high throughput screening simultaneous screening of large numbers of drug candidates against protein molecules implicated in disease informatics the use of powerful computer technology software and data management systems for the collection, storage, analysis and organisation of very large amounts of biological data 94 Amersham plc Annual Report & Accounts 2002 interferons a group of proteins produced naturally by the cells of our bodies, which increase the resistance of cells to viral infection in vitro biological processes observed outside the body, eg.
