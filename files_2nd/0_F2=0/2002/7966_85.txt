Provision is made for the expected cost of labour and parts based on historic claims experience and expected future trends.
These assumptions are reviewed regularly.
Motors business exits During 2002, the Group became committed to business exits and terminations which resulted in the charge of 2.4m 2001 8.1m to the profit and loss account.
These included the UK Retail dealership exits shown in note 5.
These business exits will be completed over the next two years and will be broadly cash neutral.
Non-motors business exits Provision has been made for warranties, indemnities and other litigation issues in relation to these exits, based on expected outcomes.
During the year the Company reached an agreement with Intertek Testing Services ITS in relation to claims arising from the sale of ITS in 1996.
Under this agreement the Company paid ITS 14.9m US$22.75m in full and final settlement of all claims, including any that may arise in the future.
This payment was fully provided for in prior years.
Any detailed disclosure of the remaining outstanding claims could seriously prejudice negotiations.
Accordingly, no information is given in regard to the likely timing or cash impact as normally required under FRS 12.
These are however referred to in note 21.

These are principally located in the UK.
Provision has been made to the extent of the estimated future net cost.
This includes taking into account existing sub-tenant arrangements.
In determining the provision, the cash flows have been discounted on a pre-tax basis using appropriate government bond rates.
The charge for amortisation of discount of 0.2m 2001 0.2m has been included in the charge to profit and loss account.
The commitments relating to these provisions have not been disclosed within note 22.
