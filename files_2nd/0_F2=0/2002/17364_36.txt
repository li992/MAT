2,852,828 2.930 2001 2008 5,022 3.030 2001 2008 As explained in the operating and financial review on pages 98 and 99, the Groups 36,500 3.270 2001 2008 policy is to hedge the following exposures: interest rate risk using interest swaps, caps and collars: currency swaps: and forward foreign currency contracts: structural 83,500 4.136 2000 2008 and transactional currency exposures, and currency exposures on future expected 42,153 4.210 2005 2006 sales using currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.

3,497 8.110 2005 2011 Non-derivative financial instruments 50,733 8.193 2004 2011 The Group estimates that the aggregate fair value of non-derivative financial 16,700 8.769 2000 2010 instruments at 31 December 2002 does not differ materially from their aggregate 20,875 8.927 2000 2010 carrying values recorded in the consolidated balance sheet.
10,438 8.996 2000 2010 The Group has used the methods and assumptions detailed below to estimate the 4,341 9.010 2003 2004 fair values of the Groups financial instruments.
693,826 9.010 2003 2010 Cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, overdrafts and short-term borrowings including those drawn under the Revolving Credit Facilities are considered to 13,548 9.010 2004 2010 approximate fair value because of the short maturity of such instruments.
This is calculated by reference to market prices at 31 December 2002.
Considerable judgement is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value, and, accordingly, the estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realised in a current market exchange.
As at 31 December 2002, unexercised options over ordinary shares of 3,739,675 and unexercised options over ADRs of 349,190 have been granted under the WPP The weighted average fair value of the option element of the awards made under Worldwide Share Ownership Program as follows: the Leadership Equity Acquisition Plan LEAP in the year, calculated using the Number of ordinary Exercise price Black-Scholes model, was as follows: shares under option per share Exercise dates 2002 2001 2000 130,875 2.700 2000 2007 Fair value 319.7p 236.2p 299.9p 365,625 3.400 2001 2008 Weighted average assumptions: 86,800 4.210 2005 2012 Risk-free interest rate 5.06% 5.00% 5.80% 21,125 4.210 2005 2013 Expected life months 60 48 48 17,625 5.210 2004 2011 Expected volatility 45% 40% 40% 508,025 5.320 2002 2009 Dividend yield 1.0% 0.6% 0.6% 14,000 5.320 2003 2009 The option element was granted at an exercise price equal to market value on the date 21,375 5.990 2004 2011 of grant.
