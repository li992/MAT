Currency and interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities The currency and interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2002, after taking account of the interest rate and currency swaps used to manage the interest and currency profile, was: 2002 2001 NON-INTEREST FLOATING NON-INTEREST FLOATING TOTAL BEARING RATE TOTAL BEARING RATE m m m m m m Financial assets Sterling 1.9 0.9 1.0 2.6 0.6 2.0 US Dollar 17.8 15.5 2.3 20.2 17.6 2.6 Other 16.5 16.5 13.9 13.9 36.2 16.4 19.8 36.7 18.2 18.5 Financial assets comprise: cash 18.9m 2001 18.0m, short-term deposits 0.9m 2001 0.5m, long-term debtors nil 2001 0.1m, and fixed asset investments 16.4m 2001 18.1m.
There is no fixed maturity for financial assets on which no interest is paid.
Floating rate assets and liabilities bear interest at market rates for bank deposits and borrowings based on LIBOR and national base rate equivalents.
Financial liabilities on which no interest is paid do not have fixed maturity dates and, therefore, it is not possible to calculate a weighted average period of maturity.
Fixed rate liabilities comprise guaranteed senior unsecured loan notes issued in Sterling and US Dollars under a private placement totalling 185.3m 2001 nil.
The above analysis includes interest rate swaps totalling 182.0m 2001 253.1m, of which 81.1m are cancellable by third parties in 2004.
Kidde plc 2002 39 BORROWINGS OTHER TOTAL 20 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED m m m The maturity of financial liabilities at 31 December 2002 was as follows: Within one year 36.8 3.2 40.0 From one to two years 1.8 1.8 From two to five years 90.9 7.7 98.6 After five years 185.3 1.5 186.8 313.0 14.2 327.2 The maturity of financial liabilities at 31 December 2001 was as follows: Within one year 27.5 5.7 33.2 From one to two years 66.3 3.3 69.6 From two to five years 237.1 8.2 245.3 330.9 17.2 348.1 Currency risk The Groups reported profits and overseas investments are affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
Where appropriate, local currency borrowings and swaps are used to hedge the currency exposure arising from the translation of overseas net assets in the same currency.
Offsetting assets and liabilities are defined as those that give rise to no gain or loss in the profit and loss account because they are either denominated in the same currency as the Group activity to which they belong or because, under the provisions of SSAP 20, exchange gains and losses arising on the translation of currency borrowings qualify as a hedge against currency net investments and are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Operating companies are required to hedge with Group Treasury all significant currency transaction exposures into their functional currency.
After taking into account the effect of any hedging transactions to manage currency exposures, the Group did not have a material profit and loss exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities at 31 December 2002.
US Dollar borrowings in UK companies amounted to $250.0m in 2002 2001 $200.0m.
Euro borrowings in the UK amounted to 21.3m in 2002 2001 nil.

These values are based upon quotations from counterparties, taking into consideration interest and exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been assessed by discounting future cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
Other financial assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or there is no material difference between book and fair value.
40 Kidde plc 2002 notes to the financial statements continued 20 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Principal hedging instruments At 31 December 2002, forward foreign currency contracts were outstanding to a total Sterling value of 83.7m 2001 90.7m, representing hedges in respect of future transaction and translation exposures.
At 31 December 2002, interest rate swaps were outstanding totalling 182.0m 2001 253.1m.
The net effect of these interest rate swaps was to convert floating rate borrowings to fixed rates.

Acquisition reorganisation provision has been made for the committed cost of reorganising recently acquired businesses.
The closing provision relates principally to the costs of integrating Ajax Fire Protection Services BV into the European Fire Protection division in 2003.
Post-retirement the Kidde Group has a wide range of post-retirement obligations which vary by country and company.
These are longterm liabilities, assessed using actuarial principles and calculated in accordance with SSAP 24.
It is expected that the utilisation in a given year will be offset by the profit and loss account charge in respect of active members.
Kidde plc 2002 41 21 PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES AND CHARGES CONTINUED Litigation environmental provision has been made for the anticipated cost of resolving litigation and environmental issues, based on professional advice.
The timing of the settlement of these claims is uncertain, but it is expected that these provisions will be utilised over the short to medium-term.
Property the provision covers onerous contract obligations for leasehold properties where vacated or where the sublet income is insufficient to meet all obligations under the lease.
The duration of these contracts ranges from one to nine years.
Warranty provision has been made for the likely costs arising on returned products under warranty of 5.8m 2001 5.6m.
Such warranty periods continue for up to ten years and the provision is based on levels of claims experienced historically.
Specific allowance is made for known product warranty issues.
Provision has also been made for potential claims arising from warranty and indemnity claims under the sale contracts on disposal of businesses of 2.1m 2001 4.2m.
Other provisions consist of a wide range of other individually small obligations provided in accordance with FRS 12.

Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
Contributions to the Groups defined benefit pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
The contributions are determined by a qualified actuary.
SSAP 24 Retirement Benefits The principal defined benefit schemes operate in the UK and the US.
The key assumptions used in the SSAP 24 valuation of the UK scheme are: Rate of price inflation 2.5% Return on assets above inflation: pre-retirement 7.0% post-retirement 5.5% Increase in earnings above inflation 2.5% The UK pension scheme, which was closed to new members in 2000, was valued at 5 April 2002.
The total market value of the assets of the fund was 51.0m 2001 47.4m which compares with the past service liabilities of 56.2m 2001 48.6m producing a deficit of 5.2m 2001 1.2m.
This deficit is being spread over average future service lives of 12 years.
The Groups contribution rate was 11.2% 2001 14.8%.
The US pension scheme was valued at 31 December 2002 using similar assumptions to the UK.
The market value of the investments was 25.9m 2001 24.5m which compared with the past service liabilities of 33.2m 2001 32.9m, producing a deficit of 7.3m 2001 8.4m.
Additional contributions are being made to correct the deficiency on a current funding basis.
The Group also operates other post-retirement benefit schemes in a number of countries throughout the world.
The principal scheme is the post-retirement medical scheme in the US.
The key assumptions used in the last valuation at 31 December 2002 were: Discount rate 7.5% Medical inflation rate 6.5% FRS 17 Retirement Disclosures Whilst the Group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24, under FRS 17 transitional disclosures are required as set out below.
The valuation was updated by the actuary on an FRS 17 basis as at 31 December 2002 for the US and UK pension schemes.
The financial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under FRS 17 were: 2002 2001 UK OVERSEAS UK OVERSEAS PROJECTED PROJECTED PROJECTED PROJECTED UNIT UNIT UNIT UNIT Rate of general increase in salaries 4.00% 4.00% 4.00% 4.00% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.50% 2.50% 2.50% 2.50% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 5.50% 7.00% 5.75% 7.00% Inflation assumption 2.50% 2.50% 2.50% 2.50% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

The Group, in the normal course of business, is also involved in certain claims and litigation involving product liability, patent infringement and contract disputes.
Management believes that insurance coverage in effect will be sufficient to cover any liability or that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Groups consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
The Group has contingent liabilities for certain potential claims from third parties in relation to companies acquired or sold by Williams PLC prior to demerger.
Due to the long-term nature and subjectivity of these potential claims, it is not practical to assess their impact at this time.
The parent company has contingent liabilities at 31 December 2002 of nil 2001 nil.
