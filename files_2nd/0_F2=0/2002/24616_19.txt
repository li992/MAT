4 Long-term Incentive Plan Former Bank of Scotland Directors Share options granted between 1995 and 2000 under Bank of Scotlands plans were subject to a performance pre-condition on exercise that options were not capable of being exercised unless growth in diluted earnings per share EPS exceeded the growth in the Retail Prices Index over a period of at least three consecutive financial years by not less than 2% per annum.
No performance target will apply in respect of unapproved share options following the third anniversary of grant, as agreed by Bank of Scotland stockholders at the time of the merger.
The performance target in respect of approved share options has now been satisfied for all grants EPS performance for the most recent grants is illustrated in Chart 2 opposite and consequently all approved options become exercisable in accordance with the rules of the plans.
No further grants will be made under any of these plans.
