Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2002 1.
Accounting policies Accounting convention The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the results of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings.
No profit and loss account is presented for Celltech Group plc as provided by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
The results of businesses acquired are included in the Group accounts from their date of acquisition.
Income recognition Revenue from product sales is recognised upon receipt and acceptance by the customer by 31 December of each year.
Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are based upon the terms of sale in the same period that the related sales are recorded.
Provisions for returns and other adjustments are made in the period that the related sales are recorded.
Royalties receivable under licensing agreements are recognised as they are earned and are recorded within turnover.
Revenue under research and development reimbursement contracts, where there is no obligation to repay such amounts, is recognised as the related costs are incurred and is recorded as a credit to research and development expenditure.
Income associated with performance milestones is recognised based upon the occurrence of the event that triggers the milestone payment, as defined in the respective agreements, and is recorded as Other income.
Other payments received, such as licence fees, are assessed on a case by case basis taking into account the nature of the payment and the ongoing collaboration, if any, with the third party and any possible related continuing obligations.
Depending on the nature of the arrangement, amounts received may be recognised immediately as a component of Other income or deferred over the development or other appropriate period.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of the net separable assets acquired at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill arising after 1 January 1998 is capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life, normally not exceeding 20 years, on a straight line basis.
Prior to 1 January 1998 goodwill was written off directly to reserves and upon disposal would be charged to the profit and loss account.
Intangibles Intangible assets represent acquired licences, patents, platform technologies and marketing rights, where these relate to specific compounds, products or know-how which are being developed or used for commercial applications.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are capitalised at cost.
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business are capitalised separately where their value can be measured reliably: otherwise they are treated as part of goodwill acquired with that business.
Separately capitalised intangible assets are stated at cost less provision for amortisation.
Intangible assets in relation to licences, patents and marketing rights are amortised over their estimated useful lives to match the sales of the related products or, where this is not readily identifiable, on a straight-line basis.
Estimated useful lives are reviewed annually and are generally presumed not to exceed 20 years.
Platform technologies supporting the Groups discovery research strategy are presumed to have an indefinite life and consequently are subject to annual reviews and amortised as necessary if impairment is considered to have taken place.
Research and development Research and development expenses include related salaries, contractor fees, building costs, utilities and allocations of appropriate administrative overheads.
Research and development costs also include activities such as product registration and regulatory costs.
All such costs are charged to research and development expenditure as incurred.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided on all fixed assets at rates calculated to write the cost of each asset down to estimated residual values evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Leasehold properties and improvements the shorter of 20 years or the lease term Freehold buildings 50 years Freehold land No depreciation Plant and machinery 2 to 10 years 52 Celltech Annual Report 2002 1.
Accounting policies continued Stocks Stock of material for use in scheduled clinical trials is written off to investment in research and development upon use or at the termination of the programme.
The total clinical trial stock on the balance sheet as at 31 December 2002 is 7.9 million 2001: 6.6 million.
Other stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Leased assets Assets acquired under finance leasing arrangements are capitalised at cost upon inception and depreciated over their expected useful lives.
The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Outstanding future lease obligations are shown in creditors.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as they accrue.
Foreign currencies The profit and loss accounts and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange, other than substantial exceptional items which are translated at the rate on the date of the transaction.
The adjustment to closing rates is taken to reserves.
Balance sheets are translated at closing rates.
Exchange differences arising on the re-translation at closing rates of the opening balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries are taken to reserves, less exchange differences arising on related foreign currency borrowings.
Tax charges and credits arising on such items are also taken to reserves.
Other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged forward, at the rate of exchange under the related foreign currency contract.
Preference share dividends Accumulated unpaid preference share dividends are accounted for as a reserves accrual see note 25.
Pensions The Group operates contributory and non-contributory defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes covering the majority of its employees.
The scheme funds of the defined benefit plans are administered by trustees and are independent of the Groups finances.
Contributions are paid to the schemes in accordance with the recommendations of independent actuaries.
The Groups contributions are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the costs of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
As permitted by SSAP 24, and as indicated in note 27, the defined benefit schemes of certain overseas subsidiaries are accounted for under local GAAP due to the difficulties and cost of obtaining the necessary actuarial information.
Payments to defined contributions schemes are expensed as incurred.
Equity investments Current asset equity investments are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In determining net realisable values, market values are used in the case of listed investments and Directors estimates are used in the case of unlisted investments.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided on timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date on a non-discounted basis except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which future reversals of the underlying timing difference can be deducted.
Contingent liabilities The Group is involved in certain legal proceedings, arising in the normal course of its business, as discussed in the contingent liabilities note to the Financial Statements see note 28.
Provision is made in the accounts for all liabilities which might be reasonably expected to materialise from these claims.
Financial instruments The Group uses financial instruments, in particular forward exchange contracts to manage the financial risks associated with the Groups underlying business activities and the financing of those foreign activities.
The Group does not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
A discussion of how the Group manages its financial risks is included in the Financial Review and in note 21.
The primary financial instruments used by the Group are forward exchange contracts which are used to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts in foreign currencies.
As the hedges are not matched to specific receivables gains and losses are not recognised until such time as they have been realised.
The aggregate fair values at the balance sheet date of the hedging instruments described above are disclosed in note 21 to the accounts.

Taxation Year to Year to 31 Dec 2002 31 Dec 2001 m m UK corporation tax at 30% 2001:30% 0.7 5.0 Utilisation of tax losses 0.7 5.0 UK corporation tax Overseas federal and state tax 4.7 2.1 Overseas deferred tax 2.9 6.0 Overseas taxation 7.6 8.1 Deferred tax credit on goodwill 5.1 5.2 Taxation charge 2.5 2.9 The deferred tax credit on goodwill arises as a result of the adoption of FRS 19 Deferred Tax during 2001.
The standard requires that a full provision is recognised for deferred tax liabilities including those in respect of goodwill on which tax benefits are obtained.
This resulted in the Group recognising an additional deferred tax liability on the acquisition of Medeva of 15.3 million, recorded as a prior year adjustment in 2001, of which 5 million has been taken as a credit in 2000, 5.2 million has reversed in 2001 and the remaining 5.1 million has reversed in 2002.
The table below reconciles the actual tax charge to the expected tax charge, computed by applying the UK tax rate of 30% 2001: 30% to the loss on ordinary activities before taxation: Year to Year to 31 Dec 2002 31 Dec 2001 m m Expected tax credit at UK corporation tax rate 13.0 15.8 Permanent difference on goodwill 23.3 23.4 Restructuring costs 4.7 2.3 Difference in local tax rates 0.3 3.5 Utilisation of losses 1.3 5.0 Other 0.1 0.7 Current taxation charge 4.7 2.1 The deferred taxation provision at the end of the year is set out below: As at As at 31 Dec 2002 31 Dec 2001 m m Accelerated capital allowances 3.6 6.1 Other non-current tax liabilities 53.7 59.4 57.3 65.5 The movement in the provision in the year is set out in note 20.
There are taxation losses of approximately 291 million 2001: 278 million which have not been recognised.
Celltech Annual Report 2002 57 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 9.
Earnings per share The basic loss per share is based upon a loss of 46.0 million 2001: loss of 55.7 million after deduction of accrued unpaid preference share dividends of 0.2 million 2001: 0.2 million and a weighted average number of shares in issue of 275.4 million.
In addition for the years ended 31 December 2002 and 2001 the earnings per share before goodwill and restructuring items is provided which is based on a profit of 42.6 million 2001: profit of 39.5 million.
This is reconciled to the loss of 46.0 million 2001: loss of 55.7 million as set out below: Year to Year to 31 Dec 2002 31 Dec 2001 m m Attributable loss 46.0 55.7 Goodwill amortisation 93.7 92.6 Restructuring costs 7.8 Tax on goodwill 5.1 5.2 Adjusted profit 42.6 39.5 The diluted earnings loss per share takes into account the dilutive effect of share options and convertible preference shares.
A reconciliation between the number of shares used in the calculation of the basic and diluted earnings loss per share is shown in the table below: Year to Year to 31 Dec 2002 31 Dec 2001 Number Number m m Basic weighted average number of shares 275.4 274.5 Share options 0.6 2.6 Convertible preference shares 1.9 1.9 Diluted number of shares 277.9 279.0 Due to the loss-making position of the Group, the exercise of share options and conversion of preference shares do not increase the basic loss per share and therefore according to FRS 14 the basic and diluted loss per share remain the same.
The 2002 and 2001 earnings per share before goodwill and restructuring items has been adjusted for the dilutive effect.
Profit attributable to members of the holding company In accordance with the exemption allowed by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
The profit dealt with in the financial statements of the Company was 6.8 million 2001: profit 7.7 million.

Included within intangible assets is a payment of 11.8 million to Abgenix for extensive access to its SLAM Selective Lymphocyte Antibody Method technology.
Amortisation has not been charged on this in the year as the Directors consider that it has an indefinite life.
As required by FRS 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, the Directors have undertaken an impairment review to support the carrying value.
The SLAM technology has been combined with the Groups existing antibody technologies in order to expand the breadth of the antibody pipeline and extend the repertoire of drug targets.
The technology is seen as core to Celltechs research activities and will continue to benefit the Group for the foreseeable future, accordingly Celltech has rebutted the presumption that useful economic life should be no longer than 20 years as permitted by FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
As required by FRS 10 this matter will be kept under review and SLAM will be subject to an annual impairment review.
During July 2002, the Group announced that it had entered into arrangements with Pharmacia to access its product Dipentum in the US and European markets.
The European product rights were acquired outright for $20 million.
The US agreement provided Celltech with exclusive sales, marketing and distribution rights until January 2005 at which time Celltech can acquire the product outright at its option for $5 million.
The substance of the US transaction is that of an outright acquisition settled through a series of payments which are capital in nature over the period to January 2005 followed by the $5 million exercise element.
In accordance with FRS 5, Reporting the Substance of Transactions, the Group has capitalised the total of these payments of $35.4 million.
The total capitalised for the European and US rights is thus $55.4 million 35.3 million.
The total capital payments made during 2002 amounted to 14.7 million.
The Dipentum asset is being amortised over 15 years which is based on the Directors estimate of useful economic life.
In estimating the useful life the Directors have had regard to market projections, barriers to entry and risk of generic products and substitutes.
Dipentum sales recorded by the Group in 2002 post acquisition are 4.6 million.
Celltech Annual Report 2002 59 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 12.
The Group has assets in the course of construction or commissioning which are not depreciated of 18.4 million 2001: 24.7 million.

Investments include two five-year convertible loan notes issued by PowderJect Pharmaceuticals plc, one for 25 million issued on 2 October 2000 and a second for 6 million issued on 30 March 2001.
These were issued at par, pay interest half yearly at 4% per annum and have a yield to maturity of 7%.
Interest is being accrued and credited in the profit and loss account at the 7% rate.
The loan notes are convertible by Celltech into PowderJect ordinary shares at a fixed price of 7.19.
The loan notes can be redeemed at par by PowderJect, subject to the payment of a redemption premium of 13% per annum thereon.
If the notes are not converted to PowderJect ordinary shares within five years of issue they will be redeemed at 117.6% of par value.
Investments continued A loan note of SwF 4.25 million 1.9 million issued by Tillotts Pharma AG has been reclassified from other debtors to long term investments during the year.
This loan note was issued to Medeva PLC on 26 April 1999.
The loan note bears interest at 4% per annum and is repayable in annual installments dependant on the underlying adjusted profits of Tillotts Pharma AG, or at the latest by 31 December 2011.
In line with the loan agreement no payments of principal have yet to be received, accordingly the loan note has been reclassified to reflect its long term nature.
In 2001, Celltech acquired a minority interest in Neogenesis for $10 million 7.0 million.
This investment is of a long-term strategic nature and is carried in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value to the Group.
In total 1,675,042 shares of common stock are owned by Celltech representing approximately a 7% shareholding in Neogenesis.

In total during 2002 the Group disposed of 937,000 shares in Targeted Genetics Corporation and 207,500 shares in Matrix Pharmaceuticals Inc.
The disposals generated cash of 1.1 million and resulted in a loss of 0.9 million which has been recorded within research and development expenditure.

The Group has successfully placed external product liability insurance coverage for 100 million in excess of 50 million and thereafter is self insured.
Whilst no methylphenidate claims have been received since 20 September 2001, the Group has provided 2.5 million based on an external review of the likely liability associated with incidents that may arise from past sales.
A further 0.4 million has been provided for product recall and other liabilities for which the Group has no external insurance.
Settlement with ML Laboratories During the year Celltech negotiated a settlement to terminate certain co-development relationships with Innovata Biomed, a subsidiary of ML Laboratories, which had been inherited with the Medeva acquisition.
The terms of the termination included a 4.0 million payment to Innovata Biomed of which the final 2.0 million was paid in January 2003.
The settlement allowed the release of the remaining provisions of 1.6 million held by the Group in relation to this matter.
This provision had been established as part of the fair value adjustments on the Medeva acquisition.
In total the settlement of this liability resulted in a credit of 3.1 million to the Group profit and loss account through the release of the provision discussed above and other stock and debtor provisions held in relation to the potential exposures.
Derivatives and other financial instruments The disclosures below, with the exception of currency exposures, exclude short-term debtors and creditors where permissible under FRS 13.
The following categories of short-term creditor are included below: borrowing and leasing obligations and foreign currency denominated deferred consideration.
The main risks arising from the Groups use of financial instruments and the strategy for managing these are set out below: Interest rate risk The Group has 31.2 million US$50 million of fixed borrowings repayable in December 2003 in the form of a private placement which carries an interest rate of 6.51% 2001: 6.51%.
Liquidity risk The Group ensures that it has sufficient long-term funding and committed bank facilities to meet foreseeable peak borrowing requirements.
As at 31 December 2002 the Group had 107.2 million of committed facilities 2001: 125.5 million of which 76.0 million were undrawn 2001: 91 million.
Foreign currency risk Approximately 50% 2001: 42% of the Group assets excluding goodwill are in the US.
The Groups only borrowing is denominated in US$ which provides a partial hedge against exchange gains or losses on these assets.
However, the Group does not currently actively hedge against the effect of exchange rate differences resulting from the translation of foreign currency earnings but does, where appropriate, seek to hedge significant transaction exposures which includes hedging material surplus balances not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit.
The Group uses financial derivatives, in particular forward currency contracts, to manage the financial risks associated with the Groups underlying business activity.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Credit risk A large number of major international financial institutions are counterparties to the foreign exchange contracts and deposits transacted by the Group.
Counterparties for such transactions entered into during the year have a long-term credit rating of A or better.
The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties, together with their credit ratings, and, by policy, limits the amount of agreements or contracts it enters into with any one party.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in interest rate and foreign exchange management do not represent the credit risk arising through the use of these instruments.
The immediate credit risk of these instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive value.
Cash at bank and liquid resources principally comprise money market deposits, commercial paper and investments.
The investments are with counterparties having strong credit ratings.
The Group considers the possibility of material loss in the event of non performance by a financial counterparty or the non payment of an account receivable to be unlikely, other than as already provided for in the accounts.
However, the position is kept under review particularly having regard to the Groups loan notes and Armstrong debtor see note 15. i Interest rate risk At fixed Interest Group At fixed Interest Group interest free Total interest free Total 2002 2002 2002 2001 2001 2001 Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities m m m m m m Sterling 1.7 1.7 2.8 1.0 3.8 US dollar 31.2 23.5 54.7 34.5 3.0 37.5 Swiss Francs 5.8 5.8 Preference shares 3.4 2.4 5.8 3.4 2.2 5.6 36.3 25.9 62.2 40.7 12.0 52.7 Weighted average Weighted average Weighted average Weighted average interest rates period for which interest rates period for which rates are fixed rates are fixed 2002 2002 2001 2001 Fixed rate financial liabilities % Months % Months Sterling 6.7 35 7.2 35 US dollars 6.5 12 6.5 24 Preference shares 6.9 3 6.9 15 6.6 12 6.6 24 The interest-free liabilities are in relation to Dipentum deferred consideration, pension obligations provided in the US and accrued preference share dividends.

Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Floating rate financial assets comprise cash deposits in the money market, certificates of deposit and commercial paper.
These include deposits where the interest rate is fixed until maturity but, as the original maturity is less than one year, they are classified as floating fixed rate financial instruments.
Fixed rate deposits comprise 32.9 million 2001: 31 million of convertible loan notes see note 13 for duration carrying a weighted average interest rate to maturity of 6.8% 2001: 7%.
The interest free assets in the current year relate to the investment in Neogenesis see note 13 and long-term debtors see note 15.
In 2001 the interest free assets consisted of the Neogenesis investment, the equity investments which were held by the Group see note 16 and long-term debtors.
In the disclosures above and in v below, prior year figures have been adjusted to include preference shares and long-term debtors in line with the current year presentation.
ii Currency exposures The table below shows the Groups transactional currency exposures that give rise to net currency gains and losses in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved.

The Group currently has no reason to believe that it will not be able to continue to meet the requirements of these covenants.
The undrawn revolving credit facility has been renegotiated during the year and is now available until December 2005. v Fair value of financial instruments Book Value Fair Value At 31 Dec 2002 At 31 Dec 2001 At 31 Dec 2002 At 31 Dec 2001 m m m m Primary financial instruments: Cash and shortterm deposits 105.1 90.4 105.1 90.4 Convertible loan notes 32.9 31.0 32.9 31.0 Investment in Neogenesis 7.0 7.0 7.0 7.0 Long-term debtors 5.9 5.9 5.7 5.7 Other creditors 2.9 4.0 2.9 4.0 Finance leases 1.7 2.8 1.7 2.8 Senior loan notes 31.2 34.5 31.2 34.5 Deferred consideration 20.6 5.8 20.6 5.8 Equity investments 2.0 2.0 Derivative financial instruments forward exchange contracts 8.8 1.9 Preference shares 5.8 5.6 6.7 16.3 88.7 83.6 96.4 74.6 66 Celltech Annual Report 2002 21.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Market values have been used to determine the fair value of shortterm deposits, equity investments and the derivative financial instruments.
The Directors have assessed the fair value of the senior loan notes and convertible loan stock based on i the availability of alternative finance for the loan note and ii the risk premium attached to the convertible notes.
It was determined in both cases that the book values fairly represented the actual value to the Company as at 31 December 2002.
Neogenesis is an unlisted company and as such it is difficult to obtain a fair market value.
However, the Directors do not consider that there has been any material change in the value of the Groups investment in this entity.
Preference shares are convertible into Celltech ordinary shares at 3.
The Groups share price as of 31 December of each period has been used to determine the fair value of the preference shares.
Other amounts are determined to be equal to their book values.
vi Gains and losses on hedges No financial instruments were held for the purposes of dealing or other financial instrument trading activities.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
The table below shows the extent to which the Group has unrecognised gains on financial instruments.

The unrecognised gains as at 31 December 2001 included 0.6 million of gains which are expected to be recognised in 2003.
Acquisition of subsidiary undertakings Thiemann On 1 October 2001, the Group acquired effective control of Thiemann SA, the parent company of Celltech Pharma GmbH & Co KG Thiemann in Germany.
The total cost of the acquisition was DM89.8 million 28.8 million and in addition Celltech inherited a loan of DM16.9 million 5.4 million that was immediately repaid on acquisition, and cash of DM9.6 million 3 million.
The total net cash outflow was thus DM97.1 million 31.2 million.
Goodwill of 32.6 million has been capitalised and is being amortised over seven years, which is based on the Directors estimate of useful economic life.
The assets and liabilities of Thiemann acquired were as follows: Total fair value As reported in 2001 m Fixed assets tangible 1.4 Fixed assets intangible Stocks 1.8 Debtors 1.3 Cash 3.0 Creditors 1.8 Provisions for liabilities 3.7 Loans 5.4 Net liabilities acquired 3.4 Total consideration 28.8 Costs of acquisition 0.4 Net liabilities acquired 3.4 Goodwill 32.6 There have been no further fair value adjustments recorded during 2002.
Celltech Annual Report 2002 67 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 23.
Businesses held for resale During the first quarter of 2001 the Group completed the process of disposing of the businesses it had identified for resale upon the acquisition of Medeva.
The total receipts in 2001 from these disposals primarily Armstrong were 15.3 million.
European asset sales During 2001 the Group disposed of its Belgian fine chemical business and French over the counter products for net proceeds of 3.0 million.

During the period 560,041 ordinary shares were issued fully paid upon the exercise of share options.
The cash consideration received amounted to 2.0 million and resulted in an increase in the share premium account of 1.7 million.
Share options outstanding to employees of the Group as at 31 December 2002 are as follows: i Celltech Executive Share Option Schemes 1,969 employees hold options including unapproved options to subscribe for up to 10,153,665 shares at prices ranging between 205p and 1295p per share exercisable between 2003 and 2012.
This includes both Chiroscience and Medeva originating Executive options.

Celltech has potential minimum take or pay obligations under this agreement of approximately 38 million.
iii Leasing Operating and finance lease commitments are disclosed in note 19.
Pension arrangements The Group operates a number of pension schemes, the majority being defined benefit arrangements.
Details of the Groups schemes are as follows: i Pension schemes under SSAP 24 31 Dec 2002 31 Dec 2001 The charge for the year comprises: m m Celltech Pension and Life Assurance Scheme and Medeva Plans MUKPP & MSEPP 2.2 2.2 US qualified scheme 1.1 1.0 US nonqualified scheme 0.2 0.5 Thiemann plan 0.5 0.1 Defined contribution schemes US and UK 1.6 1.8 5.6 5.6 The defined contribution schemes relate primarily to the Celltech Group Personal Pension Plan CGPPP and US 401K plans.
The CGPPP was introduced as of 1 January 2000 for all new UK employees of the Group.
The Celltech Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, the Medeva UK Pension Plan and the Medeva Senior Executive Pension Plan are all closed to new members.
These schemes were merged on 18 September 2002 see below.
Under the CGPPP the Group contributes 8% of salary to individual plans for employees.
The contributions outstanding at the end of the financial year in respect of the Groups UK pension schemes were 0.2 million.
These were paid in accordance with trust rules during January 2003.
Details of the Groups defined benefit schemes are set out below: UK Schemes During the year the Group operated three UK defined benefit schemes, the Celltech Pension and Life Assurance Scheme CP&LAS, the Medeva UK Pension Plan MUKPP and the Medeva Senior Executive Pension Plan MSEPP.
On 18 September 2002 the MUKPP and the MSEPP plans were merged into the CP&LAS.
A full actuarial valuation was then undertaken as at 30 September 2002.
The main financial assumptions for the 30 September 2002 valuation were as follows: Rate of return 6.7% Rate of increase in salaries 3.8% Rate of increase of pension in payment excess over GMP 2.3% Post88 GMP 1.8% Asset valuation method Market value Liability valuation Attained age 70 Celltech Annual Report 2002 27.
Pension arrangements continued The assets and liabilities of the schemes were as follows: 30 Sep 2002 m Assets 33.3 Liabilities 38.9 Deficit in CP&LAS 5.6 The CP&LAS is thus funded at 86% of the liabilities.
The attained age methodology is used to obtain the actuarial valuation for liabilities.
The attained age methodology is the most appropriate in the circumstances of this scheme, which has been closed to new members.
The CP&LAS has been funded in accordance with actuarial advice in all periods and consequently there is no material asset or liability arising from the pension cost and the amounts actually paid into the scheme.
On the basis of the actuarial reviews the current contribution rate paid by the Group is 14.7% for the scheme.
This contribution rate includes 3.3% to refinance the deficit in the scheme over the average future service lifetime of the active membership.
Pension costs are not expected to increase significantly as a result of the revised funding requirements.
US Qualified Scheme The most recent valuation of the plan under US accounting standards was carried out on 31 December 2002.
At the valuation date the market value of the assets of the plan was 7.6 million and the liabilities were 10.7 million.
Thus the assets of the plan represented 71% of the value of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
On the basis of the above valuation and the December 2001 valuation, contribution rates have been agreed with the schemes actuary and are funded at the maximum levels permissible whilst still retaining tax allowable status.
The funding for the US plan in respect of the year that has just ended is typically not paid to the trust until several months after the year end, which is in accordance with US regulations on this matter.
The anticipated funding for 2002 is 1.0 million 2001: 1.2 million which would reduce the underfunding reported above.
The projected unit method was used to derive the valuation above and the key actuarial assumptions are identical to those set out in ii below.
The US Qualified Scheme was frozen as at 31 December 2002 and as such no further benefits accrue to the members.
US Unqualified Scheme The most recent valuation of the scheme under US accounting standards was carried out on 31 December 2002.
The liabilities of this unfunded scheme at this date were valued at 2.6 million.
However, the Group is carrying a liability in creditors of 2.9 million against this obligation, and also holds a RABBI trust account of 2.1 million for this liability see page 72.
The US Unqualified Scheme was frozen as at 31 December 2002 and as such no further benefits accrue to the members.
Thiemann Plan The most recent valuation of the plan was carried out as at 31 December 2002 under IAS 19.
At the valuation date the market value of the assets of the plan was 5.5 million and the liabilities were 11.0 million.
Thus the assets of the plan represented 50% of the value of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
However, the Company also holds separate insurance assets of 5.6 million outside of the scheme to cover the deficit.
Thus in total there are assets of 11.1 million available to cover the liability of 11.0 million as set out in the FRS 17 disclosures.
Celltech Annual Report 2002 71 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 27.
Pension arrangements continued The key actuarial assumptions that were used are as set out in ii below.
ii FRS 17 disclosures The Group has adopted FRS 17 Retirement Benefits to the extent of the mandated disclosure requirements for the year ended 31 December 2002.
FRS 17 is more prescriptive than SSAP 24 in the assumptions and methodology that must be used in order to assess actuarial liabilities.
In particular FRS 17 prescribes the use of the projected unit method of valuation and a discount rate obtained from corporate bonds rather than equities.
Because of the low average age of the members of the CP&LAS the Group considers the SSAP 24 valuation to be more relevant.
The results of the FRS 17 review are presented below.
Qualified independent actuaries updated the actuarial valuations of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group to 31 December 2002.
The main financial assumptions used in this update were as follows: 2002 2001 UK US Germany UK US Germany Assumptions %%% %%% Inflation assumptions 2.3 3.0 2.0 2.6 3.0 2.0 Rate of increase in salaries 3.8 4.1-4.6 3.0 4.1 5.0 3.0 Rate of increase in pension payment 1.9-2.3 2.0 2.0-2.6 2.0 Discount rate 5.5 6.7 6.0 5.9 7.0 6.0 Long term rate of return expected at 31 December Equities 7.5 9.0 n a 7.2 10.0 n a Bonds 4.5 6.7 n a 5.0 7.0 n a Insurance 4.5 n a 3.5 n a n a 3.5 Pension fund deficit The pension fund deficit set out below under FRS 17 is as if this standard were fully applied.
However, under the current accounting methodology SSAP 24 there are assets and provisions within the balance sheet at 31 December 2002 that would offset the effect on net assets see below of this deficit in the event of a restatement under FRS 17.
If FRS 17 had been adopted for the year ended 31 December 2002 the Groups net assets per the balance sheet would be reduced by 18.4 million.
Further explanation of this adjustment is included below.
The assets and liabilities of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group at 31 December 2002 as calculated in accordance with FRS 17 are shown below.
In addition, the effect a restatement would have, if FRS 17 were fully adopted, on the Groups net assets as currently stated under SSAP 24 is set out below.

This account can only be used by the Group to pay the pension liabilities of the US Unqualified Scheme, except in the case of bankruptcy when it would become part of the general pool of assets and pensioners would rank as ordinary creditors.
Pension arrangements continued Included within the insurance assets held in Germany are 5.6 million of insurance arrangements in the Companys own name which were written in order to cover the pension deficits that would otherwise exist in the pension scheme.
There is no intention to use these assets for any purpose other than to cover the deficit and accordingly they have been shown as part of the available assets.
An adjustment of 0.5 million is required in the German scheme to arrive at the net FRS 17 position.
This is in order to remove the insurance asset held in the Companys own name and to remove an estimate of the pension deficit under current GAAP.

Contingent liabilities a The Group has unsecured and undrawn overdraft facilities of 11 million net see note 21.
The Company has provided guarantees to finance companies in respect of finance leases to Celltech R&D Limited not exceeding 2,534,623 2001: 2,782,062 of which 1,406,943 2001: 1,781,411 has been utilised.
The Company has also provided guarantees to Zurich of 15 million in respect of reinsurance and 8 million to Biochemie in respect of manufacturing capacity arrangements.
b The principal litigation in which the Group has been involved in 2002 is discussed below.
In common with most trading companies, Celltech and various of its subsidiary undertakings are the subject of a number of legal claims or potential claims against the Group, the outcome of which cannot at present be determined.
Provision has been made in these accounts for all liabilities, which might be reasonably expected to materialise from these claims.
i Ionamin In July 1997 significant health concerns were raised over the use of the socalled fenphen diet coprescription of fenfluramine and phentermine.
These concerns resulted in the voluntary withdrawal from the market of fenfluramine and a related drug dexfenfluramine in September 1997.
These withdrawals were followed by the commencement of a significant number of lawsuits in the US against manufacturers and prescribers of fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine and phentermine.
The most common allegation is that the fenphen diet caused heart valve problems, neurological dysfunction and, much less frequently, primary pulmonary hypertension, a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs.
Celltech has been named in approximately 6000 of these cases, approximately 900 of which were pending as at 31 December 2002.
The Groups involvement derives from the sale by a Celltech subsidiary, since 2 July 1996, of lonamin, the phentermine prescription pharmaceutical acquired from Fisons Corporation Fisons on that date.
At 12 March 2003 the Group had been formally dismissed from approximately 5,100 of these cases without payment of any sums by way of damages or costs to third parties, and dismissals of more than 700 additional cases, also without payment, were filed but were not yet effective.
Celltech denies liability on a number of grounds, including fundamentally that Ionamin does not cause the health conditions complained of.
Ionamin has been marketed since 1959 and the FDA did not request that Ionamin or any other phentermine be withdrawn from the market.
Moreover, Celltech believes it will be indemnified for any unanticipated liability by Fisons for Ionamin sold prior to 2 July 1996 and by Celltechs product liability insurance carriers for Ionamin sold after 2 July 1996.
Celltechs defence costs are being paid by Fisons and its insurance carriers as required by their contractual indemnities.
Fisons indemnity obligations are guaranteed by Rhone Poulenc Rorer Inc, now part of Aventis Pharmaceuticals.
Based on the merits of its defences and based on the third party insurance coverage benefiting Celltech discussed above, Celltech believes that the ultimate outcome of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position and results of the operations.
However, if the Company were ultimately held liable in these lawsuits and the indemnities and insurance discussed above were not available or were inadequate, the ultimate liability could have a material adverse effect a reasonable estimate of which cannot be made at this time on the financial position and results of operations of the Company.
74 Celltech Annual Report 2002 ii Medlmmune In 1998 Celltech granted to Medlmmune Inc a worldwide non-exclusive licence to use the patents in relation to its humanized antibody preparation, pallvizumab sold by Medlmmune under the trade name Synagis.
Celltech believes that Medlmmunes Synagis product comes within the scope of its patent and that accordingly Medlmmune owes significant royalties to Celltech.
Medlmmune dispute this and have refused to pay any royalties.
Accordingly Celltech have commenced two legal actions against Medlmmune one in the US the major market for Synagis and the other in Germany where Synagis is manufactured.
Both actions are being heard in the UK Courts.
The status of the two claims is as follows: The US claim In October 2002, an application was made by Medlmmune to have the action dismissed on a preliminary point of law.
The application of US law in this case depended on two issues.
Although the Court found in favour of Celltech on the major issue, it found in Medlmmunes favour on the subsidiary issue and consequently an Order was made in November 2002 dismissing this action.
Celltech have lodged an appeal against the judgement of the Court, which is due to be heard in early June 2003.
If the appeal is successful, Celltechs claim against Medlmmune will be reinstated and the litigation continues to trial.
The German claim This litigation was commenced in September 2002 and is still at the early stages.
Statements of case have been exchanged and the parties are currently discussing the timetable for the rest of the proceedings.
Since Celltech is the claimant in both these actions, the only potential liability Celltech has under this litigation is in respect of Medlmmunes legal costs should the claims fail.
In dismissing the US action, the Court ordered that Celltech pay Medlmmunes legal costs of the action so far, and full provision for these has been made in the financial year to 31 December 2002. iii 69kD Celltech is the owner of patents for 69kD, the Bordetella pertussis protein known as Pertactin.
Celltech has granted GlaxoSmithKline an exclusive worldwide licence to use the patents.
Under the terms of the licence, Celltech has the first option to take proceedings to enforce the patents.
Litigation has arisen in Europe involving Celltechs patents and acellular pertussis vaccines owned by Chiron and its subsidiaries.
On 23 July, 1998, Celltech issued infringement proceedings against Chiron SpA and a local chemist shop in Milan, Italy for infringement of one of Celltechs patents relating to the 69kD antigen and seeking an injunction to prevent Chiron from marketing its product.
Chiron is defending that action, and has counterclaimed for a declaration of invalidity of the patent.
Court experts have been appointed, but the date when their report will be provided is not known.
This patent is also subject to opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office brought by Chiron on 22 January, 1997.
The European Patent office has determined in a decision issued in November 2000 that the patent should be revoked.
This decision of the EPO is the subject of an appeal by Celltech.
iv Lonza On 7 March 2003 Celltech gave notice terminating its commercial supply agreement with Lonza Biologics Plc Lonza for CDP 571 under terms which provide that no termination fees shall be payable.
Lonza is disputing Celltechs basis for termination and the parties are in discussion with a view to resolving the matter.
Celltech has provided within creditors for managements best estimate of the amounts expected to materialise from the dispute.
c Self insurance Since 20 September 2001, the Group has been required to increase its levels of self insurance in respect of methylphenidate.
Accordingly, the Groups external insurance cover is limited to losses in excess of 50 million not exceeding 150 million.
Losses under 50 million and over 150 million effectively have to be self insured by the Group.
While no methylphenidate claims have been received since 20 September 2001, the Group has provided for 2.5 million through its captive insurance company in respect of estimated costs of defending expected claims see note 20.
