Capital allowances are claimed on eligible investment assets and calculated on the reducing balance.
The availability of further capital allowances will depend, inter alia, on the timing of the Groups development programme.
In addition where assets are sold out of the British Land Group the gain arising will initially be set off against capital losses and so such sales may reduce the tax rate.
Contingent tax Unprovided further taxation which might become payable if the Groups investments and properties were sold at open market value is estimated at 510 million 2001: 550 million.
Tax losses, which have not been recognised in the Balance Sheet, have reduced the contingent tax by approximately 100 million.
This unprovided taxation is stated after taking account of the FRS 19 capital allowance deferred tax provision of 83 million 2001: 77 million recorded in the Balance Sheet.
