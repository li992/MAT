c Pension costs The principal pension arrangement operated by the Group is a funded scheme providing benefits on both a defined benefit basis and a defined contribution basis.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
A valuation of the scheme is undertaken by an independent qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions to the scheme are paid in accordance with his recommendations.
The last formal valuation of the defined benefit arrangement for funding purposes was undertaken as at 1 August 1999 and used the attained age method.
A further assessment was carried out as at 1 August 2001 for accounting purposes.
In both the valuation and the assessment referred to above, the assumption which has the most significant effect is the difference of 2.0% per annum between the yield on the fund's assets over the rate of salary increases.
The assets of the defined benefit arrangement had a market value at 1 August 2001 of 24,219,000.
The value of the assets was sufficient to cover 94% of the value of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The shortfall is being debited to the profit and loss account over the expected remaining working lives of current employees.

At 31 July 2002 pre-paid contributions to the funds totalled 164,000 2001 - 65,000.
The formal valuation at 1 August 1999 has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 July 2002.
The transitional arrangements of the accounting standard FRS17 require disclosure of assets and liabilities as at 31 July 2002 calculated in accordance with the requirements of FRS17.
They also require disclosure of the items which would appear in the profit and loss account and in the statement of total recognised gains and losses were the full requirements of FRS17 in place.

Deferred tax is the tax attributable to timing differences arising from the inclusion of gains and losses in one period for tax purposes and another for financial accounting.
In previous years provision for deferred tax was only made to the extent that these timing differences were likely to reverse.
As required by FRS 19, full provision is now made.
Had deferred tax been fully provided in the previous year, there would have been a further credit to the profit and loss account for that year of 221,000.
The directors considered that this figure was not material in relation to the profit and loss account for that year and so no prior period adjustment has been made.
This amount has been shown, in Note 4, as part of the tax charge for the current year, seperately disclosed as amounts relating to the previous year.
