66 Notes to the accounts continued 27 Acquisitions and disposals a During 2002 the Group purchased the minority holding c. 36.7% in its quoted Singaporean subsidiary, Inchcape Motors Limited.
The minority interest share of profit before tax from the end of the preceding financial year to date of acquisition, before exceptional items, amounted to 1.5m.
The minority share of net assets at the date of acquisition totalled 46.3m, which included cash and cash equivalents of 32.5m.
The purchase price was 63.1m including costs of 1.1m and goodwill arising on the acquisition of the minority interest amounted to 16.8m.
This goodwill is being amortised evenly over twenty years, the period over which the Directors estimate that the values of the underlying businesses acquired are expected to exceed the value of the underlying assets.
There was no difference between the provisional fair value and net book value of the assets acquired and therefore no fair value adjustments were made.
If necessary, the fair value of assets and goodwill will be adjusted during 2003.
The Group acquired a number of other businesses during the year.
