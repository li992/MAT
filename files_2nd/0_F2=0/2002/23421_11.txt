Accounts Report of the Directors Ten Year Record of Earnings and Dividends Going Concern The Directors believe that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Accounts as the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Annual General Meeting The Annual General Meeting will be held on Thursday 13 March 2003.
In addition to the ordinary business the following special business will be considered: Authority to Purchase Own Shares A special resolution will be proposed to renew, for one year, the Boards authority to buy up to 9,778,207 of the Companys own shares being 14.99% of the total number of ordinary shares in issue subject to the constraints set out in the special resolution.
The Directors do not intend to use this authority to purchase shares unless this would result in an increase in net asset value per share and would be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
