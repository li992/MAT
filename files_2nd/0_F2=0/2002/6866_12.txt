Defined benefit scheme The Company operates a defined benefit pension scheme, the Greggs plc 1978 Retirement and Death Benefit Scheme.
The scheme funds are administered by trustees and are independent of the Companys finances.
Contributions are paid to the scheme in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuarial adviser.
The pension cost relating to the scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the attained age method.
Actuarial valuations are carried out triennially and the latest actuarial assessment of this scheme was at 6 April 2002.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rate of increase in salaries.
It was assumed that the investment return would exceed salary increases by 2.0% per annum.
At the date of the latest actuarial valuation, the market value of the schemes assets was 33,334,400.
The actuarial value of the schemes assets represented 87% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
In view of this situation the Company has already made a one off contribution to the scheme and has agreed to increase the funding rate, including employees contribution, to a total of 16.5% previously 13.3% of annual pensionable salary.
In addition the Company has undertaken regularly to review the funding position and intends to ensure that the scheme is adequately funded to meet its liabilities.
The total pension cost to the Group of this scheme, including the group life premium, was 2,400,000 for the year 2001: 1,798,000.
Whilst the Group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension Costs under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits the following transitional disclosures are required: The actuarial valuation was updated to 28 December 2002, by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with the transitional arrangements of FRS 17.
As required by FRS 17, the defined benefit liabilities have been measured using the projected unit method and both the assets and liabilities include the value of those pensions in payment which are secured with insured annuities.
The major assumptions used in this valuation were: 28 December 29 December 2002 2001 Inflation 2.4% pa 2.5% pa Pension increases LPI 2.4% pa 2.5% pa Salary growth 3.9% pa 4.0% pa Discount rate 5.6% pa 5.8% pa The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

Pensions continued Scheme assets The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, were: 28 December 29 December 2002 2001 restated Expected return 000 000 Expected return 000 000 Fair value of assets Composed of : Equities 7.4% pa 18,188 8.0% pa 20,908 Bonds 4.5% pa 6,229 4.8% pa 7,125 Other 4.5% pa 7,952 5.3% pa 6,034 Total fair value of assets 32,369 34,067 Present value of liabilities 41,699 34,373 Gross pension liability 9,330 306 Related deferred tax asset 2,799 92 Net pension liability 6,531 214 The present value of liabilities at 29 December 2001 has been restated from the value presented in the 2001 annual report following clarification of the treatment of benefits accrued before 6 April 1997.
An allowance has been made for the pensions payable for pre-April 1997 service to increase overall at rates lower than 3% pa.
This has resulted in a reduction of 1,219,000 in the net pension liability at 29 December 2001.
Over the year to 28 December 2002, contributions by the Company of 2,171,000 2001: 1,852,000 were made to the scheme.
It has been agreed with the trustees that employers contributions from 6 April 2003 will be at the level of 9.9% of annual pensionable salary plus the cost of insuring death in service benefits and the cost of administration expenses.
The post retirement deficit under FRS 17 would have moved as follows during the year to 28 December 2002: Year ended 28 December 2002 000 Post retirement deficit at 29 December 2001 306 Current service cost employee and employer 2,513 Contributions employee and employer 3,011 Other net finance income 367 Actuarial loss 9,889 Post retirement deficit at 28 December 2002 9,330 25 GREGGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 7.

The scheme is now closed to new entrants and, under the method used to calculate pension costs in accordance with FRS 17, the cost as a percentage of covered pensionable payroll will tend to increase as the average age of the membership increases.
The Groups net assets, including the disclosed FRS 17 balance sheet item above, would be 113,434,000 at 28 December 2002. b.
Defined contribution schemes The Company also operates defined contribution schemes for other eligible employees.
