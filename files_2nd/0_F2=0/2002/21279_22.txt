Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The accounts have been prepared on the historical cost basis of accounting, modified to include the revaluation of fixed asset investments.
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies SORP.
All of the Groups operations are of a continuing nature.
b Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary undertaking, The Army and Navy Investment Company Limited.
c Valuation of fixed asset investments UK listed investments are valued according to the prices issued by the London Stock Exchange being the closing midmarket prices for all investments other than FTSE 100 constituents and FTSE 100 reserve list constituents for which the last trade prices are used.
Overseas listed investments are valued at their closing mid-market prices or last trade prices if appropriate.
Unquoted investments are valued by the directors at cost unless circumstances indicate different valuations are warranted.
d Valuation of current asset investments Current asset investments held by the Companys subsidiary undertaking are stated at the lower of cost and market value.
e Capital gains and losses Realised and unrealised capital gains and losses, together with exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in other reserves.
f Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are taken to the revenue account on an ex-dividend basis.
Income from fixed interest debt securities is recognised on a time apportionment basis and, if material, so as to reflect the effective yield on each such security.
The dealing profits of the subsidiary undertaking, which represent realised gains on the sale of current asset investments, are dealt with in the Group Statement of Total Return as a revenue item.
Bank deposit interest is accounted for on an accruals basis.
g Expenses and interest payable On the basis of the Boards expected long term split of returns in the form of capital gains and income of 70% and 30% respectively, the Company charges 70% of its interest payable and investment management fee to other reserves.
All other expenses are charged to revenue.
h Foreign currency Transactions denominated in overseas currencies during the year are translated into sterling at the appropriate daily exchange rate.
Assets and liabilities denominated in overseas currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at that date.
i Taxation The tax effect of different items of expenditure is allocated between capital and revenue using the Companys effective rate of tax for the year.
Financial Reporting Standard 19 has been adopted for the period ended 31 October 2002.
No restatement of prior period comparatives is required.
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date other than those differences regarded as permanent.
Any liability to deferred tax is provided at the average rate of tax expected to apply.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted to reflect the time value of money.
j Financial instruments Derivative instruments utilised by the Group include futures and traded options.
A derivative instrument is considered to be used for hedging purposes when it alters the market risk profile of an existing underlying exposure of the Group.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under FRS 13 and excluded short term debtors and creditors from disclosures under financial instruments where allowed.

17 Financial instruments i Management of risk The Groups financial instruments comprise: Equity and non-equity shares and fixed interest securities that are held in accordance with the Groups investment objectives as set out on page 1 of the report and accounts: Debenture stock, term loans and bank overdrafts, the main purpose of which is to raise finance for the Groups operations: Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the Groups operations: and Derivative transactions which the Group enters into comprising futures and traded options, the purpose of which is to manage market price risks arising from the Groups investment activities.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market price risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
As last year, these policies have remained constant throughout the year under review.
30 Notes to the Accounts continued 17 Financial instruments continued Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about the future prices of financial instruments used in the Groups operations.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and movements in exchange rates.
It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular country or sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets and stock selection are other factors which act to reduce market risk.
The investment manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly to consider investment strategy.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through its debenture stocks and term loans as well as bank overdrafts and any retained revenues arising from operations.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest and the Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
Liquidity risk The Groups assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
The maturity of the Groups existing borrowings are set out below.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of short term borrowing and overdraft facilities.
Foreign currency risk The Groups total return and net assets can be significantly affected by currency translation movements as some of the Groups assets and revenue are denominated in currencies other than sterling.
The fund manager mitigates the individual currency risks through the international spread of investments.
Borrowings in foreign currencies will be limited to levels appropriate to the asset exposure to these currencies.
ii Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets The majority of the Groups financial assets are equity shares and other investments which neither pay interest nor have a stated maturity date.
