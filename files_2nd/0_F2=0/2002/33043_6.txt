Financial Statements Statement of Directors responsibilities in relation to the Financial Statements 68 Auditors Report 68 Group Profit and Loss Account 70 Recognised Gains and Losses 71 Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds 71 Balance Sheets 72 Group Cash Flow Statement 73 Geographical Analysis 74 Notes to the Financial Statements 76 Contents Inside Front Cover Glossary 143 Cross reference to Form 20-F 144 Index 146 Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Cadbury Schweppes 67 Financial Statements Statement of Directors responsibilities in relation to the Financial Statements The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the auditors statement of auditors responsibilities set out in their report, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the Directors and of the auditors in relation to the financial statements.
The Directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the Groups profit or loss and cash flows for the financial year.
The Directors consider that in preparing the financial statements the Company and the Group have used appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, and that all accounting standards which they consider to be applicable have been followed.
The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Company keeps accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position of the Company and the Group and which enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors have general responsibilities for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Auditors Report Independent Auditors Report to the Members of Cadbury Schweppes plc We have audited the financial statements of Cadbury Schweppes plc for the year ended 29 December 2002, which comprise the Group and Company Balance Sheets at 29 December 2002 and 30 December 2001, the Group Profit and Loss Accounts, the Group Cash Flow Statements, the Statements of Total Recognised Gains and Losses and the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds for the years ended 29 December 2002, 30 December 2001, and 31 December 2000, and the related notes 1 to 32.
These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have also audited the information in the part of the Report on Directors Remuneration that is described as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors As described in the Statement of Directors responsibilities, the Companys Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards.
They are also responsible for the preparation of the other information contained in the Report & Accounts and Form 20-F including the Report on Directors Remuneration.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Report on Directors Remuneration described as having been audited in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part of the Report on Directors Remuneration described as having been audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Report of the Directors is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors remuneration and transactions with the Company and other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Companys compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to 68 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 consider whether the Board's statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the Report of the Directors and the other information contained in the Report & Accounts and Form 20-F for the year ended 29 December 2002 as described in the contents section including the unaudited part of the Report on Directors Remuneration, and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board and with generally accepted auditing standards in the United States of America.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Report on Directors Remuneration described as having been audited.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the circumstances of the Company and the Group, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Report on Directors Remuneration described as having been audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the Report on Directors Remuneration described as having been audited.
UK Opinion In our opinion: the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 29 December 2002 and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended: and the financial statements and the part of the Report on Directors Remuneration described as having been audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
US Opinion In our opinion the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group at 29 December 2002 and 30 December 2001 and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the years ended 29 December 2002, 30 December 2001 and 31 December 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom.
As explained in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Group has given retroactive effect to the classification of certain sales incentives and marketing promotion programmes as areductiontoturnover, .
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom vary in significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The application of the latter would have affected the determination of net income for the years ended 29 December 2002, 30 December 2001 and 31 December 2000 and the determination of shareholders equity at 29 December 2002 and 30 December 2001, to the extent summarised in Note 31 to the financial statements.

The Group is focused on the beverages and confectionery businesses, two closely related consumer markets, and manages an extensive portfolio of brands.
Significant measures used by management in assessing geographical performance include sales, operating profit before major restructuring costs and goodwill amortisation and operating margins before major restructuring costs and goodwill amortisation.
The basis of accounting for these measures is UK generally accepted accounting principles.
Transactions between reportable segments are not material.
In 2002, the Group operated in six business regions which were managed separately due to their geographical locations and their product portfolio.
b Accounting convention The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention modified for the revaluation of certain land and buildings.
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards all of which have been applied consistently throughout the three years ended 29 December 2002, other than as stated below: In 2002 the Group made the following change to Accounting Policies: In 2002 the Group adopted, for UK and US reporting purposes, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Emerging Issues Task Force the EITF Issue No.
0025, Vendor Income Statement Characterisation of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendors Products, and Issue No.
0014, Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives, which were codified along with other similar issues, into Issue 0109, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendors Products in April 2001.
This resulted in a restatement of Group turnover for 2001 and 2000 to reflect these new accounting provisions.
EITF Issue 0109 clarifies the Profit and Loss Account classification of costs incurred by a vendor in connection with the resellers purchase or promotion of the vendors products, resulting in certain cooperative advertising and product placement costs previously classified as trading expenses to be reflected as a reduction of turnover.
As a result of applying the provisions of EITF 0109, the Group turnover and trading expenses have been restated by 457 million for 2000 and 559 million in 2001.
This had no effect on Group operating profit or net earnings.
c Financial year The financial statements are made up to the Sunday nearest to 31 December.
Periodically this results in a financial year of 53 weeks.
The profit and loss accounts cover the 52 weeks from 31 December 2001 to 29 December 2002, the 52 weeks from 1 January 2001 to 30 December 2001, and the 52 weeks from 3 January 2000 to 31 December 2000.
The balance sheets for 2002 and 2001 have been drawn up as at 29 December 2002 and 30 December 2001 respectively.
d Basis of consolidation The financial statements are presented in the form of Group financial statements and no profit and loss account is presented for Cadbury Schweppes plc itself as the exemption in Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 applies.
The Group financial statements consolidate the accounts of the parent company and its subsidiary undertakings after eliminating internal transactions and recognising the minority interests in those subsidiary undertakings.
76 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 e Acquisition or disposal of subsidiary undertakings Results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the financial year are included in Group profit from the effective date of control and those of undertakings disposed of up to the effective date of disposal.
For this purpose the separable net assets, both tangible and intangible, of newly acquired subsidiary undertakings are incorporated into the financial statements on the basis of the fair value to the Group as at the effective date of control.
f Foreign currencies The consolidated financial statements are prepared in pounds sterling.
The functional currency of each of the companys subsidiaries is the local currency in which each subsidiary is located.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the end of the financial year except when covered by an open foreign exchange contract in which case the rate of exchange specified in the contract is used.
Differences on exchange arising from the translation of both the opening balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings date of control in case of acquisition during the year and foreign currency borrowings used to finance or hedge long-term foreign investments are taken directly to reserves.
All other profits and losses on exchange are credited or charged to the profit and loss account.
The results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at monthly average rates.
The exchange differences arising as a result of restating net assets to closing rates are dealt with as movements on reserves.
g Turnover This represents the invoiced value of sales net of trade discounts, sales incentives, upfront payment, slotting fees and other non-discretionary payments and royalties excluding inter-company sales, value added tax and sales taxes.
Revenue is recognised when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the amount due is reasonably assured.
h Research and development expenditure Expenditure is written off in the financial year in which it is incurred.
i Major Restructuring Costs The Group classifies major restructuring costs separately within operating costs.
Major restructuringcosts are non-recurring expenditure arising on the acquisition ofbusinesses, or from significant reorganisation within one of our existing businesses.
j Earnings per Ordinary Share Basic Earnings per Ordinary Share EPS is calculated by dividing the profit on ordinary activities after taxation, minority interests and preference dividends by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing profit on ordinary activities after taxation, minority interests and preference dividends by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year increased by the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares primarily share options.
Underlying EPS represents Basic EPS, adjusted in order to exclude goodwill amortisation, major restructuring costs net of tax and profits and losses on disposal of fixed assets, subsidiaries and investments.

Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Cadbury Schweppes 77 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Nature of Operations and Accounting Policies continued k Taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future has been entered into by the subsidiary or associate.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
l Stocks Stocks are valued at the lower of average cost and estimated net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct material and labour costs together with the relevant factory overheads including depreciation on the basis of normal activity levels.
m Tangible fixed assets Depreciation is charged on the original cost or subsequent valuation of assets excluding freehold land and assets in course of construction.
The principal rates, using the straight line method, are as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold properties 2.5% Plant and machinery 10% Vehicles 12.5% - 20% Office equipment 20% Computer software 12.5% - 33% Short leasehold properties are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset and the life of the lease.
In specific cases higher depreciation rates are used e. g. high speed machinery, machinery subject to technological changes or any machinery with a high obsolescence factor.
The rates used overseas are not materially different from the rates used above, but they vary according to local conditions and requirements.
The Company capitalises costs associated with software that is ready for service and software developed or obtained for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and the Companys management has authorised further funding for the project which it deems probable of completion and use for the function intended.
Capitalised internal-use software costs include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software, and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the project.
Capitalisation of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose.
Impairment reviews of tangible fixed assets are carried out when the Directors believe there is animpairmentrisk, .
78 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 n Fixed assets held under leases Where assets are financed by leasing agreements that give rights approximating to ownership finance leases the assets are treated as if they had been purchased outright and the corresponding liability to the leasing company is included as an obligation under finance leases.
Depreciation on leased assets is charged to the profit and loss account on the same basis as shown above.
Leasing payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements and the interest is charged to the profit and loss account.
All other leases are operating leases and the relevant annual rentals are charged wholly to the profit and loss account.
o Revaluation of properties Prior to 1999, freehold and leasehold properties were revalued every five years.
Any overall surplus over book value was credited to the revaluation reserve and any overall deficit below historical cost was charged to the profit and loss account in the year of revaluation.
On adoption of FRS 15 in 1999 the Group decided that no further revaluations would be undertaken.
Transfers are made to retained profits each year in order to amortise surpluses over the remaining useful lives of the properties.
On disposal the profit or loss is calculated by reference to the net book value and any unamortised revaluation surplus is transferred from revaluation reserves to retained profits.
p Intangibles and goodwill Intangibles represent significant owned brands acquired since 1985 valued at historical cost.
No amortisation is charged as the annual results reflect significant expenditure in support of these brands and the carrying values are reviewed on an annual basis for any impairment in value.
Acquired brand values are calculated based on the Groups valuation methodology, which is based on an internal valuation of discounted cash flows.
Prior to 1998, goodwill, being any excess of the consideration over fair value, was written off against reserves on consolidation.
Upon disposal of a previously acquired business the attributable amount of goodwill previously written off to reserves is included in determining the profit or loss on disposal.
Since 1998, acquired goodwill has been capitalised and its subsequent measurement via annual impairment review or an annual amortisation charge determined based on the individual circumstances of each business acquired.
Goodwill is amortised over 20 years.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1998 has not been recorded on the balance sheet.
The Group has concluded that goodwill arising on its associates, including Dr Pepper Seven Up Bottling Group DPSUBG, should not be amortised as it has an indefinite useful economic life.
These investments are considered to have indefinite durability that can be demonstrated, and the value of the investment can be readily measured.
DPSUBG operates in a longstanding and profitable market sector: the US soft drinks bottling industry has over 100 years of history.
The sector has high market entry barriers due to the nature of licence agreements with soft drink concentrate owners including the Groups subsidiary Dr Pepper Seven Up, Inc. DPSU and the capital required to operate as a bottler and distributor.
As an associate, the company is managed separately from the Group and can be valued on a discounted cash flow basis.
The Group has not amortised this goodwill, a departure from the Companies Act 1985 Paragraph 21 of Schedule 4, for the over-riding purpose of giving a true and fair view of the Groups results, for the reasons outlined above.
If the goodwill arising on DPSUBG had been amortised over a period of 20 years, operating profit would have decreased by 17 million in 2002 19 million in 2001: 2000: 18 million, and the investment in associates would be decreased by 51 million in 2002 and 37 million in 2001.
Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Cadbury Schweppes 79 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Nature of Operations and Accounting Policies continued q Associated undertakings All companies where the Group exercises significant influence, normally by board representation and or ownership of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights on a long-term basis, are treated as associated undertakings.
The value of associated undertakings reflects the Groups share of the net assets of the companies concerned.
The Groups share of the profit before tax of associated undertakings is included in the Group Profit and Loss Account.
All associated undertakings have financial years which are coterminous with the Groups, with the exception of Camelot Group plc Camelot whose financial year ends in March.
The Groups share of the profits of Camelot are based on its most recent, published, unaudited financial statements to 30 September.
r Pensions The costs of providing pensions and other post-retirement benefits are charged to the profit and loss account on a consistent basis over the service lives of employees.
Such costs are calculated by reference to actuarial valuations and variations from such regular costs are spread over the remaining service lives of the current employees.
To the extent to which such costs do not equate with cash contributions a provision or prepayment is recognised in the balance sheet.
 costs, and provides the required transitional disclosures under FRS 17Retirement Benefits.
s Liquid resources Liquid resources are defined as current asset investments which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash without curtailing or disrupting the business, primarily bank deposits, commercial paper and bond investments.
t Financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
To qualify as a hedge, a financial instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities or to a firm commitment or anticipated transaction.
Gains and losses on hedges of existing assets or liabilities are included in the carrying amounts of those assets or liabilities and are ultimately recognised in the profit and loss account as part of those carrying amounts.
Gains and losses on qualifying hedges of firm commitments or anticipated transactions are also deferred and are recognised in the profit and loss account or as adjustments of carrying amounts when the hedged transaction occurs.
Gains and losses on financial instruments that do not qualify as hedges are recognised as other income or expense.
If a financial instrument ceases to be a hedge, for example because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any gains or losses are recognised as other income or expense.
u Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The  finance costin  reduced by payments made in the period.
Convertible debt is reported as a liability unless conversion actually occurs.
No gain or loss is recognised on conversion.
80 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 v Preparation of Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The charge to the profit and loss account for restructuring is explained in Note 3.
The restructuring expenditure in the year includes 27 million in respect of restructuring charges recorded in 2002 and 26 million in respect of restructuring charges recorded in prior years.
Substantially all of the restructuring provision at the end of the year is expected to result in cash expenditure in 2003.
Adjustments have been made to the restructuring provision of 3 million to reflect changes in estimates of liabilities from prior years, including 1 million for employee severances.
The restructuring charge relates mainly to severance costs where factory rationalisation and transfer of production to other Group sites, results in closure of sites and redundancies.
The severance programmes impacted 1,100 employees with 497 being manufacturing related, 370beingsales  related.
Contractual, legal and other provisions relate to the Groups ongoing obligations relating to the disposal of subsidiaries, investments and brands.

The Company has unrecognised deferred tax liabilities on property revaluations of 1 million 2001: 1 million.
To the extent that dividends from overseas undertakings are expected to result in additional taxes, appropriate amounts have been provided.
No taxes have been provided for other unremitted earnings since these amounts are considered permanently reinvested by subsidiary undertakings and in the case of associated undertakings the taxes would not be material.
Distributable earnings retained by overseas subsidiary undertakings and the principal associated undertakings totalled approximately 3,349 million at 29 December 2002.
The remittance of these amounts would incur tax at varying rates depending on available foreign tax credits.
Tax losses carried forward as at 29 December 2002 for offset against future earnings of overseas companies were approximately 73 million 2001: 83 million.
The utilisation of losses is dependent upon the level of future earnings and other limiting factors within the countries concerned.
Tax losses totalling 7 million have expiration periods in 2003 and 2004, tax losses of 48 million expire in 2005 to 2014 and tax losses totalling 18 million have no expiry date.
92 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Other than 4 million in 2002 2001: nil, deferred tax has not been recognised on these tax losses as in the opinion of the Directors it is unlikely that these losses will be recovered in the foreseeable future.

18 Pension Arrangements and other Post-Retirement Benefits The Group has various pension schemes throughout the world and these cover a significant proportion of the current employees.
The principal schemes are of the defined benefit type, with benefits accruing based on final salary and length of service.
The schemes assets are held in external funds administered by trustees and managed professionally.
Regular assessments are carried out by independent actuaries and the long-term contribution rates decided on the basis of their recommendations.
Costs are normally spread as a percentage of payroll.
In the UK, US and South Africa, the Group has certain post-retirement medical benefit schemes whereby the Group contributes towards medical costs for certain retirees.
These contributions are paid only for retirees who were members of such medical schemes before retirement.
a UK GAAP The major scheme is the Cadbury Schweppes Pension Fund in the UK for which the last full valuation was carried out as at 5 April 2002 on the projected unit method when the market value ofthe assets was 1,336million.
The level offunding on the assumptions shown below was 115%.
The principal long term assumptions used for the actuarial valuation were as follows: Rate of return on new investments 6.25% Rateofreturnon existinginvestments 6.25% Earnings increases 4.50% Pensions increases 2.50% Credit for the estimated surplus has been spread over the remaining service lives of the existing employees and the net contribution rate on the accruals basis is 6.1% of pensionable payroll.
The dates of the latest actuarial reviews of the main schemes for the principal overseas subsidiaries were: Ireland: 5 April 2000, USA: 30 September 2002, Australia: 30 June 2000 and Canada: 1 January 2001.
The aggregate market value of these schemes at the relevant review dates was approximately 351 million.
The total pension cost for the year was 39 million 2001: 30 million: 2000: 28 million, of which 13 million 2001: 10 million: 2000: 11 million related to the UK and 21 million 2001: 15 million: 2000: 12 million to the above-mentioned principal overseas funds.

The lowest limit to which it is subject under its borrowing facilities was 4,262 million at 29 December 2002.
The security, for the borrowings shown above as secured, is by way of charges on the properties of the Group companies concerned.
At 29 December 2002, the book value of assets pledged as collateral for secured loans was 30 million 2001: 41 million.
Borrowings include 19 million 2001: 25 million which are secured by means of fixed charges on the property of overseas subsidiaries.
The Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures were convertible into common stock of Triarc Companies Inc. the former owners of Snapple Beverage Group.
The stock required to satisfy the conversion obligations was held in escrow for the benefit of debenture holders.
They were redeemed on 10 February 2003.
Medium Term Notes and Commercial Paper which have been swapped into another currency are presented at the swapped value.
Medium Term Notes mature between 2003 and 2008.
The obligation under the perpetual loan represents the present value of the future interest payments on the principal amount of 244 million formerly FFr1,600 million which terminate in 2005: the interest rate is variable, based on the Euro Inter-Bank Offered Rate formerly Paris Inter-Bank Offered Rate.
A subsidiary of the Group has borrowed 621 million 2001: 684 million which is guaranteed by letters of credit.
These letters of credit are backed by security over certain assets of another subsidiary of the Group.
The lenders sole recourse under this arrangement is to the letters of credit.
The financing has been accounted for as a fully offsetting arrangement in the Group Balance Sheet and the Notes to the Financial Statements and meets the criteria for offset in accordance with FRS 5.
Interest on unsecured bank loans is at rates which vary in accordance with local inter-bank rates.
The weighted average interest rate payable at year end on short-term borrowings excluding overdrafts was 3.0% 2001: 3.5%.

100 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 20 Derivatives and other Financial Instruments a Treasury Risk Management The Group is exposed to market risks arising from its international business.
Derivative financial instruments are utilised by the Group to lower funding costs, to diversify sources of funding, to alter interest rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities or to achieve greater certainty of future costs.
These instruments are entered into in accordance with policies approved by the Board of Directors and are subject to regular review and audit.
Substantially all financial instruments hedge specifically identified actual or anticipated transactions: movements in their fair value are highly negatively correlated with movements in the fair value of the transactions being hedged and the term of such instruments is not greater than the term of such transactions or any anticipated refinancing or extension of them.
Such anticipated transactions are all in the normal course of business and the Group is of the opinion that it is highly probable that they will occur.
Further discussion of the Groups objectives, policies and strategies with regard to derivatives and financial instruments can be found in the Operating and Financial Review on pages 32 to 34.
As permitted by FRS 13, short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from these disclosures other than the currency disclosures.
b Interest rate and currency of borrowings After taking into account the various interest rate and currency swaps entered into by the Group, the effective currency and interest rate profile of the Groups borrowings were as follows: At 29 December 2002: Cash Effect of 2002 Floating rate Fixed rate and liquid currency Total net borrowings borrowings resources swaps borrowings m m m m m Sterling143160 199 360464 Euro 172 94 47 122 341 US Dollar Bloc 107 1,082 103 133 953 Australia New Zealand Dollars 125 52 47 4 126 Others 379 4 76 345 38 926 1,392 472 1,846 At 30 December 2001: Cash Effect of 2001 Floating rate Fixed rate and liquid currency Total net borrowings borrowings resources swaps borrowings m m m m m Sterling123150 254 260279 Euro 167 34 36 149 16 US Dollar Bloc 533 667 85 152 1,267 Australia New Zealand Dollars 84 62 24 122 Others 270 4 58 263 47 1,177 917 457 1,637 Floating rate borrowings bear interest based on short-term inter-bank rates principally LIBOR applicable to periods of three months or less or commercial paper rates.

Foreign currency assets and liabilities do not generate any material gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
This is either because they are denominated in the functional currency of the operating company in which they arise, or have been hedged into that currency, or because they qualify under SSAP 20 a foreign currency borrowing providing a hedge against a foreign equity investment.
The Groups borrowings and net assets by currency at 29 December 2002 were as follows: 2002 2001 Net Net assets by external currency of borrowings Net Net operations a by currency investments investments m m m m Sterling39 464 425 171 Euro 1,143 341 802 745 US Dollar Bloc 2,939 953 1,986 1,867 Australia New Zealand Dollars 265 126 139 125 Others 496 38 534 342 4,882 1,846 3,036 2,908 a Net assets as stated exclude net borrowings and include equity minority interests.
102 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 d Interest Rate Risk Management The Group uses a combination of long-term and short-term cross currency and interest rate swaps to manage the currency and interest rate profile of its borrowings.
The aggregate currency impact of these swaps is shown in Note 20 b above.
Details of the fixed rate element of the swap portfolio are shown in the table below: Analysis of Derivative Instruments Weighted Weighted average average Notional interest remainingFinal principal rate maturity maturity m % Years Year Currency Instrument Sterling: Receive Fixed 168 5.97 3.6 2003-06 Pay Fixed 50 5.94 0.9 2003 Euro: Receive Fixed 75 4.11 2.2 2005 Pay Fixed 277 6.39 2.5 2005 US Dollar: Receive Fixed 188 7.64 2.4 2005-06 Pay Fixed 438 4.75 4.2 2004-08 Forward Start Pay Fixed 2003 500 3.60 4.5 2007-08 Other: Receive Fixed 176 2.16 4.1 2004-08 Pay Fixed 92 5.51 0.8 2003-04 Forward Start Pay Fixed 2003 70 5.74 1.2 2004-05 On swaps where fixed rates of interest are payable, the Group receives interest at floating rates of three month or six month LIBOR rates or local equivalent.
On swaps where fixed rates of interest are received, the Group pays interest at floating rates set at three month or six month LIBOR plus an average margin of 0.57%.
The differential to be paid or received on swap agreements is accrued as interest rates change and is recognised within net interest expense over the lives of the respective agreements.
Any net asset or liability arising on conversion into sterling of the principal amounts of cross currency swaps is included on the Balance Sheet see Note 19.
In addition to the above, the Group also has in place a number of cross-currency swaps which effectively swap floating rate Medium Term Note funding from Hong Kong Dollars and Japanese Yen with a value of 181 million to three month floating rate US Dollar LIBOR plus an average margin of 0.13%.
e Fair values of financial instruments The comparison of book and fair values of all the Groups financial instruments is set out below.
The fair values of liquid resources and debt are based on, where available, market values.
In the absence of market values fair values have been calculated by discounting cash .
Thefair values  are based on the estimated amount the company would receive or pay if the transaction was terminated,  andexchangerates.

f Hedges of future transactions The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to eliminate the currency exposures that arise on sales denominated in foreign currencies.

The Employee Trust is a general discretionary trust whose beneficiaries include employees and former employees of the Company, and their dependants.
The principal purpose of the Employee Trust is to encourage and facilitate the holding of shares in the Company by or for the benefit of employees of the Group.
The Employee Trust may be used in conjunction with any of the Companys employee share plans.
In January 1997, the Company established an additional employee trust, the Cadbury Schweppes plc Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust the QUEST, for the purpose of distributing ordinary shares in the Company on the exercise of options under the UK Savings-Related Share Option Scheme.
The trustee of the QUEST is Cadbury Schweppes Group Trustees Ltd, a subsidiary of the Company.
All employees of Group companies in the UK, including Executive Directors of the Company, are potential beneficiaries under the QUEST.
The options held by each Director holding office at the year end are detailed in the Report on Directors Remuneration on page 56.
There were no options held by them under the Irish Share Plan see below.
118 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 The Cadbury Schweppes Irish Employee Share Scheme the Irish Share Plan In the last three years, 1,686 appropriations under the Irish Share Plan a profit sharing plan totalling 21,918 ordinary shares, have been made to Irish registered employees who worked 25 hours or more per week, with two or more continuous years service.
The prices at which the shares will vest, between 20 December 2004 and 31 May 2005, range from 4.315 to 4.690.
31 Summary of Differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles The financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable in the UK UK GAAP, which differ in certain significant respects from those applicable in the US US GAAP.
These differences relate principally to the following items and the necessary adjustments are shown in the tables set out on pages 126 to 129. a Goodwill and Intangible assets Prior to 1998, under UK GAAP the Group wrote off acquisition goodwill against reserves in the balance sheet in the year of acquisition.
From 1998, under UK GAAP, acquired goodwill is capitalised and its subsequent measurement via annual impairment review or annual amortisation charge is determined based on the individual circumstances of each business acquired.
A portion of the goodwill capitalised from 1998 is not being amortised under UK GAAP see Note 1.
Under UK GAAP, the cost of brands acquired may be capitalised and no amortisation or writedown is required unless there is an impairment in value below cost.
On an annual basis, the Group reviews non-amortised goodwill and brands for possible impairment using an estimate of the related businesses discounted cash flows in measuring whether the asset is recoverable.
Under US GAAP, for periods ending on or before 30 December 2001 goodwill and identifiable intangible assets eg brands were amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful economic life, not to exceed 40 years.
Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets were evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicated that, in managements judgement, the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
Impairments of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets were recognised if expected undiscounted cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset.
If a material impairment was identified, the asset was written down to its estimated fair value.
Fair value was determined based on the present value of expected net cash flows to be generated, discounted using a rate commensurate with the risks involved.
Under US GAAP, effective 31 December 2001, the Group adopted SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
The statement directs that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortised but rather will be tested at least annually for impairment.
Intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortised over their useful lives, but without the constraint of an arbitrary ceiling.
Going forward, the Group will carry out an annual impairment review of goodwill.
In 2002 an impairment of goodwill of 14 million was recorded under US GAAP.
No impairments were recorded in 2001, or 2000. b Interest capitalisation Under UK GAAP, the capitalisation of interest is optional and the Group does not capitalise such interest.
Under US GAAP interest is required to be capitalised on capital construction projects and amortised over the life of the asset.
The amount of interest capitalised for US GAAP purposes was 6 million 2001: 7 million, 2000: 3 million.
Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Cadbury Schweppes 119 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements 31 Summary of Differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles continued c Derivative instruments Under UK GAAP, to qualify as a hedge, a financial instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities or to a firm commitment or anticipated transaction.
Under UK GAAP, gains and losses on financial instruments that do not qualify as hedges are recognised as other income or expense.
Prior to 1 January 2001 under US GAAP, hedging of foreign currency transactions was allowable for transactions which were firm commitments.
Some of the Groups foreign currency contracts which hedge forecast or budgeted transactions did not meet the definition of a firm commitment: gains or losses on these contracts were not deferred and were recognised in net income.
Under US GAAP, SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities has been applied as of 1 January 2001.
This standard establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and used for hedging activities.
All derivatives, whether designated for hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
The Group has not designated its derivative instruments as hedges pursuant to SFAS 133.
All contracts are marked to market at the balance sheet date and gains or losses arising are recognised in net income.
The adoption of SFAS 133 in 2001 resulted in a net cumulative transition adjustment of 41 million net of 18 million tax, of which 15 million has been dealt with as a cumulative adjustment to net income during 2001.
Of the cumulative adjustment to shareholders funds, 1 million 2001: 41 million has been released to the profit and loss account during the current year.
d Deferred taxation Under UK GAAP, deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Under US GAAP, deferred tax liabilities related to temporary differences differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their corresponding tax basis are fully provided and future taxation benefits are recognised as deferred tax assets to the extent that their realisation is more likely than not.
Under UK GAAP, FRS 19 requires deferred tax to be provided in full on all liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will  can be deducted.
In certain circumstances where it is expected to take some time for tax losses to be relieved, it may not be appropriate to recognise the deferred tax assets at all.
FRS 19 does 120 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 not define or provide guidance relating to the phrases some time or more likely than not.
Under US GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying  capital loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50% that the deferred tax assets will not be realised.
There were no such items in any of the periods presented.
Under UK GAAP deferred tax is based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted.
For US GAAP only tax rates and laws that have been enacted are taken into account.
This difference has not resulted in material differences in 2002, 2001 and 2000.
Under UK GAAP, passing certain criteria, the Group may net deferred tax liabilities and assets and present a net balance in the balance sheet, within Provisions for liabilities and charges.
Additionally, under UK GAAP the tax rate reconciliation is performed to the current tax charge for the year.
Under US GAAP deferred taxes are classified between current and non-current portion, , , bytax jurisdiction.
Additionally, under US GAAP the tax rate reconciliation is performed to the total tax charge for the year.
e Revaluation of properties Under UK GAAP, properties were, up to 1999, restated on the basis of appraised values in financial statements prepared in all other respects in accordance with the historical cost convention.
Depreciation is provided on the restated values.
Such restatements are not permitted under US GAAP.
f Ordinary dividends Under UK GAAP, final ordinary dividends are provided in the financial statements on the basis of the recommendation by the Directors which requires subsequent approval by the shareholders to become a legal obligation of the Company.
Under US GAAP, dividends are only provided when the legal obligation to pay arises.
g Pension costs Under UK GAAP, the costs of providing pension benefits may be calculated by the use of any recognised actuarial method which is appropriate and whose assumptions reflect the longterm nature of the assets and liabilities involved.
Under US GAAP, the costs of providing these benefits are calculated using the projected unit credit method and a discount rate being the rate of interest at which pension liabilities could be effectively settled which reflects current market rates.
See note 18 for disclosures presented in accordance with SFAS 132. h SAYE discounts Under UK GAAP, there is no charge related to the discount offered on SAYE shares.
Under US GAAP, the discount on each scheme has to be amortised over the life of the scheme.
i LTIP Under UK GAAP, the costs of LTIP schemes are amortised based on the cost of shares acquired by the ESOP trust to fulfil the scheme.
Under US GAAP, these plans are accounted for as variable plans and the cost is calculated based on the market price of shares at the date of award.
For those schemes where the measurement period has not yet been completed so no award has been made, the year end accrual is based on the year end share price.
Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Cadbury Schweppes 121 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements 31 Summary of Differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles continued j Cash Flows Under UK GAAP the Group complies with FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements the objective and principles of which are similar to those set out in SFAS 95 Statement of Cash Flows.
Under FRS 1, the Company presents its cash flows for a operating activities: b dividends from associates: c returns on investments and servicing of finance: d taxation: e capital expenditure and financial investments: f acquisitions and disposals: g dividends to ordinary shareholders: h management of liquid resources: and i financing activities.
SFAS 95 requires only three categories of cash flow activity namely a operating: b investing: and c financing.
Cash flows arising from taxation and returns on investments and servicing of finance under FRS 1 are included as operating activities under SFAS 95: dividend payments are included as a financing activity under SFAS 95 and cash flows from capital expenditure, long-term investments, acquisitions and disposals net of cash acquired or disposed are included as investing activities under SFAS 95.
In addition, under FRS 1, cash represents cash at bank and in hand less bank overdrafts.
Under US GAAP bank overdrafts are usually classified as financing activities.

l Disposal gain adjustment Due to differing treatment of goodwill and intangible assets under UK and US GAAP see Note 31 a, differences arise on the profit on sale of subsidiaries and investments.
Under UK GAAP profit on sale of subsidiaries and investments are classified as non-operating profits.
m Restructuring costs Under US GAAP, certain costs are provided for within purchase accounting which are not permitted under UK GAAP where such costs are charged to the profit and loss account and classified within restructuring.
In addition, non-contractual costs associated with voluntary redundancy schemes are not provided for under US GAAP until redundancy is accepted by the employee.
Under UK GAAP, these costs are provided for prior to acceptance by the employee.
n Employee Trust Under UK GAAP, own shares held by the Employee Trust are accounted for as fixed asset investments.
Under US GAAP, own shares are accounted for within shareholders equity.
o Advertising The Group expenses advertising costs as incurred.
p Right of Offset Under UK GAAP, a guaranteed loan of 621 million 2001: 684 million has been offset against restricted cash deposits included in short term investments in accordance with FRS 5.
Under UK GAAP a loan has been offset against a zero coupon bond perpetual loan note 19 which will mature at 244 million.
Under US GAAP, the offsets do not meet the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation 39. q Associates , before taxand interest, .
Interestandtax relatingtosuch  ofNetinterestand Taxation, respectively.
Under US GAAP, equity in earnings of associates is presented in a one line item after minority interests.
r Minority Interest Under UK GAAP the Company records minority interest on acquisitions at fair value.
Under US GAAP the minority interest at acquisition is recorded at historical cost.
This difference does not affect shareholder funds and net income under US GAAP.
s Debt Under UK GAAP debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
Under US GAAP issue costs are shown as assets.

These disclosures have been prepared under US GAAP and are set out below: 2001 m Turnover 5,764 Net income 505 Net income per ADS 1.01 The Group does not believe that this pro forma disclosure should be regarded as indicative of the on-going results of the Group or of Orangina Pampryl.
Profit after tax for Orangina Pampryl in 2000, on a US GAAP basis, was 19 million.
For the period from 1 January 2001 to 31 October 2001, Orangina Pampryl recorded a profit after tax, on a US GAAP basis, of 12 million.
There is no interest charge included in these numbers as Orangina Pampryl was part of the Pernod Ricard Group and no standalone accounts are available.
The tax rate used is based on local tax rates for the respective year.

32 Changes and Proposed Changes to US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles a SFAS 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.
SFAS 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognised in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.
The associated asset retirement costs are capitalised as part of the carrying amount of the longlived asset.
An entity shall measure changes in the liability for an asset retirement obligation due to passage of time by applying an interest method of allocation to the amount of the liability at the beginning of the period.
The interest rate used to measure that change shall be the creditadjusted risk-free rate that existed when the liability was initially measured.
That amount shall be recognised as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability as an expense classified as an operating item in the statement of income.
SFAS 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after 15 June 2002.
The Group does not anticipate that adoption of SFAS 143 will have a material impact on its results of operations or its financial position.
b SFAS 145 Rescission of SFAS Nos.

94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee  OtherCoststo ExitanActivity  a Restructuring.
SFAS 146 eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in EITF 94-3.
SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognised when the liability is incurred.
Under EITF 94-3, a liability for an exit cost as defined in EITF 94-3 was recognised at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan.
SFAS 146 also concluded that an entitys commitment to a plan, by itself, does not create a present obligation to others that meets the definition of a liability.
SFAS 146 also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability.

d SFAS 147 Acquisition of Certain Financial Institutions In October 2002, FASB issued SFAS No.
147, Acquisitions of Certain Financial Institutions.
This Statement removes acquisitions of financial institutions from the scope of Statement 72 and Interpretation 9 and requires that those transactions be accounted for in accordance with SFAS 141, and SFAS 142.
In addition, this Statement amends SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, to include in its scope long-term  intangible assets of financial institutions such as depositor and borrower relationship intangible assets and credit cardholders intangible assets.
SFAS 147 was effective immediately upon issuance.
The adoption of SFAS 147 has not had a material impact on its results of operations and financial position.

Additionally, SFAS148amendsthe disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require disclosure in the significant accounting policy footnote of both annual and interim financial statements of the method of accounting for stock-based compensation and the related pro-forma disclosures when the intrinsic value method continues to be used.
The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after 15 December 2002, and disclosures are effective for the first fiscal quarter beginning after 15 December 2002.
The Group does not intend to adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation.
Consequently SFAS 148 will not have an impact on its results of operation and financial position.
f FIN 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others In November 2002, FASB issued Interpretation 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.
This interpretation requires certain disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that is has issued.
It also requires a guarantor to recognise, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee.
The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for interim and annual periods after 15 December 2002 and the Group has adopted these requirements for our financial statements.
The initial recognition and initial measurement requirements of FIN 45 are effective prospectively for guarantees issued or 128 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 modified after 31 December 2002.
The Group are assessing, but at this point do not believe the adoption of the recognition and initial measurement requirements of FIN 45 will have a material impact on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
g FIN 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB 51.
FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.
FIN 46 explains how to identify variable interests entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity.
It requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved.
It also requires certain disclosures by the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and by an enterprise that holds significant variable interests in a variable interest entity where the enterprise is not the primary beneficiary.
FIN 46 is effective immediately to variable interest entities created after 31 January 2003 and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date, and effective for the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after 15 June 2003 to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before 1 February 2003.
FIN 46 requires an entity to disclose certain information regarding a variable interest entity, if when the Interpretation becomes effective, it is reasonably possible that an enterprise will consolidate or have to disclose information about that variable interest entity, regardless of the date on which the variable entity interest was created.
The Group does not expect that when FIN 46 becomes effective that it will have to consolidate or disclose any information regarding variable interests.
