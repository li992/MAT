Aegis Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2002 1.
Principal accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards, adopting the following principal accounting policies.
Financial Reporting Standard 19, Deferred Tax, has been adopted in the current year.
The introduction of this new accounting standard has not had a material effect on the results presented in this Annual Report.
The 2001 balance sheet has been restated to present deferred tax balances on a grossed-up basis in accordance with FRS19.
This has resulted in a 1.4 million asset and a 1.1 million liability being shown separately in the notes to the financial statements.
There was no impact on the 2001 profit and loss account.
In 2002, the Group changed its accounting treatment of internal labour cost in line with industry practice.
These costs are now disclosed within operating expenses rather than being included within cost of sales.
2001 comparative results have been restated to present cost of sales and operating expenses on the same basis.
The impact on the 2001 results has been to transfer 37.4 million out of cost of sales into operating expenses.
The impact of this change in treatment on the 2002 results has been to move 39.6 million of cost from cost of sales into operating expenses.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results, cashflows and net assets of Aegis Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings.
Where subsidiaries are acquired in the year, their results and cashflows are included from the date of acquisition up to 31 December 2002.
All inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated.
The financial statements also include the Groups attributable share of associated undertakings and joint ventures results up to 31 December 2002 and of their net assets liabilities at 31 December 2002.
Goodwill Prior to 1 January 1998, it was the Groups policy to write off purchased goodwill immediately to reserves and charge it to the profit and loss account only on the subsequent disposal of the business to which it related.
For acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998, the Group has elected to continue with this accounting policy.
In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 10, goodwill arising on each acquisition on or after 1 January 1998 is capitalised as an asset in the balance sheet.
The directors review the estimated useful economic life of goodwill arising on each acquisition and, where this is considered finite, the goodwill is amortised over this period on a straight line basis not exceeding 20 years.
Following the first full year of ownership of an acquired business, the goodwill capitalised is reviewed for impairment.
The carrying value of goodwill may also be reviewed at any time if there is a new event or change in circumstance which may impact upon its recoverable amount.
Deferred consideration on acquisitions is provided based on the directors best estimate of the liability at the balance sheet date.
The liability is discounted and an imputed interest charge is included in the profit and loss account.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Upon settlement, monetary assets and liabilities are re-translated at the rate ruling on the settlement date.
Monetary assets and liabilities at the year end are re-translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising upon re-translation at the settlement date or balance sheet date are taken to the profit and loss account.
Exchange differences arising on the re-translation of foreign currency borrowings used to provide a hedge against foreign currency investments are taken directly to reserves.
Profit and loss accounts and cash flows in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at average exchange rates.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences, arising on the translation of the results and net assets of subsidiaries and associated undertakings, are taken directly to reserves in the consolidated financial statements.
Short term forward exchange contracts are used to hedge transactions with material foreign currency exposures.
Assets and liabilities denoted under such contracts are translated at the contracted rate.
44 Notes to the financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2002 1.
Principal accounting policies continued Financial instruments The costs of issue of capital instruments such as the issue costs of new debt are charged to the profit and loss account on an annual basis over the life of the instrument.
The Group has entered into a swap agreement to convert interest payable on its US dollar Loan Notes from fixed into floating rate based upon the US six month LIBOR rate.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Group remits or receives the differential between the fixed and variable rate calculated by reference to the notional principal amount.
This differential is charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year to which it relates.
Turnover Turnover represents the value of media handled by the Group on behalf of clients, together with fees relating to media and research services provided.
Media turnover is recognised when charges are made to clients, principally when advertisements appear in the media.
Fees are recognised over the period of the relevant assignments or agreements.
For the market research business, turnover is recognised either on completion of a project or on the satisfactory completion of a specific phase of a project.
Provision is made for losses on a project when identified.
Invoices raised during the course of a project are booked as deferred income on the balance sheet until such a time as the related revenue is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Research and development Research and development expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of all fixed assets, except freehold land, to their residual value over their expected useful lives.
It is calculated on the historic cost of the assets at the following rates: Freehold buildings 1%-5% per annum Leasehold buildings Over the period of the lease Leasehold improvements 10%-20% per annum or over the period of the lease, if shorter Office furniture, fixtures, equipment & vehicles 10%-50% per annum Fixed assets are periodically reviewed for impairment with any resulting write down being charged to the profit and loss account.
Leased assets Where assets are financed by leasing agreements that give rights approximating to ownership finance leases, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased outright.
The amount capitalised is the present value of the minimum lease payments payable during the lease term.
The corresponding leasing commitments are shown as amounts payable to the lessor.
Depreciation on the relevant assets is charged to the profit and loss account.
Lease payments are split between capital and interest using the actuarial method.
The interest is charged to the profit and loss account.
The capital element reduces the amounts payable to the lessor.
All other leases are treated as operating leases.
These annual rentals are charged to the profit and loss account over the lease term on a straight line basis.
Subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiaries are held in the Company Balance Sheet at cost less any provisions for impairment.
Associated undertakings and joint ventures Companies in which the Group has a participating interest and over whose operating and financial policies it exercises a significant influence are treated as associated undertakings.
Investments in associated undertakings are included in the consolidated balance sheet at cost less provisions for impairment in value plus attributable post-acquisition retained profits or losses less provision for impairment and amortisation of goodwill.
Attributable profits or losses are included in the Group profit and loss account in the year.
45 Aegis Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Notes to the financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2002 1.
Principal accounting policies continued Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method.
Amounts are included in the consolidated balance sheet at cost less provision for any impairment, plus attributable post-acquisition profits or losses.
In the case of the Groups joint venture in eVerger, no account is taken of the trading results of eVergers underlying investments.
Other fixed asset investments Other fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provisions for impairment.
Work in progress Work in progress comprises attributable costs on market research projects and is held in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Provisions for liabilities and charges Where leasehold properties remain unutilised by the Group and have not been sublet, provision is made in full, on a discounted basis, for the outstanding rental payments together with other outgoings for the remaining period of the lease.
This provision takes into account any future sublet income reasonably expected to be obtained.
Future rental payments are charged against this provision in the period in which they are made.
Deferred taxation The Group has adopted FRS19, deferred tax, during the period.
Full provision is made for timing differences that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date between the treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Pension costs Retirement benefits for employees of certain companies in the Group are provided by defined contribution schemes which are funded by contributions from Group companies and employees.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account is the contribution payable in the year.
Segmental reporting The Group operates in two business sectors: media communications and market research.
An analysis of turnover by geographical area and business sector is set out below.
The geographical analysis reflects the regions by which the Group is managed.
Comparative figures have been restated on a similar basis.

59 Aegis Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Notes to the financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2002 23.
Financial instruments The Board of Directors has established objectives concerning the holding and use of financial instruments.
The key objective is to manage the financial risks faced by the Group, which are discussed below.
Formal policies and guidelines have been set to achieve this objective and it is the responsibility of Group Treasury to implement these policies using the strategies set out below.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments nor engage in speculative arrangements and it is the Groups policy not to use any complex financial instruments, unless, in exceptional circumstances, it is necessary to cover defined risks.
Management of financial risk The Group considers its major financial risks to be currency risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and credit risk.
The Groups policies with regard to these risks and the strategies concerning how financial instruments are used to manage these risks are set out below.
Currency risk A significant portion of the Groups activities takes place overseas.
The Group therefore faces currency exposures on transactions undertaken by subsidiaries in foreign currencies and on consolidation upon the translation of profits and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
The Groups foreign currency management policy requires subsidiaries to hedge all transactions and financial instruments with material currency exposures.
This is achieved using short-term forward exchange contracts.
At the year end, the aggregate value of transactions and related hedges was not material.
It is the Groups policy not to hedge exposures arising from the translation of profits or net assets as these represent an accounting rather than cash exposure.
The Groups policy is to borrow locally wherever possible to act as a natural hedge against the translation risk arising from its net investments overseas.
A currency analysis of borrowings is given below.
Liquidity The Groups objective of ensuring that adequate funding is in place is achieved by having agreed sufficient committed bank facilities.
The Group also seeks to manage its working capital requirement by requiring clients to pay for media in advance whenever possible.
At 31 December 2002, the Group had net debt before finance lease obligations and issue costs of new debt of 122.3 million 2001: 125.6 million.
The Group had cash balances of 122.2 million at 31 December 2002 2001: 60.7 million and gross borrowings of 244.5 million 2001: 189.5 million.
Included within gross borrowings is 108.8 million e165 million of 2 per cent convertible bonds due in 2006.
These bonds were issued on 15 May 2002.
Also included within gross borrowings is 99.4 million US$160 million 2001: 109.9 million US$160 million of unsecured loan notes issued on 20 November 2000.
These notes are repayable in full between 2006 and 2008.
In addition to the net debt at 31 December 2002, the Group has undrawn committed facilities of 168.7 million 2001: 222.5 million.
Further details are given on page 61.
Interest rate risk The Groups borrowings, excluding the convertible bond but including the unsecured loan notes referred to above, are at floating rates.
The Group has entered into long-term hedging arrangements to swap the interest relating to the unsecured loan notes from fixed into floating rates.
The Group has in place cash pooling arrangements in a number of territories.
These enable the Gr0up to minimise the interest paid on short-term borrowings and overdrafts, whilst allowing net surplus funds to be invested in interest bearing accounts.
An analysis of the interest rate risk profile of the financial liabilities and assets of the Group is given opposite.
60 Notes to the financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2002 23.
Financial instruments continued Credit risk Trade credit risk is managed in each territory through the use of credit checks on new clients and individual credit limits, where considered necessary.
In some instances, clients are required to pay for media in advance.
Short-term debtors and creditors and currency disclosures Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all disclosures.
Group companies do not have material, unhedged monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currencies.
Hence, no additional currency disclosures have been provided.
Analysis of interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities of the Group The currency and interest rate risk profile of the financial liabilities of the Group at 31 December was: Fixed rate Floating rate Total Fixed rate Floating rate Total financial financial financial financial financial financial liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities 2002 2002 2002 2001 2001 2001 m m m m m m Sterling 7.3 7.3 44.6 44.6 Euro 107.5 2.1 109.6 12.8 12.8 US dollar 114.2 114.2 125.8 125.8 Other currencies 13.4 13.4 6.3 6.3 107.5 137.0 244.5 189.5 189.5 Interest is payable on the above floating rate financial liabilities excluding the US unsecured loan notes based on the variable market rate in each country.
The weighted average interest rate for the year ended 31 December 2002 was 2.8% 2001: 5.3%.
The variable interest rate payable on the US unsecured loan notes is based on the prevailing US LIBOR rate.
Interest on the convertible bond is fixed at 2% with a 1.875% premium payable.
In addition to the liabilities above, the Group had creditors due after more than one year of 22.8 million 2001: 23.1 million on which generally no interest is paid representing deferred consideration on acquisitions repayable between one and five years and finance lease obligations of 1.1 million 2001: 1.6 million which are mostly held in US dollars.
Analysis of the interest rate risk profile of financial assets of the Group The currency and interest rate risk profile of the financial assets of the Group at 31 December was: Cash at Current Cash at Current bank and asset bank and asset in hand investments Total in hand investments Total 2002 2002 2002 2001 2001 2001 m m m m m m Sterling 0.1 0.1 5.8 5.8 Euro 86.3 86.3 25.6 2.0 27.6 US dollar 12.0 12.0 1.0 1.0 Other currencies 23.8 23.8 28.3 28.3 122.2 122.2 60.7 2.0 62.7 Floating rate cash earns interest based on the relevant national LIBID equivalent.
In addition to the financial assets above, the Group had other fixed asset investments of 2.8 million 2001: 2.9 million principally in US dollars, which do not yield an interest-related income and which do not have a fixed maturity date.
61 Aegis Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Notes to the financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2002 23.
Financial instruments continued Fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities With the exception of the Groups 2.7 million fixed asset investment in Harris Interactive Inc and the interest rate swap on the Groups US$ loan notes which is not included in the balance sheet, there are no material differences between the book and fair values of the Groups financial assets or liabilities.
The fair value of the Groups investment in Harris Interactive Inc at 31 December 2002 was 2.2 million.
The fair value of the swap at 31 December 2002 was 16.8 million 2001: 8.1 million.
This fair value represents unrecognised profits which the Group expects to realise as a result of lower variable interest payments under the swap compared with the fixed interest rate applicable on the underlying loan notes.
4.8 million of this unrealised profit is expected to be realised in 2003.
Maturity of financial assets and liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities is set out in notes 15, 16 and 21.
With the exception of the Groups other fixed asset investments of 2.8 million, all financial assets have a maturity of less than one year.
Borrowing facilities The Group had the following undrawn, committed bank borrowing facilities available at 31 December in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date: 2002 2001 m m Expiring within one year 140.1 165.3 Expiring between one and two years 28.6 28.6 Expiring between two and five years 28.6 168.7 222.5 Of the amounts disclosed above at 31 December 2002, 111.6 million expiring within one year may be extended annually by the Group until 2004.
Market risk At 31 December 2002, it is estimated that a general rise of 1% in interest would reduce 2002 profit before tax by 1.2 million.
It is also estimated that a strengthening of Sterling by 1% would reduce 2002 profit before tax by approximately 0.3 million.
Currency exposures No Group companies have material unhedged monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than that of the local functional currency.
Hedges of future transactions At 31 December 2002 and 2001, there were no material foreign exchange contracts to hedge against future transaction flows.
