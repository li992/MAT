The major schemes are of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The two largest schemes, which cover the majority of employees, are in the UK and US.
The main UK scheme was subject to a valuation by Watson Wyatt Partners as at 5 April 2000.
The scheme is valued formally every three years, the next valuation being as at 5 April 2003.
The main US scheme is valued annually and was subject to a valuation by Towers Perrin as at 1 January 2002.
The principal valuation assumptions for the main UK scheme were: Actuarial method Projected unit method Annual rate of return on investments 6.6% Annual increase in total pensionable remuneration 5.0% Annual increase in present and future pensions in payment 3.0% The principal valuation assumptions used for the US scheme were a rate of return on investments of 8%, increase in pensionable remuneration of 4.5%, and increase in present and future pensions in payment of 3%.
The actuarial values placed on scheme assets as at their last valuation date were sufficient to cover 121% and 103% of the benefits that had accrued to members of the main UK and US schemes, respectively.
Actuarial surpluses are spread as a level amount over the average remaining service lives of current employees.
The market values of the schemes assets at the valuation dates, excluding assets held in respect of members additional voluntary contributions, were 1,723m 2,826m, and 216m 330m in respect of the UK and US schemes, respectively.
Assessments for accounting purposes in respect of other funded schemes, including the Netherlands scheme, have been carried out by external qualified actuaries using prospective benefit methods.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the assessments of these other schemes are that, over the long term, investment returns will marginally exceed the annual increase in pensionable remuneration and in present and future pensions.
The actuarial value of assets of the schemes approximated to the aggregate benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable remuneration and pensions in course of payment.
The assets of the Netherlands scheme as at 31 December 2002 were sufficient to cover 109% of the actuarial value placed on the benefits that had accrued to the members of the scheme at that date.
The liabilities in respect of unfunded schemes have been determined by actuaries and provided for within creditors.
The net pension charge was 59m 94m 2001: 39m 63m.
Pension contributions made in the year amounted to 47m 75m 2001: 39m 63m.
The net SSAP24 charge on the main UK scheme comprises a regular cost of 27m 43m 2001: 24m 39m, offset by amortisation of the net actuarial surplus of 24m 38m 2001: 24m 39m.
Based on the advice of the scheme actuaries at the time of the last formal valuation in 2000, and with the agreement of the scheme trustees, no employer contributions are currently being made to the main UK scheme.
Aprepayment of 125m 191m 2001: 128m 210m is included in debtors falling due after more than one year, representing the excess of the pension credit to the profit and loss account since 1988 over the amounts funded to the main UK scheme.

A new UK financial reporting standard, FRS17: Retirement Benefits, will, with effect from the 2005 financial year, introduce new accounting policies in respect of pension arrangements.
FRS17 also requires additional information to be disclosed in the intervening period based on methodologies set out in the standard which are different from those used by the scheme actuaries in determining funding arrangements.
The assumed rates of return on scheme assets, the fair value of those assets and the present value of the scheme liabilities based on the methodologies and presentation prescribed by FRS17 were as follows: Main UK Scheme Aggregate of Schemes Assumed rate of Assumed rate of return on assets m m return on assets m m 2002 Equities 9.0% 825 1,262 9.0% 1,068 1,634 Bonds 4.5% 487 745 4.9% 670 1,025 Other 3.8% 45 69 3.8% 53 81 Total fair value of assets 1,357 2,076 1,791 2,740 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,305 1,996 1,928 2,950 Net surplus deficit 52 80 137 210 Related deferred tax 16 25 50 77 Net pension asset liability 36 55 87 133 Main UK Scheme Aggregate of Schemes Assumed rate of Assumed rate of return on assets m m return on assets m m 2001 Equities 7.2% 991 1,625 7.7% 1,267 2,078 Bonds 5.0% 502 823 5.5% 721 1,182 Other 4.0% 73 120 4.0% 81 133 Total fair value of assets 1,566 2,568 2,069 3,393 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,316 2,158 1,872 3,070 Net surplus 250 410 197 323 Related deferred tax 75 123 57 93 Net pension asset 175 287 140 230 At 31 December 2002, the aggregate net deficit in respect of the defined benefit schemes under FRS17 comprised 66m 101m 2001: net surplus 263m 431m in respect of funded schemes and liabilities of 71m 109m 2001: 66m 108m in respect of unfunded schemes, of which 52m 80m 2001: 49m 80m is provided for within creditors under SSAP 24.

The operating charge, the amount credited to other finance income and the amount recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses in the 2002 financial year based on the methodologies and presentation prescribed by FRS17 would have been as follows: Main UK Scheme Aggregate of Schemes m m m m Charged to operating profit Current service cost 34 54 75 119 Past service cost Total operating charge 34 54 75 119 Credited to other finance income Expected return on pension scheme assets 97 154 137 218 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 72 114 107 170 Net return 25 40 30 48 Amounts recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 254 404 352 560 Experience losses arising on the scheme liabilities 21 33 13 21 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the scheme liabilities 86 136 43 69 Actuarial loss 189 301 322 512 The difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets represented 19% and 20% of scheme assets of the main UK scheme and of the aggregate of schemes respectively.
The experience losses arising on the scheme liabilities represented 2% and 1% of the present value of scheme liabilities of the main UK scheme and of the aggregate of schemes respectively.
The total actuarial loss arising in 2002 under FRS17, that would have been recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, represents 14% and 17% of the present value of the scheme liabilities of the main UK scheme and of the aggregate of schemes respectively.

The most significant were MBO Verlag and Quicklaw Inc. in the Legal segment.
The net assets of the businesses acquired are incorporated at their fair value to the combined businesses.
The fair values of the consideration given and the assets and liabilities acquired are summerised below: Book value Fair value Fair on acquisition adjustments value m m m Goodwill 37 37 Intangible fixed assets 64 64 Tangible fixed assets 2 2 Current assets 22 13 9 Current liabilities 12 1 13 Net assets acquired 12 87 99 Consideration after taking account of 4m net cash acquired 99 Less: deferred to future years 9 Net cash flow 90 Book value Fair value Fair on acquisition adjustments value m m m Goodwill 59 59 Intangible fixed assets 102 102 Tangible fixed assets 3 3 Current assets 35 21 14 Current liabilities 19 2 21 Net assets acquired 19 138 157 Consideration after taking account of 6m net cash acquired 157 Less: deferred to future years 14 Net cash flow 143 The fair value adjustments in relation to the acquisitions made in 2002 relate principally to the valuation of intangible assets and the restatement of current assets to conform with Reed Elsevier accounting policies in relation to cost capitalisation.
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
The businesses acquired in 2002 contributed 19m 30m to turnover, 5m 8m to adjusted operating profit, before the amortisation of goodwill and intangible assets and exceptional items, and 3m 5m to net cash inflow from operating activities for the part year under Reed Elsevier ownership.
No depreciation was provided on freehold land.
The net book amount of tangible fixed assets includes 24m 37m 2001: 16m 26m in respect of assets held under finance leases.
