Mexican excise rebate The Mexican Supreme Court ruled in 2001 in favour of an action, brought by a number of spirits companies challenging the excise duty regime applicable to their Mexican operations during 1998 and 1999.
Its ruling determined that the tax was inequitable because it was applied only to large companies.
The Mexican Supreme Court awarded compensation which, by agreement with the Mexican tax authorities, is principally received by offset against current and future duties and taxes.
At 31 August 2002, 260m has been received and has been subject to applicable corporation tax at 35%.
It is anticipated that the remaining recovery will be in the region of 30m to 50m comprising excise duty rebate and related interest and inflation adjustments and will be fully recovered by 31 August 2003.
Due to the size of the 2002 rebate it has been treated as an exceptional item and for comparative purposes the 2001 benefit has been reclassified from trading profit to exceptional items.
