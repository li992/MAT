The funds of the Scheme are administered by trustees and are separate from the Group.
A valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 30 September 2000 by an independent actuary.
The Group contribution rate is 16.5% of members total earnings.
The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the funding position of the Scheme are those relating to the differences between the long-term rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in earnings.
The 2000 valuation for the Scheme assumed that investment returns over the long term would exceed salary growth by 2.5% per annum and price inflation of 2.5% per annum.
The market value of the Scheme assets was 184.2m, which was sufficient to cover 98% of members accrued benefits, after allowing for future increases in earnings at the long-term rate.
The Group contribution rate recommended by the actuaries rose from 13.6% to 16.5% from 1 October 2001.
The Scheme was closed to new entrants on 29 September 1997.
A Group Personal Pension Plan defined contribution scheme has been made available to eligible employees since that date.
A provision of 3.1m 2001: 2.8m is included in creditors representing the cumulative excess of pension costs charged to the profit and loss account over the Group contributions paid.
