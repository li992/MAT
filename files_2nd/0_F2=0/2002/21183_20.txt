Directors remuneration report continued Options granted after 1997 are only exercisable if certain performance conditions have been met.
During the year, the three-year performance periods attaching to options granted in 1998 and 1999 expired.
In order for participants to exercise these options, the Companys TSR, when compared with the TSR of a comparator group of financial services companies, would need to at least match median performance.
At median performance, 40% of the options become exercisable and, at upper quartile performance, 100% of the options become exercisable.
Between median and upper quartile, the number of options vesting is determined on a straight-line basis.
At the end of the performance period attaching to the options granted in 1998, the Company was ranked fourth out of the 10 companies remaining in the comparator group and accordingly 72.7% of the options have become exercisable at 853 pence per share.
In respect of the options granted in 1999, the Company was ranked seventh in the comparator group and therefore none of these options have become exercisable.
Under the rules of the scheme, the performance conditions will be retested at each subsequent anniversary of their grant in respect of the options which have not vested.
Bonus Plan options are the options granted in 1999 and 2000 under the CGU Deferred Bonus Plan.
Participants who deferred their annual cash bonus and received an award of shares also received a matching award over an equivalent number of options.
These options, which are not subject to performance conditions, are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of their grant.
The mid-market price of an ordinary share in the Company on 31 December 2002 was 443 pence, and the mid-market prices during the year ranged from 341.5 pence to 873.0 pence.
No director exercised any options during the year and therefore no gains on such were made.
