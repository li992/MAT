Description of Exels segmental analysis Exels segmental analysis splits logistics activities between contract logistics and freight management.
Contract logistics CL includes ground-based supply chain management services, such as integrated warehousing and transportation, just in time services, sub-assembly and other value added activities.
Freight management FM includes airfreight and seafreight forwarding, customs broking, transportation management including US road and rail and specialist mail and express services.
Due to the comprehensive range of services provided to customers within individual contracts there are some cross-overs between these two segments but these are relatively small.
The restatements of Asia Pacific contract logistics and freight management represent the incremental results of Exel-Sinotrans, following the reclassification of the Groups investment in the company as a joint venture: previously Exel-Sinotrans was included in the Groups results as an associated undertaking.
The impact of the restatements on the Groups results is an increase in turnover of 43.0m.
There was no change to the Groups profit for the financial year due to this reclassification.
Discontinued operations are the German chilled food logistics business which was closed in 2002, and the German frozen food logistics business which was sold in 2001.
Non-operating net liabilities comprise other investments, net debt, taxation, dividends and related items.

As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on the sale of properties where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
Such tax would become payable only if the property were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief.
The total amount not provided is 14.4m 2001: 16.3m.
At present, it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
In the past, the Group has incurred significant tax losses in certain overseas jurisdictions, the future utilisation of which is uncertain.
The Group has therefore not recognised a deferred tax asset of 42.7m 2001: 31.4m in respect of tax losses of overseas companies.
In addition, the Group has generated significant UK capital losses from disposals in previous years.
Such losses are only available to offset certain UK capital profits arising in future periods and it is expected to be some time before these losses are relieved.
Accordingly, the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 16.3m 2001: 18.0m on these losses.
The tax charge for the year has been reduced by 2.4m 2001: 2.0m in respect of the write back of advance corporation tax which is available to reduce current tax liabilities.
All advance corporation tax previously written off has now been written back.
In order to ensure the full recovery of advance corporation tax, the Group has deferred taking deductions for certain UK losses arising in earlier periods.
These losses are expected to be utilised in the short-term.
This has resulted in a prior year UK current tax charge, and a corresponding deferred tax credit, of 9.0m.
Tax reliefs were introduced in the US during 2002 in respect of the timing of deductibility of certain expenditure incurred in 2001.
This has resulted in a material prior year current tax credit and a corresponding deferred tax charge.
This represents the majority of the 5.1m prior year current tax credit within foreign tax.

Profit on ordinary activities before taxation and earnings per share, both before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, are provided in addition to the earnings per share required by FRS 14 because, in the opinion of the Directors, they will assist shareholders to consider more readily the underlying performance trends of the Group.

Exel plc Annual report 2002 Financials 73 16 Pensions The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24 and the disclosures given in a are those required by that standard.
The required disclosures for FRS 17 Retirement benefits, to the extent not given in a, are set out in b below.
a SSAP 24 Pensions costs The major UK schemes are of the defined benefit type except for the part of the Exel Retirement Plan for members under the age of 40 which is of the defined contribution type and are administered by external trustees independently of the Groups finances.
These schemes cover 54% of UK employees: defined benefit arrangements account for 55% of the membership of the schemes.
The pension costs for these schemes have been assessed with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
Full actuarial valuations of both the main UK pension schemes, the Exel Retirement Plan and the Ocean Nestor Pension Scheme, were carried out as at 31 March 2000.
The major actuarial assumptions were: % Investment return 7.0 Salary growth 4.5 Pension increase 3.0 Dividend growth 4.0 The market value of the assets in the Exel Retirement Plan and the Ocean Nestor Pension Scheme at the valuation date were 1,841.0m and 755.8m respectively.
The actuarial valuation of these assets represented 136% and 145% respectively of the liabilities for benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in salaries.
The actuaries have been able to recommend the continued suspension of the Groups contributions to both schemes until at least the conclusion of the March 2003 valuation.
The pension surpluses are spread on the level cash amounts method over the average estimated remaining service life of employees, currently 12 years.
The pensions credit comprises a defined benefit regular cost of 23.5m 2001: 22.5m and a defined contribution cost of 3.2m 2001: 3.2m less a variation of 62.7m 2001: 60.2m arising from the surplus.
The main defined benefit schemes outside the UK have been assessed in accordance with advice from independent qualified actuaries and are accounted for using SSAP 24.
The charge included in the profit and loss account in relation to these schemes was 2.7m 2001: 2.9m.
The Group also has a number of defined contribution schemes outside the UK.
The total cost of defined contribution arrangements of 16.9m 2001: 15.6m has been charged against profits in the year.
b FRS 17 Retirement benefits The valuations of the UK schemes used for FRS 17 disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial valuations as at 31 March 2000 and updated by Watson Wyatt LLP to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2002 for the purposes of FRS 17.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2002.
The market values of overseas schemes liabilities at 31 December 2002 have been assessed by local actuaries.
The disclosures for all of the Groups defined benefits arrangements are aggregated below.
Overseas assets and liabilities are included, but are not material to the totals.

Exchange gains and losses arising from structural currency exposures, net of hedges, are included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Transactional currency exposures Transactional currency exposures arise from trading transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the business.
These exposures give rise to currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
The Group carries on a significant amount of intra-group activity across the world.
To control the currency exposures arising from this trading activity, Exels treasury function Group Treasury operates an intercompany netting system which passes the non-functional currency exchange risk to Group Treasury.
The residual exchange risks are hedged by Group Treasury using forward foreign currency contracts.
