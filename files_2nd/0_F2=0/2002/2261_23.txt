The major programmes included the restructuring of BOC Edwards manufacturing capacity, closure of production at the Process Plants Edmonton site in the UK, investments in information technology and information management systems, restructuring to deliver operational efficiencies in Process Gas Solutions and restructuring of operational networks in Industrial and Special Products.
Cash flow from operating activities includes an outflow of 48.0 million in 2002 in respect of these exceptional items.
ii Write-downs of assets In September 2002 BOC and Air Liquide announced a conditional agreement to merge their industrial and medical gases businesses in Japan to form a combined company to be called Japan Air Gases.
The net assets of OSK the existing BOC gases business in Japan, which had included an increase in the value of fixed assets through property revaluations in the 1980s and early 1990s, have been reduced to an appropriate amount based on valuations performed ahead of the merger.
This has resulted in a write-down of 32.7 million, of which 11.5 million has been taken against the revaluation reserves, and the balance of 21.2 million has been charged as an exceptional item in the profit and loss account in 2002.
The write-downs in 2001 related to the business initiative announced in August 2001 with the objective of releasing cash tied up in unproductive assets and improving cash generation.

Profit and loss continued iii Costs of proposed takeover and break fee The final costs associated with the pre-conditional offer for the Group have been incurred in 2002 in respect of share options and other costs related to the retention of key employees.
There are no further costs to come.
The break fee was received in 2000 from the potential bidders on the failure of the pre-conditional offer.
Cash flow from operating activities includes an outflow of 4.5 million in 2002 in respect of these exceptional items.

The costs of 21.3 million for closing BOCs Process Plants business have been charged as an exceptional item this year.
This includes severance costs for 215 employees, the write-down of assets and the costs of winding down the business.
Cash flow from operating activities includes an outflow of 12.5 million in 2002 in respect of these exceptional costs.
In April 2002 BOC Edwards agreed the sale of its US glass coating business, resulting in a profit on disposal of 1.1 million.
v The profit on disposal of the health care discontinued business in 2000 of 12.5 million arose from the release of provisions established at the time of disposal in 1998. vi In 2001, proceeds from the disposal of fixed assets were 41.2 million.
Of this, 39.0 million was from those assets which were sold at a profit and 2.2 million was from those assets which were sold at a loss.

d Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares.
The company has only one category of dilutive potential shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys shares during the year and where any performance conditions have been met at the balance sheet date.

b Currency, interest rate and counterparty exposure The Groups approach to managing currency and interest rate risk and its use of swaps in that process is described on pages 45 and 46 in the finance and treasury review under the heading management of financial risks.
Interest rate swaps At 30 September 2002, the Group had entered into six interest rate swap agreements 2001: five with notional principal amounts of 420.0 million 2001: 375.4 million.
The swaps underlying currencies are sterling, US dollars and Japanese yen.

Treasury information continued Currency swaps At 30 September 2002, the Group had entered into eight currency swap agreements 2001: nine with notional principal amounts of 360.7 million 2001: 359.6 million.
The maturity dates range between one month and 33 months from the balance sheet date 2001: between one month and 24 months.
The weighted average receivable payable swap interest rate is calculated by applying the notional swap interest received or paid, using rates applicable at the financial year end, to the notional principal of outstanding swaps at the financial year end.
The currency and interest rate exposure of the net borrowings of the Group at 30 September, after taking into account interest rate and currency swaps entered into by the Group, is given in the table below.

iv Facilities The Group maintains a number of short and medium-term committed lines of credit.
The main medium-term facilities are multi-currency agreements with a group of relationship banks, under which the Group may borrow up to US$420.0 million 2001: US$420.0 million for general corporate purposes.
These facilities were undrawn both at 30 September 2002 and 30 September 2001.
The following table shows the maturity profile of these facilities.
2002 2001 $ million $ million Within one year 200.0 One to two years 220.0 200.0 Two to three years 220.0 420.0 420.0 Additional committed facilities are maintained by the principal operating units in the Group.
v Security The secured loans, maturing between 2002 and 2019, are principally secured by charges over the property, plant and machinery, stocks and trade debtors of certain overseas subsidiaries.
d Fair value information i Fair values of financial instruments Set out below is a comparison of the carrying amount of the Groups financial instruments excluding short-term debtors and creditors at 30 September 2002.

For those bearing either no interest or a floating rate of interest it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
For those bearing a fixed rate of interest an assessment of the interest rate at which the Group could make the same loan under current conditions has been made.
Unless this differs significantly from the fixed rate it is also deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
Where this does differ significantly, the fair value is based on the discounted value of future cash flows.
For equity instruments listed on a recognised stock exchange the fair value is the quoted market price.
For other equity instruments it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
The fair value is the quoted market price.
As all bear either no interest or a floating rate of interest it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
For those bearing a floating rate of interest it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
For those bearing a fixed rate of interest the fair value is either the quoted market price where a liquid market exists or has been calculated using well established pricing models.
Both the carrying amount and the fair value are based on current market prices and interest rates.
The fair value is the estimated amount the Group would receive or pay to terminate the agreements.
The fair value represents the net effect on the Group of closing out all outstanding contracts.
Includes foreign currency and interest rate swap agreements.

Treasury information continued ii Hedges As explained on pages 45 and 46 of the finance and treasury review under the heading management of financial risks, the Groups policies are to use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge transactional currency exposures principally arising through anticipated sales and purchase transactions and swap agreements to manage interest rate risks and hedge structural currency exposures.
Currency swaps are only held to change the currency of the Groups borrowings to match better its net investments in its overseas subsidiaries.
In accordance with the Groups accounting policies, the assets and liabilities arising from these swap agreements are translated into sterling at the spot rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
The resulting exchange gains or losses are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses to match the exchange gains or losses on the net investments in the overseas subsidiaries.
The carrying amount of the swap agreements as shown in note 3 d i is the result of the exchange gains and losses recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, and is analysed in the deferred gains and losses table shown below.

After taking account of the hedging transactions, there was no significant net profit and loss account exposure to currency gains and losses arising from monetary assets and liabilities at 30 September 2002. f Financial instruments i Financial assets The interest rate and currency profile of the Groups financial assets excluding short-term debtors at 30 September 2002 is shown below.

The principal benchmark rates for floating rate financial liabilities are LIBOR for sterling balances, US LIBOR for US dollar balances, Australian bank bill rate for Australian dollar balances, South African prime rate for South African rand balances and Japanese yen LIBOR for Japanese yen balances.
The maturity profile of the net borrowings is set out in note 3 c ii.
Other floating rate financial liabilities are mainly employee incentive provisions.
These are expected to be utilised over the period to 2004 depending on the future choices of the relevant employees.

Tax continued ii Deferred tax US GAAP For US GAAP reporting, the Group follows SFAS109, Accounting for Income Taxes, in respect of deferred taxation.
SFAS109 requires deferred tax to be fully provided on all temporary differences.

As required by the applicable UK GAAP accounting standard, FRS17, this asset is set against the relevant retirement benefit liability to show the net position see note 6 e. If it was included above, it would be wholly reversed in the adjustments to US GAAP.

Tax continued c Factors affecting the current and Group effective tax charge for the period The table set out below provides a reconciliation between the UK corporation tax rate and the Groups effective tax rate, excluding exceptional items, computed by taking the various elements of the tax reconciliation as a percentage of the profit before tax, excluding exceptional items.

The current tax charges will also be affected by changes in the excess of tax depreciation over book depreciation and the use of tax credits.
e Unused tax credits On a consolidated basis, the Group has net operating loss carryforwards of 44.4 million.
If not offset against taxable income, these losses will expire as follows: Net operating loss Year million 2003 2004 11.7 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter, or no expiry date 32.7 For US Federal tax purposes, the Group has investment tax credits and general business tax credits to carry forward of approximately 12.9 million, which are available to reduce income taxes otherwise payable.
These do not expire until 2003 or thereafter.
In addition, the Group has alternative minimum tax credits for US Federal income tax purposes of approximately 27.7 million which can be carried forward to reduce regular tax liabilities of future years.
There is no expiration date on these credits.
Investment tax credits are accounted for by the flow-through method whereby they reduce income taxes currently payable and the provision for income taxes in the period in which the assets giving rise to such credits are placed in service.
Deferred tax assets, subject to the need for a valuation allowance, are recognised to the extent that the investment tax credits are not currently utilised.

Employees continued d Option and incentive schemes BOC operates share option schemes for both executives and employees.
The features of these are given in the report on remuneration and the employees report.
Executive options include share options and rights and long-term share incentive units.
The executive share award plan was granted at an option price of nil.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Details of the assumptions used are given in ii below.
89 The BOC Group plc Report and accounts 2002 Notes to the financial statements 6.
Employees continued Executive options are granted at the market price of the companys shares at the time of the grant and consequently there is no compensation expense under UK GAAP.
The Group also takes advantage of the exemption granted under UITF17, Employee Share Schemes, whereby no compensation expense need be recorded for employee schemes.
For US reporting purposes the company applies APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations in accounting for its plans.
By applying this statement the employee share schemes are deemed non-compensatory and therefore do not result in an expense for financial reporting purposes.
Under the executive schemes, grants of share options are at the market price of the companys shares at the time of grant.
If compensation cost for the Groups share option plans had been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with the method of US SFAS123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, the Groups profit before tax under US GAAP would have been charged with an additional cost of 6.3 million 2001: 9.7 million, 2000: 8.3 million, basic earnings per share would have been 51.18p 2001: 46.71p, 2000: 53.99p and diluted earnings per share would have been 50.99p 2001: 46.54p, 2000: 53.72p.
The Black-Scholes model was used to measure the compensation expense under US SFAS123.
The assumptions used for grants in 2002 included a dividend yield of 4.0 per cent 2001: 4.0 per cent, 2000: 3.3 per cent, expected share price volatility of 31.0 per cent 2001: 30.0 per cent, 2000: 24.6 per cent, a weighted average expected life of 5.0 years 2001: 4.2 years, 2000: 4.2 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.9 per cent 2001: 5.1 per cent, 2000: 5.9 per cent.
The weighted average interest rate is based on UK Gilts on the date of grant with a maturity similar to the related options.
e Retirement benefits i UK GAAP FRS17 Retirement benefits Group The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The majority of the schemes are self-administered and the schemes assets are held independently of the Groups finances.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The Group operates defined benefit schemes in Europe, Americas, Africa and Asia Pacific.
The largest schemes are located in the UK, US, South Africa and Australia.
The UK and South African schemes are based on final salary and the US on annual salary.
With effect from 1 January 1998 the Australian scheme changed to operate primarily as a defined contribution scheme, although it retains some defined benefit guarantees.
The geographical split of the pension schemes has been amended in 2002 to be consistent with the segmental analysis.
The most recent actuarial valuations have been updated by an independent qualified actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 30 September 2002.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 30 September 2002.
On the advice of the actuaries, company contributions to the principal UK scheme will resume from 1 October 2002 at a rate of 14.4 per cent of payroll.
In accordance with South African legislation, contributions recommenced on 7 December 2001 at rates ranging from 10.5 per cent to 12 per cent.
Contribution rates were increased in June 2002 and now range from 14.9 per cent to 19.5 per cent.
As the South African schemes and the defined benefit guarantees of the Australian scheme are closed schemes, the current service cost as a percentage of pensionable salaries under the projected unit method will increase as the members approach retirement.
Contributions recommenced to the Australian scheme on 1 October 2001 at rates ranging from 11 per cent to 17 per cent.
In the US, company contributions to the pension plan remain suspended.
During the year, the Pension Funds Second Amendment Act, 2001 was passed in South Africa.
Under this Act, surpluses in pension funds have to be used in a manner specified under Regulations to the Act to improve current and former members benefits prior to the employer obtaining any benefit from the surpluses.
Consequently, it is considered unlikely that the company will obtain any benefit from the surpluses in the South African schemes.
Therefore the surpluses at 30 September 2002 have been written off in the statement of total recognised gains and losses in accordance with FRS17.

Employees continued ii UK GAAP FRS17 Retirement benefits parent company The pension rights of UK BOC Group employees are dealt with through a self-administered scheme, the assets of which are held independently of the Groups finances.
The scheme is a defined benefit scheme that is funded partly by contributions from members and partly by contributions from Group undertakings at rates advised by independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Acting on the advice of the actuaries, company contributions to the principal UK scheme will resume from 1 October 2002.
The company accounts for pension costs in accordance with UK Financial Reporting Standard 17 FRS17 on retirement benefits.
In accordance with the standard, the company treats contributions to the pension scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
This is because the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme cover a number of UK BOC Group undertakings and cannot readily be split between each Group undertaking on a consistent and reliable basis.
iii Pensions US GAAP For the purposes of US GAAP, the pension costs of the largest schemes have been restated in the following tables in accordance with the requirement of SFAS132.
The changes in projected benefit obligation, plan assets and details of the funded status of these retirement plans, together with the changes in the accumulated other post-retirement benefit obligations of the Groups US business, are given below.

ii Associates The cost of investment in associates was 15.1 million 2001: 8.3 million and the attributable profit before tax was 9.4 million 2001: 10.5 million, 2000: 5.6 million.
Goodwill of associates arose on the combination of the BOC Process Plants business with Linde Engineering.
This represents the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the provisional fair value of the net assets acquired.
This goodwill will be amortised over a period of 15 years.
iii Own shares For share-based incentive schemes which do not use new issue shares, options are satisfied by the transfer of shares held in trust for the purpose.
At 30 September 2002, options over 5.4 million shares were outstanding under these schemes, for which 4.6 million shares in the company were held pending exercise.
Loans and advances for the purchase of shares in trust have been made either by the company or its subsidiaries.
If the value of shares in trust is insufficient to cover the loans, the company and its subsidiaries will bear any loss.
The company also bears administrative costs on an accruals basis.
Based on the companys share price at 30 September 2002 of 867.0p, the market value of own shares held in trust was 39.5 million.
This compares with the acquisition cost shown above.
Own shares are shown as fixed asset investments for accounting purposes, in accordance with FRS5 and UITF Abstract 13.
Information on share option schemes appears in the report on remuneration and in notes 6 and 12.
Dividends waived on the shares held in trust amounted to 1.8 million 2001: 1.2 million, 2000: 1.5 million.

Due to the time frame that is often involved in such claims, a significant part of this provision is subject to actuarial valuation.
Where this is not appropriate, other external assessments are used.
The restructuring provision represents expenditure to be incurred on major reorganisations.
This year 48.0 million was spent of which 4.2 million was provided for at 30 September 2001 and 3.7 million was provided for at 30 September 2000.
The provisions remaining at 30 September 2002 consist mainly of redundancy costs and will be spent during 2003.
Incentive and other employee provisions include long-term share incentive units and deferred compensation plans.
Note 6 d contains further details of the long-term share incentive units.
Environmental provisions have been set aside to cover the costs of remediation for a number of hazardous waste sites.
The costs are expected to be incurred between 2002 and 2030.
Due to the period over which this expenditure is likely to be incurred, the provision has been discounted at a rate of four per cent.
The effect of discounting is 6.7 million.
Other provisions are principally for warranty and legal costs.

The principal differences between the standards relate to classification of items within the cash flow statement and with regard to the definition of cash and cash equivalents.
Under FRS1, cash flows are presented separately for: a operating activities: b dividends from joint ventures and associates: c returns on investments and servicing of finance: d tax paid: e capital expenditure and financial investment: f acquisitions and disposals: g equity dividends paid: h management of liquid resources: and i financing.
Under SFAS95, however, only three categories of cash flow activity are reported: a operating activities: b investing activities: and c financing activities.
Dividends from joint ventures and associates, cash flows from returns on investments and servicing of finance excluding dividends paid to minorities and tax paid under FRS1 would be included in operating activities under SFAS95: capital expenditure and acquisitions and disposals would be included in investing activities under SFAS95: equity dividends would be included as a financing activity under SFAS95.
Under FRS1, cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand with any qualifying financial institution, less overdrafts from any qualifying financial institution repayable on demand.
Under SFAS95, cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits but also includes cash equivalents which are short-term, highly liquid investments.
Generally only investments with original maturities of three months or less come within this definition.
Set out above, for illustrative purposes, is a summary consolidated statement of cash flows under SFAS95.

It also purchased Hydromatix Inc in January 2002 and the Semco business in April 2002.
In March 2002 the Group acquired the turbomolecular pumps business of Seiko Instruments Inc.
Purchases of products from Seiko Instruments Inc in the period from 1 October 2001 to the date of acquisition were approximately 3.0 million.
In May 2002 the Group purchased 79 per cent of Unique Gas and Petrochemicals Public Company Limited and acquired a further 20 per cent before the end of the year.
In July 2002 the Group purchased the industrial assets of Enron Teesside Operations Limited.
During 2002 the Group acquired an additional three per cent of the minority interests in Osaka Sanso Kogyo KK.
The acquisitions in the BOC Edwards line of business contributed 55.5 million to turnover and 0.8 million to operating profit before exceptional items.
Acquisitions in the other lines of business did not have a material impact on turnover or operating profit before exceptional items.
Of the total acquisition expenditure, 48.1 million was in the Process Gas Solutions business, 57.3 million was in the Industrial and Special Products business, 86.2 million was in the BOC Edwards business and 15.7 million was in the Afrox hospitals business.

107 The BOC Group plc Report and accounts 2002 Notes to the financial statements 16.
US accounting information a Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles and other US accounting information The financial statements of The BOC Group plc are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UK UK GAAP, which differ in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the US US GAAP.
Set out below is a summary of the more significant adjustments which would be required if US GAAP had been applied, together with the reconciliation of profit before tax and shareholders funds from UK GAAP to US GAAP, presentation of net income, earnings per share and comprehensive income on a US GAAP basis, and a statement of movement in shareholders funds under US GAAP.
Goodwill Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1998 accounted for under the purchase method has been eliminated against shareholders funds.
Additionally, UK GAAP requires that on subsequent disposal or closure of a business, any goodwill previously taken directly to shareholders funds is then charged against income.
The Group adopted FRS10 in 1999, which requires goodwill on subsequent acquisitions to be capitalised and amortised over a period not exceeding 20 years.
Under US GAAP, goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 30 June 2001 was capitalised and then amortised over the expected useful life, not exceeding 40 years, as a charge against income.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions since 1 July 2001 is capitalised but no amortisation is charged, in accordance with the transitional provisions of SFAS142.
Specific provision is made if there is a permanent impairment to the carrying value of capitalised goodwill.
Deferred tax The Group adopted FRS19 Deferred tax in 2002 for UK GAAP purposes.
This requires that full provision for deferred tax is recognised in the financial statements.
The adoption of FRS19 has eliminated most of the differences that previously existed between UK GAAP and US GAAP.
As a result, the adjustment now primarily relates to the deferred tax effect of other US GAAP adjustments.
Revaluation of fixed assets UK GAAP allowed for the periodic revaluation of land and buildings with depreciation then being calculated on the revalued amount.
Any surplus or deficit to the extent that the revaluation reserve was in surplus on the revaluation was then taken directly to shareholders funds.
With the Groups adoption of FRS15 in 2000, the Group no longer revalues fixed assets.
Under US GAAP, revaluations of fixed assets are generally not permitted and, as a result, the reconciliation restates fixed assets to historical cost and the depreciation charge and any write downs of previously revalued assets are adjusted accordingly.
Restructuring costs Under UK GAAP, when a decision has been taken to restructure, the necessary provisions are made for impairment of asset values together with severance and other costs.
Under US GAAP, the requirements for charging restructuring costs to income are more prescriptive and all significant actions arising from the restructuring plan and their completion dates must be identified by the balance sheet date.
Accordingly, the charge for restructuring costs has been adjusted to meet US GAAP requirements.
Pensions For UK GAAP reporting FRS17 Retirement benefits, the pension asset or liability in the balance sheet represents the difference between the market value of pension scheme assets at the balance sheet date and the present value of pension scheme liabilities at that date, net of deferred tax.
Under US GAAP SFAS87, plan assets are valued by reference to market-related value at the date of the financial statements.
Liabilities are assessed using the rate of return obtainable on fixed or inflation-linked bonds.
There is a significant difference in the treatment of actuarial gains and losses arising during the accounting period.
UK GAAP recognises the actuarial gains and losses in full in the year in which they arise in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Under US GAAP, the actuarial gains and losses which exceed ten per cent of the value of the assets or liabilities at the start of the accounting period are amortised over the remaining service lives of scheme members.
FRS17 requires that past service costs are recognised in full in the period in which they become vested.
SFAS87 requires past service costs to be amortised over the remaining service lives of the employees to whom the amendments relate.
Where an additional minimum liability exists under US GAAP, ie where the amount provided for any scheme does not cover the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation for that scheme, this must be recognised under SFAS87.
Securities investments Under UK GAAP, current asset investments of all types are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost, or alternatively, at market value or at directors valuation.
Under US GAAP, securities which are determined to be available-for-sale are stated at fair value and any unrealised gains or losses included as a separate component of shareholders funds.
The deferred tax consequences of unrealised gains or losses are also charged or credited to shareholders funds.
Employee share option plans ESOPs Under UK GAAP, shares held by the ESOPs are recorded as fixed asset investments at cost.
Realised and unrealised gains or losses on subsequent issues of shares are charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year to which they relate.
Under US GAAP, these shares and other shares held in trust are recorded at cost in the balance sheet as a deduction from shareholders funds.
Gains or losses on subsequent issues of shares are recorded as adjustments to the share premium account.
108 The BOC Group plc Report and accounts 2002 16.
US accounting information continued Financial instruments The Group enters into a number of currency swaps, interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to currency and interest rate risks.
Under UK GAAP, such instruments are shown at their carrying value.
Under US GAAP, these instruments are marked to market and any change in value is recognised in either the income statement or through comprehensive income in accordance with SFAS133 depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if it is, the type of hedge transaction.
Accounting for swaps Under UK GAAP, gains or losses on closing out interest rate swap contracts taken to hedge the Groups fixed floating interest rate position can be taken to profit immediately.
US GAAP requires any gain or loss to be deferred over the remaining hedge period.
Share of results and net assets of joint ventures and associates The Groups share of the results and net assets of its joint ventures and associates as calculated under UK GAAP is shown within fixed asset investments.
For the purposes of the reconciliations set out below, the Groups share of the results and net assets of its joint ventures and associates has been adjusted to recognise a difference in the method of reporting profits under US GAAP.
Other Other adjustments principally comprise sale and leaseback transactions, depreciation and certain executive incentive schemes.
Under UK GAAP, any profit or loss on the sale and operating leaseback of fixed assets can generally be taken to profit immediately.
US GAAP requires any gain or loss to be deferred over the contract lease period.
Prior to 2001, under UK GAAP, it was acceptable for depreciation to be charged on an annuity basis.
The Group no longer charges depreciation on an annuity basis.
Under US GAAP, annuity depreciation is not allowed.
Under US GAAP, executive incentive schemes are accounted for under APB Opinion 25.
Comprehensive income In June 1997, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS130.
This establishes requirements for the reporting of comprehensive income and its components revenue, expenses, gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements.
Components of comprehensive income for the Group determined on a UK GAAP basis include profit for the financial year, pension actuarial gains and losses, and foreign currency translation gains and losses.
Information regarding the Groups foreign currency translation gains and losses is included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses under UK GAAP on page 69. b Reconciliation of profit before tax 2001 2000 2002 restated restated Years ended 30 September million million million Profit before tax in the Group profit and loss account under UK GAAP 335.3 362.2 441.8 Pensions 35.4 24.9 0.7 Post retirement medical costs 0.3 2.7 0.7 Revaluations realised on asset disposals 6.0 1.1 Write-down of previously revalued assets 21.2 Depreciation of revalued fixed assets 1.2 4.1 0.2 Amortisation of goodwill previously charged to reserves 7.2 7.9 7.9 non-amortisation on acquisitions since 30 June 2001 3.5 Share of results of joint ventures and associates 4.8 Interest rate swaps 1.9 1.9 1.8 Financial instruments 19.5 8.5 10.7 Restructuring costs 6.5 7.9 ESOPs and other shares held in trust 0.2 3.8 0.1 Other 3.4 0.1 1.7 Profit before tax under US GAAP 413.9 377.1 417.7 UK tax charge 106.2 104.6 135.2 Deferred income tax 25.6 11.3 16.8 Share of taxation in joint ventures and associates 0.6 4.6 Minority interests 26.7 27.6 25.9 Profit for the financial year under US GAAP 255.4 234.2 268.8 Represented by: Profit from continuing operations 255.4 234.2 256.3 Profit from discontinued operations 12.5 109 The BOC Group plc Report and accounts 2002 Notes to the financial statements 16.

US accounting information continued e Recently issued accounting pronouncements US GAAP The effects on the Group of recently issued accounting pronouncements are summarised below.
SFAS141 Business combinations In June 2001, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS141.
The standard prohibits the use of pooling-of-interest accounting for all acquisitions made subsequent to 30 June 2001.
The Group did not previously use the pooling-of-interest method of accounting and as a result management do not believe there will be any impact on Group results in this respect.
The standard also addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and intangible assets in business combinations, accounted for using the purchase method, that are completed after 30 June 2001.
SFAS142 Goodwill and other intangible assets In June 2001, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS142.
The standard removes the requirement to amortise goodwill, and certain other intangible fixed assets, on all acquisitions subsequent to 30 June 2001.
Annual impairment reviews will need to be carried out to assess the recoverability of such assets.
For fiscal years commencing after 15 December 2001, all existing goodwill, and certain intangible assets, will no longer be amortised.
This will require a thorough initial impairment review, followed by annual impairment reviews thereafter.
At this time, management is still assessing the impact of adopting the standard.
SFAS143 Accounting for asset retirement obligations In June 2001, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS143.
This statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognised in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.
The associated asset retirement costs are capitalised as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset.
This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after 15 June 2002.
SFAS144 Accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets In June 2001, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS144.
This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.
The statement establishes a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of and addresses implementation issues related to SFAS121.
This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after 15 December 2001.
4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FAS8 Statement No.
13 and Technical Corrections In April 2002, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS145.
This statement amends several existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions.
The statement is applicable for fiscal years beginning after 15 May 2002, although certain sections are effective for transactions occurring after 15 May 2002.
SFAS146 Accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities In June 2002, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS146.
This statement addresses financial reporting and accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities.
The statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognised when the liability is incurred, at the fair value of the liability.
This statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after 31 December 2002.
At this time, management is assessing the likely impact of adopting the standard.
f Other information Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Comparative information The adoption of FRS17 Retirement benefits has resulted in a an increase in the pension charge, within employee costs, of 73.1 million in 2001 2000: 64.2 million b an increase in exceptional employee costs of 16.7 million in 2001 2000: nil c a decrease in the net interest charge of 59.7 million in 2001 2000: 48.8 million d a decrease in the tax charge of 2.4 million in 2001 2000: increase of 1.4 million e a decrease in the profit for the year of 29.2 million in 2001 2000: 18.0 million f a decrease in the recognised gains and losses of 312.3 million in 2001 2000: increase of 95.8 million The adoption of FRS19 Deferred tax has resulted in a decrease in the tax charge of 2.6 million in 2001 2000: increase of 30.1 million and an increase in the profit for the year of 1.0 million in 2001 2000: decrease of 29.8 million.
The impact of adopting FRS17 and FRS19 on the balance sheet of the Group has been to reduce capital employed at 30 September 2001 by 12.2 million.
The impact of adopting FRS17 and FRS19 on the parent company has been to reduce profit after tax for the year ended 30 September 2001 by 4.1 million 2000: 9.5 million.
As FRS17 and FRS19 use different measurement bases than the previously adopted standards, the impact on the current year has not been quantified as it is impractical to do so.
