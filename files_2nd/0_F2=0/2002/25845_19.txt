Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31st December 2002 A SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN APPLIED CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, IS SET OUT BELOW.
Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of investments.
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP Financial statements of investment trust companies.
Valuation of investments Quoted investments are valued at middle market prices.
Where trading in the securities of an investee company is suspended, the investment is valued at the Boards estimate of its net realisable value.
Unquoted investments are valued by the Board.
In making their valuations, the Board has taken into account, where appropriate, latest dealing prices, valuations from reliable sources, asset values and other relevant factors.
Realised surpluses or deficits on the disposal of investments and permanent impairments in the value of investments are taken to capital reserve realised, and unrealised surpluses and deficits on the revaluation of investments are taken to the capital reserve unrealised.
Year-end exchange rates are used to translate the value of investments which are denominated in foreign currencies.
Income Dividends from equity shares are included in the revenue account on an ex-dividend basis.
The income from debt securities is accounted for on an accruals basis.
Where there is uncertainty over the recoverability of income, a provision is made.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in capital reserves.
Overseas dividends are accounted for gross of withholding tax.
Interest receivable on deposits is recognised in the revenue account on an accruals basis.
Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged to the revenue account except for performance related fees, which are charged to the capital reserve, and: expenses which are incidental to the acquisition of an investment are included within the cost of the investment: and expenses which are incidental to the disposal of an investment are deducted from the disposal proceeds of the investment.
expenses are charged to capital reserve realised where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
The management fee and interest expenses including applicable tax relief has been allocated 80% to capital reserve realised and 20% to the revenue account, in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income respectively, from the investment portfolio of the Company.
v. Taxation Deferred tax is recorded in accordance with FRS19 Deferred Tax.
The adoption of this standard has had no impact on current or prior year results.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable.
Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the capital reserve or in the revenue account depending on whether the gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature respectively.
Finance costs In accordance with FRS4 Capital Instruments, the US$40 million loan and the 50 million debenture are stated at the amount of net proceeds immediately after issue plus the appropriate accrued finance costs at the balance sheet date.
The finance costs on such borrowings, being the difference between the net proceeds of a borrowing and the total payments that may be required in respect of that borrowing, are allocated to periods over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying value.

Financial instruments The Companys financial instruments comprise: Investments including equity shares, with international exposure.
These are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies: Short-term debtors, creditors and cash amounts arising directly from its operations: Bank loans in US Dollar, for which the main purpose is to raise finance for the Companys operations: Derivative transactions which the Company also enters into principally an interest rate swap and forward foreign currency transactions the purpose of which is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Companys investment activities and bank loan: and Debenture issued by the Company: As an investment trust, the Company invests in securities for the long-term.
Accordingly it is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Companys policy that no short-term trading in investments or other financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments is market price risk which incorporates both foreign currency and interest rate risk.
The Boards policy for managing these risks is summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the year to which these financial statements relate 2001: same.
Market Price Risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Board meets on at least four times a year to consider inter alia, the asset allocation of the portfolio.
The manager has responsibility for monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk-reward profile.
Interest Rate Risk The Company finances its operations through bank borrowings and retained profits.
The Company borrows in the desired currencies at floating rates of interest and then uses an interest rate swap to both generate the desired interest rate profile and, to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
At the year end, the Companys borrowing was at a fixed rate after taking account of an interest rate swap.
42 JPMorgan Fleming American Notes to the Accounts continued 18.
Financial instruments continued Foreign Currency Risk The income and capital value of the Companys investments can be affected by exchange rate movements as most of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling which is the Companys reporting currency.
The Board has identified three principal areas where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affect the value of investments: Movements in rates affect short-term timing differences, and Movements in rates affect the income received.
The Company may be subject to short-term exposure to exchange rate movement, for instance where there is a difference between the date an investment purchase or sale is entered into and the date when settlement of the proceeds occurs.
When it is considered appropriate, the Company manages its exposure to foreign currency risk by hedging its US Dollar investments and US Dollar loan exposure.
Liquidity Risk The Companys assets comprise mainly realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
The material accounting policies adopted in accounting for financial instruments are disclosed on page 33.
With the exception of the note on currency exposures, the Company has excluded short-term debtors and creditors from the following analysis.
Currency Exposures An analysis of the Companys net currency assets and liabilities at 31st December 2002 is: USA Total m m Investments 363.6 363.6 Net monetary liabilities 17.1 17.1 Effect of derivative financial instruments 49.6 49.6 Total 296.9 296.9 An analysis of the Companys net currency assets and liabilities at 31st December 2001 is: USA Total m m Investments 528.1 528.1 Net monetary assets 31.4 31.4 Effect of derivative financial instruments 48.4 48.4 Total 511.1 511.1 JPMorgan Fleming American 43 Notes to the Accounts continued 18.
Financial instruments continued Interest Rate Risk Profile of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Assets The majority of the Companys financial assets are equity shares or other investments which neither pay interest nor have maturity dates.
However, the portfolio does contain certain investments which exhibit one or both of these characteristics.
Short-term debtors have been excluded from this disclosure.
The analysis of such as at 31st December is: 2002 2001 1 1 m m Fixed rate investments 2.1 2.3 1 These are US Dollar exposures which have been expressed in sterling terms.
The average period for fixed rate investments is two years 2001: one year with an interest rate on an average weighted basis of 4.68% 2001: 2.72%.
Liabilities The Company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement in relation to the $40 million loan with the Royal Bank of Scotland.
This agreement enables the interest on the loan to be paid at a fixed rate of interest.
The Company also has a 50m debenture at a fixed rate.
Details are given in note 10 and 11 on page 38.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments Financial assets and liabilities are included in the balance sheet at values which represent fair values except in respect of the items disclosed below.
The fair value of the loan, which is stated after the effect of interest rate swaps, has been calculated by estimating the breakage costs of the loan and the swap.
