Balfour Beatty plc Annual report and accounts 2002 57 22 Pensions a The Group, through trustees, operates a number of pension schemes the majority of which are of the defined benefit type and are funded.
Contributions are determined in accordance with independent actuarial advice.
The total cost to the Group was 19m 2001: 12m, of which 4m 2001: 3m related to overseas schemes.
At the date of the latest formal actuarial funding valuations of the principal defined benefit schemes, the market value of the assets of those schemes amounted to 1,744m.
The actuarial value of those assets exceeded the benefits which had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The latest formal actuarial funding valuation of the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund was carried out by independent actuaries at 31 March 2001 using the projected unit method and disclosed an excess of assets over past service liabilities of 9%.
The principal actuarial assumptions of the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund are for investment returns to exceed inflation by 4% per annum for active and deferred members and by 2.6% per annum for pensioners, widows and dependents.
The excess of cumulative amounts paid to this scheme over pension costs charged in the accounts of 6m 2001: 12m is included in debtors.
Certain Group employees are members of the Balfour Beatty Shared Cost Section of the Railways Pension Scheme.
The last formal actuarial funding valuation of this defined benefit scheme was carried out by independent actuaries as at 31 December 2001 using the projected unit method and disclosed a surplus of assets over past service liabilities of 4%.
The main assumptions used were that the rate of investment return net of inflation would be 3.7% per annum and that dividend growth on UK equities would be 3.0% per annum more than the rate of inflation.
A prepayment of 22m 2001: 26m is included in debtors.
The Groups actuaries have reviewed the funding valuations of the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund and the Balfour Beatty Shared Cost Section of the Railways Pension Scheme at 31 December 2002.
The results of these reviews confirm that the funds remain in surplus, although at significantly reduced levels.
b The Group continues to account for the cost of pensions in accordance with the requirements of SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
The following supplementary analysis is given in accordance with the transitional requirements of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The latest actuarial funding valuations of the Groups principal defined benefit schemes, the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund and the Balfour Beatty Shared Cost Section of the Railways Pension Scheme, have been updated by the actuaries to 31 December 2002 on the basis prescribed by FRS 17.
In particular, scheme liabilities have been discounted using the rate of return on a high quality corporate bond rather than the expected rate of return on the assets in the scheme used in the funding valuations.

The pension assets above take account of this by assuming that the employer will obtain future economic benefit from only a proportion of the surplus in the Balfour Beatty section of the scheme.
This proportion has been based on the distribution of the surplus which has already been agreed together with the relevant provisions of the Pension Trust and rules of the scheme regarding future surplus distribution.
Contributions paid in 2002 for the principal schemes were 4m 2001: 3m for the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund, and nil 2001: nil for the Railways Pension Scheme.
In addition, the Group has unfunded post-retirement benefit obligations in Europe and North America amounting to 16m 2001: 16m, the majority of which arrangements are closed to new entrants.
