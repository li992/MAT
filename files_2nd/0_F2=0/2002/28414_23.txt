Notes on the Achieved Profits Basis Supplementary Information 1.
Basis of Preparation of Results The achieved profits basis results include the results of the Groups long-term insurance operations on the achieved profits basis.
These results are combined with the statutory basis results of the Groups other operations including banking, unit trusts, mutual funds and other non-insurance investment management business.
The achieved profits basis results for long-term business for 2002 have been prepared in accordance with the guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers ABI in December 2001 Supplementary Reporting for long-term insurance business the achieved profits method.
The information is supplementary to the financial statements on pages 47 to 85.
Methodology The achieved profits basis results incorporate best estimate assumptions of future rates of investment return, proprietors spread in the case of Jackson National Life, policy discontinuances, mortality, expenses, expense inflation, taxation, bonus rates, surrender and paid up bases, and statutory valuation bases.
In adopting these assumptions, account has been taken of recent experience and general economic conditions, together with inherent uncertainty.
It has been assumed that the bases and rates of taxation, both direct and indirect, will not change materially in the countries in which the Group operates.
The proportion of surplus allocated to shareholders from the UK with-profits business has been based on the present level of 10%.
Future bonus rates have been set at levels which would fully utilise the assets of the with-profits fund over the lifetime of the business in force.
In the UK, Department of Social Security rebate business has been treated as single premium business.
Economic Assumptions Under the ABI guidance, for most countries, the basis for setting long-term expected rates of returns on investments and risk discount rates are set by reference to period end rates of return on fixed interest securities.
This active basis of assumption setting has been applied in preparing the results of all the Groups UK, US and European long-term business operations.
For the Groups Asian operations the active basis is appropriate for business written in Japan, Korea and US dollar denominated business written in Hong Kong.
An exception to this general rule is that for countries where long-term fixed interest markets are underdeveloped, investment return assumptions and risk discount rates should be based on an assessment of longer-term economic conditions.
Except for the countries listed above, this basis is appropriate for the Groups Asian operations.
The profit and loss account charge or credit in respect of changes in economic assumptions, which is shown as an item excluded from operating profit, as shown in note 14, reflects the effect on shareholders funds at the start of the reporting period.
The key economic assumptions are described below: 2002 2001 UK Operations Pre-tax expected long-term nominal rates of investment return: UK equities 7.0% 7.5% Overseas equities 7.0% to 7.8% 7.5 to 7.8% Property 6.75% 7.5% Gilts 4.5% 5.0% Corporate bonds 5.5% 6.0% Assets of PAC with-profits fund applying the rates listed above to the investments held by the fund 6.6% 7.1% Expected long-term rate of inflation 2.5% 2.6% Post-tax expected long-term nominal rate of return: Pension business where no tax applies 6.6% 7.1% Life business 5.7% 6.3% Risk margin included within the risk discount rate 2.6% 2.6% i Risk discount rate 7.1% 7.7% US Operations Jackson National Life Expected long-term spread between earned rate and rate credited to policyholders for single premium deferred annuity business 1.75% 1.75% US 10 year treasury bond rate at 31 December 2002 2001 3.9% 5.1% Risk margin included within the risk discount rate 3.1% 2.6% i Risk discount rate 7.0% 7.7% ii Prudential Asia Weighted pre-tax expected long-term nominal rates of investment return 7.1% 7.3% Weighted expected long-term rate of inflation 3.0% 3.0% i Weighted risk discount rate 9.6% 10.1% Prudential Europe i Risk discount rate 7.1% 7.7% i For all operations, a discount rate is applied to post-tax cash flows to determine post-tax results.
For most operations, these results are then grossed up for the effective rate of tax to derive the pre-tax results.
For Jackson National Life, pre-tax results are determined by applying the risk discount rate to pre-tax cash flows adjusted for the impact of capital charges.
ii The Prudential Asia economic assumptions shown above have been determined by weighting each countrys economic assumptions by reference to the achieved profits basis operating results for new business written in 2002 and 2001.
Investment Return i Profit before tax With the exception of fixed interest investments held by Jackson National Life, investment gains and losses during the period to the extent that changes in capital values do not directly match changes in liabilities are included in the profit for the year and shareholders funds as they arise.
In the case of Jackson National Life, it is assumed that fixed income investments will normally be held until maturity.
Therefore unrealised gains and losses on these securities are not reflected in either the achieved profits or statutory basis results and, except on realisation or impairment of investments, only income received and the amortisation of the difference between cost and maturity values are recognised to the extent attributable to shareholders.
ii Operating profit Investment returns, including investment gains, in respect of long-term insurance business are recognised in operating results at the expected long-term rate of return.
For the purposes of calculating investment return to be recognised in operating results of UK operations, where equity holdings are a significant proportion of investment portfolios, values of assets at the beginning of the reporting period are adjusted to remove the effects of short-term market volatility.
For the purposes of determining the longer-term returns, realised gains and losses arising including impairment losses on debt securities of Jackson National Life have been averaged over five years and combined with actual interest income and dividends.
For equity-related investments of Jackson National Life, a longer-term rate of return of 7.75% has been assumed.
This has been applied to the monthly average carrying value of such investments after excluding the estimated effect of short-term market movements.
Supplemental Earnings Information The Groups supplemental measure of its results and reconciliation of achieved profits basis operating profit based on longer-term investment returns before amortisation of goodwill to achieved profits basis profit on ordinary activities, including the related basic earnings per share amounts, are as follows: Before Minority Basic tax Tax Post-tax interests Net earnings m m m m m per share 2002 Based on operating profit after tax and minority interests before amortisation of goodwill 1,133 286 847 4 851 42.8p Adjustment for amortisation of goodwill 98 98 98 4.9 p Adjustment from post-tax longer-term investment returns to post-tax actual investment returns after related minority interests 1,406 447 959 5 954 48.0 p Effect of change of economic assumptions 467 181 286 286 14.4 p Profit on sale of UK general business operations 355 13 342 342 17.2p Based on loss for the financial year after minority interests 483 329 154 9 145 7.3 p 2001 Based on operating profit after tax and minority interests before amortisation of goodwill and merger break fee 1,186 370 816 12 828 41.9p Adjustment for amortisation of goodwill 95 95 95 4.8 p Adjustment from post-tax longer-term investment returns to post-tax actual investment returns after related minority interests 1,402 422 980 13 967 48.9 p Effect of change of economic assumptions 482 167 315 315 16.0 p Merger break fee, net of related expenses 338 6 332 332 16.8p Based on loss for the financial year after minority interests 455 213 242 25 217 11.0 p The average number of shares for 2002 is 1,988m 1,978m.
The adjustment from post-tax longer-term returns to post-tax actual investment returns includes investment return that is attributable to external equity investors in two investment funds managed by PPM America.
These two funds are consolidated as quasi-subsidiaries but, except to the extent of Prudential Group participation in the funds, they have no net impact on pre-tax or post-tax operating profit.
Total profit, before and after tax, incorporating the adjustment from longer-term to actual investment returns includes losses of 5m 13m attributable to the minority interests in these funds.

Cost of Capital A charge is deducted from the annual result and the balance sheet value for the cost of capital supporting solvency requirements for the Groups long-term business.
This cost is the difference between the nominal value of solvency capital and the present value, at risk discount rates, of the projected release of this capital and investment earnings on the capital.
The annual result is impacted by the movement in this cost from year to year which comprises a charge against new business profit with a partial offset for the release of capital requirements for business in force.
Where solvency capital is held within a with-profits long-term fund, the value placed on surplus assets in the fund is already discounted to reflect its release over time and no further adjustment is necessary in respect of solvency capital.
However, where business is funded directly by shareholders, principally at Jackson National Life, the solvency capital requires adjustments to reflect the cost of that capital.
In determining the cost of capital of Jackson National Life, it has been assumed that an amount equal to 200% of the risk based capital required by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners at the Company Action Level must be retained.
The impact of the related capital charge is to reduce Jackson National Lifes shareholders funds by 138m 222m.
Foreign Currency Translation Foreign currency revenue has been translated at average exchange rates for the year.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities have been translated at year end rates of exchange.

Operating Profit from Business in Force Operating profits from new business are measured using the revised economic assumptions shown in note 3 and after applying any revised operating assumptions.
The profit and loss account impact for revised operating assumptions is shown below: 2002 2001 m m UK Operations i Unwind of discount 358 384 Cost of strengthened persistency assumption 47 Change of renewal expense assumption resulting from closure of direct sales force 15 Cost of strengthened assumption for required capital for shareholder backed business 16 Experience variances and other items 7 6 304 377 Jackson National Life Unwind of discount 156 200 Return on surplus assets over target surplus 41 44 Averaged realised investment losses note 10 133 74 Experience variances against current assumptions: ii Spread 2 12 Persistency 8 7 Mortality and morbidity 2 Expenses 1 16 Loss from strengthening of operating assumptions 54 13 Other 4 16 17 136 Prudential Asia Unwind of discount 95 78 Profit arising from reorganisation of long-term funds 59 Change in operating assumptions 2002 principally Singapore mortality 42 66 Other items and experience variances 13 16 209 160 Prudential Europe Unwind of discount 9 9 Experience variances 6 9 3 0 Total 533 673 i The unwind of discount for UK long-term business operations represents the unwind of discount on the value of in force business at the beginning of the year adjusted for the effect of current year assumption changes, the expected return on smoothed surplus assets retained within the main with-profits fund see note 13, and the expected return on shareholders assets held in other UK long-term business operations.
Surplus assets retained within the main withprofits fund are smoothed for this purpose to remove the effects of short-term investment volatility.
ii The spread variance for Jackson National Life shown above has been determined after including longer-term returns on equity based investments.
This treatment is consistent with the inclusion of longer-term investment returns within operating profits.
Short-term fluctuations in investment returns, including those for equity based investments, are excluded from operating profit but included within the total profit or loss for the reporting period.
An analysis of the short-term fluctuations in investment returns is shown in note 10.

This gives rise to lower than expected year end values of variable annuity assets under management with a resulting effect on the projected value of future account values, and hence future profitability.

These have been included in the statutory basis gains averaging calculation for the years 1998 to 2002.
On the achieved profits basis deferred acquisition costs do not feature as part of the methodology.
Accordingly the realised gains and losses included in the averaging process are exclusive of the amortisation of policy acquisition costs attributable to realised gains and losses.

Taxation Charge The profit for the year is in most cases calculated initially at the post-tax level.
The post-tax profit is then grossed up for presentation purposes at the effective rates of tax applicable to the countries and periods concerned.
For Jackson National Life the profit is calculated at the pre-tax level and the effective tax rate is the rate expected to be applicable on average over the remaining lifetimes of the policies.

Results Sensitivity to Alternative Assumptions i Estimated results for 2001 based on economic assumptions applied for the 2002 results Memorandum only Estimated Estimated profit from new business pre-tax unwind of Pre-tax Tax Post-tax discount m m m m Operating profit UK Operations 227 68 159 344 Jackson National Life 195 110 85 156 Prudential Asia 219 64 155 65 Prudential Europe 8 2 6 8 Total 649 244 405 573 Jackson National Life: Before capital charge 126 Capital charge 41 After capital charge 85 Shareholders funds If the economic assumptions applied for 2002 had been in place at 31 December 2001 the achieved profits basis shareholders funds at that date would have been lower by 286m.
This represents a pre-tax loss of 467m less related tax credit of 181m.
These figures are analysed by business operation in note 14. ii Estimated impact on 2002 results based on alternative assumptions The key assumptions that affect the Groups results are economic, in particular expected rates of investment return and risk discount rates.
The sensitivity of the 2002 results to changes in these assumptions is set out below: Group Total m 2002 Pre-tax operating profit from new business Pre-tax expected long-term nominal rates of investment return: Increase in rates of 1% 103 Decrease in rates of 1% 100 Risk discount rates: Increase in rates of 1% 85 Decrease in rates of 1% 102 31 December 2002 shareholders funds Pre-tax expected long-term nominal rates of investment return: Increase in rates of 1% 750 Decrease in rates of 1% 774 Risk discount rates: Increase in rates of 1% 417 Decrease in rates of 1% 474 16.
Development Expenses Development expenses excluding Asia regional head office costs of 34m 48m were incurred in 2002 2001.
The reduction reflects reduced European development costs offset by increased development expenses arising from launch costs in Japan.
UK Re-engineering Costs Details of the re-engineering costs charged in the year are explained in note 7 on page 65.
After including amounts borne by the main with-profits fund but attributed to shareholders, the costs relating to continuing operations recognised on the achieved profits basis were 16m 57m.
Pension Costs The impact of pension costs on the achieved profits basis results of long-term business has been determined in the context of the methodology described in note 2.
Accordingly, for long-term business, the achieved profits basis value of new business written in the reporting period, and the value of in force at the balance sheet date have been determined after incorporating projections of attributable pension costs into the estimates of future cash flows for the contracts concerned.
Experience variances for expenses include any difference between the actual and assumed contributions to defined benefit pension schemes.
The achieved profits basis results and shareholders funds for long-term business are, therefore, not affected by whether or not the Group has adopted FRS 17 Retirement benefits in preparing its achieved profits basis results.
On the achieved profits basis of reporting, the impact of adoption of FRS 17 for long-term business would be limited to: i Balance sheet recognition of the FRS 17 basis net pension scheme asset or liability ii For that element of the net pensions scheme asset or liability that is attributable to the PAC with-profit fund, adjustment of the Group fund for future appropriations by an equal but opposite amount, and iii For shareholder financed long-term business, an adjustment of the composition of achieved profits basis shareholders funds between the components of the modified statutory basis shareholders funds and additional shareholders reserves reflecting the additional shareholders interest recognised on the achieved profits basis.
As explained in note 1, the achieved profits basis results include statutory basis results for operations other than those conducting long-term business.
In preparing results for these operations the Group has continued to apply SSAP 24.
Further details are shown in note 19 on pages 73 to 76 of the Groups financial statements.
