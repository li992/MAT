For 2002, the group has changed the method of accounting for deferred taxation to comply with a new UK accounting standard.
Comparative figures have been restated to reflect this change in accounting policy, and also to reflect the transfer of the solar, renewables and alternative fuels activities from Other businesses and corporate to Gas, Power and Renewables.
2 Replacement cost profit Replacement cost profits reflect the current cost of supplies.
The replacement cost profit is arrived at by excluding stock holding gains and losses from the historical cost profit.

The loss during 2001 arose principally from the sale of the groups Carbon Fibers business and the write-off of assets following the closure or exit from certain chemicals activities.
Sale of fixed assets The major part of the profit on the sale of fixed assets during 2002 arises from the divestment of the groups shareholding in Ruhrgas.
The other significant elements of the profit for the year are the gain on the redemption of certain preferred limited partnership interests BP retained following the Altura Energy common interest disposal in 2000 in exchange for BP loan notes held by the partnership, the profit on the sale of the groups interest in the Colonial pipeline in the USA and the profit on the sale of a US downstream electronic payment system.

The profit attributable to ordinary shareholders is $6,843 million $6,554 million.
The average number of shares outstanding excludes the shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plans.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders as for basic earnings per share.
However, the number of shares outstanding is adjusted to show the potential dilution if employee share options are converted into ordinary shares.
In addition to earnings per share based on the historical cost profit for the year, a further measure, based on replacement cost profit before exceptional items, is provided as it is considered that this measure gives an indication of underlying performance.
