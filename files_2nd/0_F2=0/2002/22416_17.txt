Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared on the historical cost basis of accounting, modified to include the revaluation of fixed asset investments.
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
b Valuation of fixed asset investments UK listed investments are valued according to the prices issued by the London Stock Exchange, being the closing midmarket prices for all investments other than FTSE 100 constituents and FTSE 100 reserve list constituents for which the last trade prices are used.
Unlisted investments are valued by the directors at cost unless circumstances indicate that different valuations are warranted.
c Capital gains and losses Realised and unrealised capital gains and losses, together with exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in the other capital reserves.
d Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are taken to the revenue account on an ex-dividend basis.
Income from nonequity shares is recognised on a time apportionment basis and, if material, so as to reflect the effective yield on the shares.
Income from fixed interest debt securities is recognised on a time apportionment basis and, if material, so as to reflect the effective yield on each such security.
Bank deposit interest is accounted for on an accruals basis.
e Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
In accordance with the boards expectation, over the long term, that investment returns will be attributable 70% to capital gains and 30% to income, the Company charges to capital 70% of the finance costs and management fee.
The performance fee earned for the year ended 30 June 2002 has been charged to the capital account as it was earned from capital outperformance of the benchmark index.
f Taxation The tax effect of different items of expenditure is allocated between revenue and capital using the Companys effective rate of taxation for the year.
g Deferred taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred taxation is provided using the liability method on all timing differences, calculated at the rate at which it is anticipated the timing differences will reverse.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only when, on the basis of available evidence, it is more likely than not that there will be taxable profits in the future against which the deferred tax asset can be offset.
h Financial instruments The Company has not utilised any derivative instruments in the year under review and has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under Financial Reporting Standard 13 and excluded short term debtors and creditors from disclosures under financial instruments where allowed see note 16 on pages 27 and 28.

16 Financial instruments a Management of risk The Companys financial instruments may comprise: Equity and non-equity shares and fixed interest securities that are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective as set out on page 1: Debenture stocks, preference and preferred ordinary stocks, term loans and bank overdrafts, the main purpose of which is to raise finance for the Companys operations: and Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the Companys operations.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Companys policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised overleaf.
These policies have remained constant throughout the year under review.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about the future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys operations.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
It is the boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular sector.
Stock selection is a factor which acts to reduce market risk.
The Portfolio Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the board, which meets regularly to consider investment strategy.
27 Notes to the Accounts continued 16 Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through its debenture stocks, preference and preferred ordinary stocks and term loans as well as bank overdrafts and any retained revenues arising from operations.
The Company borrows in sterling at both fixed and floating rates of interest and the board imposes borrowing limits to ensure that gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities that can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
The maturities of the Companys existing borrowings are set out in paragraph c below.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing and overdraft facilities.
b Risk profile of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets The majority of the Companys financial assets are equity shares and other investments which neither pay interest nor have a stated maturity date.
Financial liabilities The interest rate profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 30 June 2002 was: Weighted Weighted Fixed rate average Fixed rate average financial Weighted period for financial Weighted period for liabilities average which interest liabilities average which interest 000 interest rate rate is fixed 000 interest rate rate is fixed 2002 2002 2002 2001 2001 2001 Debenture stocks 46,000 9.27% 17.6 years 46,000 9.27% 18.6 years Preference and preferred ordinary stocks without a redemption date 2,086 9.10% 2,086 9.10% cccccc 48,086 48,086 mmmccc c Maturity of the Companys financial liabilities All of the Companys redeemable financial liabilities at 30 June 2002 mature in more than five years.
