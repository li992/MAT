Exceptional items continued 2002 Exceptional operating items a ITV Digital As of 27 March 2002, the date on which the ITV Digital DTT platform was put into administration, the Group had balances owed to it and unprovided for, in respect of programming licensed to ITV Digital, of 22.3 million.
On 30 April 2002, the joint administrators of ITV Digital announced the closure of pay television services on the platform and their intention to close the administration.
Accordingly, the Group made an exceptional operating provision against the whole of this balance effective 31 March 2002. b Release of analogue termination provision On 27 September 2001, the Group terminated its analogue operation.
From the original exceptional operating provision of 41.0 million, taken at 30 June 2000, 4.1 million of provision has not been utilised and has therefore been released to the profit and loss account as an exceptional credit.
Other exceptional items c Joint ventures goodwill amortisation, net The exceptional item of 971.4 million of joint ventures goodwill amortisation, net, relates to the impairment charge taken against the carrying value of the Groups interest in KirchPayTV GmbH & Co KGaA KirchPayTV of 984.9 million as at 31 December 2001, net of an amount of 13.5 million released from the provision matching the Groups share of losses for the period from 1 January 2002 to 8 February 2002, at which date the Group ceased to gross equity account for KirchPayTVs results see notes 5 and 14. d profit on sale of xed asset investments During the year, the Group sold its investments in Static 2358 Limited and Gameplay plc realising a profit on disposal of 2.3 million see note 15. e Release of provision for loss on disposal of subsidiary On 16 October 2001, the Group and Ladbrokes, the betting and gaming division of Hilton Group plc, announced that they had agreed not to pursue the proposed joint venture to offer a xed-odds betting service on Sky Sports channels and other media.
As a result, the provision for loss on disposal of the subsidiary, taken at 30 June 2001, has been written back, resulting in a non-cash exceptional profit of 10.0 million see note l below.
The Group continues to operate and develop interactive TV betting services through its wholly-owned bookmaker, Surrey Sports.
f Write down of deferred tax asset Following the impairment charge made in respect of the Groups investment in KirchPayTV at 31 December 2001 see note 14 there was insufficient evidence to support the recognition of a deferred tax asset arising on losses incurred by certain UK companies.
Accordingly, the deferred tax asset of 95.6 million was written off in full as at 31 December 2001.
Subsequent to this date 12.3 million of this amount has been written back due to the utilisation of tax losses.
The Directors ultimately expect the remaining 83.3 million to be recovered in full.
g Amounts written off xed asset investments At 31 December 2001, 60.0 million was provided against the Groups minority investments in football clubs.
2001 Exceptional operating items h Reorganisation of Sky Interactive In May 2001, the Group announced the consolidation of all of its interactive and online activities within the Sky Interactive division.
The costs of reorganisation within Sky Interactive were estimated at 23.1 million and principally comprised the cost of termination of certain contracts, the closure of duplicate sites and a reduction in headcount.
Of these costs, 7.0 million were included within xed assets, 4.0 million were included within other creditors and the remainder within provisions.
Other exceptional items i Share of joint ventures operating exceptional item In April 2001, British Interactive Broadcasting Holdings Limited BiB incurred exceptional operating costs of 16.5 million, which principally comprised the cost of the write-down of the current platform.
Of these costs, 13.1 million were included within xed assets and the remainder within provisions.
j Share of joint ventures loss on sale of xed asset investment On 31 August 2000, KirchPayTV disposed of their remaining 58 million holding of BSkyB shares.
The Groups share of the loss on disposal was 69.5 million.
The loss was calculated as the Groups share of the difference between the balance sheet value of the 58 million shares at 15.21 per share based on the value of the shares at the date of acquisition of 24% of KirchPayTV by the Group and the net proceeds realised by KirchPayTV of 10.05 per share.
k Amounts written off xed asset investments At 30 June 2001, 38.6 million was provided against the Groups minority investments in new media companies see note 15. l Provision for loss on disposal of subsidiary On 11 July 2001, the Group and Ladbrokes, the betting and gaming division of Hilton Group plc, reached agreement to form a 50:50 joint venture to develop and operate a xed-odds and pools betting business linked to Sky channels on Sky digital.
The agreement was for the Group to contribute its wholly-owned bookmaker, Surrey Sports, to the joint venture and a provision was made in the year to 30 June 2001 for the adjustment to existing goodwill which would have been necessary when Surrey Sports was transferred to the new joint venture.
This provision was subsequently reversed when the Group and Ladbrokes agreed not to pursue the proposed joint venture in October 2001 see note e above.
m Finance credit An exceptional accrual was made in June 1999 in respect of the mark-to-market of a oating-to-xed interest rate swap over 100 million of the 1,000 million revolving credit facility RCF which was no longer required when the RCF was cancelled and replaced with a 750 million RCF.
The swap was closed out in September 2000, and the remaining accrual of 2.7 million was released.

The Group considered that, by 8 February 2002, the relationship between the Group and KirchPayTV had irrevocably changed and that the Group has not exercised significant inuence since that date.
As the Group has no intention of providing any future funding to KirchPayTV and the Group, on a consolidated basis, has no financial commitments, outstanding financial liabilities or contingent liabilities in respect of KirchPayTV, an amount of 13.5 million was released from the impairment provision made at 31 December 2001, in order to match the Groups share of KirchPayTVs losses for the period from 1 January 2002 to 8 February 2002.
BiB The Group recognised 32.5% of the results of BiB up until November 2000.

These losses can be offset only against taxable profits generated in the entities concerned.
Although the Directors ultimately expect sufficient profits to arise, there is currently insufficient evidence to support recognition of a deferred tax asset relating to these losses.
The losses are available to be carried forward indefinitely under current law.
For similar reasons, estimated deferred tax assets of 63.7 million 2001: 47.7 million have not been recognised in respect of losses in the Groups German holding companies of KirchPayTV and nil 2001: 52.0 million have not been recognised in respect of the Groups share of losses of KirchPayTV.

The related obligation is recorded within creditors.
KirchPayTV As at 31 December 2001, the Directors believed that the Groups investment in KirchPayTV was impaired.
The ongoing losses experienced by KirchPayTV, the Groups concerns over the adequacy of funding in place to support KirchPayTVs business plan and the Groups evaluation of limited information it had received from KirchPayTV regarding the expected financial effects of certain strategic, operational and management decisions made by KirchPayTV, did not provide the Group with sufficient confidence that the value of KirchPayTV was able to support the carrying value of the Groups investment in KirchPayTV.
As the Group had the right to exercise a put option in respect of its stake in KirchPayTV, it considered whether the put option could be used to support the carrying value of the Groups investment in KirchPayTV as at 31 December 2001.
The put option was exercisable from 1 October 2002, or earlier in certain circumstances, if no initial public offering of KirchPayTV has occurred before then.
On exercise, Taurus Holding formerly known as Kirch Holding, KirchPayTVs largest shareholder, would be required to pay EUR 1.3 billion in cash, an amount equal to the cost of acquisition at the time the Group entered into the investment agreement, plus compound interest at 12%.
As at 31 December 2001, the Group was not able to obtain any evidence to its satisfaction that the resources of Taurus Holding would be sufficient to satisfy the put option if exercised.
Due to the lack of sufficient information from any source over the realisability of contractual payments specified by the put option, the Directors were unable to determine the amount, if any, likely to be received in the event of exercising the put option.
Given the uncertainties described above, as at 31 December 2001, the Directors considered the most appropriate accounting treatment was to write down the carrying value of its investment in KirchPayTV to nil resulting in an exceptional charge to joint ventures goodwill amortisation of 984.9 million.
By 8 February 2002, the Group considered that its relationship with KirchPayTV had irrevocably changed and that the Group has not exercised significant inuence since that date.
Therefore, the Group believed that from 8 February 2002 it was no longer appropriate to account for its interest in KirchPayTV as a joint venture, and ceased accounting for KirchPayTVs losses using the gross equity method from that date.
On 8 February 2002, the Groups investment in KirchPayTV was transferred to xed asset investments.
As the Group has no intention of providing any future funding to KirchPayTV, and the Group, on a consolidated basis, continues to have no financial commitments, outstanding financial liabilities or contingent liabilities in respect of KirchPayTV, an amount of 13.5 million was released from the provision against the carrying value of the investment made at 31 December 2001, matching the Groups share of KirchPayTVs losses for the period from 1 January 2002 to 8 February 2002.
On 8 May 2002, KirchPayTV led for insolvency.
KirchPayTV management had informed the Group that Taurus Holding, was unable to continue to make funding support available to KirchPayTV and none of the other existing shareholders, banks or new investors were willing to provide funding to KirchPayTV to avoid an insolvency ling.

Investment in joint ventures continued KirchPayTV continued On 13 May 2002, the Group exercised its put option to transfer the Groups 22% equity interest in KirchPayTV to Taurus Holding.
Taurus Holding rejected the exercise of the put as it did not consider that the conditions for exercising the put had occurred.
However, based on the information available to the Group, the Group continues to believe the put option was exercisable at that time.
On 12 June 2002 Taurus Holding led for insolvency.
The Group continues to monitor the situation carefully insofar as it relates to its interest in KirchPayTV and its put option to Taurus Holding and will continue to take such action, from time to time, as it considers appropriate in order to seek to realise value from the put option, recognising that Taurus Holding may oppose such action in the future.
The Group continues to believe that, unless the liquidity issues of Taurus Holding are adequately resolved, it is unlikely to receive a significant amount, if any amount, in respect of the put option.

In the absence to date of KirchPayTV results for the period from 1 July 2001 to 8 February 2002, the results for a similar period, the period from 1 April 2001 to 8 November 2001, have been used.
In June 2001, due to the absence of results for KirchPayTV for the year from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001, the results for a similar period, the year to 31 March 2001, were used.
The 2000 results were adjusted to include the loss from the sale by KirchPayTV, on 7 June 2000, of 20 million of its holding of BSkyB shares.
Consequently this loss has been excluded from the 2001 results.

Following the impairment charge made in respect of the Groups investment in KirchPayTV see note 14, there is insufficient evidence to support the recognition of part of the deferred tax asset previously recognised.
During the year 83.3 million was written off the asset as an exceptional item, although the Directors ultimately expect this amount to be recovered in full see note 4 f. Given recent and forecast trading, the Directors are of the opinion that the level of profits in the foreseeable future is more likely than not to be sufficient to recognise the remaining deferred tax asset.

As permitted by FRS13, short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the FRS13 disclosures, other than the currency risks disclosures.
Interest rate risks After taking into account interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts entered into by the Group, the interest rate prole of the Groups financial liabilities was: 2002 2001 Fixed Floating Total Fixed Floating Total m 1,378.2 200.2 1,578.4 1,379.9 390.2 1,770.1 Weighted average interest rate 7.7% 5.4% 7.4% 7.6% 6.3% 7.3% Weighted average period for which the rate is xed years 5.1 n a n a 5.8 n a n a Weighted average term years 5.5 2.0 5.0 6.5 3.0 5.7 Further details of interest rates on long-term borrowings are given in note 20.
In addition, cash at bank and in hand of 50.3 million 2001: 223.6 million consists mainly of sterling deposits, in bank accounts or on money markets at call.

The fair values of other borrowings are estimated by discounting the future cash ows to net present value.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments are estimated by calculating the difference between the contracted rates and the appropriate market rates prevailing at the period ends.
In addition to the financial instruments in the above fair value table, the Group had holdings in the equity share capital of other listed investments at 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2001.
See note 15 for disclosure of their book and fair values.
The difference between book value and fair value reects unrealised gains or losses inherent in the instrument, based on valuations as at 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2001.
The volatile nature of the markets means that values at any subsequent date could be signicantly different from the values reported above.

At 30 June 2002 the US dollar commitments have been translated at the year end rate of US$1.5347:1 2001: US$1.4041:1, except for US$585 million 2001: US$462m covered by forward rate contracts or other hedging instruments, where the average forward or hedged rate of US$1.3856:1 2001: US$1.4281:1 has been used.
According to the terms of certain of the movie programme rights contracts, the minimum contracted amount is subject to price escalation clauses.
The extent of the escalation, and hence of the commitments, is dependent both upon the number of subscribers to the relevant movie channel and upon the audience achieved on US theatrical release.
If subscriber numbers were to remain at 30 June 2002 levels, the commitment in respect of subscriber escalation would be some 251 million US$386 million 2001: 377 million US$529 million, and would be in addition to the gures shown above.
Certain contracts may be extended at the licensors option depending on subscriber levels to the relevant movie channel.
At 30 June 2002, the Group had outstanding forward rate contract commitments to purchase in aggregate US$920 million 2001: US$885 million at an average rate of US$1.3856:1 2001: US$1.4281:1. b Contingent liabilities The Group has contingent liabilities by virtue of its investments in unlimited companies, or partnerships, which include Nickelodeon UK, The History Channel UK, Paramount UK, QVC, National Geographic Channel UK.
The Directors do not expect any material loss to arise from the above contingent liabilities.
c Guarantees Two of the Groups subsidiary undertakings, British Sky Broadcasting Limited and Sky Subscribers Services Limited, have given joint and several guarantees in respect of the Companys obligations under 300 million and 750 million revolving credit facilities and the $650 million, $600 million, $300 million and 100 million Guaranteed Notes see note 20. d Contingent consideration BiB A further 67.5% of the issued share capital of BiB was acquired on 9 May 2001 and 28 June 2001, increasing the Groups interest to 100%.
If the valuation of BiB, based on agreed criteria, is 3 billion or greater, either at January 2003 or July 2003, an estimated further 75 million, 56 million and 122 million will be payable to HSBC, Matsushita and BT respectively through the issue of new BSkyB Ordinary Shares or loan notes.
Due to the degree of uncertainty, these amounts have not been recognised.
WAP TV On 29 May 2001 the Group acquired the 5% minority interest in WAP TV Limited for a total consideration of 5.0 million.
The consideration comprised 169,375 new BSkyB Ordinary Shares issued on 29 May 2001, contingent consideration which was satisfied by the issue of a further 169,375 new BSkyB Ordinary Shares on 30 June 2002, and contingent consideration which will be satisfied by the issue of 338,755 new BSkyB Ordinary Shares on 30 September 2003.
The contingent consideration is contingent upon the vendors remaining continuously in the employment of a member of the Group from completion until the date the deferred consideration is due.
The remaining contingent consideration has been recognised as it is considered probable that these criteria will be fullled.

Regulatory update Ofce of Fair Trading OFT The OFT announced its current investigation of the Group on 11 January 2000.
The investigation initially commenced under the Fair Trading Act 1973.
On 5 December 2000, the OFT indicated that it wished to continue its inquiry under the Competition Act, and on 17 December 2001, the OFT announced that it had issued a Rule 14 Notice to the Group and proposed to make a decision that the Group had behaved anti-competitively, infringing UK competition law.
The Group maintained that it had not infringed the Competition Act and welcomed the opportunity to put its case to the OFT.
On 18 January 2002, the Group informed the cable companies and ITV Digital that it was modifying its wholesale prices for its premium channels to be consistent with the OFTs new position on wholesale pricing set out in its Rule 14 Notice.
The modications addressed, but in no way implied acceptance of, the allegations made by the OFT against the Group in its Rule 14 Notice.
The effect of these new prices was expected to be broadly neutral on the Groups wholesale revenue.
In April and May 2002, the Group submitted written and oral representations to the OFT on its Rule 14 Notice and is now waiting for the OFT to respond.
Latest indications from the OFT are that no response is likely to be forthcoming before late summer 2002.
An adverse decision would be appealable to the Competition Commission Appeal Tribunal.
EC investigation The European Commission is in the preliminary stages of an investigation into certain agreements, decisions or practices leading to the acquisition of broadcasting rights to football events within the EEA, including the sale of exclusive broadcast rights to Premier League football by The Football Association Premier League Limited FAPL.
It is too early to assess whether the investigation will have any impact on the Groups current agreements for FAPL rights, which were notied to the European Commission on 21 June 2002 seeking either a clearance or exemption from Article 81 of the EC Treaty.
The FAPL has also notied the rules of the FAPL.
Where a company infringes the Competition Act 1998 through abusing a dominant position it may be ned up to 10% of its total UK turnover for each year it is found to be in breach, up to a maximum of three years.
If a company infringes Article 81 of the EC Treaty, it may be ned up to 10% of total annual group worldwide turnover.
In addition, third parties may be entitled to seek damages where they have suffered loss as a result of an infringement of UK or EC competition law.
