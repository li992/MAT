The directors have responsibility for ensuring that the company and the group keep accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and the group and which enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They also have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the company and the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
