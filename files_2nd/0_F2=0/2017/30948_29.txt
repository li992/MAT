Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Notes to the Group Financial Statements 1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of Preparation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union, and the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations issued and effective at the time of preparing these accounts.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the fair valuation of assets and liabilities of subsidiary companies acquired, and financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL including derivative instruments not in hedging relationships.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements reasonable knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 1.4.
Going Concern After making enquiries, the Directors are of the opinion that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months from the date of approval of its consolidated financial statements.
The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.
Further information on the Groups borrowings is given in Note 24.
Functional and Presentation Currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates the functional currency.
The functional currency of each Group company has been assessed against the underlying transactions and economic conditions in which it operates.
These financial statements are presented in euro, which is the Groups presentation currency.
All financial information presented in euro has been rounded to the nearest 100,000 except where stated otherwise.
Changes in Accounting Policy and Disclosures Changes in accounting policies and disclosures are set out below: 1.1.
New and Revised IFRS Affecting Amounts Reported in the Current Year and or Prior Years There are no amendments to standards or new standards where adoption by the Group for the first time has had a material impact on the Groups financial statements for the financial reporting year beginning 1 January 2017.
New Interpretation During September 2017, the IFRS Interpretations Committee issued an agenda decision on interest and penalties related to income taxes.
The decision refers to previous agenda decisions regarding what is an income tax and also states that any interest and penalty related to income tax should be accounted for in accordance with either IAS 12 Income taxes or IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
Following a review of the Groups uncertain tax positions and taking into consideration the comments from the agenda decision, the Group determined that 4.8m of interest payable related to the uncertain tax positions should be reclassified on the balance sheet from the current tax payable account to the interest payable account.
Therefore, the balance sheet at 31 December 2017 reflects this position.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.1.
New and Revised IFRS in Issue but not yet Effective A number of new standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, or are not yet effective because they have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
These have not been applied in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

2 Effective for the Groups 2018 financial statements, but not endorsed by the EU at 31 December 2017.
3 Effective for the Groups 2018 financial statements.
4 Effective for the Groups 2019 financial statements.
None of these is expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group except for IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 as detailed below.
TI Fluid Systems plc 76 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 issued in November 2009 was revised in July 2014 and finalised the reform of financial instruments accounting.
It will supersede IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement in its entirety.
Key requirements of IFRS 9 are: All recognised financial assets that are within the scope of IFRS 9 are to be subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value.
The impairment model reflects expected credit losses as opposed to incurred credit losses.
The types of instruments that qualify as hedging instruments are broader, and the effectiveness test has been revised and is now subject to the principle of an economic relationship.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which becomes mandatory for the Groups 2018 consolidated financial statements is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers establishes a single comprehensive model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers, and supersedes IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations.
The new standard has a single model to account for revenue.
The main implications are: A customer is a party that has contracted with the entity to obtain goods or services that are an output of the entitys ordinary activities, in exchange for consideration.
Unlike IAS 18 the recognition and measurement of interest income and dividend income from debt and equity investments are not within the scope of IFRS 15 and are instead within the scope of IFRS 9.
There is a new five-step approach to revenue recognition and measurement: - Identify the contract with the customer - Identify the performance obligations in the contract - Determine the transaction price - Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract - Recognise revenue when the entity satisfies the performance obligations.
IFRS 15 has more prescriptive guidance as to how and when revenue should be recognised.
Revenue is recognised either at a point in time or over time depending on when control transfers.
Variable consideration, such as a transaction price affected by discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives, performance bonuses, penalties and contingency arrangements, is required to satisfy specific criteria to be recognised as revenue.
Costs incurred to obtain a contract and costs to fulfil a contract may only be capitalised in certain situations.
Extensive disclosures are required to provide greater insight into both revenue that has been recognised, and revenue that is expected to be recognised in the future from existing contracts.
IFRS 15 becomes mandatory for the Groups 2018 consolidated financial statements.
Having reviewed key customer contractual frameworks, management have concluded that the new standard will have an immaterial impact on the recognition, measurement and timing of revenue, resulting in the majority of the Groups revenue continuing to be recognised at the point in time customer release orders are satisfied.
As required by the standard, the Group expects to make additional revenue related disclosures.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 Leases replaces the existing guidance in IAS 17 Leases and IFRIC 4, Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease.
IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016, and eliminates the dual accounting model for lessees.
The standard removes the accounting distinction between finance and operating leases and requires that right-of-use assets and liabilities be created for all leases on the balance sheet, unless the lease term is 12 months or less, or the underlying asset has a low value.
Under the new standard, operating lease charges will be replaced with interest payable and depreciation charges.
On an individual lease basis, this will result in higher expenses in the Income Statement earlier in the lease term, and correspondingly lower expenses later in the lease term.
It is expected that application of the standard will have a significant impact on the Group.
The full impact of future adoption is still being assessed.
IFRS 16 becomes mandatory for the Groups 2019 consolidated financial statements.
There are no other standards or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
TI Fluid Systems plc 77 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.2.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control.
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations.
The consideration transferred to the former owners of the acquiree for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred, and any equity interests issued by the Group.
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an  basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated.
Profits and losses resulting from intercompany transactions that are recognised in assets are eliminated.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
A list of subsidiaries and their countries of incorporation is presented in Note 4 of the Parent Companys financial statements.
The term Group means the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and undertakings.
Associates Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, under which the investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investors share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition.
The Groups investment in associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition.
The Groups share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the Income Statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in Other Comprehensive Income is recognised in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income, both with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment.
When the Groups share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that an investment in an associate is impaired.
If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment, which is recognised in the Income Statement, as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value.
Foreign Currency Transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are converted to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are converted using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
All transactional foreign currency differences are included in the Income Statement.
Foreign Operations Foreign operations are those subsidiaries whose functional currency is not euro.
For the purposes of consolidation, income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to euro at average exchange rates for the year, and assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to euro at exchange rates at the reporting date.
Foreign currency translation differences are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The average and year-end exchange rates for the Groups principal currencies were: 2017 2017 2016 2016 Key euro exchange rates Average Year-end Average Year-end US dollar 1.129 1.201 1.106 1.054 Chinese renminbi 7.631 7.815 7.355 7.318 South Korean won 1,276 1,282 1,281 1,272 TI Fluid Systems plc 78 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information 1.4.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements The preparation of financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates and for management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
Assumptions and accounting estimates are subject to regular review, governed by Group wide policies and controls.
Any revisions required to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the revisions are made including all future periods affected.
The areas involving critical accounting judgements or estimates which are significant to the financial information are disclosed below.
These are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period.
Critical Accounting Estimates Costs and obligations of the Groups defined benefit plans are calculated on the basis of a range of assumptions, including discount rates, inflation rates, salary growth and mortality assumptions.
Further details, including a sensitivity analysis illustrating how changes in the principal assumptions would impact the total defined benefit obligation are included in the Retirement Benefit Obligations Note.
Fair value estimates of derivatives are based on relevant market information and information about the financial instruments, which are subjective in nature.
The fair value of these financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the reporting date, which is a proxy for market price.
The Group is required to estimate income tax due in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
This requires an estimation of the current tax liability together with an assessment of the temporary differences, which arise because of differing accounting and tax treatments.
These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets or liabilities, which are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse.
The Group is subject to many different tax jurisdictions and tax rules because of its geographic spread and is subject to tax audits, which are often complex and can require several years to conclude.
Where appropriate, estimates of interest and penalties are included in these provisions for uncertain tax positions.
As amounts set aside in any year could differ from actual tax liabilities, adjustments may be required in subsequent years, which may have a material impact on the Groups Income Statement.
Costs of project engineering are capitalised as development intangible assets when there is an indication from a customer or market that costs will be recoverable from future business.
Expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour, and overhead costs that are directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use.
Estimates are used in apportioning costs that are directly attributable to each development project.
Estimates are reviewed at least annually to ensure that the recoverability of costs is reasonably certain.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised.
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
The impairment review requires estimation of the discount rate, long-term growth rate, EBITDA multiple and components of forecast cash flows.
Estimation techniques are employed in the calculation of the amount required to settle product warranty claims, restructuring and other provisions, including determining how likely it is that expenditure will be incurred.
This can be complex, especially when there is a wide range of possible outcomes.
Reference is made to contractual considerations, historical data and other relevant factors such as specific events with an underlying product.
Critical Accounting Judgements The Group is required to estimate income tax due in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
This requires an estimation of both the current tax liability, and deferred tax assets or liabilities, which arise because of differing accounting and tax treatments for temporary differences.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is based on forecast future taxable income and therefore involves the exercise of managements judgement regarding the future financial performance of particular legal entities or tax groups in which the deferred tax assets are recognised.
The Group is subject to many different tax jurisdictions and tax rules because of its geographic spread and subject to tax audits, which are often complex and can require several years to conclude.
The total accrual for income tax in any year requires the exercise of management judgement in respect of the interpretation of country specific tax law and the likelihood of challenge of uncertain tax positions and their subsequent settlement.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the tax positions are sustainable.
As amounts set aside in any year could differ from actual tax liabilities, adjustments may be required in subsequent periods, which may have a material impact on the Groups Income Statement and or cash tax payments.
Development expenditure is capitalised where the costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete the project and to use or sell the development asset.
Assumptions underlying these judgements are reviewed at least annually to ensure that the recoverability of costs is reasonably certain.
As part of the annual impairment review, judgement is required in determining the cash-generating units CGUs of the Group.
These represent the lowest level within the Group at which the non-financial assets are monitored for internal management purposes.
Judgement is required as to whether or not to apply hedge accounting to derivative financial instruments recorded in the balance sheet.
TI Fluid Systems plc 79 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.5.
Goodwill Initial measurement Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount of non-controlling interests over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured at fair value is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the Income Statement.
Subsequent measurement Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment, and an impairment loss on such an investment is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying amount of the equity accounted investee.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is subject to impairment testing which is performed annually or when an impairment trigger event occurs.
The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination which generated the goodwill.
If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU.
CGUs comprise the two operating segments each sub-divided into four geographic territories.
Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised as an expense in the Income Statement.
Impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods.
Intangible Assets Research and development Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes.
Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges.
Development expenditure, which does not meet the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset, is recognised in the Income Statement as incurred.
Computer software and licences Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Land use rights Licences for the long-term use of land are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire.
Amortisation Amortisation is recognised in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the date that they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives for the current year are as follows: Capitalised development costs 5-10 years over the life of the production cycle Computer software 3-5 years Technology 4-8 years Customer platforms 11-25 years Intangible assets that are under development are not amortised until they are brought into use.
They are reviewed for indications of impairment to ensure that expectations of future economic benefits remain valid.
Where there is any indication to the contrary, capitalisation ceases and costs are expensed.
TI Fluid Systems plc 80 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information 1.7.
Property, Plant and Equipment PP&E PP&E is stated at historical cost, which includes expenses directly attributable to bringing assets into productive use including finance charges, less accumulated depreciation.
Assets acquired as part of the acquisition of the Group are valued at fair value as part of the acquisition accounting.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.
When major components of an item of PP&E have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items.
Depreciation of PP&E is calculated using the straight-line method reflecting expected patterns of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the assets to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Freehold buildings 30-50 years Leased buildings improvements 30-50 years or the period of the lease if shorter Plant, machinery and equipment 3-12 years Depreciation is not charged on assets in the course of construction.
Once completed these are transferred to the relevant category above and depreciated accordingly.
Spare parts are not depreciated until they are brought into use but are subject to annual impairment testing.
Enhancement expenditure of PP&E items is capitalised only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of replaced parts is fide-recognised.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
Gains and losses on disposals of PP&E are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount, and are recognised net within other income in the Income Statement.
Investment grants received against the cost of acquired PP&E assets are included in payables as deferred income and credited to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the relevant assets.
Impairment of Non-Financial Assets Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at CGU level, the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have previously been impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Leased Assets Assets held under leases where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Upon initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to purchased assets of that asset type and depreciated accordingly.
Each finance lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges.
The future rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in borrowings.
The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the Income Statement over the lease period to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
TI Fluid Systems plc 81 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.10.
Financial Instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL are expensed as incurred.
Financial Assets Financial assets are classified into financial assets at FVTPL, available-for-sale, and loans and receivables.
The classification is determined at the time of initial recognition and depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets.
Financial assets at FVTPL A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term.
Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges.
Contracts are marked to market by re-measuring to fair value at the end of each reporting period.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that any financial asset is impaired because of one or more loss events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, which has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that any debtor is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in payments, the probability that any debtor will enter bankruptcy, or other financial reorganisation, and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
A financial asset is impaired and an impairment loss incurred if there is objective evidence that loss events since initial recognition of the asset have adversely affected the amount or timing of future cash flows from the asset.
Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at FVTPL or other financial liabilities.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL Financial liabilities are classified at FVTPL when they are so designated or held for trading, including derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments.
The Group enters into conventional derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risks, mostly foreign exchange forward contracts.
Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in Note 25.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently marked to market by re-measuring to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.
Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are accounted for in accordance with IAS 39 hedging requirements.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially on the date at which the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities not classified at FVTPL, including borrowings, and trade and other payables, are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, which calculates the amortised cost of a financial liability and allocates interest expense over its term.
The effective interest rate discounts estimated cash payments including all issuance discounts and transactions costs through the expected life of the financial liability, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Borrowings Borrowings, including extensions to existing agreements, are recognised initially at fair value, net of discounts and transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost.
Any difference between the net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the Income Statement over the term of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Interest arising on financial instruments is recognised on an accruals basis.
In assessing whether a debt alteration is to be treated as a modification or an extinguishment and new arrangement, an evaluation is made of the qualitative factors such as the underlying parties to the transaction and quantitative factors such as the impact on the net present value of remaining cash flows.
TI Fluid Systems plc 82 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information 1.10.3.
Hedge Accounting The Group enters into derivatives to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
Derivatives are initially recognised at their fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at each Balance Sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: Hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction cash flow hedge : Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation net investment hedge.
At the inception of a hedging transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Cash flow hedges The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and variability in cash flows relating to US dollar borrowings.
The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk arising from its borrowings, which fix the interest rate for a portion of the borrowings.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement, within finance income or expense.
When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the Income Statement within finance income or expense.
Net investment hedges Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument, relating to the effective portion of the hedge, is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the Income Statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the Income Statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.
The fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
The fair values of derivatives, which are not designated as part of a hedging relationship, are classified as current assets or liabilities.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, including an appropriate proportion of overheads, and net realisable value, on the first in first out principle.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.
Tooling that is being manufactured for an external customer or supplier is reported as an item of inventory until invoiced, and represents the gross amount recoverable from the customer in respect of costs incurred, less progress payments received.
For productive material, cost is standard cost, and for non-productive material including consumables cost is actual cost.
The standard cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads all at standard, based on normal operating conditions.
Cash discounts, trade discounts and rebates are deducted from the costs of purchase.
Other costs are included only to the extent that they are incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition.
Provision is made for slow moving and obsolete inventory.
Trade and Other Receivables Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business.
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Impairment is recognised when there is evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due under the original contractual terms.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
Share Capital Ordinary shares of the Company are classified as equity.
Costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised in equity as a deduction, net of any tax effects from the proceeds.
Trade and Other Payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers.
Accrued expenses are recognised when ownership of goods or services has been transferred but not invoiced.
Trade and other payables are recognised at amortised cost.
TI Fluid Systems plc 83 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.16.
Provisions A provision is recognised if, because of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance expense.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Product warranties A product warranty provision is recognised when specific events occur with the underlying product.
The provision is based on contractual considerations, historical warranty data and expected outcomes against their associated probabilities.
Specific claims are provided for reflecting managements best estimates of potential exposure.
Restructuring A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly.
Asset retirement obligations Provisions are recognised for the estimated costs of dismantling and removing PP&E at the end of its operational life.
Provisions for site restoration in respect of contamination and lease dilapidations are made in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Onerous contracts Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are measured and recognised as provisions.
An onerous contract exists where the unavoidable costs of meeting the contractual obligations exceed the economic benefits expected to be received.
The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing.
Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with the contract.
Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, discounts, sales taxes and volume rebates.
Revenue is recognised when adequate evidence exists, usually in the form of an executed sales agreement, that the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
The majority of the Groups revenues are derived from the supply of automotive components where the point of sale is generally ex-works from the Group.
Where consignment arrangements apply, title to the goods passes depending upon which party is exposed to the principal risks and rewards associated with ownership.
Revenue from the supply of tooling, prototypes and product development is recognised at the points of sale as specified in each contract.
Income from these activities is recognised no later than at completion of contract, except where it is evident that a loss will arise in which case the estimated loss on the contract is recognised immediately.
Other Income and Other Gains and Losses Other income includes government grants, proceeds from insurance claims, gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets and other miscellaneous items.
Other gains and losses includes net foreign exchange movements and movements in fair value on foreign exchange forward contracts.
The Groups reporting currency is the euro.
A significant portion of the Groups external borrowings are denominated in US dollars, and are largely on-lent to subsidiaries in the UK, whose functional currency is the euro.
The net foreign exchange movement represents the impact of currency movements on intercompany loans after the effect of hedging arrangements.
Employee Benefits Short-term benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
Accrued paid absence such as holiday pay entitlement is charged to the Income Statement as earned.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under bonus plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount because of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Defined contribution plans Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions to a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts in respect of past service.
TI Fluid Systems plc 84 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan provides an amount of benefit that an employee will receive at a later date, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, periods of service and compensation.
Defined benefit arrangements in the Group include funded and unfunded pension plans, post-employment healthcare, statutory termination indemnities and long service awards.
The liability recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation DBO at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.
Where the fair value of plan assets exceeds the present value of the DBO, an asset is recognised only to the extent of future economic benefits accruing to the Group either as cash refunds or as a reduction in contributions.
The service cost of providing benefits for funded plans accruing during the year and any past service costs are charged as an operating expense.
The interest cost or credit arising from the unwinding of the discount on the net actuarial liability or asset is recognised in the Income Statement as finance expense or income.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income in the year in which they arise.
The DBO is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the DBO is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related benefit obligation.
Defined benefit plans funded The Group operates funded pension plans in the US, Canada and UK.
The US plans are subject to annual actuarial review, whilst the others are formally valued at least triennially.
Assets are held in trusts and are separately administered from the Groups activities.
Assets include readily marketable equities, bonds and funds and qualifying insurance policies and are valued at fair value.
The Group makes contributions based on actuarial advice sufficient to meet the liabilities of the plans.
Defined benefit plans unfunded including healthcare The Group operates unfunded employment benefit plans in certain countries of which the most significant are post-employment healthcare in the US, a closed arrangement, and pension plans in Germany.
Other liabilities include statutory termination indemnities and long service awards.
Share-based compensation The fair value of equity settled payments to employees is determined at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the expense is recognised in the Income Statement on the straight-line basis over the period that the employees become entitled to the awards.
The credit entry relating to the awards is recorded in equity Note 7.
The Group reviews the estimate of the number of shares expected to vest at each balance sheet date.
The total amount expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, including any market performance and any non-vesting conditions, and excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions.
Non-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest.
Income Tax The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income and equity.
Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Uncertain tax positions The Group operates in many jurisdictions and is subject to tax audits which are often complex and can take several years to conclude.
Therefore, the accrual for current tax includes provisions for uncertain tax positions, which require estimates for each matter and the exercise of judgement in respect of the interpretation of tax laws and the likelihood of challenge to historic positions.
Management uses in-house tax experts, professional advisers and previous experience when assessing tax risks.
Where appropriate, estimates of interest and penalties are included in these provisions.
As amounts provided for in any year could differ from eventual tax liabilities, subsequent adjustments may arise which have a material impact on the Groups tax rate and or cash tax payments.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable profits.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which the applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
TI Fluid Systems plc 85 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Deferred tax Deferred income tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except for deferred income tax liabilities where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities, and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities, where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Exceptional Items Exceptional items are defined as those items that, by virtue of their nature, size and expected frequency, warrant separate additional disclosure in the consolidated financial statements in order to fully understand the underlying performance of the Group.
These may include the costs of closure of locations or significant headcount reduction, costs arising from the acquisition or disposal of businesses including related contractual management incentive charges, transaction costs of a significant and non-recurring nature, debt-refinancing costs including early redemption premiums on voluntary repayments of borrowings, impairment charges, share option costs prior to the initial public offering, and the recognition of previously derecognised deferred tax assets.
Dividends Receivable Dividends from associates and other investments of the Group and dividends receivable by the Company are recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Payable Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recognised in the Statement of Changes in Equity in the period in which they are approved.
Deferred Income Deferred income is recorded when consideration for goods or services provided by the Group is received before the revenue is recognised.
Segment reporting Notes to segment reporting In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the Groups segment reporting is based on the management approach with regard to segment identification: under which information regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker CODM for decision making purposes is considered decisive.
The Companys CODM is the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer.
The CODM evaluates the performance of the Companys segments primarily on the basis of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBIT, both non-IFRS measures.
Two operating segments have been identified by the Company: Fluid Carrying Systems FCS and Fuel Tank and Delivery Systems FTDS.
Fluid Carrying Systems FCS FCS products include brake and fuel lines and bundles, tank top lines, vacuum booster lines, quick connectors, air-conditioning tube and hose assemblies, accumulators and receiver dryers, coaxial or tube-in-tube assemblies, thermal products and powertrain components.
There is a high degree of vertical integration from the creation of steel strip from rolled steel, through tube manufacturing to the assembly of finished products.
Fuel Tank and Delivery Systems FTDS FTDS products include plastic fuel tanks, fuel filler pipes, fuel pumps and modules, level sensors and additive dosing systems.
These products are sold as original equipment and in the aftermarket.
Allocation of corporate costs Corporate costs comprise costs of stewardship of the Group.
Costs incurred in administrative services performed at the corporate level are allocated to divisions in line with utilisation of the services.
Where direct allocation is not possible, costs are allocated based on revenue for the year.

Financial Risk Management The Board of Directors and key management have overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management policies, which are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Groups capital structure comprising of debt Note 24 and equity Note 20 is regularly monitored to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to provide returns for shareholders and value added benefits for other stakeholders.
The overall debt structure of the Group is designed to meet the strategic objectives of the Company and its shareholders.
The level of debt is monitored on an actual and projected basis to ensure compliance with the covenants in the Groups main borrowings facilities.
The Group has exposure to the following significant risks from its activities: 3.1. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The following categories comprise the main credit exposures of the Group: Trade and other receivables Cash and cash equivalent balances Derivatives or other financial instruments The credit risk for trade and other receivables is normally managed by the operating subsidiaries by reference to credit rating agencies and historic trading experience with customers further details are available in Note 18.
Cash, which is surplus to normal working capital needs and any approved capital investments in the operating subsidiaries, is managed by Group Treasury.
The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by Group policies and managed by Group Treasury.
In most cases, the counterparties are investment grade banks.
The portfolio of derivatives is spread across six counterparties with no one dominant financial institution.
The credit ratings of the financial institutions used are Baa2 or better.
Guarantees issued by third parties comprise letters of credit and other bank guarantees, nearly all of which are of a stand-by nature.
Most of the issuing banks are rated investment grade and these ratings are monitored.
If any of these banks became unable to meet their obligations under a guarantee, it is expected that a similar guarantee could be issued by another bank or alternative security provided to the beneficiary.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due.
The Group has access to various forms of funding and these are considered sufficient to meet anticipated liquidity requirements.
The Directors believe that there is currently no significant risk that the Group will be unable to fund its planned commitments.
Cash flow forecasts of the Groups liquidity requirements are monitored regularly to ensure there is sufficient cash and undrawn committed borrowing facilities to meet operational needs of the Group over the medium term.
Surplus cash generated by the operating entities over and above balances required for normal working capital and any approved investment is managed by Group Treasury.
TI Fluid Systems plc 89 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 3.
Market Risk Market risk, is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income, expenditure or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The Group enters into derivative contracts, and incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
Foreign Currency Risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on revenue, purchases, investments and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies of individual Group entities, which are primarily euro, US dollars, Chinese renminbi and Korean won.
Where possible, business entities sell in prices denominated in the same currency as the majority of their costs, to produce a natural hedge.
At the reporting date, the majority of cash and cash equivalents in the Group were denominated in Chinese renminbi, euro and US dollars.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage much of the residual transactional currency risk.
Derivative instruments used by the Group to manage foreign currency exposure fall under the following main categories: Forward foreign exchange contracts not designated in hedge relationships The nominal value of these derivatives as at 31 December 2017 was 135.9 million 31 December 2016: 186.9 million and the aggregate fair value was 1.3 million payable 31 December 2016: 3.1 million payable.
Forward foreign exchange contracts designated in cash flow hedge relationships In October 2015, the Group entered into a series of forward foreign exchange contracts and US dollar interest rate swaps with a number of financial institutions.
In aggregate, these instruments converted a portion of the drawings under the main borrowing facilities of $400.0 million at floating interest rates into 355.0 million at a fixed interest rate of 4.2%.
The nominal value of the forward foreign exchange contracts in this arrangement as at 31 December 2017 was 616.6 million 31 December 2016: 642.3 million, and their aggregate fair value was 54.0 million payable 31 December 2016: 20.0m receivable.
A fair value loss of 66.8 million 31 December 2016: 18.4 million gain, was recorded in other comprehensive income in the year, and a 76.3 million loss 31 December 2016: 30.7 million gain was subsequently recycled to the income statement.
An ineffectiveness loss of 3.2 million 31 December 2016: 1.9 million loss was recorded in the Income Statement Note 11.
Forward foreign exchange contracts designated in net investment hedges In October 2015, the Group entered into a series of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the net investment in the Groups Korean won subsidiary.
The nominal value of these derivatives as at 31 December 2017 was KRW 265,893 million 186.2 million 31 December 2016: KRW 265,893 million 186.2 million : and their aggregate fair value was 10.0 million payable 31 December 2016: 6.9 million payable.
A fair value loss of 3.2 million 31 December 2016: loss of 0.1 million was recorded in other comprehensive income in the year for these contracts.
No amounts were recycled during the year and there was no ineffectiveness.
Sensitivity analysis The Group is primarily exposed to changes in euro KRW exchange rates on its hedging derivatives and associated net investments and euro US dollar exchange rates on its borrowings and associated hedging instruments.
The Groups exposure to a - 1% change in euro KRW exchange rate would be a 0.3 million profit 0.3 million loss arising from those euro KRW contracts that do not qualify for investment hedge accounting.
Those euro KRW contracts that qualified for hedge accounting impact equity: however, that movement would be offset by a substantially equal and opposite movement arising from the Groups exposure to the net investment in KRW subsidiaries.
The sensitivity of profit or loss to changes in the euro US dollar exchange rates arises from US dollar denominated intercompany financial instruments, which are partially offset by forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges held at the Balance Sheet date.
The profit and loss impact associated with these hedges and the related financial instrument exposure is not significant due to the application of hedge accounting.
The Groups net Income Statement exposure to euro US dollar contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting and the net unhedged intercompany loans subject to euro US dollar risk is also insignificant.
The sensitivity of the income statement to changes in the euro US dollar exchange rate has significantly reduced compared to the sensitivity at 31 December 2016, of a 3.6 million profit 3.6 million loss per 1% change in the euro US dollar exchange rate.
This is due to a large reduction in the Groups unhedged US dollar denominated intercompany loans in the year, which were partially settled from the proceeds of the issue of new share capital.
The Groups Income Statement exposure to other foreign exchange movements is not significant.
TI Fluid Systems plc 90 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information 3.3.
Interest Rate Risk Most of the Groups interest rate risk arises on its main external borrowing facilities.
The interest expense arising from the secured term loans, denominated in US dollars and euro, are based on floating rates of respectively, one month US dollar LIBOR minimum 0.75% 2.75% p. a. and three month EURIBOR minimum 0.75% 3.0% p. a.
The interest expense arising from unsecured US dollar notes has a fixed coupon of 8.75%.
On 23 January 2018, the Group met certain additional borrowings criteria which enabled it to further reduce the interest rate payable on the US term loan by 0.25% p. a. to US$ LIBOR minimum 0.75% p. a.
2.5% p. a. and the euro term loan by 0.25% p. a. to EURIBOR minimum 0.75% p. a.
2.75% p. a. both effective from 30 December 2017.
Interest rate swaps As noted above, the Group has used interest rate swaps to manage the risk and used such contracts, together with the forward foreign exchange contracts to fix in 355.0 million of debt at 4.2%.
The notional value of the interest rate swaps as at 31 December 2017 was $400.0 million 31 December 2016: $400.0 million and their fair value was 7.0 million receivable 31 December 2016: 5.2 million receivable.
In aggregate, a fair value gain of 1.9 million 31 December 2016: 1.9 million loss has been recorded in other comprehensive income during the year and a 0.7 million loss 31 December 2016: 2.9 million loss was subsequently recycled to the income statement.
No ineffectiveness was recorded in the income statement.
Interest rate floors The aggregate fair value of these derivatives as at 31 December 2017 was 3.9 million payable 31 December 2016: 4.5 million payable.
Sensitivity analysis If interest rates had been 100 bps higher or lower with all other variables held constant, after taking account of hedging arrangements, the pre-tax profit or loss on an annual basis would be respectively, 3.7 million lower, or 3.0 million higher.
There would be no significant impact on equity.

Share-based Compensation The Omega Holdco II Ltd 2015 Equity Incentive Plan the Plan was adopted on 30 June 2015 under which the Company granted options over its shares to selected key executives of the Group.
The contractual life of an option is 10 years.
The options are split equally between those with time-based vesting features and those with both time-based and performance-based vesting features.
Time-based options have a five-year vesting period with 20% of the options vesting on the first anniversary of a grant made under the Plan and 1.6667% monthly thereafter.
Performance-based options have the same vesting period as time-based options, subject to certain performance conditions occurring such that the sponsor, the funds managed by Bain Capital affiliates of and funds advised by Bain Capital LLC achieves two times cash proceeds relative to its equity investment, provided that such return is measurable in cash or marketable securities.
Exercise of an option is subject to certain employment and other related conditions.
Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
At the start of the year total share options outstanding were 35,495,935.
During the year 2,667,097 were granted and 980,550 forfeited up to the Initial Public Offering the IPO.
Prior to the IPO, the Plan was cancelled by form of an agreement with all option holders.
At cancellation option holders were compensated by a mix of shares issued or replacement awards in the form of Restricted Stock Awards RSA or Restricted Stock Units RSU.
A total of 2,623,412 RSAs and 1,054,838 RSUs were granted and outstanding at the end of the year and represent the only remaining element of the share incentive scheme.
These replacement awards will vest in 50% equal allocations on 1 December 2018 and 1 December 2019, subject to the participants continued employment with the Company through the applicable vesting date.
In accordance with IFRS 2, the Replacement Awards have been Fair Valued at date of replacement and compared to the Fair Value of the Plan options on cancellation.
No incremental additional charge was required.
The remaining share option cost will be charged over the vesting period of the Replacement Awards.
The total charge for the year for share option awards was 11.3 million 2016: 7.4 million.
This included an accelerated cost 5.9 million on the cancellation of the Plan.
All share option costs, including accelerated costs, up to the point of IPO are included in exceptional administrative expenses Note 9, post IPO share option costs are treated as an operating expense.

The exceptional net finance expense relates to voluntary repayments of borrowings and comprises an early redemption premium of 17.7 million and the expense of unamortised issuance discounts and fees of 8.7 million see Note 24.4.
As a result of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Group recognised 25.4 million of exceptional deferred tax benefit in the Income Statement and 15.0 million of exceptional deferred tax charge in the Statement of Comprehensive Income to reflect the new US corporate tax rate of 21% and other tax reform changes, offset by 0.6 million of one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings.

Factors that may affect future tax charges include the continued non-recognition of deferred tax assets in certain territories as well as the existence of tax losses in certain territories which could be available to offset future taxable income in certain territories and for which no deferred tax asset is currently recognised.

Following a review of the Groups uncertain tax positions and taking into consideration the comments from the agenda decision, the Group determined that 4.8 million of interest payable related to the uncertain tax positions should be reclassified on the balance sheet from the current tax payable account to the interest payable account.
Uncertain tax positions The Group maintains a provision for uncertain tax positions.
At 31 December 2017, the balance stands at 44.1 million after reclassification of 4.8 million of interest payable 2016: 53.6 million.
As each uncertain tax provision is considered more likely than not to materialise, settlement of the issues that have been provided should not result in a material impact to the effective tax rate.
In the event that a favourable unfavourable conclusion is reached on an uncertain tax position, this would have a favourable unfavourable impact on the Groups effective tax rate.

Unrecognised Deferred Tax Assets Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
At 31 December 2017, the Group did not recognise deferred income tax assets net of specific tax provisions of 113.2 million 31 December 2016: 115.8 million.
This is principally represented by gross tax losses in respect of which no deferred income tax asset was recognised before the netting of specific provisions amounting to 549.8 million 31 December 2016: 560.3 million that can be carried forward against future taxable income.
All tax losses referred to above can be carried forward without time limitation UK, Brazil and Australia.

Impairment Tests for Goodwill and Intangibles The purchase of TIFS Holdings Ltd TIFSHL on 30 June 2015, which was the previous Parent Company of the Group, and the consequent fair valuation of assets and liabilities, resulted in total goodwill recognition of 711.1 million and intangibles of 663.2 million.
The purchase of Millennium Industries Corporation on 16 February 2016 resulted in total goodwill recognition of 57.1 million and intangibles of 72.6 million see Note 29.
Goodwill and intangibles are monitored by management at the operating division level and then the geographic sub-division level.
Goodwill and intangibles amount to 665.5 million and 351.5 million respectively for FCS 31 December 2016: 706.4 million and 439.2 million, and 59.4 million and 197.6 million respectively for FTDS 31 December 2016: 60.8 million and 206.4 million.
The geographic split by cash-generating unit CGU of goodwill within FCS is: Asia Pacific 237.9 million 31 December 2016: 249.5 million, North America 209.2 million 31 December 2016: 238.5 million and Europe 218.4 million 31 December 2016: 218.4 million.
Goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite useful life.
It is currently carried at cost and reviewed annually for impairment.
Intangibles assets are amortised over their useful economic life, which range from 3 to 25 years.
The annual impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the non-financial assets of a business or CGU to their recoverable amount.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
During the year, the non-financial assets of the Group were tested for impairment, with all CGUs demonstrating a recoverable amount in excess of their carrying value and therefore no impairment charge has been recorded.
The recoverable amount for the CGUs has been determined based on a value in use calculation.
These calculations use post tax cash flow projections from financial plans approved by the Board, covering a five-year period, plus a terminal value.
The range of discount and growth rates used were as follows: Range of rates % 2017 2016 Discount rates FCS 11.7520.25% 11.0021.00% FTDS 12.0019.25% 11.5018.00% Long-term growth rates FCS 2.508.00% 2.508.00% FTDS 2.506.00% 2.506.00% For FCS Latin America, management also estimated the carrying value under the fair value less costs of disposal model, using industry bench-marked EBITDA multiples.
The Group believes that any reasonably probable change in the assumptions would not cause the carrying value of non-financial assets within the respective CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.

TI Fluid Systems plc 110 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Fair values of financial instruments have been determined by reference to a hierarchy defined as follows: Level 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
All derivative items reported are within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy specified in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: their measurement includes inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
The fair values of non-derivative amounts are determined in accordance with generally accepted valuation techniques based on discounted cash flow analysis.
For the non-derivative items reported above, it is assumed that by their nature their carrying value approximates their fair value, with the exception of unsecured notes included within borrowings.
At 31 December 2017, the borrowings figures above include unsecured notes carried at a book value of 183.6 million before deduction of issuance discounts and fees.
The fair value of these notes excluding deduction of issuance discounts and fees is 196.0 million at 31 December 2017 2016: book value of 427.1 million and fair value of 448.5 million.

Defined Benefit Arrangements Pension plans The Group operates funded defined benefit pension plans in the US, Canada and the UK under broadly similar regulatory frameworks.
All of the plans provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of pensions provided is determined by members length of service and, for most of these plans, pensionable remuneration.
Plan assets are held in trusts from which all benefit payments are made.
The plans are governed by local regulations and practice, including the nature of the relationship between their trustees and the Group.
Responsibility for governance of the plans, including investment strategy and schedules of contributions, rests primarily with the trustees, some of whom who are appointed by the Group and the remainder by the members in accordance with the rules of each plan.
There are five plans in the US, four of which are closed to both new entrants and future accrual, and one of which is closed to new entrants but permit future accrual.
The active members are not required to make contributions to the plans.
Pensions in payment are not subject to inflationary increase.
The plan in Canada remains open to new entrants, and is contributory.
Pensions in payment are subject to discretionary inflationary increase.
The UK plan is closed to new entrants but remains open to future accrual.
Pensions in payment are subject to annual increase based on the UK Retail Price Index.
Independent accounting valuations of all major defined benefit scheme assets and liabilities were carried out as at 31 December 2017.
The US pension plans are subject to annual actuarial valuation, and were most recently valued by independent qualified actuaries as at 1 January 2017.
The Canadian plan is subject to actuarial valuation at least triennially, and was most recently formally valued as at 1 July 2017.
The UK plan is subject to triennial actuarial valuation, and was most recently formally valued as at 6 April 2015.
Employer funding contributions to the US and other pension plans are agreed at each formal valuation, and for the year ended 31 December 2017 totalled 5.1 million 31 December 2016: 2.7 million.

Principal Assumptions The principal assumptions in measuring plan liabilities are as follows: US Pensions 2017 2016 Discount rate 3.56% 4.02% Mortality assumptions: life expectancy from age 65 Retiring at the end of the current reporting year: Males 22 21 Females 23 23 Retiring 20 years after the end of the current reporting year: Males 23 23 Females 24 24 For US Pensions, assumptions with regard to life expectancies from retirement at age 65 are based on RP-2014 collarand genderspecific mortality tables, adjusted and generationally projected by a modified MP-2017 improvement scale.
Other pensions 2017 2016 Discount rate 2.70% 3.08% Inflation rate 2.90% 3.16% Salary increases 2.96% 3.34% Benefit increases 2.32% 2.62% Mortality assumptions for other pensions: life expectancy from age 65 Retiring at the end of the current reporting year: Males 22 22 Females 24 24 Retiring 20 years after the end of the current reporting year: Males 22 23 Females 25 25 US healthcare 2017 2016 Discount rate 3.50% 3.95% Healthcare cost trend: Initial rate 6.25% 6.50% Other post-employment liabilities 2017 2016 Discount rate 2.10% 2.03% Inflation rate 1.29% 1.56% Salary increases 2.44% 2.50% Benefit increases 1.96% 1.90% Changes in the principal assumptions would decrease increase the total defined benefit obligation DBO as follows: 2017 2016 Change in Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Decrease increase in DBO assumption m m m m Discount rate 0.5% 30.2 34.7 30.1 34.5 Inflation rate 0.5% 8.2 7.6 7.4 7.4 Salary growth rate 0.5% 2.5 2.3 2.1 1.9 Life expectancy 1 year 15.0 15.0 15.6 15.5 Healthcare cost trend: Initial rate 0.5% 3.0 2.7 4.2 3.7 The sensitivity analysis above illustrates the change in each major assumption whilst holding all others constant.
The methods of calculating the defined benefit obligation for this purpose are the same as used for calculating the end of year position.
