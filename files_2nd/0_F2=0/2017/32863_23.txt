It is a non-cellular company limited by shares and has been declared by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission to be a registered closed-ended collective investment scheme.
On 20 April 2011, the Company was admitted to the Official List of the U. K. Listing Authority with a premium listing trading on the Main Market of the LSE.

The Sterling C Shares issued on 21 March 2013 were converted into 360,521,605 Sterling Ordinary Shares on 16 July 2013 and the Sterling C Shares issued on 24 October 2013 were converted into 421,103,481 Sterling Ordinary Shares on 21 January 2014.
At the AGM of the Company held in June 2017, the Directors were granted the general authority to purchase in the market up to 14.99% of the Ordinary Shares of each class in issue as at 14 June 2017.
This authority will expire at the next AGM in 2018.
Pursuant to this authority, and subject to the Law and the discretion of the Directors, the Company may purchase shares of any of its classes in the market on an on-going basis with a view to addressing any imbalance between the supply of and demand for such shares, thereby increasing the NAV per share of the shares and assisting in managing the discount to NAV per share of the shares in relation to the price at which the shares of such class may be trading.
As required under Article 51 of the Company s Articles of Incorporation, an Extraordinary General Meeting EGM was convened on 5 April 2017, being the sixth anniversary of the IPO admission date, to propose an ordinary resolution that the Company continues its business as a closed-ended investment company, which was duly passed.
From 2018, a continuation vote will be proposed annually at the AGM.
The Companys investment objective is to provide its shareholders with regular dividends, at levels that are sustainable, whilst preserving the capital value of its investment portfolio, utilising the investment skills of the Investment Manager to pursue its investment objective.
The Company invests mainly in floating rate senior secured loans issued in U.
Dollars, Sterling and Euros by primarily North American and European Union corporations, partnerships and other business issuers.
These loans will at the time of investment often be non-investment grade.
The Company considers debt instruments to be non-investment grade if, at the time of investment, they are rated below the four highest categories AAA, AA, A and BAA by at least two independent credit rating agencies or, if unrated, are deemed by the Investment Manager to be of comparable quality.
For the purposes of efficient portfolio management, the Company has established a wholly-owned Luxembourg incorporated subsidiary, NB Global Floating Rate Income Fund Lux 1 S. a. r. l. which in turn holds a wholly-owned subsidiary, NB Global Floating Rate Income Fund Lux 2 S. a. r. l. All references to the Company in this document refer to the Company and its wholly owned Luxembourg subsidiaries.
The directors of these companies are unrelated to the Directors of the Company.
A representative of the Investment Manager was appointed as a director of NB Global Floating Rate Income Fund Lux 1 S. a. r. l. and NB Global Floating Rate Income Fund Lux 2 S. a. r. l. in January 2018.
The Companys share capital is denominated in Pound Sterling and U. S. Dollars and consists of Pound Sterling Ordinary Shares and U. S. Dollar Ordinary Shares as at 31 December 2017.
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been presented on a going concern basis and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP.
The Company is regarded as an Investment Company and it follows the accounting and reporting requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards FASB Codification ASC Topic946 ASC946.
The Board believes that the underlying assumptions are appropriate and that the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements therefore present a true and fair financial position.
The Directors have undertaken a rigorous review of the Companys ability to continue as a going concern including reviewing the on-going cash flows and the level of cash balances as of the reporting date as well as taking into consideration the continuation vote on page 16.
After making enquiries of the Investment Manager and the Sub-Administrator, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least one year from the date these financial statements were signed.
Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt a going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.
61 | B GLOBAL FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND LIMITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2017 NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued Basis of consolidation The Financial Statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary undertakings as at 31 December 2017.
The subsidiaries are NB Global Floating Rate Income Fund Lux 1 S. a. r. l. which in turn holds a wholly-owned subsidiary, NB Global Floating Rate Income Fund Lux 2 S. a. r. l. The Company and all its wholly owned subsidiaries have US Dollars as their functional and reporting currency.
The results of the subsidiary undertakings are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full.
a Use of estimates The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with US GAAP requires that the Directors make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Such estimates and associated assumptions are generally based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and form the basis of making the judgments about attributing values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may vary from such accounting estimates in amounts that may have a material impact on the financial information of the Company.
b Revenue recognition Interest earned on debt instruments is accounted for net of applicable withholding taxes and is recognised as income over the terms of the loans.
Discounts received or premiums paid in connection with the acquisition of loans are amortised into interest income using the effective interest method over the contractual life of the related loan.
If a loan pays off prior to maturity, the recognition of the fees and costs is accelerated as appropriate.
The Company raises a provision when the collection of interest is deemed doubtful.
c Cash and cash equivalents The Company s cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than 90 days that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near maturity that they represent insignificant risk of changes in value.
d Foreign Currency translation Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than U. S. Dollars are translated into U. S. Dollar equivalents using spot rates as at the reporting year end date.
On initial recognition, a foreign currency transaction is recorded and translated at the spot exchange rate at the transaction date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the historic exchange rate.
There were no non-monetary assets held during the year.
Transactions during the year, including purchases and sales of securities, income and expenses, are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction.
The rates of exchange against U. S. Dollars at 31 December 2017 were 1.35275 USD: 1GBP and 1.20080 USD: 1 EUR 31 December 2016 were 1.23565 USD: 1GBP and 1.05475 USD: 1EUR.
e Fair Value of Financial Instruments and derivatives A financial instrument is defined by FASB ASC 825, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, as cash, evidence of an ownership interest in an entity, or a contract that creates a contractual obligation or right to deliver to or receive cash or another financial instrument from a second entity on potentially favourable terms.
Fair value estimates are made at a discrete point in time, based on relevant market data, information about the financial instruments, and other factors.
Fair value was determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
Estimates of fair value of financial instruments without quoted market prices are subjective in nature and involve various assumptions and estimates that are matters of judgment.
Accordingly, fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts realised on disposition of financial instruments.
The use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on estimated fair value amounts.
The following estimates and assumptions were used at 31 December 2017 to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments: - Valuation of financial investments - The loans and bonds are valued at bid price.
The Investment Manager believes that bid price is the best estimate of fair value and is in line with the valuation policy adopted by the Company.
Equity investments are carried at fair value as determined by the Investment Manager.
- Cash and cash equivalents - The net realisable value is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
- Receivables for investments sold - The net realisable value reasonably approximates fair value as they reflect the value at which investments are sold to a willing buyer and settlement period on their balances is short term.
Interest receivables - The net realisable value reasonably approximates fair value.
62 | NB GLOBAL FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND LIMITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements For the ear ended 31 December 2017 NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT CCOUNTING POLICIES Continue e Fair Value of Financial Instruments and derivatives Continued - Other receivables - The net realisable value reasonably approximates fair value, - Derivatives - The Company estimates fair values of derivatives based on the latest available forward exchange rates.
- Payables for investments purchased - The net realisable value reasonably approximates fair value as they reflect the value at which investments are purchased from a willing seller and settlement period on their balances is short term.
Payables to the Investment Manager and affiliates - The net realisable value reasonably approximate fair value.
- Accrued expenses and other liabilities - The net realisable value reasonably approximates fair value.
A fair value hierarchy that prioritises the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value is established under FASB ASC Topic 820.
The objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price.
Accordingly, the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to valuations based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to valuations based upon unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation Level 3.
The levels of the fair value hierarchy under FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35-39 to 55 are as follows: The guidance establishes three levels of the fair value hierarchy as follows: Level 1: Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date.
Level 2: Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies.
Level 3: Pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment.
The inputs used in the determination of the fair value require significant management judgement or estimation.
The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.
The following table details the Company s financial instruments that were accounted for at fair value as at 31 December 2017.
These arose due to the repricing and restructuring of certain investments during the year.
These have also been excluded from the sales and purchases in the cash flow statement on page 60.

All derivative trades have an enforceable master netting agreement so the net amount based on this is the same as the net amount disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
As at 31 December 2017, there were two counterparties for the forward contracts 31 December 2016: two.
Due to changes in observable inputs, the Company transferred securities from Level 2 to Level 3 and from Level 3 to Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Level 3 assets are valued using single broker quotes.
The following table presents the impact of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statement of Operations in conformity with US GAAP.

There is no collateral for forward contracts.
The Company presents the gain or loss on derivatives in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
The Company uses independent third party vendors to price its portfolio.
As part of its valuation process, the AIFM evaluates the number of broker quotes that combine to make up the valuation provided by these vendors and if it believes that the number of broker quotes is not sufficient to ensure a Level 2 price it designates those positions Level 3.
As at 31 December 2017 the AIFM designated 9 31 December 2016: 16 of its floating rate senior secured loans at Level 3.
With respect to the Equity position, the Investment Manager s Investment Committee has derived the fair value, based on comparison of similar industries, designating the position as Level 3.
64 | NB GLOBAL FLOATING R TE INCOME FUND LIMITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS I Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2017 NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICA T ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued e Fair Value of Financial Instruments and derivatives continued The net realised and unrealised gain loss on investments shown in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended 31 December 2017 by type of investment is as follows: FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 EXPRESSED IN U. S. DOLLARS Realised gain on investments 15,023,739 Realised loss in investments 12,256,512 2,767,227 Realised gain on derivatives 119,635,688 Realised loss on derivatives 34,265,774 83,369,914 Unrealised gain on investments 30,263,399 Unrealised loss on investments 18,841,153 11,422,246 Unrealised gain on derivatives 21,924,956 Unrealised loss on derivatives 20,023,258 1,901,698 Realised and unrealised gain on foreign currency transactions 4,371,208 Realised and unrealised loss on foreign currency transactions 3,258,605 1,112,603 f Investment Transactions, Investment Income, Expenses and Valuation All investment transactions are recorded on a trade date basis.
Upon sale or maturity, the difference between the consideration received and the cost of the investment is recognised as a realised gain or loss.
"The cost is determined based on the first in, first out FIFO"" cost method."
Operating expenses are recognised on an accruals basis.
Operating expenses include amounts directly or indirectly incurred by the Company as part of its operations.
Any costs incurred by a share buyback and by a re-issue of shares held in treasury will be charged to that share class.
The Company carries investments on its Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities at fair value in accordance with US GAAP, with changes in fair value recognised within the Consolidated Statement of Operations in each reporting period.
Quoted investments are valued according to their bid price as at the close of the relevant reporting date.
Investments in private securities are priced at the bid price using a pricing service for private loans.
Asset backed securities are valued according to their bid price.
If a price cannot be ascertained from the above sources, the Company will seek bid prices from third party broker dealer quotes for the investments.
In cases where no third party price is available, or where the Investment Manager determines that the provided price is not an accurate representation of the fair value of the investment, the Investment Manager determines the valuation based on the Investment Manager s fair valuation policy.
The overall criterion for fair value is a price at which the securities involved would change hands in a transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under compulsion to buy or sell and both having the same knowledge of the relevant facts.
Consistent with the above criterion, the following criteria are considered when applicable: Valuation of other securities by the same issuer for which market quotations are available: Reasons for absence of market quotations: The credit quality of the issuer and the related economics: Recent sales prices and or bid and ask quotations for the security: Value of similar securities of issuers in the same or similar industries for which market quotations are available: Economic outlook of the industry: issuer s position in the industry: The financial information of the issuer: and The nature and duration of any restriction on disposition of the security.
65 | NB GLOBAL FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND LIMITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2017 NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOU TING POLICIES Continued g Derivative Contracts The Company may, from time to time, hold derivative financial instruments for the purposes of hedging foreign currency exposure.
These derivatives are measured at fair value in accordance with US GAAP, with changes in fair value recognised within the Consolidated Statement of Operations in each reporting period.
Depending on the product and the terms of the transaction, the fair value of the over the counter OTC derivative products, such as foreign exchange contracts, can be modelled taking into account the counterparties credit worthiness and using a series of techniques, including simulation models.
Many pricing models do not entail material subjectivity because the methodologies employed do not necessitate significant judgments and the pricing inputs are observed from actively quoted markets.
The forward exchange contracts valued by the Company using pricing models fall into this category and are categorised within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
As shares are denominated in U. S. Dollars and Pound Sterling and investments are denominated in U. S. Dollars, Euro or Sterling holders of any class of shares are subject to foreign currency fluctuations between the currency in which such shares are denominated and the currency of the investments made by the Company.
Consequently, the Investment Manager seeks to engage in currency hedging between the U. S. Dollar and any other currency in which the assets of the Company or a class of shares is denominated, subject to suitable hedging contracts such as forward currency exchange contracts being available in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to the Investment Manager, in their sole and absolute discretion.
Note 2 e details the gross and net derivative asset and liability position by contract type and the amount for those derivative contracts for which netting is permissible under US GAAP.
The derivative assets and liabilities have been netted where an enforceable master netting arrangement is in place h Taxation The Company is exempt from Guernsey tax on income derived from non-Guernsey sources.
However, certain of its underlying investments may generate income that is subject to tax in other jurisdictions, principally in the United States.
The Company files tax returns for its Luxembourg entities.
In accordance with US GAAP, management is required to determine whether a tax position of the Company is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
The tax benefit to be recognised is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has 50% or higher chance of being realised upon ultimate settlement.
fide-recognition of a tax benefit previously recognised could result in the Company recording a tax liability that would reduce net assets.
This policy also provides guidance on thresholds, measurement, fide-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in periods, disclosure, and transition that intends to provide better financial statement comparability among different entities.
As of 31 December 2017, the Company has recorded no liability for net unrecognised tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions it has taken or expects to take in future tax returns 31 December 2016: Nil.

NOTE4-RISK FACTORS Market Risk Market risk is the potential for changes in the value of investments.
Market risk includes interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk.
Interest rate risk primarily results from exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of the yield curve, the volatility of interest rates and credit spreads.
Floating rate investments, such as senior secured loans, typically receive a fixed coupon, which is linked to a variable base rate, usually LIBOR or EURIBOR.
As such, income earned will be affected by changes in the variable component albeit downward moves are likely to be capped by the LIBOR EURIBOR floors that are prevalent in the majority of transactions.
The Company invests predominantly in floating rate investments: however, it does have some exposure to fixed rate investments, which are subject to interest rate risk through movements in their market price when interest rates change.
Price Risk Price Risk is the risk that the price of the security will fall.
The Investment Manager manages the exposure to price risk by diversifying the portfolio.
Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign Exchange Risk arises from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to Sterling and Euro investments and share issue proceeds.
The Company makes use of hedging techniques, as part of its risk management strategy, including but not limited to the use of forward exchange contracts to mitigate its exposure to this risk.
These instruments involve market risk, credit risk, or both kinds of risks.
Risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and from movement in currency and interest rates.
Credit Risk The Company maintains positions in a variety of securities, derivative financial instruments and cash and cash equivalents in accordance with its investment strategy and guidelines.
"The Company s trading activities expose the Company to counterparty credit risk from brokers, dealers and other financial institutions collectively, ""counterparties with which it transacts business."
Counterparty credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a trade will fail to meet an obligation that it has entered into with the Company, resulting in a financial loss to the Company.
The Company s policy with respect to counterparty credit risk is to minimize its exposure to counterparties with perceived higher risk of default by dealing only with counterparties that meet the credit standards set out by the Investment Manager.
All the Company's assets other than derivative financial instruments were held by the Custodian.
The Custodian segregates the assets of the Company from the Custodians assets and other Custodian clients.
The Investment Manager believes the risk is low with respect to any losses as a result of this concentration.
The Company conducts its trading activities with respect to non-derivative positions with a number of counterparties.
Counterparty credit risk borne by these transactions is mitigated by trading with multiple counterparties.
"In addition, the Company trades in over-the-counter ""OTC derivative instruments."
The Company is subject to counterparty credit risk related to the potential inability of counterparties to these derivative transactions to perform their obligations to the Company.
The Companys exposure to counterparty credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance is generally limited to the fair value derivative assets and liabilities of OTC derivatives reported as net assets, net of collateral received or paid, pursuant to agreements with each counterparty.
The Investment Manager attempts to reduce the counterparty credit risk of the Company by establishing certain credit terms in its ISDA Master Agreements with netting terms with counterparties, and through credit policies and monitoring procedures.
Under ISDA Master Agreements in certain circumstances e. g, when a credit event such as a default occurs all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is due or payable in settlement of all transactions.
The Company receives and gives collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities and it is subject to the ISDA Master Agreement Credit Support Annex.
This means that securities received given as collateral can be pledged or sold during the term of the transaction.
The terms also give each party the right to terminate the related transactions on the other partys failure to post collateral.
The Company may invest in a range of bank debt investments and corporate and other bonds.
Until such investments are sold or are paid in full at maturity, the Company is exposed to issuer credit risk, relating to whether the issuer will make interest and or principal payments on their debt obligations.
Geographic Concentration Risk The Company may invest a relatively large percentage of its assets in issuers located in a single country, a small number of countries, or a particular geographic region.
As a result, the Companys performance may be closely aligned with the market, currency or economic, political or regulatory conditions and developments in those countries or that region, and could be more volatile than the performance of more geographically diversified investments.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its obligations as and when these fall due.
Liquidity risk is managed by the Investment Manager to ensure that the Company maintains sufficient working capital in cash or near cash form so as to be able to meet the Companys ongoing requirements as they fall due.
68 | NB GLOBAL FLOATING R TE INCOME FUND LIMITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2017 NOTE 4- RISK FACTORS continued Participation Commitments With respect to the senior loans the Company may: 1 invest in assignments: 2 act as a participant in primary lending syndicates: or 3 invest in participations, if a Company purchases a participation of a senior loan interest, the Company would typically enter into a contractual agreement with the lender or other third party selling the participation, rather than directly with the borrower.
As such, the Company not only assumes the credit risk of the borrower, but also that of the selling participant or other persons inter positioned between the Company and the borrower.
As of 31 December 2017, there were no such outstanding participation commitments in the Company.
Other Risks Legal, tax and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Company that may adversely affect the Company.
The regulatory environment for alternative investment companies is evolving, and changes in the regulation of investment companies may adversely affect the value of investments held by the Company or the ability of the Company to pursue its trading strategies.
The effect of any future regulatory change on the Company could be substantial and adverse.
The Board has considered the specific risks faced by the Company as a result of Brexit.
At the portfolio level, the Board expects the impact of Brexit to be limited given the hedging arrangements in place and the robust investment process the Investment Manager has always adopted and its positioning in better rated, performing issuers.
At the Company level the impact could be felt more directly through volatility of the Company s share price.
The Board seeks to mitigate this risk by continuing to address any imbalances in supply and demand of the Company s shares through the use of further share buybacks in line with its stated policy.
