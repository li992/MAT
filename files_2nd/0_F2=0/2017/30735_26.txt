d. Capitalisation of development costs The Group undertakes significant levels of development work which is largely expensed to the Income Statement.

If these tests were met, further costs would be capitalised as an intangible asset until the intangible asset was readily available for use and would then be amortised.

The changes to impairment and hedge accounting will not have a material impact on the results of the Group.
The valuation of the Parent Companys minority shareholdings in two Air Tanker companies as detailed in note 13 will, however, be impacted.
Cobham holds 13.3% of the equity of AirTanker Holdings Limited and 5% of AirTanker Services Limited.
These shareholdings, together with the governance structure of the entities, are not considered to provide significant influence and hence the investments are currently accounted for as trade investments, categorised as available for sale.
They are held at a cost of 6.1m in accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments.
Under IFRS 9, these investments must be held at fair value, using a present value methodology.
The provisional impact on the Balance Sheet as at 1 January 2018 is to increase investments by 39m, with a potential increase in deferred tax liabilities of 7m, and a corresponding increase to reserves.

IFRS 15 introduces a five step model to be applied to the Balance Sheet.
Broadly the Group will recognise leases currently treated as all contracts with customers when determining accounting for revenue.

to date compared with total estimated costs at completion.
Mission Systems also generate revenue through the sale of products.
Some of these products are customer specific and therefore may have no alternate use.
For these contracts there is usually a right to payment and therefore revenue will be recognised over time.
Progress in completing performance obligations will typically be measured based on cost incurred as a percentage of total expected cost.
The Group has a number of contracts with government bodies, in particular within the Advanced Electronic Solutions Sector, by which control is transferred to the customer as the product is being manufactured or as the services are being provided.
For these contracts revenue will be recognised over time, typically using cost as the basis of measuring progress.
For cost-plus contracts typically with government departments and agencies, revenue will continue to be recognised to the extent of reimbursable costs incurred, plus a proportionate amount of the estimated fee earned.
IFRS 15 will change revenue recognition methodologies for longer term contracts in the Advanced Electronic Solutions Sector and for products where there is no alternate use and an enforceable right to payment.
Currently revenue for some of these contracts is recognised on a contractual milestone basis, or at a point in time on shipment or delivery to the customer.
A detailed review of contracts impacted by IFRS 15 has been undertaken and the provisional impact on the Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2016 is a decrease to working capital of 17m, a decrease in provisions of 21m, and a decrease in other Balance Sheet items of 4m resulting in no net impact on reserves.
The impact on 2017 revenue is an increase of approximately 41m, with an increase in operating profit of approximately 3m.

Underlying measures, EPS and specific adjusting items Use of underlying measures To assist with the understanding of earnings trends, the Group has included within its published financial statements non-GAAP alternative performance measures including underlying operating profit and underlying profit.
The non-GAAP measures used are not defined terms under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
They are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measures.
Management uses underlying measures to assess the operating performance of the Group, having adjusted for specific items as defined below.
They form the basis of internal management accounts and are used for decision making including capital allocation and a subset also forms the basis of internal incentive arrangements.
By using underlying measures in our segmental reporting, this further ensures readers of the financial statements can recognise how incentive performance is targeted.
Underlying measures are also presented in this report because the Directors believe they provide additional useful information to shareholders on comparative trends over time.
Finally, this presentation allows for separate disclosure and specific narrative to be included concerning the adjusting items: this helps to ensure performance in any one year can be more clearly understood by users of the financial statements.
Definitions of underlying measures All underlying measures include the operational results of all businesses including those held for sale until the point of sale.
These definitions are applied consistently on a year to year basis.
Underlying operating profit Underlying operating profit is defined as operating profit from continuing operations excluding the impacts of business acquisition and divestment related activity and prior periods business restructuring costs as detailed below.
Also excluded are changes in the marking to market of non-hedge accounted derivative financial instruments, gains and losses arising on dividend related foreign exchange contracts and other items deemed by the Directors to be of a non-operating nature including the impairment of intangible assets.
Underlying profit Underlying profit before taxation is defined as underlying operating profit less net underlying finance costs, which exclude business acquisition and divestment related items and specific finance costs.

Details of specific adjusting items The specific adjusting items excluded from underlying profit can be analysed as follows: m Note 2017 2016 Cost of sales Revisions of the carrying values of other assets 24.1 Estimates of fixed price contract profitability 179.1 Assessment of legal and other provisions 5.5 208.7 Operating costs Amounts related to prior periods restructuring programmes 4.7 8.7 Derivative financial instruments 19 28.9 39.3 Business acquisition and divestment related items Amortisation of intangible assets arising on business combinations 9 138.9 161.2 Profit loss on divestments 1.1 1.3 Other M&A related costs 0.3 0.4 Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 9 33.5 573.8 Reversal of impairment of intangible assets 9 31.8 Other items provided at 31 December 2016 Adjustments to revisions of the carrying values of other assets 1.4 9.2 Adjustments to the assessment of legal and other provisions 8.0 18.9 106.2 795.4 Finance costs Non-underlying finance costs make whole payments 5 19.0 Taxation Tax on specific adjusting items 6 51.7 92.4 Explanation of specific adjusting items Business acquisition and divestment related items The Group has been acquisitive over time and also divests businesses in accordance with its strategy.
Accounting adjustments that arise as a result of business combinations and divestments are not considered to result from the underlying business activity and have therefore been excluded from underlying results.
These adjustments include the amortisation of intangible assets arising on business combinations, gains or losses arising on business divestments, adjustments to businesses held for sale, the writing off of the pre-acquisition profit element of inventory written up on acquisition, revaluation gains and losses arising on the original equity interests on stepped acquisitions, other direct costs associated with business combinations and terminated divestments, and adjustments to contingent consideration related to previously acquired businesses.
Amortisation of intangible assets arising as a result of the purchase price allocation on business combinations, such as customer lists, technology based assets and order book and trade names, is not included in underlying measures.
Amortisation of internally generated intangible assets such as software and development costs is included within underlying measures.
Likewise impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets arising on business combinations, together with any reversal of impairment of intangible assets, are treated as specific adjusting items as these assets arose from business acquisitions in prior periods.
Other M&A related costs reflect the finalisation of costs related to acquisitions and divestments in prior years.
Amounts related to prior periods restructuring programmes Amounts related to prior periods restructuring programmes were deemed as incremental to normal operations.
These costs relate to the integration of the Aeroflex businesses acquired in 2014, specifically in respect of the IT integration and remediation costs resulting from this acquisition.
Where restructuring costs are incurred as a result of the ongoing business activity, such costs are included within operating costs and are not excluded from underlying results.
Derivative financial instruments The impact of derivative financial instruments excluded from underlying results includes changes in the marking to market of non-hedge accounted derivative financial instruments.
These amounts relate to foreign currency exchange contracts and would not impact operating results had the Group chosen to comply with IAS 39 requirements to enable these contracts to be hedge accounted.
Also included are gains and losses arising on dividend related foreign exchange contracts.
As dividend cash flows do not impact operating results, the movement in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts being used to manage the currency risks arising are excluded from underlying results.
com Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 95 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued Other items In 2016 additional items which were excluded from underlying results due to their unusual size and incidence arose out of the January 2017 Balance Sheet review.
The impact of these items was much larger than would normally be expected in any individual accounting period and they reflected commercial events that were not expected to repeat.
They included revisions to the carrying value of assets, changes in estimates of fixed price contract profitability and the assessment of legal and other provisions.
Adjustments to revisions of the carrying value of other assets provided at 31 December 2016 relate to a provision against aged receivables which was considered doubtful at 31 December 2016 but which has been recovered during the first half of the year ended 31 December 2017.
The release of this provision has been treated as an adjusting item consistent with the treatment of the original provision.
Adjustments to the assessment of legal and other provisions relate to provisions made at 31 December 2016 which have been reassessed during 2017.
These provision releases have been treated as an adjusting item consistent with the treatment of the original provisions.

UK deferred taxes have been calculated at 19%, or 17% where the liability is expected to crystallise after 1 April 2020.
The US corporation tax rate reduced from 35% to 21% on 1 January 2018, and US deferred taxes as at 31 December 2017 have been calculated at 21%.
The reduction in tax rate did not result in a material change due to deferred tax assets arising from timing differences being offset by deferred tax liabilities on acquired intangible assets.
The Group is reviewing the implications of the US tax reform, including the Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax BEAT provisions, and resolving certain tax issues arising from prior years.
Given this, and the expected geographical mix of profit, the underlying tax rate is anticipated to remain at approximately the current level, subject to any future changes in tax legislation.
Current tax assets and liabilities 2016 m 2017 restated Current tax receivables 7.2 3.1 Current tax liabilities 135.8 141.6 128.6 138.5 In September 2017 the IFRS Interpretations Committee issued an agenda decision on interest and penalties related to income taxes.
This decision clarified that entities do not have a policy choice between applying IAS 12 Income taxes and applying IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets to interest and penalties related to income taxes.
As a consequence the Group has reassessed its treatment of interest and penalties related to its global uncertain tax positions as presented in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts.
This resulted in other liabilities within trade and other payables increasing by 9.5m, current tax liabilities decreasing by 7.9m, and deferred tax assets increasing by 1.6m and 2016 balances have been restated accordingly.
com Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 99 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued Current tax risks key estimation uncertainty The Group is subject to corporate and other tax rules in the jurisdictions where it conducts its business operations.
Changes in tax rates, tax reliefs and tax laws, changes in practice or interpretation of the law by the relevant tax authorities, increasing challenges by relevant tax authorities on transfer pricing and other matters, or any failure to manage tax risks adequately could result in increased charges, financial loss, penalties and reputational damage, which may materially adversely affect the Groups financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, tax enforcement has become a higher priority for many tax authorities in jurisdictions in which the Group operates, which has led to an increase in tax audits, enquiries and challenges, or the testing through litigation of the boundaries of the correct interpretation of legislation.
Tax authorities may also actively pursue additional taxes based on retroactive changes to tax laws and the Group may have disagreements with tax authorities which could result in a material restatement to the tax position.
For example, the availability of certain interest deductions on one of the Groups internal financing arrangements, principally as a result of various US acquisitions, has been under challenge for some time.
Over the life of this internal financing arrangement, the aggregate tax value of the interest deductions amounted to approximately 130m.
If decided adversely to the Group, this could lead to increased tax liabilities in excess of those provided in the Groups Balance Sheet, and result in a substantial tax payment becoming due.
That payment may also be subject to an interest charge from the relevant authority.
The Group has taken external advice and considers that it has strong support for its position.
However, the timing and resolution of this issue is uncertain.
The European Commission EC has opened an investigation into the UKs controlled foreign company CFC rules.
The CFC rules levy a charge on foreign entities controlled by the UK that are subject to a lower rate of tax, however there is currently an exemption available for 75% of this charge if the activities being undertaken by the CFC relate to financing.
The EC are investigating whether this exemption is in breach of EU State Aid rules, but it is too early to assess what the conclusions of this investigation might be.
On 22 December 2017 extensive changes to the US tax system were made.
A number of risks to the Group arise as a result, including Anti-base erosion, the way that interest deductions are made, foreign tax credits and tax of foreign earnings.
These risks are currently being assessed as further clarity is provided by the US tax authorities.
In respect of the above risks and other uncertain tax positions in the UK, US and other tax jurisdictions, amounts totalling 126.4m 2016: 138.7m have been accrued.
Final resolutions will affect the amounts settled and the timing of any settlements.
Whilst resolution remains uncertain, these amounts are included in current liabilities.

com 100 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Tax losses key estimation uncertainty Tax losses of 29.6m 2016: 28.9m arising in the UK during the year have been recognised on the basis of UK forecasted future taxable profits, using projections prepared by management and reviewed by the Board.
The recognition of these tax losses is sensitive to movement in these forecasted profits.
A 33% reduction in the estimated profits would not impact the recognition of these tax losses.
In addition capital losses in the US are expected to be used on completion of the divestment of the AvComm business and therefore 10.9m has been recognised as a deferred tax asset.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has further unused capital losses of 85.9m 2016: 144.4m potentially available for offset against future capital profits in certain circumstances.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of this amount because of the unpredictability of future qualifying profit streams.
These losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
Unremitted earnings The unprovided tax on unremitted earnings as at 31 December 2017 is considered to be immaterial.
Dividends No dividends have been paid or approved by Cobham plc during the year ended 31 December 2017.

These alternative performance measures are used in internal management accounts and for decision making including capital allocation.
In addition to underlying profit measures, underlying cash conversion is also used for internal incentive arrangements, and presenting this information allows users of the financial statements to better understand the way in which performance is targeted.
Definitions of operating cash flow measures Free cash flow Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities plus dividends received from joint ventures, less cash flows related to the purchase or disposal of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets but excluding payments relating to business acquisition and divestment related activities.
Operating cash flow Operating cash flow is free cash flow before payment of tax, interest and restructuring costs.

com Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 103 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued Goodwill Goodwill represents the premium paid on acquisitions in anticipation of future economic benefits from assets that are not capable of being separately identified and separately recognised, such as the value of the workforce, and is the only indefinite life intangible asset held by the Group.
Goodwill must be allocated to CGUs for the purposes of reporting and accounting.
Cobham has previously defined CGUs in line with business units.
However, during the year, the Group determined that following completion of all historic integration activities, the strategic review undertaken in 2017 and increasing numbers of new customer platforms using multiple Cobham products, CGUs are now more appropriately defined at the Sector level.
This avoids the need to allocate goodwill on an increasingly arbitrary basis and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is now monitored by management.
Prior to making the assessment of impairment at this new level, impairment reviews were performed at the business unit level.
Where relevant any impairments arising are discussed below.
The carrying value of goodwill is allocated to the following Sectors: m 2017 2016 Communications and Connectivity 278.8 310.0 Mission Systems 89.8 92.4 Advanced Electronic Solutions 225.1 244.1 Aviation Services 43.3 78.7 Total 637.0 725.2 Annual impairment review key estimation uncertainty A review of the carrying value of goodwill is completed at least once a year to ensure that it is not impaired.
This requires estimation of the recoverable amounts of the CGUs to which the goodwill is allocated.
This is determined from value in use calculations unless specific conditions at a CGU dictate otherwise.
As the Wireless and AvComm businesses are treated as held for sale then the expected sales proceeds, less costs to sell, have been used for the purposes of the impairment review.
Impairment tests on other intangible assets are undertaken if events occur which may indicate that these assets may be impaired.
The carrying value of intangible assets is considered annually as part of the goodwill impairment exercise with reference to the value in use calculation of each CGU.
Estimating value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the CGUs and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
This is considered to be a source of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, which may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of intangible assets within the next financial year.
Key assumptions The calculation of recoverable value for CGUs based on value in use includes the following key assumptions: Cash flow forecasts prepared by management and reviewed by the Board covering a three year period, updated where appropriate for more recent forecasts.
These forecasts take into account the current and expected economic environment including factors such as continued uncertainty within some markets in which we operate.
They also make assumptions about the demand for our products in our primary geographical markets, based on historic experience, available government spending and key current and future programme platforms.
These cash flow projections do not include benefits or costs expected to arise from future restructuring or initiatives to enhance performance which have not yet commenced: Growth rates assumed after this period are based on long-term GDP projections of the primary market for each business.
The long-term projections used are in the range 1.5% to 2.5% 2016: 1.2% to 2.5% : Cash flows are discounted using the Groups WACC, adjusted for country, cash flow and currency risks in the principal territories in which the CGU operates.
These pre-tax discount rates are within the range 8.6% to 10.5% 2016: 8.3% to 10.1% : Cash flows include the impact of working capital and fixed asset requirements: and Cash flows include management charges which allocate central overheads to the CGUs.
In 2017 and 2016 the following impairments were made: 2017 2016 m Goodwill Other intangible assets Goodwill Other intangible assets Wireless Communications and Connectivity 31.8 152.9 43.2 Helicopter Services Aviation Services 33.5 Integrated Electronic Solutions Advanced Electronic Solutions 185.7 Semiconductor Solutions Advanced Electronic Solutions 192.0 Total 33.5 31.8 530.6 43.2 Helicopter Services goodwill arose on the acquisition of the FB Group in 2013.
Projected cash flows for the next three years, with subsequent growth assumed at a rate of 2.3% were discounted at a pre-tax rate of 9.7%.
The previously announced loss of the UK Defence Helicopter Flying School contract, which expires at the end of March 2018, meant this business has been more sensitive to its ability to secure extensions on its remaining portfolio of contracts and to secure new business.
In 2017 the business was not able to win extensions with two key non-UK customers where local governments were reconsidering whether or not, and how, they fund training activities.
Reflecting the lower level of secured income into future projections an impairment provision of 33.5m has been expensed, leaving a balance of 17.3m.
31.8m of a previous impairment of intangible assets held in the Wireless business was reversed with reference to the expected sale proceeds less costs to sell for the AvComm and Wireless businesses, which were subsequently reclassified as held for sale in the Balance Sheet.
com 104 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the CGUs, as described below: The largest elements of goodwill in Communications and Connectivity arose on the acquisition of Thrane & Thrane in 2012 and a number of Aerospace Communications businesses.
Cash flow projections assume growth in the satellite communications market for maritime products driven by availability of satellite capacity and aerospace products from regulatory changes and passenger connectivity demands.
Projected cash flows for the next three years, with subsequent growth assumed at a rate of 1.8% were discounted at a pre-tax rate of 9.7%.
If cash flows reduced by 20%, the discount rate was 11.7% or if the growth rate was zero, then no impairment losses would arise.
Mission Systems goodwill primarily arose on the acquisition of Carleton Technologies in 1987, Conax in 1998 and Koch in 2005.
Projected cash flows for the next three years, with subsequent growth assumed at a rate of 2.1% were discounted at a pre-tax rate of 10.3%.
If cash flows reduced by 20%, the discount rate was 12.4% or if the growth rate was zero, then no impairment losses would arise.
Advanced Electronic Solutions goodwill includes part of the Aeroflex business acquired in 2014, the Trivec business acquired in 2011, the Lansdale business and the former M A-COM businesses acquired in 2008 and the REMEC business acquired in 2005.
In prior years this CGU has been impacted by the end of production on some long term programmes.
Projected cash flows for the next three years, with subsequent growth assumed at a rate of 2.0% were discounted at a pre-tax rate of 10.5%.
If cash flows reduced by 20%, the discount rate was 12.6% or if the growth rate was zero, then no impairment losses would arise.
Aviation Services goodwill includes that arising on the acquisition of FR Aviation together with the remaining goodwill, after the impairment charge made in the year, that arose on the acquisition of the FB Group in 2013.
Projected cash flows for the next three years, with subsequent growth assumed at a rate of 2.5% were discounted at a pre-tax rate of 10.2%.
If cash flows reduced by 20%, the discount rate was 12.2% or if the growth rate was zero, then impairment losses of between 5m and 8m would arise.

These values are based on management estimates using observable market data, taking into account current lease terms.
Property rental income earned by the Group from its investment properties amounted to 0.7m 2016: 0.7m, which is net of all direct costs associated with the leasing of the properties except depreciation.

These amounts will be utilised or amortised as deliveries are made against customers contractual schedules.
Those schedules are subject to change and do not all fall due within 12 months.
Within the Mission Systems segment, inventory expected to be realised after more than 12 months amounts to 17.7m 2016: 29.2m.
Otherwise, all inventory is expected to be realised within the normal operating cycle of the businesses.
Obsolescence provision key estimation uncertainty The nature of much of the Groups business means that inventory held can become technically obsolete.
It is also necessary to hold additional spare parts in order to support key customers and programmes.
Assessing the level of provision required for obsolete, slow moving and defective items of inventory is an area of estimation uncertainty which may have a significant effect on the carrying amount of inventory within the next financial year.
This allowance is reviewed by management on a regular basis and further amounts are provided or released as considered necessary.
The amounts are generally determined based on factors which include ageing and known demand reflecting assumptions concerning future orders and revenue streams.
Subsequent events may give rise to these estimates being revised and, consequently, to the reversal of amounts previously provided.
During the year 21.2m 2016: 36.3m was provided, 4.5m 2016: 5.2m was utilised and 6.2m 2016: 6.4m of the allowance for obsolescence was reversed.
The amount provided in the year represents the outcome of the key sensitivity, being changes in forecast customer demand against which production has been planned or undertaken.
A 10% deterioration in the assumed immediate forecast demand would lead to an increased provision in the order of 4m 2016: 4m.

Contract loss provisions key estimation uncertainty Contract loss provisions are recognised for onerous contracts when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group are lower than the forecasted unavoidable cost of meeting the related contractual obligations.
The assessment of the amount provided is a source of estimation uncertainty which may have a significant effect on the carrying amount of these provisions within the next financial year.
The estimated costs to complete, the outcome of negotiations with customers, the amounts recoverable under these contracts and the risk of incurring penalties for not meeting challenging delivery schedules are all areas requiring management judgement and the Group may take account of the advice of experts in quantifying the expected costs of future adverse outcomes.
Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with such matters, the timing and determination of the total costs or amount of any payments under any claims could differ from the amounts provided.
These provisions are expected to be utilised within three years although where there are uncertainties surrounding the timing of utilisation, they have been disclosed as current liabilities.
There are multiple sensitivities to be considered in assessing contract loss provisions, in particular the ability to achieve development milestone dates, the accuracy of cost estimates to complete contractual work and the ability to successfully invoice and collect cash from the customer.
It is not considered practical to provide sensitivities for each of these items, and potentially misleading to suggest each one can be considered separately, so this risk is disclosed as part of our contingent liabilities in note 26.
Other categories of provisions Provisions related to businesses divested relate to longer term warranties given on the divestments completed in 2005.
Due to uncertainties surrounding the timing of settlement of these items, they have been disclosed as current liabilities.
Restructuring provisions relate to onerous lease provisions arising from the restructuring of the Aeroflex businesses, which is now complete.
Amounts carried forward are not expected to be fully settled until 2025.
Provisions for warranty claims are expected to be utilised within three years.
Aircraft maintenance provisions relate to significant periodic maintenance costs as well as return conditions for leased aircraft and are anticipated to crystallise within five years.
Other provisions include amounts provided in respect of legal claims and environmental obligations and are mostly expected to be settled within one year.

1.1m 2016: 0.4m was outstanding in respect of defined contribution schemes but not due for payment at 31 December 2017.
Defined contribution schemes The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension arrangements.
Under a defined contribution pension arrangement the Groups contribution is fixed at a set percentage of employees pay.
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense as the employee provides service to the Group.
There is no legal or constructive obligation to pay any additional amounts into the funds.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates a number of funded defined benefit schemes where benefits are based on employees length of service and average final salary, the most significant being the Cobham Pension Plan CPP.
The assets of all of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
However, the Group is responsible for funding any shortfall in the obligations of the schemes to their members.
All defined benefit schemes have been closed to new members since 2003 and the UK schemes were closed to future accrual from 1 April 2016.
The defined benefit schemes expose the Group to a number of risks, as described below: Volatility of investment returns.
If the investment return is lower than the discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields then the scheme deficit will increase: Inflation risk.
Pensionable salaries, deferred pensions and pensions in payment are subject to inflationary increases.
A higher inflation rate will lead to higher defined benefit obligations: Changes in bond yields.
Volatility in the financial markets can have a significant impact on corporate bond yields which are used to generate a discount rate assumption.
Lower corporate bond yields will lead to higher defined benefit obligations: and Life expectancy risk.
The schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member and therefore increases in life expectancy will lead to higher defined benefit obligations.
The trustees seek to mitigate these risks and have entered into a number of buy-in arrangements where assets are transferred to an insurance company in return for a qualifying insurance policy which provides an income stream equivalent to the obligations to pensioners covered by the arrangement.
The most significant buy-in arrangement relates to pensioners of the CPP as at 1 July 2013.
This eliminates all of the above risks in relation to these liabilities except for the credit risk related to the insurance provider.
In addition the trustees have invested in liability driven investments that mitigate approximately 85% of the remaining bond yield and inflation risks, on a technical provision basis.
This is achieved by using a portfolio of gilts and swaps supported with investment grade credit instruments.
These investments introduce the risk that a call for further investment may be made if inflation decreases or the bond yield increases, which is managed by maintaining sufficient liquid investments.
Leverage and counterparty risks are managed by the fund investment managers.
The remaining assets include significant investment in diversified growth funds which seek to manage investment risks.
Triennial actuarial valuations Actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit obligations for the CPP are carried out on a triennial basis by qualified independent actuaries: the most recent valuation was as at 1 April 2015.
Actuarial valuations of other schemes have been carried out at regular intervals as required by the applicable country regulations.
The actuarial valuations were updated by qualified independent actuaries for accounting purposes to 31 December 2017.
In the UK, within 15 months of each triennial valuation, the employer and the trustees are required to agree a schedule of contributions to ensure that the Plan is fully funded over time on a suitably prudent basis.
The valuation of the Plan liabilities for this triennial valuation is on a more prudent basis than that required by IAS 19 and therefore the schedule of contributions will address a higher deficit than that recorded on an IAS 19 basis.
The Group expects to contribute 18.1m to its defined benefit pension schemes in 2018 and, under the current schedule of contributions, 10.7m in 2019.
Thereafter the current schedules of contributions require 8.8m of contributions each year through to 2022.
A new schedule of contributions is likely to be agreed prior to 1 April 2019 based on a triennial valuation as at 1 April 2018, which may change the Groups commitments after 2018.
Assumptions source of estimation uncertainty A number of assumptions are made in assessing the costs and present value of the pension assets and liabilities, which include the discount rate, inflation and mortality rates.
These are considered to be major sources of estimation uncertainty as comparatively small changes in the assumptions used may have a significant effect on the Groups financial statements within the next financial year.
The Group uses published indices and independent actuarial advice to select the values of critical assumptions.
The principal financial assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows: 2017 2016 UK schemes US scheme UK schemes US scheme RPI inflation assumption rate of increase in pensions in payment unless overridden by specific scheme rules 3.35% 3.35% 3.45% 3.45% CPI inflation assumption rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.35% 2.35% 2.45% 2.45% Discount rate 2.35% 3.47% 2.65% 3.95% www.
com Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 115 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued The mortality assumptions used for the CPP are based upon actuarial tables which reflect actual recent mortality experience and also allow for future mortality improvements.
The mortality tables used to estimate life expectancy are known as SAPS CMI 16 2016: SAPS CMI 15.
In practical terms, this is demonstrated in the table below: Year of birth Year age 65 Life expectancy Male 1952 2017 88 years Female 1952 2017 89 years Male 1980 2045 90 years Female 1980 2045 91 years At 31 December 2017 it has been assumed that members will commute on average 25% 2016: 25% of their pension for cash at retirement.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity of scheme liabilities to changes in certain key assumptions, after adjusting for liabilities covered by insurance contracts, is provided below: Change in assumption Change in liabilities Discount rate Increase by 1.0% -9% Inflation rate both RPI and CPI Increase by 0.5% 3% Life expectancy Increase by one year 2% If the change in assumptions were in the opposite direction to that shown above, the impact would be approximately symmetrical.

Of the net actuarial gain recognised in the year, the loss from changes in financial assumptions is primarily driven by the movements in the discount rate, while the gain from changes in demographic assumptions arises from the use of the latest mortality tables.
The actual return on scheme assets was 51.8m 2016: 137.4m.
The weighted average duration of the scheme liabilities is estimated to be 16 years.

Financial risk management The Groups multinational operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using foreign currency financial instruments, debt and other instruments, including interest rate swaps.
Other derivative financial instruments may be used from time to time to manage exposures such as inflation risk.
The financial risk management policies agreed by the Board have not changed during the year and are summarised below.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
Foreign currency risk The Group is based in the UK, reports in sterling and has significant investment in overseas operations in the USA, Australia and other European countries.
As a result, the Groups Balance Sheet, including the net debt position, can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
The Groups policy is to reduce, or eliminate where practical, both structural and transactional foreign exchange risk and, consequently, the net foreign exchange gains and losses included in the Income Statement amounted to a gain of 12.1m 2016: 26.1m.
The Group undertakes to manage the currency mix of debt and EBITDA so that they are broadly in line to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on the net debt to EBITDA financial covenant.
All currency exposures are reviewed regularly and all significant foreign exchange transactions are approved by Cobham plc management.
The Group has the following exposure to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the Balance Sheet, translated into sterling at the relevant year end exchange rates: 2017 2016 Monetary Monetary Monetary Monetary m assets liabilities assets liabilities US dollars 488.3 932.6 377.8 1,290.8 Euros 95.2 166.5 116.4 163.2 Australian dollars 48.7 11.6 40.3 43.8 Danish kroner 9.3 8.7 24.1 68.2 Other currencies 36.2 7.0 42.6 8.2 677.7 1,126.4 601.2 1,574.2 Sterling denominated monetary assets and liabilities 167.7 129.2 110.8 186.7 845.4 1,255.6 712.0 1,760.9 Foreign currency borrowings also mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange differences arising from the Groups overseas net assets.
Monetary liabilities in the table above include US dollar borrowings of 717.1m 2016: 1,061.8m which match exposures arising from currency denominated net assets.
Foreign currency derivative contracts are also used to manage exposure to currency risks.
On consolidation, the net assets of overseas subsidiaries which include the monetary assets and liabilities shown in the table above are translated at closing exchange rates and exchange differences arising are accounted for in OCI through the translation reserve note 23.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk in the Income Statement where individual subsidiaries hold non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities and when an operating unit makes sales and purchases in currencies other than its own functional currency.
The Group undertakes a formal process to actively manage and mitigate this exposure through a combination of matching non-functional currency revenues and costs, matching non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities and through the use of forward contracts.
Group policy is that at least 80% of the next 12 months forecast cash flows in non-functional currencies are covered by forward foreign exchange contracts.
For shorter cycle businesses, the profile of hedging is based on customer commitments which are subject to approval by the Group CFO.
Where forecasted currency cash flows do not arise this will result in increased income statement exposure to foreign currency exchange differences.
These are however managed at a Group level and mitigating action is taken where possible.
The sterling US dollar and Danish krone US dollar exchange rates are the most important for the Group.
The Group has the following forward foreign currency contracts outstanding for net sales of US dollars for sterling and Danish kroner: Average US$m amount US$: exchange rate 2017 2016 2017 2016 Expiring within one year 119.4 141.8 1.37 1.42 Expiring within one to two years 85.3 40.2 1.36 1.43 Expiring after two years 29.5 34.7 1.50 1.52 US$ sterling contracts outstanding at 31 December 234.2 216.7 1.38 1.43 Average US$m amount US$:DKK exchange rate 2017 2016 2017 2016 Expiring within one year 85.5 95.1 6.34 6.16 Expiring within one to two years 0.5 6.20 Expiring after two years 1.2 1.7 6.01 6.07 US$ DKK contracts outstanding at 31 December 87.2 96.8 6.34 6.15 The latest expiry date of forward foreign currency contracts for sales of US dollars is July 2022 and it is the Groups current belief that the net dollar receipts by subsidiaries will exceed the level of the outstanding commitments.
com 118 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Sensitivity analysis Financial instruments denominated in a currency other than the functional currency in which they are measured create exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk.
These financial instruments include the monetary assets and liabilities and the forward foreign currency contracts shown in the tables above.
The sensitivity arising on these financial instruments from a weakening in sterling against the respective foreign currency at the balance sheet date is set out below, with a negative number indicating a reduction in profit after taxation or total equity.

However these potential changes are hypothetical and actual rates in future may differ significantly as a result of developments in global financial markets.
This sensitivity analysis has been based on the assumption that all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant.
Interest rate risk The Group has borrowings with a range of maturities at both fixed and floating rates of interest.
In managing its borrowing costs, the Group monitors its exposure to movements in interest rates, having regard to prevailing market conditions and, where necessary, uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk.
At 31 December 2017, the Group does not have any interest rate swaps outstanding.
All floating rate borrowings have regular repricing dates.

There was no material sensitivity to changes in interest rates at the year end.
Floating to fixed interest rate swaps, designated as cash flow hedges, have previously been used to mitigate the interest rate exposure arising on selected floating rate debt.
As the borrowings were repaid during the year, the associated interest rate swaps were cancelled and there were no interest rate swaps outstanding at 31 December 2017.

com Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 119 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued Liquidity risk The Groups policy on managing liquidity risk throughout the year has been to maintain a mix of short, medium and long term borrowings with lenders.
Overdraft and revolving credit facilities provide short term flexibility whilst the revolving credit facilities provide longer term committed funding.
As shown in note 16, at 31 December 2017 undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 404.1m 2016: 123.9m were available to the Group in various currencies.
At an operating level, the Group has a positive cash flow from operating activities and where practical the funds generated by business units are managed on a regional basis.
In the UK and USA, most business units utilise local banking facilities within a UK or US group arrangement.
This allows a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
The table below summarises the remaining contractual maturity for the Groups borrowings and other financial liabilities.
The amounts shown are the contractual undiscounted cash flows which include interest, analysed by contractual maturity.

The Group has a conservative policy towards the credit risk related to liquid funds and derivative financial instruments with balances currently spread across a range of reputable financial institutions.
The levels of credit risk are monitored through the Groups ongoing risk management processes, which include a regular review of the banks credit ratings.
Risk in this area is limited further by setting a maximum level for term deposits with any one counterparty.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group having a large customer base.
Customers are typically large global companies or government agencies with long term trading relationships.
The Group also has in place procedures that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales are made and any requests for extended credit are approved by senior management.
Existing customer accounts are monitored on an ongoing basis and appropriate action is taken where necessary to minimise any credit risk.
At 31 December 2016, additional provisions were made following the Balance Sheet review exercise as described in note 2.
No further credit risk provision is required in excess of the provision for impaired receivables shown in note 13.
Bank term balances totalling 7.0m 2016: 7.1m have been pledged against the residual value of leased assets under an agreement which expires in 2020.
Group management monitor debtor days and the ageing of receivables which are more than one month overdue on a regular basis.
At 31 December 2017, 8.7% 2016: 9.5% of gross trade receivables were overdue by one month or more.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2017 is the fair value of each class of receivable as disclosed in note 13.
com 120 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Group has master netting arrangements in respect of bank balances in the UK.
In the normal course of business, these bank accounts are settled on a net basis within each currency and as such are presented net in the Balance Sheet as shown in note 13.
In the event of an automatic enforcement event, the bank balances are set off against each other to achieve a net position.
Derivatives can also be offset by counterparties in the event of a default: net amounts that result on this basis are also shown in note 13.
Inflation risk The Groups exposure to inflation is considered to be a general business risk which is mitigated through normal commercial activity.
The Group has one swap contract which was designed to manage the inherent inflation risk in a specific operational contract.
The fair value of this swap contract is included in derivative financial instruments shown in note 19.
Capital risk management Group policy continues to be to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain stakeholder confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
Capital is defined as total equity excluding non-controlling interests and amounted to 1,027.0m at 31 December 2017 2016: 488.8m.
Within its overall policy, the Group seeks to maintain an appropriate finance structure through a mixture of debt and retained earnings.
Funding needs are reviewed periodically and also each time a significant acquisition or business divestment is made.
A number of factors are considered which include the net debt EBITDA ratio, forecast trading requirements, the availability and maturity of banking facilities, future funding needs and proposed dividend levels.
Group banking arrangements include financial covenants which are based on adjusted IFRS results as outlined in note 16.
As a result of these considerations it was announced in January 2017 that no dividend would be paid in respect of the year ended 31 December 2017.
The Board set a net debt EBITDA threshold of 1.5x in response to the immediate need to strengthen the Balance Sheet, and in May 2017 a Rights Issue was completed as detailed in note 22.
This raised net proceeds of 496.7m which were applied to existing debt and held as bank deposits.
The Board continues to review the position on a regular basis and intends to take a conservative approach to the capital structure in 2018 before setting out a revised capital allocation policy.
Net proceeds of 496.7m were realised after costs of 15.7m.
In the prior year, shares were issued following a 1 for 2 fully underwritten Rights Issue which raised net proceeds of 490.6m after costs of 16.1m.
As at 31 December 2017 88,427,023 2016: 88,587,855 ordinary shares were held in treasury including 12,475,299 2016: 12,636,131 shares held in the Cobham Employee Benefit Trust.
At 31 December 2017 the market value of treasury shares was 111.7m 2016: 145.0m, including shares with a market value of 15.8m 2016: 20.7m held by the Cobham Employee Benefit Trust.
During the year ended 31 December 2017 treasury shares were used to satisfy awards and options under the Groups share based payment schemes.
Receipts from option exercises are included in retained earnings and total equity.

The share based payment reserve includes the cost of awards as assessed under IFRS 2 and detailed in note 24, together with related deferred tax provided under IAS 12.
The appropriate proportion of this reserve is transferred to retained earnings following vesting or exercise.
Share based payments The Group offers a number of long term incentive schemes which provide a mix of performance based incentive and retention based awards as described below and in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 62 to 71.
All schemes are equity settled and the total amount included in the Income Statement arising from share based payment schemes is as follows: m 2017 2016 PSP 1.4 1.7 RSP 3.4 1.3 Other schemes 0.7 0.8 5.5 3.8 The number of awards outstanding at 31 December under each scheme are as follows: Number of awards thousands of shares 2017 2016 PSP 13,597 9,998 RSP 5,052 3,618 ESOS 3,484 3,794 BCP 17 ShareSave 8,372 7,612 At 31 December 30,505 25,039 Cobham plc www.
com 122 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PSP The PSP scheme is offered to senior executives across the Group and allows for annual grants of conditional shares and nil-cost options with vesting conditions based on the Groups financial performance, taking into account both market based conditions such as TSR growth and non-market based measures such as EPS growth or cash conversion.
The scheme includes retention awards granted from time to time to specific personnel and buy-out awards granted to key new starters, both vesting after a maximum of three years conditional only upon continued employment within the Group.

Fair values are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and, where market related performance conditions apply, a Monte Carlo simulation is also used.
There is no exercise price for these awards.
The weighted average inputs into the models were as follows: 2017 2016 Weighted average share price 1.381 1.646 Expected life 2.9 years 2.2 years Expected employee cancellation rate 3.1% 4.0% Risk free rate 0.3% 0.6% The expected lives used in the models have been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability and behavioural considerations.
The expected employee cancellation rates are based on assessments of historic rates of voluntary cancellations of contracts by employees.
Dividend yields were nil or were not relevant to the valuation model where participants of the vested awards receive the benefit of dividend equivalent payments.
RSP RSP awards provide conditional shares based solely on continued employment within the Group over a maximum of four years.

Fair values are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and equate to the market price on the date of grant.
Other schemes Charges for other schemes relate to share options granted under the Groups ShareSave scheme, which is open to all UK employees.
The fair values of ShareSave awards granted in the year are significantly lower than for PSP and RSP awards due to the effect of the exercise price which is set based upon the market value of the Companys ordinary shares around the date of grant.
In 2016, the charges for other schemes also included the final amounts charged for ESOS and BCP schemes which were last awarded in 2013 and 2014respectively.
com Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 123 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 25.
Operating lease arrangements At the balance sheet date the Group had outstanding commitments for minimum lease payments due under non-cancellable operating leases as follows: m 2017 2016 Within one year 28.3 30.3 Between one and two years 24.7 27.7 Between two and three years 17.5 25.1 Between three and four years 16.0 16.6 Between four and five years 13.7 14.0 After five years 66.9 45.5 167.1 159.2 Operating lease commitments include 17.6m 2016: 23.8m related to onerous leases which have been provided for at the balance sheet date.
Operating lease payments during the year totalled 35.7m 2016: 32.3m including rental costs of 8.6m 2016: 7.8m relating to operational aircraft used in the Groups service businesses: the remainder primarily relates to the rental of office and operating facilities.
Contingent liabilities At 31 December 2017, the Company and the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of bank and contractual performance guarantees and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
Where it is expected that a material liability will arise in respect of these matters, appropriate provision is made within the Group Financial Statements.
As announced in June 2017, Cobham was notified by the Financial Conduct Authority that it had appointed investigators to ascertain whether the Company had breached the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules between April 2016 and February 2017 and the Market Abuse Regulation between July 2016 and February 2017.
It is currently not possible to predict what the outcome of this investigation will be.
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to various legal proceedings and claims and management does not anticipate that the outcome of these, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
The nature of much of the contracting work done by the Group means that there are reasonably frequent contractual issues, variations and renegotiations that arise in the ordinary course of business, whose resolution is uncertain and could materially impact the Groups future reported earnings.
In particular, on fixed price development contracts, costs incurred and anticipated can significantly exceed amounts estimated as a result of material enhancements to the specifications originally agreed under the contracts.
Judgement is therefore required as regards estimated costs to complete, the outcome of negotiations with customers and the amounts recoverable under these contracts.
The amount recoverable may be subject to direct damages due to the customer and damages or penalties they incur from their own end users.
In particular there are onerous contract terms and challenging delivery schedules on air to air refuelling development contracts.
The Group may take account of the advice of experts as required in making these judgements and whether the outcome of negotiations will result in an appropriate recovery of costs.
In the case where the Group is undertaking development activity at its own cost, but has given performance undertakings to prospective customers, then a liability for losses consequent upon the failure to meet such undertakings could exist.
The Group is subject to corporate and other tax rules in the jurisdictions where it conducts its business operations.
The EC is investigating whether this exemption is in breach of EU State Aid rules, but it is too early to assess what the conclusions of this investigation might be.
A number of risks to the Group arise as a result, including anti-base erosion, the way that interest deductions are made, foreign tax credits and tax of foreign earnings.
