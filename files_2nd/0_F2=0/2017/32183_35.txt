Segmental analysis The Group has two reportable segments, online retailing of domestic appliances to customers in the UK and online retailing of domestic appliances to customers in Europe excluding the UK.
Operating segments are determined by the internal reporting regularly provided to the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Executive Directors and has determined that the primary segmental reporting format of the Group is geographical by customer location, based on the Groups management and internal reporting structure.
Transactions between segments are undertaken on an arms-length basis using appropriate transfer pricing policies.
Income statement The following is an analysis of the Groups revenue and results by reportable segments.
One of the Groups key performance indictors is Adjusted EBITDA and each segment is measured by the Chief Operating Decision Maker on this basis.
The use of this measure is also evidenced by executive management bonus targets and Long Term Incentive Schemes being measured in relation to adjusted EBITDA, amongst other factors.
As such, these measures are important and should be considered alongside the IFRS measures.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back those material items of income and expense which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to better understand the financial performance of the Group in the period.
The adjustments are: LTIP awards were made to a number of senior staff under the Performance Share Plan at the time of the Companys IPO in 2014 and also under the Employee Reward Plan ERP in July 2016.
The Board considers that the magnitude and timing of these awards are one-off in nature and so add-back any charge credit in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA.
The difference in the add-back year on year reflects the cumulative adjustment to the LTIP charge based on the assessment of certain performance criteria during the period with the credit in 2016s numbers reflecting the likelihood that the IPO award would not vest, whilst the charge this year relates to the ERP which, having been granted during the year under review, was not in the previous year.

The Groups receivable balance primarily comprises accrued income representing the expected future commission payments in relation to the product protection plans sold by the Group on behalf of one customer.
The Directors have assessed and considered the credit risk in respect of this amount and do not consider it to be of significance.
The Groups trade receivable balances comprise a number of individually small amounts from unrelated customers, operating within the same industry but over a number of geographical areas.
Concentration of risk is therefore limited.
Sales to retail customers are made predominantly in cash or via major credit cards.
It is Group policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
New credit customers are assessed using an external rating report which is used to establish a credit limit.
Such limits are reviewed periodically on both a proactive and reactive basis, for example, when a customer wishes to place an order in excess of their existing credit limit.
Receivable balances are monitored regularly with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
Management therefore believe that there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
Exposure to credit risk The maximum exposure to credit risk at the statement of financial position date by class of financial instrument was: 2017 2016 m m Accrued income 51.4 39.4 Trade receivables 6.3 9.7 57.7 49.1 Credit quality of financial assets and impairment losses The ageing of trade receivables at the statement of financial position date was: Gross Net m m Not past due 6.0 6.0 Past due 030 days 0.2 0.2 Past due 31120 days 0.1 0.1 More than 120 days At 31 March 2017 6.3 6.3 Not past due 9.0 9.0 Past due 030 days 0.6 0.6 Past due 31120 days More than 120 days 0.1 0.1 At 31 March 2016 9.7 9.7 There has been no impairment charged to trade receivables in the current year.

Financial instruments continued c Liquidity risk Financial risk management Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
It is Group policy to maintain a balance of funds, borrowings, committed bank and other facilities sufficient to meet anticipated short-term and long-term financial requirements.
In applying this policy the Group continuously monitors forecast and actual cash flows against the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Uncommitted facilities are used if available on advantageous terms.
It is Group treasury policy to ensure that a specific level of committed facilities is always available based on forecast working capital requirements.
Cash forecasts identifying the Groups liquidity requirements are produced and are stress tested for different scenarios including, but not limited to, reasonably possible decreases in profit margins and increases in interest rates on the Groups borrowing facilities and the weakening of sterling against other functional currencies within the Group.

Foreign currency risk Refer to note 35f.
Interest rate risk The principal interest rate risks of the Group arise in respect of borrowings.
As the interest expense on variable rate financial instruments is immaterial, the Group does not actively manage the exposure to this risk.
At the statement of financial position date the interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments was: 2017 2016 m m Fixed and variable rate instruments Finance lease liabilities 13.1 5.5 Bank loans 4.3 2.5 17.4 8.0 e Capital management It is the Groups policy to maintain an appropriate equity capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain the future development of the business.

The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
