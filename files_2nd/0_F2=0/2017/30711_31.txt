STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION NON-GAAP MEASURES UNAUDITED The Directors believe it is appropriate to include in the Strategic Report and financial statements a number of non-GAAP measures NGMs that are commonly used within the business.
These measures supplement the information provided in the IFRS reported financial statements and accompanying notes, providing additional insight to the users of the Annual Report.
