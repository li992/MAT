Financial statements Notes forming part of the financial statements Pets at Home Group Plc the Company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom and its registered office is Epsom Avenue, Stanley Green, Handforth, Cheshire, SK9 3RN.
1 Significant accounting policies The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
1.1 Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements presented in this document have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its individual income statement and related notes.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments to fair value, and in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
New standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC becoming effective during the year have not had a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
1.2 Measurement convention The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments, financial instruments classified as fair value through the profit or loss or as available-for-sale.
Non-current assets held for sale are stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
1.3 Going concern The Companys business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the Strategic Report.
The financial position of the Company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Chief Financial Officers Review.
In addition, note 22 to the financial statements includes the Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Company has considerable financial resources and financing facilities and prepares detailed business plans that model headroom on financial covenants.
The Directors believe the Company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully and therefore have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
1.4 Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing socauses the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
Investment in veterinary practices The Group has a number of non-participatory shareholdings in veterinary practice companies, which are accounted for as joint venture arrangements.
The veterinary practices were established under terms that require mutual agreement between the Group and the joint venture partner, and that donot give the Group power over decision making to affect its exposure to, or the extent of, the returns from its involvement with the practices andtherefore are not consolidated in these financial statements.
Further, the Group is not entitled to profits, losses, or any surplus on winding upordisposal of the veterinary practices, and as such no participatory interest is recognised.
The investments have been equity accounted for in the Groups financial statements in accordance with IAS 28.10.
As the Groups shares are non-participatory, and therefore the Group does not share in any profits, losses or other distribution of value from the joint venture Company, thefairvalue of the investment on initial recognition does not change, subject to impairment.
The Groups category of shareholding in the veterinary practices entitle the Group to charge management fees for support services provided.
Pets at Home Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 125 Notes forming part of the financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued 1.5 Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at thedate of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement, except for differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation that is effective, or qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the Groups presentational currency, sterling, at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated inthe translation reserve or non-controlling interest, as the case may be.
Functional currency The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling which is the Companys functional currency and have been rounded to the nearest thousand.
1.6 Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group Following the adoption of IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following twoconditions: a t hey include no contractual obligations upon the Company or Group as the case may be to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company or Group : and b w here the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation todeliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Companys exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
1.7 Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using theeffective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using theeffective interest method.
Investments in debt and equity securities Other investments in debt and equity securities held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss being recognised directly in equity in the fair value reserve, except for impairment losses and, in the case of monetary items such as debt securities, foreign exchange gains and losses.
When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss.
Where these investments are interest-bearing, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in profit or loss.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part ofthe Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the cash flow statement.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interestbearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Pets at Home Group Plc 126 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Contingent consideration Contingent consideration on acquisition of a subsidiary is valued at fair value at the time of acquisition.
Any subsequent change in fair value isrecognised in profit or loss.
1.8 Derivative financial instruments and hedging Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit orloss.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged see below.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
Anyineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified into profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss, i. e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding two policy statements, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
1.9 Intra-group financial instruments Financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of companies within the Group are considered to be insurance arrangements and accounted for as such.
In this respect, the Group treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable thatapayment will be required under the guarantee.
1.10 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plantandequipment.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plantandequipment.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold property 50 years Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 3-10 years Leasehold improvements the term of the lease Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
1.11 Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value attheacquisition date which is regarded as their cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation andaccumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately.
Customer lists are amortised on a straight line basis over 10 years.
Software Software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis between two and seven years.
Pets at Home Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 127 Notes forming part of the financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued 1.12 Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
Acquisitions on or after 26 March 2010 For acquisitions on or after 26 March 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred: plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree: plus the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree: less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, itisnotre-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
If contingent consideration is payable and is dependent on future employment, it is recognised as an expense over the relevant period as a cost of continuing employment.
A combined put and call option over non-controlling interests is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and included within the valuation ofgoodwill.
Subsequent changes to fair value are recognised in profit or loss.
Where a combined written put and call option exists over a non-controlling interest, and the conditions of the agreement provide the Group with present access to the benefits of the ownership of the non-controlling interest, then the acquisition is deemed to reflect 100% ownership and nonon-controlling interest is recognised.
A liability is recorded for the expected future acquisition of the non-controlling interest, and is recognised aspart of the fair value of the consideration.
Where the written put and call option has an embedded valuation mechanism to reward and retain key individuals employed by the acquired business, who are also non-controlling shareholders, then the expected increase in the financial liability is charged to the Income Statement asemployment costs evenly over the option period.
On a  basis, the Group elects to measure non-controlling interests, which have both present ownership interests and are entitled to a proportionate share of net assets of the acquiree in the event of liquidation, either at its fair value or at its proportionate interest in the recognised amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date.
All other non-controlling interests are measured at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Acquisitions prior to 26 March 2010 date of adoption of IFRS IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full requirements of Adopted IFRS for first time adopters.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 26 March 2010, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost.
1.13 Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as transactions with owners in theircapacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.
The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.
Any difference between the price paid or received and the amount by which non-controlling interests are adjusted is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent.
1.14 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is based on the weighted average cost principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition, lessrebates and discounts.
Provision is made against specific inventory lines where market conditions identify an issue in recovering the full cost of that SKU Stock Keeping Unit.
The provision focuses on the age of inventory and applies a progressive provision against the gross inventory as the line continues to age.
Where necessary further specific provision is made against inventory lines, when the ageing of provision is not deemed sufficient to carry the inventory at net realisable value.
To the extent that the ageing profile of gross inventory as calculated by this provision methodology results in a material provision, it will be disclosed as an estimate that may have an impact on subsequent periods.
To the extent this is material, it will be disclosed in note 1.22.
Pets at Home Group Plc 128 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 1.15 Impairment excluding inventories, and deferred tax assets Financial assets including receivables A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired.
A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the assets original effective interest rate.
Interest on the impaired asset continues tobe recognised through the unwinding of the discount.
When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.
Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Groups non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each period at the same time.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
In assessing value inuse, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets the cash-generating unit.
The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating units CGUs.
Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment is tested reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit group of units on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed ateach reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
1.16 Employee benefits Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
Short term benefits Short term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share based payments A number of employees of the Companys subsidiaries including Directors receive an element of remuneration in the form of share based payments, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
Share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value of transactions involving the granting of shares is determined by the share price at the date of grant.
The fair value of transactions involving the granting of share options is calculated by an external valuer based on a binomial model.
In valuing share based payments, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of Pets at Home Group Plc market conditions.
The cost of share based payments is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Companys estimate of how many of the awards will eventually vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Pets at Home Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 129 Notes forming part of the financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Where the terms of a share based payment award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of the modification.
Where a share based payment award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification to the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
1.17 Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can bereliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
1.18 Revenue and cost of sales Revenue represents the total amount receivable for goods and services, net of discounts, brand match vouchers, coupons and excluding value added tax, sold in the ordinary course of business, and arises from activities in the United Kingdom.
Revenue is recognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, there is reasonable certainty overrecovery of the consideration and the amount of revenue, associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably.
Revenueisrecognised when transactions are completed in store or online.
Sale of goods in store and online Retail revenue from the sale of goods is recorded net of value added tax, colleague discounts, coupons and vouchers.
Sale of goods represents foodand accessories sold in store and online, with revenue recognised at the point of sale for store sales and at point of despatch for online orders.
Gift vouchers and cards Revenue from the sale of gift vouchers and cards is recognised at the time the voucher is redeemed.
VIP loyalty scheme Under the VIP loyalty scheme, points are earned by customers upon the purchase of goods and services.
These points can be converted by nominated charities into gift cards for redemption against goods and services in store and online.
The sales value of the points earned under the VIPscheme are treated as deferred income: the sales are only recognised once the points have been redeemed by the charities.
The points have novalue to the customer.
Subscription services Revenue for subscription services is recognised at the point of despatch of each incremental order.
Provision of services Revenue from the provision of services is recorded net of value added tax, colleague discounts, coupons and vouchers.
Provision of services represents veterinary group income, grooming revenue and insurance commissions, with revenue recognised upon provision of the service.
i Veterinary group income Veterinary group income represents revenue from the provision of veterinary services and income from the provision of veterinary administrative support services.
Revenue received for the provision of veterinary services is recognised at the point of provision of the service and is recognised net of value added tax, colleague discounts, coupons and vouchers.
Fee income received from the joint venture veterinary practice companies foradministrative support services is recognised in the period the services relate to and recorded net of value added tax.
ii Grooming revenue Grooming revenue is recognised net of value added tax, colleague discounts, coupons and vouchers, at the point of provision of the service.
Cost of sales Cost of sales includes costs of goods sold and other directly attributable costs, promotional income and rebate income received from suppliers, including costs to deliver administrative support services to joint venture veterinary practices and costs to deliver grooming services.
Exceptional items Income or costs that are both material and non-recurring, whose significance is sufficient to warrant separate disclosure in the consolidated financial statements, are referred to as exceptional items.
These are included and separately identified within their relevant income statement category.
Pets at Home Group Plc 130 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Supplier income A number of different types of supplier income are negotiated with suppliers via the joint business planning process, in connection with the purchase of goods for resale, the largest of which being overrider income and promotional income discussed below.
The supplier income arrangements typically are not co-terminus with the Groups financial period, instead running alongside the calendar year.
Such income is only recognised when there is reasonable certainty that the conditions for recognition have been met by the Group, and the income can be measured reliably based on the terms of the contract.
This income is recognised as a credit within gross margin to cost of sales and, to the extent that the rebate relates to unsold stock purchases, as a reduction in the cost of inventory.
Supplier income is recognised on an accruals basis, based on the expected entitlement that has been earned up to the balance sheet date for each relevant supplier contract.
The accrued incentives, rebates and discounts receivable at year end are included within trade and other receivables.
Given the presence of the joint business plans, historic recoverability of accrued balances, and amounts are typically agreed with suppliers prior torecognition, supplier income is not considered to be an area of significant estimation that could impact on the following financial year.
Supplier income comprises: Overrider income Overrider income comprises three main elements: 1.
F ixed percentage based income: These relate largely to volumetric rebates based on the joint business plan agreements with suppliers.
Theincome accrued is based on the Groups latest forecast volumes and the latest contract agreed with the supplier.
Income is not recogniseduntil the Group has reasonable certainty that the joint business agreement will be fulfilled, with the amount of income accrued regularly re-assessed and re-measured throughout the contractual period, based on actual performance against the joint business plan.
F ixed lump sum income: These are typically guaranteed lump sum payments made by the supplier and are not based on volume.
Fixed lump sum income is usually predicated on confirmation of a supplier contract and typically includes performance conditions upon the Group, such asmarketing and promotional campaigns.
These amounts are recognised periodically when contractual milestones have been met.
G rowth income: These are tiered volumetric rebates relating to growth targets agreed with the supplier in the joint business planning process.
These are retrospective rebates based on sales volumes or purchased volumes.
Income is recognised to the extent that it is reasonably certain that the conditions will be achieved, with such certainty increasing in the latter part of the calendar year.
Promotional income Promotional income relates to supplier funded rebates specific to promotional activity run in agreement between the Group and our suppliers.
Rebates are agreed at an individual inventory article level for agreed periods of time and are systemically calculated based on article sales information.
No estimation is applied in calculating the promotional income receivable.
Given the presence of the joint business plans, historic recoverability of accrued balances, and amounts are agreed with suppliers prior torecognition, supplier income is not considered to be an area of significant estimation that could impact on the following financial year.
1.19 Expenses Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement over the term of the lease as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Financing income and expenses Financing expenses comprise interest payable under the effective interest rate method, incorporating amortisation of loan arrangement fees, financecharges on shares classified as liabilities and finance leases recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method, unwinding ofthediscount on provisions and net foreign exchange losses that are recognised in the income statement see foreign currency accounting policy.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that takes a substantial time to be prepared for use, are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.
Financing income comprises interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income, andnetforeign exchange gains.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised inthe income statement on the date the entitys right to receive payment is established.
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.
Pets at Home Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 131 Notes forming part of the financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Other payables Lease incentives are received in the form of cash contributions and rent free periods.
Cash contributions from landlords for store fit-outs are initially recognised as a liability in the balance sheet at the point the recognition criteria in the lease is met and credited to selling and distribution expenses in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease commencing from access date.
Rent free periods received from landlords are initially recognised as a liability on the balance sheet, which is then credited to the selling and distribution expenses in the consolidated income statement over the life of the lease.
The effect is to recognise a reduction in selling and distribution expenses on a straight-line basis from property access date to the end of the lease.
Rent-free periods are not discounted.
1.20 Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that itrelates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted atthebalance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
1.21 Adopted IFRS not yet applied The following Adopted IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements.

1.22 Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning the future that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income andexpenses.
These judgements are based on historical experience and managements best knowledge at the time and the actual results mayultimately differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The estimates and assumptions that have significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles Determining whether goodwill and other intangibles are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill and other intangible assets have been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Details of CGUs as well as further information about the assumptions made are disclosed in note 10.
1.23 Dividends Final dividends are recognised in the Groups financial statements as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders such that the Company is obliged to pay the dividend.
Interim equity dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
Pets at Home Group Plc 132 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 2 Segmental reporting The Directors consider there to be one operating and reportable segment, being that of the sale of pet products and services through retail outlets, specialist vet referral services and the Groups websites.
The Groups Board receives monthly financial information at this level and uses this information to monitor the performance of the store portfolio, allocate resources and make operational decisions.
The internal reporting received focuses on the Group as a whole and does not identify other individual segments.
To increase transparency, the Group has decided to include an additional voluntary disclosure analysing revenue within the reportable segment.

Impairment testing Cash generating units CGUs within the Group are considered to be the body of stores including vets practices, specialist referral centres andtheGroups websites as disclosed in note 2.
The Group is deemed to have one overall group of CGUs as follows: Goodwill At 30 March At 31 March 2017 2016 000 000 Pets at Home Group 979,845 965,925 The recoverable amount of the CGU group has been calculated with reference to its value in use.
The key assumptions of this calculation are shown below: At 30 March At 31 March 2017 2016 Period on which management approved forecasts are based years 3 3 Growth rate applied beyond approved forecast period 2% 3% Discount rate pre-tax 10% 10% Pets at Home Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 143 Notes forming part of the financial statements continued 12 Intangible assets continued The goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and the recoverable amount is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use a post-tax cash flow projection based on a three year plan approved by the Board.
The plan is adjusted to remove the contribution from and costs associated with new stores and veterinary practices.
The key assumptions in the business plan are like-for-like sales growth, gross and operating profit margins.
The forecast assumptions reflect continual innovation and our deep understanding of our customers.
The projections are based on all available information and growth rates do notexceed growth rates achieved in prior periods.
A different set of assumptions may be more appropriate in future years depending on changes inthe macro-economic environment.
The discount rate was estimated based on past experience and industry average weighted average cost of capital.
The Directors have assumed agrowth rate projection beyond the three year period based on inflationary increases.
The total recoverable amount in respect of goodwill for the CGU group as assessed by the Directors using the above assumptions is greater than thecarrying amount and therefore no impairment charge has been booked in each period.
The Directors consider that it is not reasonably possible for the assumptions to change so significantly as to eliminate the excess.
A number of sensitivities have been applied to the assumptions in reaching this conclusion including: Reduction in growth rate applied beyond forecast period by 160 bps Increasing the discount rate by 200 bps Decreasing the sales growth assumption in the forecast period by 300 bps in combination with an increase in the discount rate of 20 bps andareduction in the long term growth rate by 50 bps None of the above would result in an impairment.
Disposal of Farm-Away Ltd. During the period the Group disposed of Farm-Away Ltd and its subsidiary RideAway York Ltd.
There has been no allocation of goodwill under IAS 36 as part of the disposal accounting as the assets of Farm-Away Ltd did not form a CGU against which the carrying value of assets is monitored.
Nopartial disposal of goodwill has been recognised as the future cash flows against which the carrying value of assets are measured against are notimpacted by the disposal of the subsidiary companies.

At 30 March 2017 the inventory provision amounted to 1.9m 31 March 2016: 2.0m.
The inventory provision is calculated by reference totheage of the stock keeping unit.

As part of the amendment, 325m of the Groups term loans under the previous terms of the Senior Financing Facilities were repaid via drawings under the Groups RCF along with cash from the Groups existing resources.
The amended RCF expires in April 2020 and is reviewed each period.
Interest is charged at LIBOR plus a margin based on leverage net debt: EBITDA.
Face value represents the principal value ofthe Senior Finance Bank Loans.
The bank loan is secured against the various tangible, intangible and monetary assets of the Group excluding investments in joint ventures and hedging agreements.
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, being the principal value of the loan net of attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at a carrying value, which represents the amortised cost of the loans using the effective interest method less any impairment losses.
At 30 March 2017 the Group had a revolving credit facility of 260m with a drawn amount of 210m.
The analysis of repayments on the loans is as follows: At 30 March At 31 March 2017 2016 000 000 Within one year or repayable on demand Between one and two years Between two and five years 210,000 202,000 210,000 202,000 The combined loans at 30 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 are held by the Company.

A provision is made where the rent receivable on theproperties is less than the rent payable, or where management consider there to be a risk on the sublet.
The timing of the utilisation of these provisions is variable dependent upon the lease expiry dates of the properties concerned, which vary between 10 and 15 years.
Market conditions have a significant impact and hence the assumptions on future cash flows are reviewed regularly and revisions to the provision made where necessary.
In estimating the required provision an assumption is made on the average length to provide for.
In the event that this assumption was to increase by one year, then the provision would increase by 230,000.
The provision is discounted at a rate of 7%, being the estimated average implicit lease rate.
Adecrease in this rate of 100 bps would increase the provision by 33,000.
The Company did not hold any provisions at 30 March 2017 or 31 March 2016.

Risk management framework Risk management in respect of financial risk is carried out by the Group Treasury function under policies approved by the Board ofDirectors.
TheBoard of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
TheBoard provides written principals, through its Group Treasury Policy, for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments and investment of excessliquidity.
The main objectives of the Group Treasury function are: To ensure shareholder and management expectations are managed on cash flow and earnings volatility resulting from financial market movements To protect the expected cash flow and earnings from interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations to within parameters acceptable totheBoard and shareholders To control banking costs and service levels Pets at Home Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 151 Notes forming part of the financial statements continued 22 Financial instruments continued Market risk i Foreign currency risk The Group sources a significant level of purchases in foreign currency, in excess of US $50 million each financial year, and monitors itsforeign currency requirements through short, medium and long term cash flow forecasting.
The value of purchases in US dollars continues toincrease each year and the risk management policy has evolved with this increased risk.
At 30 March 2017, the Groups policy is to hedge between 75% and 95% of the forecast foreign exchange transactions on a rolling 10to 12 month basis, using foreign currency bank accounts and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The transactions are deemed to be highlyprobable and are based on historical knowledge and forecast purchase and sales projections.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk is as follows.
This is based on the carrying amount for monetary financial instruments, except forderivatives which are based on notional amounts: 30 March 2017 Euro US Dollar HKD Total 000 000 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 6 567 2 575 Trade payables 576 4,930 5,506 Forward exchange contracts 31 1,448 1,479 Balance sheet exposure 539 2,914 2 3,452 31 March 2016 Euro US Dollar HKD Total 000 000 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 4 2 6 Trade payables 516 2,229 2,745 Forward exchange contracts 118 1,172 1,290 Balance sheet exposure 394 1,057 2 1,449 Sensitivity analysis A 5% weakening of the following currencies against the pound sterling at the period end date in both years would have increased decreased profit or loss or equity by the amounts shown below.
This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at that date.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates and interest rates, remain constant.

Pets at Home Group Plc 152 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements ii Interest rate risk  The Groups interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings.
As at 30 March 2017 the Group had a senior facility with a face value totalling 210.0m.
The Groups borrowings as at 30 March 2017 incur interest at a rate of 1.25% plus LIBOR at current leverage, which exposes the Group tocash flow interest rate risk.
The analysis of loan repayments is detailed in note 18.
The Pets at Home Groups policy with regard to interest rate risk is to hedge the appropriate level of borrowings by entering into fixed rate agreements.
The Group has entered into two fixed rate interest rate swap agreements over a total of 152.8m of the senior facility borrowings at the balance sheet date at a blended fixed rate of 0.99%.
One swap expires on 30 March 2018.
The other swap has been taken out over 142.1m of the borrowings to cover the year commencing 30 March 2018 at a fixed rate of 0.183%.
The hedges are structured to hedge atleast 70% of the forecast outstanding debt for the next year.
Profile At the balance sheet date the interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments was: Group Company Book value Book value Book value Book value At 30 March At 31 March At 30 March At 31 March 2017 2016 2017 2016 000 000 000 000 Fixed rate instruments Financial liabilities 152,096 149,091 152,096 149,091 Variable rate instruments Financial liabilities 57,200 52,000 57,200 52,000 Total financial liabilities 209,296 201,091 209,296 201,091 All borrowings bear a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR.
Group policy is to hedge at least 70% of the loan to ensure a fixed rate of interest.
Therefore, designated above is the portion of the loan hedged by a fixed rate interest rate swap and the remaining un-hedged portion isdesignated as variable rate.
Sensitivityanalysis A change of 50 basis points in interest rates at the period end date would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below.
This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to risk exposures existing atthatdate.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant and considers the effect of financial instruments with variable interest rates, financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss or available for sale with fixed interest rates and the fixed rate element of interest rate swaps.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for the comparative period.

Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
The Group ensures that the banks used for the financing of the loan facilities and interest rate swap agreements hold an acceptable risk rating by independent parties.
The Group has in place certain guarantees over the bank loans taken out by a number of veterinary practice companies in which it holds an investment.
Further details of these guarantees are disclosed in note 26.
The performance of the veterinary practice companies is reviewed onanongoing basis.
Exposure to credit risk The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk, being the carrying amount of financial assets, is summarised in the table within the fair values section below.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Management prepares and monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups cash balances based on expected cash flows to ensure, as far as possible, thatit will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions without risking damage to the Groups reputation.
Covenants are monitored on a regular basis to ensure there is no risk or breach which would lead to an Event of Default and compliance certificates are issued as required to the syndicate agent.

Trade and other payables and receivables The fair value of these items are considered to be their carrying value as the impact of discounting future cash flows has been assessed asnotmaterial.
Cash and cash equivalents The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated as its carrying amount where the cash is repayable on demand.
Where it is not repayable ondemand such as term deposits, then the fair value is estimated at the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate ofinterest at the balance sheet date.
Long term and short term borrowings The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates its carrying value as it has an interest rate based on LIBOR.
Short term deposits The fair value of short term deposits is considered to be their carrying value as the balances are held in floating rate accounts where the interest rateis reset to market rates.
Derivative financial instruments The fair value of interest rate swap contracts and forward exchange contracts are calculated by management based on external valuations received from the Groups bankers and is based on forward exchange rates and anticipated future interest yield respectively.
Contingent consideration Contingent consideration on acquisition of a subsidiary is valued at fair value at the time of acquisition.
Any subsequent changes in fair values arerecognised in profit or loss.
Put and call options over non-controlling interests Put and call options over non-controlling interests are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and included within the valuation of goodwill.

Pets at Home Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 161 Notes forming part of the financial statements continued 23 Share based payments continued d Performance,  The Matching Awards granted on 17 March 2014 vested subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions outlined below.
To the extent that any future awards are granted, different conditions may apply in the absolute discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The performance conditions are as follows: 75% of the Matching Award was subject to the CAGR in the Companys earnings per share EPS over three financial years, namely FY15, FY16and FY17 together the Performance Period which, for the avoidance of doubt, ended on 30 March 2017.
If the CAGR in the Companys EPS was 10%, then 10% of the total Matching Award would vest.
If the CAGR in the Companys EPS was 17.5% or more, then 75% ofthe total Matching Award would vest.
Vesting is on a straight-line basis between these two points.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the CAGR inEPS was less than 10% over the Performance Period then the amount of the Matching Award which would vest under this EPS performance condition would be nil.
25% of the total Matching Award was subject to the Companys total shareholder return TSR as compared to a comparator group made upofa selected group of retail companies over the Performance Period.
Vesting of 6.25% of the total Matching Award would occur for median performance.
Vesting of the maximum 25% of the total Matching Award would occur for upper quartile performance or above.
Vesting would occur on a straight-line basis between these two points.
If the Companys TSR performance over the Performance Period was below median, then the amount of the Matching Award which would vest under this TSR performance condition would be nil.
To the extent vested as to performance, Matching Awards became exercisable in three equal amounts on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of 17 March 2014, but subject to continued employment with the Group.

Part II of the CSOP provides for the grant of unapproved options.
The tax approved options under Part I of the CSOP will be exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment with the Group.
These awards will be granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of the shares at the grant date as agreed with HMRC.

Colleagues who only receive options under the CSOP in connection with Admission will not be subject to performance conditions.
d Exerciseprice The price at which an option holder may acquire shares on the exercise of an option shall be determined by the Board but shall not be less than thegreater of market value of a share at the time of grant and its nominal value.

e Individuallimits No option may be granted to an eligible colleague under Part I of the CSOP which would result in the aggregate exercise prices of shares comprised in all outstanding options granted to him her under Part I, when aggregated with outstanding options held under any other tax approved executive share option scheme established by the Company, exceeding the tax approved limit currently 30,000.
In addition, both under Part I and II of the CSOP the aggregate exercise price of shares comprised in options granted to a colleague under the CSOP and the PSP in any financial year shall not exceed 150% of his her annual salary for that year.
For the purposes of these limits, market value will be calculated by reference to the market value of the shares on or prior to the relevant date ofgrant as determined by the Board following consultation with the Remuneration Committee and subject to HMRC approval if applicable.
This enables options to be granted under the same terms as Part I of the CSOP but without complying with the particular requirements of the legislation applicable to tax approved CSOP Schemes.
The provisions of the CSOP that do not apply under Part II include the 30,000 limit and the need to seek HMRC approval for the scheme and subsequent amendments as applicable.

The expected life is the average expected period to exercise, which has been taken as three years.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds with a life equal to this expected life.
