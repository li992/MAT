4 In 2015, the Group acquired employee benefit obligations as part of its acquisitions of Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia.
These obligations are described further below.
Employee benefit obligations At Foreign At Foreign At Pension Actuarial exchange 30 June Pension Actuarial exchange 30 June 1 July 2015 payments losses movement 2016 payments gains movement 2017 m m m m m m m m m Sky Deutschland defined benefit obligations 10 2 2 14 1 1 14 Sky Italia employee benefit obligations 16 1 1 3 19 1 2 20 26 1 3 5 33 1 1 3 34 108 Sky plc Financial statements a Sky Deutschland Sky Deutschland operates unfunded final salary defined benefit pension plans that are not covered by plan assets.
These plans were closed to future accrual.
The total defined benefit obligation at 30 June 2017 was 14 million 2016: 14 million.
The amount of the pension entitlement depends on the salary of the respective employee at the time of retirement.
Employee benefit obligations will be funded out of current and future earnings.
The present value of the obligations was measured using the projected unit credit method applying the following principal assumptions: Actuarial projections including assumptions about cost-of-living increases, salary increases, etc.
were made to value the future benefits expected to be paid by the post-employment plan in the event of mortality both during and after employment, disability and early retirement.
Seniority and rates of employee turnover as well as salary and benefit levels at the measurement date were also taken into account in projecting future benefits: The average present value at the measurement date has been calculated on the basis of the assumed annual discount rate and the probability of services being rendered: The following specific assumptions have been used: Annual discount rate of 1.95% 2016: 1.50% : Annual growth rate of 2.00% 2016: 2.00% : Annual salary growth rate of 2.50% 2016: 2.50% : and Annual fluctuation rate employees of 7.00% 2016: 7.00%.
Since there are no plan assets as defined by IAS 19 revised 2011 and all actuarial gains and losses are recognised when incurred, the present value of the defined benefit obligation of the pension obligations and the obligations similar to pensions is equivalent to the provision recognised on the balance sheet.
Reasonably possible changes to these assumptions would not have a material impact on the provision.
The weighted average maturity of the defined benefit obligation is 21 years 2016: 22 years as of the balance sheet date.
Expected pension payments in the year to 30 June 2018 are less than 1 million 2016: less than 1 million.
b Sky Italia Sky Italias employee benefit obligations relate to a provision for employee retirement, determined using actuarial techniques as discussed further below and regulated by Article 2120 of the Italian Civil Code.
The total employee benefit obligation at 30 June 2017 was 20 million 2016: 19 million.
The benefit is paid upon retirement as a lump sum, the amount of which corresponds to the total of the provisions accrued during the employees service period based on payroll costs as revalued until retirement.
Seniority and rates of employee turnover as well as salary and benefit levels at the measurement date were also taken into account in projecting future benefits: The average present value at the measurement date has been calculated on the basis of the assumed annual discount rate and the probability of services being rendered: The following specific assumptions have been used: Annual discount rate of 0.01% 2016: 0.01% : Annual inflation rate of 1.20% 2016: 0.40% : Annual revaluation rate of 2.40% 2016: 1.80% : Annual fluctuation rate employees of 3.74% 2016: 5.40% : and Annual mortality rate of 0.43% 2016: 0.11%.
The weighted average maturity of the defined benefit obligation is 15 years 2016: 17 years as of the balance sheet date.
Expected pension payments in the year to 30 June 2018 are 2 million 2016: 1 million.
