com Notes to the financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies Accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements.
In the income statement, the Group presents specific adjusting items separately.
In the judgement of the Directors, for the reader to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information, specific adjusting items need to be disclosed separately because of their size and nature.
Underlying measures of performance exclude specific adjusting items.
Specific adjusting items include: amortisation of intangible assets arising from acquisitions: pension net finance expense: gains losses on business divestments and disposal of property and investments: transaction costs in respect of business acquisitions: impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets: the tax impact of the above: and other significant non-recurring deferred tax movements.
Basis of preparation The Groups financial statements, approved by the Directors, have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the Directors Report on page 58 and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRS and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on page 144.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and other relevant financial assets and liabilities.
Non-current assets held for sale are held at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The Groups reporting currency is sterling and unless otherwise stated the financial statements are rounded to the nearest 100,000.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings to 31 March 2017.
The purchase method of accounting has been adopted.
Those subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the date control is obtained to the date that control is lost usually on acquisition and disposal respectively.
An investor controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
This is the IFRS 10 definition of control.
The Group comprises certain entities that are operated under the management of a Proxy Board.
Details of the Proxy Board arrangements and the powers of the proxy holders and QinetiQ management are set out in the Corporate Governance section of this Annual Report.
IFRS 10 is the accounting standard now applicable in respect of consolidation of entities.
This does not specifically deal with proxy situations.
However, having considered the terms of the Proxy agreement, the Directors consider that the Group meets the requirements of IFRS 10 in respect of control over such affected entities and, therefore, consolidates these entities in the consolidated accounts.
An associate is an undertaking over which the Group exercises significant influence, usually from 20%50% of the equity voting rights, in respect of financial and operating policy.
A joint venture is an undertaking over which the Group exercises joint control.
Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method from the date of acquisition to the date of disposal.
The Groups investments in associates and joint ventures are held at cost including goodwill on acquisition and any post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate less any impairment to the recoverable amount.
Where an associate or joint venture has net liabilities, full provision is made for the Groups share of liabilities where there is a constructive or legal obligation to provide additional funding to the associate or joint venture.
The financial statements of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are adjusted where necessary to ensure compliance with Group accounting policies.
On consolidation, all intra-Group income, expenses and balances are eliminated.
Revenue Revenue represents the value of work performed for customers, and is measured net of value added taxes and other sales taxes on the following bases: Service contracts The Groups service contract arrangements are accounted for under IAS 18 Revenue taking into account each partys enforceable rights regarding the services provided and expected manner of settlement.
When the outcome of a contract involving the rendering of services can be reliably estimated, revenue associated with the transaction is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the end of the reporting period and reflecting the probable economic benefits that will flow to the entity.
This is normally measured by the proportion of contract costs incurred for work performed to date compared with the estimated total contract costs after making suitable allowances for technical and other risks related to performance milestones yet to be achieved.
No profit is recognised on contracts until the outcome of the contract can be reliably estimated.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense.
The Group generally does not undertake construction contracts.
QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 107 www.
com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 107 Goods sold Sales of goods are recognised in the income statement on delivery of the product or when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer and revenue and costs can be reliably measured.
Royalties and intellectual property Royalty revenue is recognised over the period to which the royalty relates.
Intellectual property revenue can be attributed either to perpetual licences or to limited licences.
Limited licences are granted for a specified period and revenue is recognised over the period of the licence.
Perpetual licences are granted for unlimited time frames and revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer.
Segmental information Segmental information is presented according to the Groups internal management reporting structure and the markets in which it operates.
Segmental results represent the contribution of the different segments to the profit of the Group.
Corporate expenses are allocated to the corresponding segments.
Unallocated items mainly comprise specific adjusting items.
Specific adjusting items are referred to in note 4.
Segmental assets and liabilities information is not regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker.
Research and development expenditure R&D costs incurred in respect of specific contracts placed by customers are recognised within operating costs and revenue is recognised in respect of the R&D services performed.
Internally funded development expenditure is capitalised in the balance sheet where there is a clearly defined project, the expenditures are separately identifiable, the project is technically and commercially feasible, all costs are recoverable by future revenue and the resources are committed to complete the project.
Such capitalised costs are amortised over the forecast period of sales resulting from the development.
All other R&D costs are expensed to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
If the research phase cannot be clearly distinguished from the development phase, the respective project-related costs are treated as if they were incurred in the research phase only and expensed.
Financing Financing represents the financial expense on borrowings accounted for using the effective rate method and the financial income earned on funds invested.
Exchange differences on financial assets and liabilities and the income or expense from interest hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement are included within finance income and finance expense.
Financing also includes the net finance expense in respect of defined benefit pension schemes.
Taxation The taxation charge is based on the taxable profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Current tax and deferred tax are charged or credited to the income statement, except where they relate to items charged or credited to equity, in which case the relevant tax is charged or credited to equity.
Deferred taxation is the tax attributable to the temporary differences that appear when taxation authorities recognise and measure assets and liabilities with rules that differ from those of the consolidated financial statements.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Any changes in the tax rates are recognised in the income statement unless related to items directly recognised in equity.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on all taxable temporary differences excluding non-deductible goodwill.
Deferred tax assets are recognised on all deductible temporary differences provided that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only where there is a legally enforceable right to offset and there is an intention to settle balances on a net basis.
Discontinued operation A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group and which: represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations: is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations: or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income is re-presented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.
Goodwill Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates is included in the carrying value of equity accounted investments.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill related to the entity sold.

com Notes to the financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Intangible assets Intangible assets arising from business combinations are recognised at fair value and are amortised over their expected useful lives, typically between one and sixteen years.
Internally generated intangible assets are recorded at cost, including labour, directly attributable costs and any third-party expenses.
The multi-period excess earnings method and the relief-from-royalty method are both used for fair valuing intangible assets arising from acquisitions.
The multiperiod excess earnings method considers the present value of net cash flows expected to be generated by customer relationships, by excluding any cash flows related to contributory assets.
The relief-from-royalty method considers the discounted estimated royalty payments that are expected to be avoided as a result of the patents or trademarks being owned.
Purchased intangible assets are recognised at cost less amortisation.
Intangible assets are amortised over their respective useful lives on a straight-line basis as follows: Intellectual property rights 28 years Customer relationships 116 years Development costs 14 years Other 19 years Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other tangible non-current assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives to their estimated residual value as follows: Freehold buildings 2025 years Leasehold land and buildings Shorter of useful economic life and the period of the lease Plant and machinery 310 years Fixtures and fittings 510 years Computers 35 years Motor vehicles 35 years Assets under construction are included in property, plant and equipment on the basis of expenditure incurred at the balance sheet date.
In the case of assets constructed by the Group, the value includes the cost of own work completed, including directly attributable costs and interest.
The useful lives, depreciation methods and residual values applied to property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually and, if appropriate, adjusted accordingly.
Impairment of goodwill and tangible, intangible and held for sale assets At each reporting date the Group assesses whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If the carrying amount of any asset exceeds its recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment annually irrespective of any indication of impairment.
If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the respective asset or the assets in the cash-generating unit CGU are written down to their recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
The value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or CGU calculated using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
Impairment losses are expensed to the income statement.
Investments in debt and equity securities Investments held by the Group are classified as either a current asset or as a non-current asset and those classified as available-for-sale are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss, other than impairment losses, being recognised directly in equity.
When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in the income statement.
The fair value of quoted financial instruments is their bid price at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of unquoted equity investments is based on the price of the most recent investment by the Group or a third party, if available, or derived from the present value of forecast future cash flows.
Inventories Inventory and work-in-progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Work-in-progress and manufactured finished goods are valued at production cost.
Production cost includes direct production costs and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
A provision is established when the net realisable value of any inventory item is lower than its cost.
A market comparison technique is used to fair value inventories acquired through a business combination.
The fair value is determined based on the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable profit margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories.
Bid costs Costs incurred in bidding for work are normally expensed as incurred.
In the case of large multi-year government contracts the bidding process typically involves a competitive bid process to determine a preferred bidder and then a further period to reach financial close with the customer.
In these cases, the costs incurred after announcement of the Group achieving preferred bidder status are deferred to the balance sheet within work-in-progress.
From the point financial close is reached, the costs are amortised over the life of the contract.
If an opportunity for which the Group was awarded preferred bidder status fails to reach financial close, the costs deferred to that point are expensed in the income statement immediately, when it becomes likely that financial close will not be achieved.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated net of provisions for doubtful debts.
Amounts recoverable on contracts are included in trade and other receivables and represent revenue recognised in excess of amounts invoiced.
Payments received on account are included in trade and other payables and represent amounts invoiced in excess of revenue recognised.
Other receivables will also include insurance recoveries where we are virtually certain of recovery.
QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 109 www.
com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 109 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and short-term deposits that are readily convertible into cash.
In the cash flow statement overdraft balances are included in cash and equivalents.
Current and non-current liabilities Current liabilities include amounts due within the normal operating cycle of the Group.
Interest-bearing current and non-current liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and then stated at amortised cost with any difference between the cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
Costs associated with the arrangement of bank facilities or the issue of loans are held net of the associated liability presented in the balance sheet.
Capitalised issue costs are released over the estimated life of the facility or instrument to which they relate using the effective interest rate method.
If it becomes clear that the facility or instrument will be redeemed early, the amortisation of the issue costs will be accelerated.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event which can be reliably estimated, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Where appropriate, provisions are determined by discounting the expected cash flows at an appropriate discount rate reflecting the level of risk and the time value of money.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The fide-recognition of a financial instrument takes place when the Group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, when the instrument expires, or when the instrument is sold, terminated or exercised.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and thereafter held at fair value, being the market value for quoted instruments or valuation based on models and discounted cash flow calculations for unlisted instruments.
Fair value hedging Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges of currency risk or interest rate risk are recognised in the income statement.
The hedged item is held at fair value with respect to the hedged risk with any gain or loss recognised in the income statement.
Cash flow hedging Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where a hedged item results in an asset or a liability, gains and losses previously recognised in equity are included in the cost of the asset or liability.
Gains and losses previously recognised in equity are removed and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.
Leased assets Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are held by the lessee.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at the lower of the present value of minimum lease payments and fair value at the inception of the lease.
Assets are then depreciated over the shorter of their useful economic lives or the lease term.
Obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges arising in future periods, are included under financial liabilities.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at period-end rates.
Any resulting exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
Gains and losses on designated forward foreign exchange hedging contracts are matched against the foreign exchange movements on the underlying transaction.
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in its functional currency.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures, including any related goodwill, are translated to sterling at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date.
The results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures are translated to sterling using the average rates of exchange during the period.
Exchange adjustments arising from the re-translation of the opening net investment and the results for the period to the period-end rate are taken directly to equity and reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
Post-retirement benefits The Group provides both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements.
The liabilities of the Group arising from defined benefit obligations are determined using the projected unit credit method.
Valuations for accounting purposes are carried out bi-annually.
Actuarial advice is provided by external consultants.
For the funded defined benefit plans, the excess or deficit of the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation are recognised as an asset or a liability respectively.
For defined benefit plans, the cost charged to the income statement consists of administrative expenses and the net interest cost.
There is no service cost due to the fact the plans are closed to future accrual.
The finance element of the pension charge is shown in finance expense and the administration cost element is charged as a component of operating costs in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses and re-measurement gains and losses are recognised immediately in full through the statement of comprehensive income.
Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Share-based payments The Group operates share-based payment arrangements with employees.
The fair value of equity-settled awards for share-based payments is determined on grant and expensed straight line over the period from grant to the date of earliest unconditional exercise.
The fair value of cash-settled awards for share-based payments is determined each period end until they are exercised or lapse.
The value is expensed straight line over the period from grant to the date of earliest unconditional exercise.
The charges for both equity and cash-settled share-based payments are updated annually for non-market-based vesting conditions.

Significant accounting policies continued Share capital Ordinary share capital of the Company is recorded as the proceeds received, less issue costs.
Company shares held by the employee benefit trusts are held at the consideration paid.
They are classified as own shares within equity.
Any gain or loss on the purchase, sale or issue of Company shares is recorded in equity.
Recent accounting developments Developments adopted by the Group in 2017 with no material impact on the financial statements The following UK GAAP and EU-endorsed Standards and amendments, improvements and interpretations of published standards are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016 and have been adopted with no material impact on the Groups financial statements: IFRS 11 Joint arrangements amendment to add guidance on how to account for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation that constitutes a business.
IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment amendments that change the financial reporting for bearer plants such as grape vines and rubber trees.
Bearer plants should now be accounted for in the same way as property, plant and equipment.
The produce growing on bearer plants will remain within the scope of IAS 41.
IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment and IAS 38 Intangible assets clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation.
IAS 27 R Separate financial statements amendment allowing entities to use the equity method to account for investment in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in their separate financial statements.
IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements amendment to improve presentation and disclosure in financial reports.
IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and joint ventures amendments to both applying the consolidation exemption and also on the sale or contribution of assets note not yet endorsed for use in the EU.
Annual improvement 2012-2014 cycle: IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations amendment regarding methods of disposal.
IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures amendment regarding servicing contracts and the transfer of financial assets to a third party under conditions which allow the transferor to derecognise the asset but retain continuing involvement in them.
A second amendment clarifies that some interim disclosures in IFRS 7 are not required.
IAS 19 Employee benefits amendments regarding discount rates: when determining the discount rate for post-employment benefit obligations, it is the currency that the liabilities are denominated in that is important and not the country where they arise.
IAS 34 Interim financial reporting amendment requiring information disclosed elsewhere in the interim financial report to be cross-referenced from the interim financial statement to the location of that information.
Developments expected in future periods of which the impact is being assessed IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: The final Standard was published in May 2014 and the IASB has taken the decision to defer the effective date of IFRS 15 to 1 January 2018 i. e. FY19 for QinetiQ.
The new Standard introduces a five-step model to the principle of revenue recognition.
The framework includes identifying the contract with the customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognising revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
QinetiQ is currently undertaking an assessment of the impact of the new standard on its financial statements when adopted.
At the current time it is not possible to quantify the impact on revenue.
Potential impacts being considered on a contract-by-contract basis include whether the current methodology for recognising revenue over time remains appropriate, the treatment of contract modifications, variable consideration, determination and distinction of performance obligations, determination of agency and principal relationships and licences.
QinetiQ observes that where services provided by QinetiQ are substantially the same over the life of the contract, QinetiQ will apply the series guidance stated in IFRS 15.
This is not expected to affect the overall amount of revenue recognised under a contract but it may affect the phasing.
The Groups on-going IFRS 15 project includes development of new internal revenue recognition accounting policies and guidance and further training across the Group in order to apply the requirements of IFRS 15 to all QinetiQ contracts and further work is being undertaken to quantify the impact of the transition to this new standard with effect from 2019.
QinetiQ is also undertaking an analysis of the transitional guidance which allows for two different approaches: the retrospective method with optional practical expedients or the cumulative effect method.
Under the retrospective method, QinetiQ would need to restate prior year comparatives and recognise the cumulative effect of applying the new standard in equity at the start of the earliest presented comparative period.
Under the cumulative method, QinetiQ would apply the new standard as of the date of initial application, with no restatement of comparative period amounts.
It would record the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard which would affect revenue and costs as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity at the date of initial application.
Under the cumulative effect method, the provisions of the new standard apply only to contracts that are open i. e. not complete under previous GAAP at the date of initial application.
QinetiQ acknowledge that the disclosure requirements under IFRS 15 are more prescriptive and extensive than under current GAAP.
QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 111 www.
com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 111 Leases: The final Standard IFRS 16 Leases was published in January 2016.
Under the new Standard, companies will recognise new assets and liabilities, bringing added transparency to the balance sheet.
IFRS 16 eliminates the current dual accounting model for lessees, which distinguishes between on-balance sheet finance leases and off-balance sheet operating leases.
Instead, there is a single, on-balance sheet accounting model that is similar to current finance lease accounting.
Lessor accounting remains similar to current practice i. e. lessors continue to classify leases as finance and operating leases.
The Standard will be effective from 1 January 2019 for QinetiQ subject to EU endorsement.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments This new Standard on accounting for financial instruments will replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The Standard will be effective from 1 January 2018.
Developments expected in future periods with no material impact on the Groups financial statements The Directors anticipate that the adoption of the following new, revised, amended and improved published standards and interpretations, which were in issue at the date of authorisation of these financial statements, will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group when they become applicable in future periods: Amendments to IFRS 2, 4, 9 and 15: Amendments to IAS 7, 12 and 40.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies The following commentary is intended to highlight those policies that are critical to the business based on the level of management judgement required in their application, their complexity and their potential impact on the results and financial position reported for the Group.
The level of management judgment required includes assumptions and estimates about future events that are uncertain and the actual outcome of which may result in a materially different outcome from that anticipated.
Revenue and profit recognition The estimation process required to evaluate the potential outcome of contracts and projects requires skill, knowledge and experience from a variety of sources within the business to assess the status of the contract, costs to complete, internal and external labour resources required and other factors.
This process is carried out continuously throughout the business to ensure that project and contract assessments reflect the latest status of such work.
No profit is recognised on a contract until the outcome can be reliably estimated.
Business combinations and related goodwill Intangible assets recognised on business combinations have been valued using established methods and models to determine estimated value and useful economic life, with input, where appropriate, from external valuation consultants.
Such methods require the use of estimates which may produce results that are different from actual future outcomes.
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
This process relies on the use of estimates of the future profitability and cash flows of its CGUs which may differ from the actual results delivered.
In addition, the Group reviews whether identified intangible assets have suffered any impairment.
Further details on the sensitivity of the carrying value of goodwill to changes in the key assumptions are set out in note 13.
Tax In determining the Groups provisions for current tax and deferred tax, it is necessary to assess the likelihood and timing of recovery of tax losses created, and to consider transactions in a small number of key tax jurisdictions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
To the extent that the final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will be made to current tax and deferred tax provisions held in the period the determination is made.
Other payables, provisions and contingent liabilities The Group holds liabilities in respect of environmental and regulatory issues see note 23.
The Group operates in regulated environments and a failure to comply with particular regulations could result in fines and or penalties.
There is judgement required in determining the significance of any instances of potential noncompliance and potential liability based on managements assessment of the most likely outcome.
The financial statements also disclose contingent liabilities in respect of legal claims and regulatory issues which have not been provided for on the basis that they are not considered to qualify for recognition as provisions.
Judgement is required in these assessments.
Post-retirement benefits The Groups defined benefit pension obligations and net income statement costs are based on key assumptions, including discount rates, mortality and inflation.
Management exercises its best judgement, in consultation with actuarial advisors, in selecting the values for these assumptions that are the most appropriate to the Group.
Small changes in these assumptions at the balance sheet date, individually or collectively, may result in significant changes in the size of the net surplus deficit.
Further details of these assumptions are set out in note 30.

QinetiQ Target Systems formerly Meggitt Target Systems On 21 December 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Meggitt Target Systems for 60.3m.
The company is a provider of unmanned aerial, naval and land-based target systems and services for test and evaluation T&E and operational training and rehearsal.
On the date of acquisition, the company changed its name to QinetiQ Target Systems and integrated into QinetiQs international business.
QinetiQ Target Systems provides target systems to approximately 40 countries with operations in Alberta, Canada and Kent, UK.
The acquisition of this company enhances QinetiQs product portfolio, market position and ability to deliver global test and evaluation services.
If the acquisition had occurred on the first day of the financial year, Group revenue for the period would have been 806.3m and the Group profit before tax would have been 136.6m.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed The following table summarises the recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition and the adjustments required to the book values of the assets and liabilities in order to present the net assets of these businesses at fair value and in accordance with Group accounting policies.
The fair values remain provisional, but will be finalised within 12 months of acquisition.

At 31 March 2017, the Group had unused tax losses of 141.7m 2016: 154.8m which are available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset of 3.7m has been recognised in the year, with the income statement credit classified as a specific adjusting item.
This asset is in respect of 18.8m of UK losses and 1.4m of Canadian losses.
No deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of the remaining 121.5m of losses due to the uncertainty over the timing of their utilisation.
The Group has 66.5m of time limited losses of which US capital losses of 30.0m will expire in 2020.
The remaining 36.5m of losses are time limited with 4.4m expiring in 2034, 22.7m in 2035 and 9.4m in 2036.
A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and to 18% effective 1 April 2020 had previously been substantively enacted on 26 October 2015, and an additional reduction to 17% effective 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016.
This will reduce the Company's future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 March 2017 have been calculated based on these rates.
Factors affecting future tax charges The effective tax rate continues to be below the UK statutory rate, primarily as a result of the benefit of research and development expenditure credits in the UK.
The effective tax rate is expected to remain below the UK statutory rate in the medium term, subject to the impact of any tax legislation changes, the geographic mix of profits and the assumption that the benefits of net R&D expenditure credits retained by the Group remain in the tax line.
Future recognition of unrecognised tax losses will also affect future tax charges.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The weighted average number of shares used excludes those shares bought by the Group and held as own shares see note 28.
For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares arising from unvested share-based awards including share options.

QinetiQ Target Systems Limited was acquired during the year on 21 December 2016 and the goodwill arising of 24.5m was allocated to the existing UK Global Products CGU.
The Group acquired RubiKon Group Pty Limited on 31 January 2017 and the goodwill arising of AUD $6.7m 3.9m was allocated to the existing Australia CGU.
Goodwill is attributable to the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired and includes expected synergies, future growth prospects and employee knowledge, expertise and security clearances.
The Group tests each CGU for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Impairment testing is dependent on managements estimates and judgements, particularly as they relate to the forecasting of future cash flows, the discount rates selected and expected long-term growth rates.
Significant headroom exists in all CGUs with the exception of US Global Products see below and management considers that there are no likely variations in the key assumptions which would lead to an impairment being recognised in any of the other CGUs.
Key assumptions Cash flows The value-in-use calculations generally use discounted future cash flows based on financial plans approved by the Board covering a two-year period.
Discounted cash flows for the US Global Products CGU were based on a Board-approved three-year plan, reflecting increases in revenue from new product lines.
Cash flows for periods beyond these periods are extrapolated based on the last year of the plans, with a terminal growth-rate assumption applied.
Terminal growth rates The specific plans for each of the CGUs have been extrapolated using a terminal growth rate of 2.0% 2.4% 2016: 2.0% 2.4%.
The US terminal growth rate was 2.0% 2016: 2.4%.
Growth rates are based on managements estimates which take into consideration the long-term nature of the industry in which the CGUs operate and external forecasts as to the likely growth of the industry in the longer term.
Discount rates The Groups weighted average cost of capital was used as a basis in determining the discount rate to be applied, adjusted for risks specific to the market characteristics of CGUs, as appropriate on a pre-tax basis.
This is considered to appropriately estimate a market participant discount rate.
The pre-tax discount rates applied for the two EMEA Services CGUs were 10.9% and 16.1%, for the UK Global Products CGU was 10.8% and for the US Global Products CGU was 11.2%.
Sensitivity analysis shows that the value of the terminal year cash flow, the discount rate and the terminal growth rates have a significant impact on the value of the discounted cash flow.
Significant CGUs US Global Products The carrying value of the goodwill for the US Global Products CGU, which had been written down in the prior year, was 43.4m as at 31 March 2017 2016: 37.9m.
The recoverable amount of this CGU as at 31 March 2017, based on value in use and calculated using the assumptions noted above, is marginally higher than the carrying value of net operating assets of 49.5m and no further impairment is required in the year to 31 March 2017.
The key sensitivity impacting on the value in use calculations is the terminal year cash flows.
These cash flows include certain assumptions about revenue and profit in respect of new product lines still to be launched and the success of winning certain government contracts.
An increase in the discount rate or a decrease in the terminal growth rate by 1% would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount.
However, a reduction of 1.5m in the terminal year cash flows would lead to the recoverable amount no longer exceeding the carrying value.
Any additional reduction in terminal year cash flows would result in an impairment of the goodwill of this CGU.
Other CGUs The UK Global Products CGU and the two individual CGUs within EMEA Services all have significant headroom.
The carrying value of goodwill for the UK Global Products CGU as at 31 March 2017 was 30.3m 2016: 5.5m.
The carrying values of goodwill for the two EMEA Services CGUs as at 31 March 2017 were 27.5m and 6.6m 2016: 27.5m and 2.2m.
The Directors have not identified any other likely changes in other significant assumptions between 31 March 2017 and the signing of the financial statements that would cause the carrying value of the recognised goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.

Financial risk management The Groups international operations expose it to financial risks that include the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks.
Treasury and risk management policies, which are set by the Board, specify guidelines on financial risks and the use of financial instruments to manage risk.
The instruments and techniques used to manage exposures include foreign currency derivatives.
Group treasury monitors financial risks and compliance with risk management policies.
There have been no changes in any risk management policies since the year end.
A Fair values of financial instruments The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.
The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1 measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 2 derivatives comprise forward foreign exchange contracts which have been fair valued using forward exchange rates that are quoted in an active market: and Level 3 measured using inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data i. e. unobservable inputs.
The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as at 31 March 2017: all figures in million Note Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets Available-for-sale investments 24 10.4 10.4 Current other investments 20 1.3 1.3 Non-current other investments 16 0.1 0.1 Non-current derivative financial instruments 24 0.3 0.3 Liabilities Current derivative financial instruments 24 0.8 0.8 Non-current derivative financial instruments 24 0.3 0.3 Total 11.7 0.8 0.1 11.0 The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as at 31 March 2016: all figures in million Total Note Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets Available-for-sale investments 24 9.9 9.9 Current other investments 20 1.7 1.7 Current derivative financial instruments 24 0.6 0.6 Non-current other investments 16 0.1 0.1 Non-current derivative financial instruments 24 0.1 0.1 Liabilities Current derivative financial instruments 24 0.2 0.2 Non-current derivative financial instruments 24 0.2 0.2 Total 11.6 0.3 0.1 12.0 For cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and bank and current borrowings, the fair value of the financial instruments approximate to their carrying value as a result of the short maturity periods of these financial instruments.
For trade and other receivables, allowances are made within the carrying value for credit risk.
For other financial instruments, the fair value is based on market value, where available.
Where market values are not available, the fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows to net present value using prevailing market-based interest rates translated at the year end rates, except for unlisted fixed asset investments where fair value equals carrying value.
There have been no transfers between levels.

com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 131 B Interest rate risk The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest costs and to reduce volatility in reported earnings.
The Groups current policy is to require rates to be fixed for 30%80% of the level of borrowings, which is achieved primarily through fixed-rate borrowings.
Where there are significant changes in the level and or structure of debt, policy permits borrowings to be 100% fixed, with regular Board reviews of the appropriateness of this fixed percentage.
At 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 the Group had no borrowings.

Floating-rate financial liabilities bear interest at the relevant national LIBOR equivalent.
Trade and other receivables payables and deferred finance costs are excluded from this analysis.
Interest rate risk management The revolving credit facility is floating-rate and undrawn as at 31 March 2017.
C Currency risk Transactional currency exposure The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional currency.
It is Group policy that when such a sale or purchase is certain, the net foreign exchange exposure is hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing are undertaken for all the Groups transactional hedge contracts.
The table below shows the Groups currency exposures, being exposures on currency transactions that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating company involved.

The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the currency exposures that arise on sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies, as the transaction occurs.
The principal contract amounts of the outstanding forward currency contracts as at 31 March 2017 against sterling are net US dollars bought of 29.1m US$37.7m, net Euros bought of 7.1m 7.4m, net Swiss Francs bought of 24.7m CHF 30.6m and net Swedish Krona bought of 10.0m SEK 113.6m Translational currency exposure The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in the US.
As a result, the sterling value of the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movement in exchange rates.
The Group does not hedge against translational currency exposure to overseas net assets.

Financial risk management continued D Financial credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not currently expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
Credit risk is mitigated by a Board-approved policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment grade long-term credit rating for cash deposits.
In the normal course of business the Group operates notional cash pooling systems, where a legal right of set-off applies.
The maximum credit-risk exposure in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations under financial assets, excluding trade and other receivables, totals 223.9m 2016: 275.9m.
The Group held cash and cash equivalents of 211.8m at 31 March 2017 2016: 263.5m, which represents the maximum credit exposure on these assets.
The cash and cash equivalents were held with different financial institutions which were rated single A or better, although 122.9m 2016: 145.1m was invested in AAA-rated money funds at the year end and nil 2016: 40m was invested in deposits collateralised by security, where the security was UK gilts.
E Liquidity risk Borrowing facilities As at 31 March 2017 the Group had a revolving credit facility RCF of US$100m and 166m 2016: US$100m and 166m.

The impact of a weakening in sterling on the Groups financial assets and liabilities would be more than offset in equity and income by its impact on the Groups overseas net assets and earnings respectively.
Sensitivity on the Groups assets other than financial assets and liabilities is not included in this analysis.

The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming that certain market conditions occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected as a result of developments in global financial markets that may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the previous tables, which should not, therefore, be considered to be a projection of likely future events and losses.
The estimated changes for interest rate movements are based on an instantaneous decrease or increase of 1% 100 basis points in the specific rate of interest applicable to each class of financial instruments from the levels effective at 31 March 2017, with all other variables remaining constant.
The estimated changes for foreign exchange rates are based on an instantaneous 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all other currencies from the levels applicable at 31 March 2017, with all other variables remaining constant.
Such analysis is for illustrative purposes only in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.
The impact of transactional risk on the Groups monetary assets liabilities that are not held in the functional currency of the entity holding those assets liabilities is minimal.
A 10% weakening in sterling would also result in a minimal increase in profit before tax.

Post-retirement benefits Defined contribution plans In the UK the Group operates two defined contribution plans for the majority of its UK employees: a Group Personal Pension Plan GPP and a defined contribution section of the QinetiQ Pension Scheme.
These are both defined contribution schemes managed by Zurich.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group and employees pay fixed contributions to a third-party financial provider.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Defined benefit pension plans In the UK the Group operates the QinetiQ Pension Scheme the Scheme for a significant proportion of its UK employees.
The Scheme closed to future accrual on 31 October 2013.
After this date, defined benefit members transferred to a defined contribution scheme.
The Scheme is a final salary plan, which provides benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on the members length of service and their final pensionable earnings at closure to future accrual.
In the Scheme, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with the Consumer Price Index CPI.
The benefit payments are made from Trustee-administered funds.
Plan assets held in trusts are governed by UK regulations as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the Trustees and their composition.
Responsibility for the governance of the Scheme including investment decisions and contribution schedules lies jointly with the Company and the Board of Trustees.
The Board of Trustees must be composed of representatives of the Company and plan participants in accordance with the Schemes regulations.
The asset liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated bi-annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates on government bonds are used.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the agreed contributions have been paid.
The expected employer cash contribution to the Scheme for the year ending 31 March 2018 is 13.0m.
Triennial funding valuation The most recent completed full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was undertaken as at 30 June 2014 and resulted in an actuarially assessed surplus of 31.0m.
The next triennial valuation will be performed as at 30 June 2017.
The agreed recovery plan requires 13.0m contributions per annum until 31 March 2018, the same annual funding level as previously in place.
This includes 2.5m p. a. distributions to the Scheme, indexed by reference to CPI, from the Groups Pension Funding Partnership.
QinetiQs Pension Funding Partnership structure Following the 30 June 2011 valuation, a package of pension changes was agreed with the Trustees to provide stability to the Scheme.
As part of the package of proposals, on 26 March 2012 QinetiQ established the QinetiQ PFP Limited Partnership the Partnership with the Scheme.
Under this arrangement, properties to the capitalised value of 32.3m were transferred to the Partnership.
The transfers were affected through a 20-year sale and leaseback agreement.
The Schemes interest in the Partnership entitles it to an annual distribution of approximately 2.5m for 20 years, indexed with reference to CPI.
These contributions replaced part of the regular contributions made under the past deficit recovery payments plan.
The Schemes interest in the Partnership will revert back to QinetiQ Limited in 2032.
The Partnership is controlled by QinetiQ and its results are consolidated by the Group.
Under IAS 19, the interest held by the Scheme in the Partnership does not qualify as a plan asset for the purposes of the Groups consolidated financial statements and is, therefore, not included within the fair value of plan assets.
As a result, the Groups consolidated financial statements are unchanged by the Partnership.
In addition, the value of the property transferred to the Partnership and leased back to QinetiQ remains on the balance sheet.
QinetiQ retains the operational flexibility to substitute properties of equivalent value within the Partnership and has the option to settle outstanding amounts due under the interest before 2032 if it so chooses.
Other UK schemes In the UK the Group has a small number of employees for whom benefits are secured through the Prudential Platinum Scheme.
The net pension deficits of this scheme at 31 March 2017 amounted to nil 2016: nil.
QinetiQ also offers employees access to a Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan, but no Company contributions are paid to this arrangement.

The Scheme has assets invested in a Liability Driven Investment portfolio.
As at 31 March 2017 this hedges against 63% of the interest rate and 100% of the inflation rate risk, as measured on the Trustees gilt-funding basis.
The increase in the year of 605.4m is split between performance of the LDI funds, with valuation gains of 355.2m, and asset reallocations of 250.2m, with 179.8m switched out of equities and 70.4m out of alternative bonds.
Includes allocations to high-yield bonds, secured loans and emerging market debt.
Per the Scheme rules, the Company has an unconditional right to a refund of any surplus that may arise on cessation of the Scheme in the context of IFRIC14 paragraphs 11 b and 12 and therefore the full net pension asset can be recognised on the Groups balance sheet and the Groups minimum funding commitments to the Scheme do not give rise to an additional balance sheet liability.

It is important to note that these assumptions are long term and, in the case of the discount rate and the inflation rate, are measured by external market indicators.
The mortality assumptions as at 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 were 90% of S2PMA for males and 90% of S2PFA for females, based on year of birth making allowance for improvements in mortality in line with CMI 2013 Core Projections and a long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum.
The balance sheet net pension liability is a snapshot view which can be significantly influenced by short-term market factors.
The calculation of the surplus or deficit depends, therefore, on factors which are beyond the control of the Group principally the value at the balance sheet date of equity shares and other assets in which the Scheme has invested and long-term interest rates which are used to discount future liabilities.
The funding of the Scheme is based on long-term trends and assumptions relating to market growth, as advised by qualified actuaries and investment advisors.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is approximately 20 years.
Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure the defined benefit obligation Indicative impact on Scheme liabilities Assumption Change in assumption before deferred tax Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 35m Rate of inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 34m Life expectancy Increase by one year Increase by 46m The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method projected unit credit method has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of financial position.
The methods and types of assumption did not change.
Risks Through its defined benefit pension plan, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Volatility in market Results under IAS 19 can change dramatically depending on market conditions.
The defined benefit obligation is linked to conditions yields on AA-rated corporate bonds, while many of the assets of the Scheme are invested in other assets.
Changing markets in conjunction with discount rate volatility will lead to volatility in the net pension liability on the Groups balance sheet and in other comprehensive income.
To a lesser extent this will also lead to volatility in the IAS 19 pension finance expense in the Groups income statement.
Choice of accounting The calculation of the defined benefit obligation DBO involves projecting future cash flows from the Scheme many years into the assumptions future.
This means that the assumptions used can have a material impact on the balance sheet position and profit and loss charge.
In practice future experience within the Scheme may not be in line with the assumptions adopted.
For example, members could live longer than foreseen or inflation could be higher or lower than allowed for in the DBO calculation.
The accounting assumptions noted above are used to calculate the year end net pension asset liability in accordance with the relevant accounting standard, IAS 19 revised Employee benefits.
Changes in these assumptions have no impact on the Groups cash payments into the Scheme.
The payments into the Scheme are reassessed after every triennial valuation.
The triennial valuations are calculated on a funding basis and use a different set of assumptions, as agreed with the pension Trustees.
Given the current extremely low gilt yields, a funding valuation of the Scheme would probably have resulted in a smaller surplus than the IAS 19 methodology if one had been performed at the year end.

Transactions with the MOD The MOD continues to own its Special Share in QinetiQ which conveys certain rights as set out in note 28.
Transactions between the Group and the MOD are disclosed as follows: Freehold land and buildings and surplus properties Under the terms of the Groups acquisition of part of the business and certain assets of DERA from the MOD on 1 July 2001, the MOD retained certain rights in respect of the freehold land and buildings transferred.
Restrictions on transfer of title The title deeds of those properties with strategic assets see below include a clause that prevents their transfer without the approval of the MOD.
The MOD also has the right to purchase any strategic assets in certain circumstances.
MODs generic compliance regime Adherence to the generic compliance system is monitored by the Risk & CSR Committee.
Refer to the Committees report within the Corporate Governance Statement on page 64.
Strategic assets Under the Principal Agreement with the MOD, the QinetiQ controlled Group is not permitted without the written consent of the MOD, to: i dispose of or destroy all or any part of a strategic asset: or ii voluntarily undertake any closure of, or cease to provide a strategic capability by means of, all or any part of a strategic asset.
The net book value of assets identified as being strategic assets as at 31 March 2017 was 6.3m 2016: 7.2m.
Long Term Partnering Agreement On 27 February 2003 QinetiQ Limited entered into a Long Term Partnering Agreement LTPA to provide Test and Evaluation T&E facilities and training support services to the MOD.
This is a 25-year contract with a total revenue value of up to 5.6bn, dependent on the level of usage by the MOD, under which QinetiQ Limited is committed to providing T&E services with increasing efficiencies through cost saving and innovative service delivery.
Other contracts with MOD The LTPA is the most significant contract QinetiQ has with the MOD.
In total approximately 70% of the Groups revenue comes directly from contracts with the MOD.
Contingent liabilities and assets Subsidiary undertakings within the Group have given unsecured guarantees of 46.1m at 31 March 2017 2016: 32.8m in the ordinary course of business.
The Company has on occasion been required to take legal action to protect its intellectual property rights, to enforce commercial contracts or otherwise and similarly to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties, including in respect of environmental and regulatory issues.
Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent managements best estimate of the likely outcome.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain pending the outcome of various court proceedings, ongoing investigations and negotiations.
However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties unless management, taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful.
Contingent liabilities associated with such proceedings have been identified but the Directors are of the opinion that any associated claims that might be brought can be resisted successfully and therefore the possibility of any outflow in settlement is assessed as remote.
The Group has also not recognised contingent amounts receivable relating to property impairments in prior years that may potentially be recovered from the MOD.
Recovery is subject to future negotiations.
It is not considered practicable to calculate the value of this contingent asset.
Capital commitments The Group had the following capital commitments for which no provision has been made: all figures in million 2017 2016 Contracted 155.3 35.5 Capital commitments at 31 March 2017 include 155.1m 2016: 30.8m in relation to property, plant and equipment that will be wholly funded by a third-party customer under long-term contract arrangements.
These primarily relate to investments under the LTPA contract.
