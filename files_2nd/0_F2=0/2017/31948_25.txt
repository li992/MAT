This reflects a significant improvement in performance following the closure of a competitor and a sustained increase in performance attributed to improvements in the local economic environment within Spain.
Group restructuring including relocation costs In the first six months of 2016 17 the Group carried out a detailed review of its entire UK organisational structure designed to improve customer service and simplify operations.

The discount rate applied was 11% 30 June 2016: 12%.
This is derived from the weighted average cost of capital and reflects the risks specific to this CGU.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are settled stakes, gaming win margins, gaming duty and the discount rate.
Settled stakes represent monies placed by customers for interactive games and are estimated taking into account the product mix and industry developments.
Gaming win margins are based on values achieved in the past and amended for any anticipated changes in the budget period.
Gaming duty is based upon statutory rates enacted at the balance sheet date.
As a result of the impairment testing, the directors do not believe that the carrying value of the goodwill was impaired as the value in use exceeded the carrying value of goodwill.
The key factors which impact the calculation of the carrying value include: Key factors Key assumption impacted Increased or improved competition Settled stakes, Gaming win margin Poor or decreased marketing activity Settled stakes Failure to respond to technological advances Settled stakes Deterioration in economic conditions Settled stakes Changes in regulation Settled stakes, Gaming win margin Changes in duties Gaming duty Based on these key assumptions and resulting projections, the recoverable amount significantly exceeds its carrying amount, by in excess of 200m, therefore no reasonably possible change in key assumptions would impact the carrying amount of Digital goodwill.
Casino goodwill 80.9m of goodwill arose on the acquisition of 19 casinos from Gala Coral in May 2013.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition is considered to benefit all acquired casinos and therefore is tested by combining the results of all of the acquired casino CGUs.
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections of the combined casinos from the Groups budget for 2017 18, the Groups strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% 30 June 2016: 2.0% thereafter.
The discount rate applied was 11% 30 June 2016: 10%.
This is derived from the weighted average cost of capital and reflects the risks specific to this group of CGUs.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are customer visits, spend per visit, casino duty, machine games duty and the discount rate.
Customer visits are the number of discrete visits by customers to casinos and have been based on historic trends.
Spend per visit comprises the average amount of money net of winnings spent per visit on gaming tables, machines and food and beverages.
This has also been determined by historic trends.
Casino duty is levied in bands of between 15% and 50% depending upon the level of gaming win at each casino.
The bands and rates have been assumed to remain at current levels without indexation.
Machine games duty is levied at rates of 5% or 20% depending upon certain criteria.
122 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 The table below outlines the possible changes in key assumptions that could cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.
These are: Key factors Key assumption impacted Increased or improved competition Customer visits Poor or decreased marketing activity Customer visits Failure to respond to technological advances Customer visits, Spend per visit Deterioration in economic conditions Customer visits, Spend per visit Changes in regulation Customer visits, Spend per visit Changes in duties Casino duty, Machine games duty Based on these key assumptions and resulting projections, the recoverable amount of the casinos exceeds its carrying amount by 10.0m 30 June 2016: 113.0m.
Headroom is less than the previous years which is attributed to a temporary decrease in performance at a couple of significant clubs.
A decrease of approximately 4% in either customer visits or spend per visit would be required for the recoverable amount to equal the carrying value.
A rise in gaming-related taxes from the current blended rate of 18% to 19% across the combined casinos would be required for the recoverable amount to equal the carrying value of the CGU.
These calculations assume all other assumptions remain constant and therefore do not reflect any cost saving measures that may be identified should a key assumption be impacted to this magnitude.
ii Casino licences The carrying value of indefinite life casino licences as at 30 June 2017 was 231.9m 30 June 2016: 231.9m.
The casino licences are assessed for impairment by reference to the associated clubs CGUs performance or through consideration of fair value less estimated costs to dispose.
The inherent value of a casino licence is deemed to be an intrinsic part of the value of the operation of a casino as a whole and licences are therefore not split out from each casino in an impairment review.
Each casino has been treated as a separate CGU, and tested for impairment on that basis.
The recoverable amount of each casino, including the licence, has been determined based on the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
The value in use has been determined using cash flow projections, over the length of the associated lease or 50 years for freehold properties, based on the Groups budget for 2017 18, the Groups strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% 30 June 2016: 2.0% thereafter.
Estimates of the fair value less costs of disposal are performed internally by experienced senior management supported by knowledge of similar transactions or, where applicable, offers received.
Customer visits are the number of discrete visits by customers to the casino and have been based on historic trends.
The table below outlines the possible changes in key assumptions that could cause the carrying value of individual licences to exceed their recoverable amount.
These are: Key factors Key assumption impacted Increased or improved competition Customer visits Poor or decreased marketing activity Customer visits Failure to respond to technological advances Customer visits, Spend per visit Deterioration in economic conditions Customer visits, Spend per visit Changes in regulation Customer visits, Spend per visit Changes in duties Casino duty, Machine games duty For UK casino licences, the directors do not believe that, with the exception of a prolonged non-operation of a UK casino licence, there are any reasonably foreseeable changes to the key assumptions that would result in a material impairment.
No impairment charges were made during the year against indefinite life casino licences year ended 30 June 2016: nil.
The casino concessions in Belgium are being amortised over their expected useful life.
At 30 June 2017, the concessions had a carrying value of 2.9m 30 June 2016: 3.9m.
The casino concessions have also been treated as a separate CGU for impairment testing purposes.
com | 123 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 12 Impairment review continued iii Spanish bingo licences The carrying value of Spanish bingo licences as at 30 June 2017 was 9.7m 30 June 2016: 7.4m.
The inherent value of each Spanish bingo licence is deemed to be an intrinsic part of the value of a club as a whole and is not therefore split out from the assets of each individual bingo club in an impairment review.
Each individual bingo club has been treated as a separate CGU, and tested for impairment on that basis.
The recoverable amount of each Spanish bingo club, including the licence, has been determined based on the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
The value in use calculation has been determined using cash flow projections, over the length of the associated lease or 50 years in the case of freehold properties, based on the Groups budget for 2017 18, the Groups strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% 30 June 2016: 2.0%, thereafter.
The discount rate applied was 12% 30 June 2016: 12%.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are customer visits, spend per visit, bingo duty and the discount rate.
Customer visits are the number of discrete visits to the bingo club and have been based on recent trends.
Spend per visit comprises the average amount of money net of winnings spent by a member on bingo games, machines and food and beverages.
This has been determined by recent trends.
Bingo duty is based upon statutory rates enacted at the balance sheet date.
However, there are possible changes in the key assumptions that could cause further impairments.
These are: Key factors Key assumption impacted Increased or improved competition Customer visits Poor or decreased marketing activity Customer visits Failure to respond to technological advances Customer visits, Spend per visit Deterioration in economic conditions Customer visits, Spend per visit Changes in regulation Customer visits, Spend per visit Changes in duties Bingo duty As outlined above, each Spanish bingo licence has been tested for impairment by reference to the associated trading at each club.
Accordingly, the sensitivity of each licence to future impairments, arising from changes in the key assumptions, varies from club to club.
During the period 1.8m 30 June 2017: 1.4m of impairment reversal was recognised on two licences.
This represented a full impairment reversal at these clubs due to a sustained improvement in performance attributed to improvements in the local economy.
No further reversals are expected as a significant change in budgeted performance would be required.
b Impairment review of property, plant and equipment and definite life intangible assets Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are grouped into CGUs which are defined as individual venues for Mecca, Enracha and Grosvenor Casinos and as the UK Digital business.
Each CGU is assessed for indicators of impairment.
An assessment is performed where there is an indicator of impairment and or reversal.
During the period the following indicators of impairment were identified: a sustained period of club underperformance: significant idle assets from Group restructuring and relocation: and a decline in the value attributed to the local economic environment.
During the period the following indicators of reversal were identified: a sustained period of club over performance: an increase in the value attributed to the local economic environment: and closure of a local competitor.

The recoverable amount of each CGU, including the licence if applicable, has been determined based on the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
The value in use has been determined using cash flow projections from the Groups budget for 2017 18, the Groups strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% 30 June 2016: 2.0% thereafter.
Estimates of the fair value less costs of disposal are performed internally by an experienced surveyor supported by external estate agent advice or, where applicable, offers received.
For a limited number of CGUs any failure to achieve the anticipated growth in future performance could result in further impairment charges being made.
Further details of exceptional impairment charges and reversals recognised during the current and prior periods are disclosed in note 4. www.

As a result, Rank Digital Limited is no longer a direct investment of the Company and the associated cost of 65.7m and accumulated impairment of 19.3m have been disposed of at book value to a Group entity.
Rank Digital Limited remains a wholly owned Group company.
There was also a 0.5m reduction in cost from the movement in fair value of services recognised by subsidiary undertakings arising from equity-settled share awards granted as part of the LTIP reward by the Company.
In the prior year the Company recognised an impairment of 5.1m following a reduction in operating profit of a subsidiary undertaking.

As at 30 June 2017, other receivables of 0.2m 30 June 2016: nil were past due but not impaired.
The creation and release of provisions for impaired receivables have been included in other operating costs in the income statement.
Amounts charged to the provision for impairment are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
The other classes within receivables do not contain impaired assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivable mentioned above.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
The Groups convertible loan note is due from its digital platform provider and at 30 June 2017, 3.5m has been loaned under the agreement with 0.2m of interest also outstanding.
The Group has the option to convert the loan note into 17.5% of the issued share capital of its digital platform provider at any time prior to June 2018.
If conversion does not take place, then the loan note is repayable in full in January 2019.
The digital platform provider is currently loss making and is reliant on continued funding from a related company and its shareholders.
However, the Group considers that the market value of the convertible option, as evidenced by third party offers for all or part of the company, at least equates to the current loan value.
The convertible option provides a mechanism whereby the Group can recover its loan through exercising the option and then selling the shares.
The Group therefore believes no impairment of the loan principal and interest is required at this time.
As the business is a private enterprise and a relatively new start up, attributing fair value to the convertible option requires significant judgement.
The Group has concluded that, based on the limited available information, the loan note will be recoverable through conversion but there is no certainty of any incremental value attaching to the option at this time.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: cash and short-term deposits, other receivables, bank overdrafts and other financial liabilities approximate to their carrying amounts, largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments: the fair value of fixed rate borrowings is based on price quotations at the reporting date: the fair value of floating rate borrowings and obligations under finance leases approximates to their carrying amounts: and the fair value of onerous property leases to approximate their carrying amount as they are discounted at current rates.
130 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 19 Financial risk management objectives and policies Financial risk factors The Groups principal financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, trade and other payables.
The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Groups operations.
The Group has other receivables, and cash and short-term deposits that derive directly from its operations.
The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall financial risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Groups senior management oversees the management of these risks.
The finance committee is supported by the Groups senior management, which advises on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Group.
The finance committee provides assurance that the Groups financial risk-taking activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and the financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with Group policies and risk appetite.
The board of directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
a Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings and deposits.
The sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to the positions at 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2016.
The sensitivity analyses have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating rates of the debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant.
i Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Groups operating activities when revenue or expense is denominated in a different currency from the Groups functional currency and the Groups net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Group policy is not to hedge foreign currency risk.
Foreign currency sensitivity The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of a possible change in the US dollar and euro, with all other variables held constant, to the Groups profit before tax and the Groups equity.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.
com | 131 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 19 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued ii Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Groups long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates.
Historically the Group had managed its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings.
Due to the current economic climate the Group has exercised its right to operate outside the Group policy of maintaining between 40% and 60% of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest.
At 30 June 2017, 21% of the Groups borrowings were at a fixed rate of interest 30 June 2016: 19%.
iii Interest rate sensitivity The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in interest rates on income and equity for the year when this movement is applied to the carrying value of loans, borrowings, cash and short-term deposits.
Effect on profit before tax As at As at 30 June 2017 30 June 2016 m m Sterling: 100 basis point increase 0.4 0.6 200 basis point increase 0.8 1.2 There was no impact on equity in either year as a consequence of loan arrangements.
Due to current low interest rates, any further decline would not have a material impact on income and equity for the year.
As such, sensitivity to a decrease in interest rates has not been presented.
The Group did not enter into any fixed-to-floating or floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps in either year.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.
The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities primarily for other receivables and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.
Financial instruments and cash deposits Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Groups treasury department in accordance with the Groups policy.
Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty.
Counterparty credit limits are reviewed by the finance director, and may be updated throughout the year subject to the approval of the Groups finance committee.
The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through potential counterparty failure.
The credit worthiness of each counterparty is checked against independent credit ratings on at least a weekly basis, with a minimum rating of BB required.
The Group predominantly invests with its lending banks when appropriate.
Sales to retail customers are settled in cash or using major credit and debit cards and therefore the exposure to credit risk is not considered significant.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any material losses from non-performance of its counterparties.
c Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities.
Cash forecasts identifying the liquidity requirements of the Group are produced three times a year.
The cash forecasts are sensitivity tested for different scenarios and are reviewed regularly.
Forecast financial headroom and debt covenant compliance is reviewed monthly during the month-end process to ensure sufficient financial headroom exists for at least a 12 month period.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
A three-year strategic forecast is prepared annually to facilitate planning for future financing needs.
Management actively manages the Groups financing requirements and the range of maturities on its debt.
The Groups core debt facilities are the 90.0m 30 June 2016: 90.0m bank facility comprising three bi-lateral bank facilities which expire in September 2020, and the 70.0m 30 June 2016: 80.0m bank facility comprising three bi-lateral bank facilities which expire in April 2019.
The Group proactively manages its relationships with its lending group.
The funding policy of the Group is to maintain, as far as practicable, a broad portfolio of debt diversified by source and maturity, and to maintain committed facilities sufficient to cover seasonal peak anticipated borrowing requirements.
132 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.
Less than Greater than On demand 12 months 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years 5 years Total m m m m m m At 30 June 2017 1 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 2.5 33.9 52.2 4.3 2.4 95.3 Trade and other payables 80.3 80.3 Property leases 4.9 2.7 7.6 13.6 28.8 2.5 119.1 54.9 11.9 16.0 204.4 At 30 June 2016 1 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 3.1 12.9 22.7 64.2 3.4 106.3 Trade and other payables 89.3 89.3 Property leases 7.2 4.5 11.0 36.5 59.2 3.1 109.4 27.2 75.2 39.9 254.8 1 The bank facility interest payments were based on current LIBOR as at the reporting date.
Interest payments on the interest-bearing loans and borrowings have been projected until the instruments mature.
Capital management As a result of the difficult conditions that developed in the global capital markets in recent years, the Groups objectives when managing capital have been to ensure continuing access to existing debt facilities and to manage the borrowing cost of those facilities in order to minimise the Groups interest charge.
Consistent with others in the gaming industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of leverage ratio.
The ratio is calculated as net debt divided by EBITDA.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including loans and borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and short-term deposits, accrued interest and unamortised facility fees.
EBITDA is calculated as operating profit before exceptional items, depreciation and amortisation from continuing operations.
The leverage ratios at 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2016 were as follows: As at As at 30 June 2017 30 June 2016 m m Total loans and borrowings note 18 91.6 102.2 Less: Cash and short-term deposits 79.0 61.0 Less: Accrued interest 0.4 0.5 Add: Unamortised facility fees 0.2 0.5 Net debt 12.4 41.2 Continuing operations Operating profit before exceptionals 83.5 82.4 Add: Depreciation and amortisation 45.3 45.8 EBITDA 128.8 128.2 Leverage ratio 0.1 0.3 Taking into consideration both the Groups capital investment requirements and the stability of the wider economic environment, the Group considers its progressive dividend policy to be appropriate.
Collateral The Group did not pledge or hold any collateral at 30 June 2017 30 June 2016: nil.

Property lease provisions The Group is party to a number of leasehold property contracts.
Provision has been made against those leases where the property or part of the property is now vacant and the unavoidable costs under the lease exceed the economic benefit expected to be derived from potential sub-letting arrangements.
Provision has also been made against leases where impairment testing has indicated that, after recognising an impairment charge, the estimated discounted cash flows derived from the property and its associated operations are insufficient to cover the unavoidable lease costs and the lease is therefore deemed onerous.

Disposal provisions Provision has been made for legacy industrial disease and personal injury claims, deferred payments arising from the settlement of property lease obligations and other directly attributable costs arising as a consequence of the sale or closure of the businesses.

The Group remains potentially liable in the event of default by the third party.
Should default occur then the Group would have recourse to two guarantors.
It is understood that, of the original 44 leases transferred, eight of these have not expired or been surrendered.
These eight leases have durations of between 21 months and 96 years and a current annual rental obligation net of sub-let income of approximately 0.8m.
During 2014, the Group became aware of certain information in respect of a change in the financial position of the third party and one of the guarantors.
However, the Group has not to date been notified of any default, or intention to default, in respect of the transferred leases.
Stamp duty In the prior year, the Group disclosed that it had received from HMRC a determination in respect of the amount of stamp duty payable on certain transactions undertaken by Gala Casino 1 Limited now Grosvenor Casinos GC Limited before its acquisition by the Group on 12 May 2013 from Gala Coral.
The Group estimated the maximum additional stamp duty that could be due, if HMRC were successful and Gala Coral were to default on terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, to be 7.2m plus interest.
During the period Gala Coral have made a payment on account to HMRC in respect of the determination and the Group has assigned the right to any potential refund back to Gala Coral.
As payment has been made by Gala Coral, there is no longer a risk of default and therefore this risk is no longer considered a contingent liability.
