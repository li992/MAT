Financial statements Annual Report 2017 164 Great Portland Estates Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 25 Employee benets continued Virtually all equity and debt instruments have quoted prices in active markets.
The fair value of the Plan assets at the balance sheet date is analysed as follows: 2017 2016 m m Cash 0.1 Equities 14.1 11.2 Bonds 19.9 17.4 34.1 28.6 Other than market and demographic risks, which are common to all retirement benefit schemes, there are no specic risks in the relevant benefit schemes which the Group considers to be significant or unusual.
Detail on two of the more specic risks is detailed below: Changes in bond yields Falling bond yields tend to increase the funding and accounting liabilities.
However, the investment in corporate and government bonds offers a degree of matching, i. e. the movement in assets arising from changes in bond yields partially matches the movement in the funding or accounting liabilities.
In this way, the exposure to movements in bond yields is reduced.
Life expectancy The majority of the obligations are to provide a pension for the life of the member on retirement, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
The ination-linked nature of the majority of benefit payments increases the sensitivity of the liabilities to changes in life expectancy.
The effect on the dened benefit obligation of changing the key assumptions, calculated using approximate methods based on historical trends, is set out below: 2017 2016 m m Discount rate -0.25% 42.0 32.9 Discount rate 0.25% 37.9 29.8 RPI ination -0.25% 38.9 30.6 RPI ination 0.25% 40.9 32.0 Post-retirement mortality assumption -1 year 41.5 32.4 The Group expects to contribute 0.9 million to the Plan in the year ending 31 March 2018.
The expected total benefit payments for the year ending 31 March 2018 is 0.6 million, with 4.3 million expected to be paid over the next five years.
