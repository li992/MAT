Financial statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Basis of preparation Accounting policies The audited consolidated financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and interpretations IFRICs as adopted by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Mans principal accounting policies have been consistently applied across the Group in the preparation of the financial statements.
Accounting policies are included in the relevant sections, and significant policies are outlined on page 111.
The impact, if any, of new accounting standards and amendments applicable to the year ended 31 December 2017 and accounting standards that are not yet effective are detailed on pages 111 to 112.
Consolidated group and presentation currency The consolidated group is Man Group plc the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group or Man.
The stand-alone Parent Company financial statements of Man Group plc have been included as separate financial statements on pages 141 to 143.
Mans presentation currency is United States Dollars USD.
The consolidated financial information contained within these financial statements incorporates the results, cash flows and financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries Note 29 for the year to 31 December 2017.
Subsidiaries are entities including structured entities controlled by Man and are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to Man until the date that control ceases.
Control exists when Man has the power to direct the relevant activities, exposure to significant variable returns and the ability to utilise power to affect those returns.
All intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The acquisition date is the date on which Man effectively obtains control of the acquiree.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value at the acquisition date of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and equity instruments issued by the Group.
The fair value of an acquisition is calculated at the acquisition date by recognising the acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities at their fair values at that date, and costs relating to acquisitions are recognised in the Group income statement as incurred.
Any contingent consideration will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date, with any subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration recognised in the Group income statement.
Mans relationship with independent fund entities Man acts as the investment manager advisor to fund entities.
Man assesses such relationships on an ongoing basis to determine whether each fund entity is controlled by the Group and therefore consolidated into the Groups results.
Having considered all significant aspects of Mans relationships withfund entities, the directors are of the opinion that, although Man manages the assets of certain fund entities, where Man does not hold an investment in the fund entity the characteristics of control are not met, and that for most fund entities: the existence of independent boards of directors at the fund entities: rights which allow for the removal of the investment manager advisor: the influence of investors: limited exposure to variable returns: and the armslength nature of Mans contracts with the fund entities, indicate that Man does not control the fund entities and their associated assets, liabilities and results should not be consolidated into the Group financial statements.
Assessment of the control characteristics for all relationships with fund entities led to the consolidation of nine funds for the year ended 31 December 2017 2016: 11, as detailed in Note 13.
An understanding of the aggregate funds under management FUM and the fees earned from fund entities is relevant to an understanding of Mans results and earnings sustainability, and this information is provided in the Chief Financial Officers review on pages 25 to 27.
Judgemental areas and accounting estimates The most significant area of judgement is whether the Group controls certain funds through its investments in fund products and is required to consolidate them Note 13.2, with our key judgements outlined above within Mans relationship with independent fund entities.
In addition, we have used judgement in assessing the purchase price of the January 2017 acquisition of Aalto Note 10 in order to determine whether each component should be accounted for as purchase consideration or as post-acquisition compensation costs.
In assessing the key criteria as set out in IFRS 3 Business Combinations we have concluded that all of the purchase price, including the deferred components, should be accounted for as purchased consideration for the following primary reasons: i the sellers will receive all of the purchase price whether they remain employed by Man or not subject to certain industry standard non-compete clauses : and ii Aalto management will be compensated for services at market rates for their services provided to Man as part of their employment contracts, in addition to deferred purchase consideration.
Furthermore, the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, include the determination of fair values for contingent consideration in relation to the Numeric and Aalto acquisitions Note 25, the valuation of goodwill and acquired intangibles for CGUs with lower levels of headroom Note 10 and recognition of deferred tax assets in relation to US tax assets Note 7.
The key assumptions and range of possible outcomes are discussed in the relevant notes.
These judgements and estimates have been an area of focus for the Group Board, and in particular the Audit and Risk Committee, during the year.
The report of the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee discusses the involvement of the Committee in this evaluation on page 58.
Going concern Mans business activity is discussed on pages 1 to 43, together with the significant risk factors pages 30 to 35.
Mans liquidity and capital positions areset out in Note 12 and 20 respectively.
The directors monitor Mans capital and liquidity positions and forecasts throughout the year, and in addition they have approved a budget, medium-term financial plan, and a capital and liquidity plan, which cover the foreseeable future and include rigorous analysis of stressed capital and liquidity scenarios.
The directors have concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that Man has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Group and Parent Company financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis using the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of certain financial instruments that are held at fair value through profit or loss or available-for-sale.
The directors have also made a longer-term viability statement, as set out on page 31.

Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative was adopted by Man in the current year, which have not had a significant impact.
The following standards and interpretations relevant to the Groups operations were issued by the IASB but are not yet mandatory: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 replaces the classification and measurement models for financial instruments in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement with three classification categories: amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss and fair value through other comprehensive income.
Under IFRS 9, the Groups business model and the contractual cash flows arising from its investments in financial instruments will determine the appropriate classification.
The Group has assessed its balance sheet assets in accordance with the new classification requirements.
The $3 million of investments held as Available For Sale AFS is expected to be classified as fair value through profit or loss as the AFS category will no longer exist Note 13.
The accumulated gain in the AFS reserve of $2 million is therefore expected be reclassified to retained earnings on transition, and any future revaluations will be recognised directly in the income statement currently these are recorded in the AFS reserve in equity.
There will be no other changes in the classification and measurement for any of the Groups financial assets or liabilities.
In addition, IFRS 9 introduces an expected loss model for the assessment of impairment of financial assets.
The current incurred loss model under IAS 39 requires the Group to recognise impairment losses when there is objective evidence that an asset is impaired.
Under the expected loss model, impairment losses are recorded if there is an expectation of credit losses, even in the absence of a default event.
This model is not applicable for investments held at fair value through profit or loss or investments in associates.
Therefore the assets on the Groups balance sheet to which the expected loss model applies are loans to funds Note 13.3 and fee receivables Note 14, which do not have a history of credit risk or expected future recoverability issues.
Therefore, no change to the carrying values of the Groups assets is expected as a result of adoption of the new standard.
The new hedging requirements under IFRS 9, which are optional to adopt, are designed to provide some increased flexibility in relation to hedge effectiveness in order to better align hedge accounting with a companys risk management policies.
The Group has elected to apply the IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirements for this reason.
IFRS 9 also requires increased disclosures in relation to the Groups risk management strategy and the impact of hedge accounting on the financial statements.
The Groups IAS 39 cash-flow and net investment hedge relationships Note 12 qualify as continuing hedging relationships under IFRS 9, and there is no material change to existing hedge effectiveness assessments as a result.
No additional hedge relationships are currently expected to be designated as a result of the adoption of IFRS 9.
The Group does not anticipate that IFRS 9 will have a material impact on its reported results.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: IFRS 15 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations.
IFRS 15 establishes a single, principles-based revenue recognition model to be applied to all contracts with customers.
The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
Specifically, IFRS 15 introduces a five-step approach to revenue recognition: 1 identify the contract with the customer: 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract: 3 determine the transaction price: 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: and 5 recognise revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
IFRS 15 is more prescriptive in terms of its recognition criteria, with certain specific requirements in respect of variable fee income such that it is only recognised where the amount of revenue would not be subject to significant future reversals.
New disclosure requirements are also introduced.
The Group has considered these changes in light of the terms of our existing investment management agreements, and assessed the timing of management and performance fee recognition.
Management fee revenues are recorded on a monthly basis as the underlying management activity service takes place, and do not include performance or other obligations excluding standard duty of care requirements.
Performance fee revenues are recognised when they crystallise, at which time they are payable by the client and cannot be clawed-back.
There are no other performance obligations or services provided which suggest these have been earned either before or after crystallisation date.
As a result of this assessment the Group has not identified any material changes to current revenue recognition principles.
The Group does not anticipate that IFRS 15 will have a material impact on its reported results.
Man Group plc Annual Report 2017 111 Financial statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
Basis of preparation continued IFRS 16 Leases: IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and replaces IAS 17 Leases and related interpretations.
This introduces a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and accounting treatment for both lessors and lessees, which distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of whether an identified asset is controlled by a customer.
There is substantially no change to the accounting requirements for lessors.
IFRS 16 requires operating leases, where the Group is the lessee, to be included on the Groups balance sheet, recognising a right-of-use ROU asset and a related lease liability representing the present value obligation to make lease payments.
Certain optional exemptions are available under IFRS 16 for short-term less than 12 months and low-value leases.
The ROU asset will be assessed for impairment annually incorporating any onerous lease assessments and depreciated on a straight-line basis, adjusted for any remeasurements of the lease liability.
The lease liability will subsequently be adjusted for lease payments and interest, as well as the impact of any lease modifications.
IFRS 16 also requires extensive disclosures detailing the impact of leases on the Groups financial position and results.
The adoption of IFRS 16 will result in a significant gross-up of the Groups reported assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, in particular as our sub-lease arrangements Note 27.3 are not expected to be eligible for offset against the ROU asset and related lease liability.
The rental expense which is currently recognised within occupancy costs in the Groups income statement Note 5 will no longer be incurred and instead depreciation expense of the ROU asset and interest expense unwind of the discounted lease liability will be recognised.
This will also result in a different total annual expense profile under the new standard with the expense being front-loaded in the earlier years of the lease term as the discount unwind on the lease liability reduces over time.
The Group has considered the available transition options, and has provisionally decided to apply modified retrospective option 1 and currently estimates that the impact will be a gross-up of up to 200 million $270 million for ROU lease assets and associated deferred tax assets and 260 million $350 million in relation to lease liabilities, with up to 60 million $80 million deducted from brought-forward reserves on transition date in 2019.
The initial reserves impact will be offset over time by a lower annual Group income statement charge, as the total charge over the life of each lease is the same as under the current IAS 17 requirements Note 27.
No other standards or interpretations issued and not yet effective are expected to have an impact on the Groups financial statements.
Revenue Fee income is Mans primary source of revenue, which is derived from the investment management agreements that are in place with the fund entities.
Fees are generally based on an agreed percentage of net asset value NAV or FUM and are typically charged in arrears.
Management fees net of rebates, which include all non-performance related fees, are recognised in the year in which the services are provided.
Performance fees net of rebates relate to the performance of the funds managed during the year and are recognised when the fee can bereliably estimated and has crystallised.
This is generally at the end of the performance period or upon early redemption by a fund investor.
Until the performance period ends, market movements could significantly move the NAV of the fund products.
For AHL, GLG, FRM and GPM strategies, Man will typically only earn performance fee income on any positive investment returns in excess of the high water mark, meaning we will not be able to earn performance fee income with respect to positive investment performance in any year following negative performance until that loss is recouped, at whichpoint a fund investors investment surpasses the high water mark.
Numeric performance fees are earned only when performance is in excess of a predetermined strategy benchmark positive alpha, with performance fees being generated for each strategy either based on achieving positive alpha which resets at a predetermined interval, i. e. every one to three years or, in the case of alternatives, exceeding high water mark.
Rebates relate to repayments of management and performance fees charged, typically to institutional investors, and are presented net within gross management and other fees and performance fees in the Group income statement.
Analysis of FUM, margins and performance is provided in the Chief Financial Officers Review on pages 25 to 27.
Distribution costs and asset servicing Distribution costs are paid to external intermediaries for marketing and investor servicing, largely in relation to retail investors.
Distribution costs arevariable with FUM and the associated management fee revenue.
Distribution costs are expensed over the period in which the service is provided.
Distribution costs have decreased, despite growth in FUM, largely as a result of the continued mix shift towards institutional assets and the roll-off of guaranteed productFUM.
Asset servicing includes custodial, valuation, fund accounting and registrar functions performed by third-parties under contract to Man, on behalf of the funds, and is recognised in the period in which the service is provided.
The cost of these services vary based on transaction volumes, the number of funds, and fund NAVs.

Compensation continued Compensation is the Groups largest cost and an important component of Mans ability to retain and attract talent.
In the short term, the variable component of compensation adjusts with revenues and profitability.
Total compensation costs, excluding restructuring, have increased by 22% compared to 2016, largely due to the increase in management and performance fee revenues year on year, as reflected in increased variable cash compensation and associated social security costs.
The compensation ratio, as outlined on page 150, has decreased to 44% from 48% in 2016 primarily as a result of the higher level of performance fee revenue.
Salaries have decreased from prior year largely as a result of a more favourable hedged Sterling to USD rate in 2017 1.36 compared to the hedged rate in 2016 1.51, which had a $12 million impact compared to prior year.
As a result of cost saving initiatives the underlying salaries costs have remained largely stable despite growth in the business, inflation and an increase in headcount.
Salaries, variable cash compensation and social security costs are charged to the Group income statement in the period in which the service is provided, and include partner drawings.
The accounting for share-based and fund product based compensation arrangements is detailed in Note 19.
Pension costs relate to Mans defined contribution and defined benefit plans Note 21.
Restructuring costs in 2017 of $4 million 2016: $17 million relate to termination expenses incurred due to the restructuring of certain areas of the business which commenced in 2016 and were completed in 2017.
Compensation costs incurred as part of restructuring are accounted for in full at the time the obligation arises, and include payments in lieu of notice, enhanced termination costs, and accelerated share-based and fund product based charges.

The underlying cost base has remained stable despite inflation and growth in the business, reflecting continued efforts to remain disciplined on costs.
Other restructuring costs of $7 million in 2017 largely relate to onerous property leases arising as a result of finalisation of the 2016 restructuring plan following the centralisation of our London resources into one location.
Other restructuring costs of $4 million in 2016 largely related to a reassessment of our onerous property lease provision relating to Riverbank House, which was recorded as an adjusting item upon initial recognition.
Auditors remuneration, including advisory and professional services, is disclosed in the Corporate Governance section on page 60.

Income and expenses are allocated to these different jurisdictions based on transfer pricing methodologies set in accordance with the laws of the jurisdictions in which Man operates and international guidelines as laid out by the OECD.
The effective tax rate results from the combination of taxes paid on earnings attributable to the tax jurisdictions in which they arise.
The majority of the Groups profit was earned in the UK, Switzerland and the US.
The Groups US tax rate is effectively nil as a result of accumulated US tax assets, as detailed on page 116.
The current effective tax rate of 6% 2016: 2% differs from the applicable underlying statutory tax rates principally as a result of the incremental recognition of the US deferred tax asset of $17 million 2016: $6 million, as detailed on page 115, the release of a non-taxable litigation provision Note 16 and the reassessment of tax exposures globally during the year.
In 2016 the 2% effective tax rate differed to the applicable underlying statutory tax rates principally as a result of the impairment of the GLG and FRM goodwill and intangibles being largely non-deductible for tax purposes, which was partially offset by the incremental recognition of the US deferred tax asset of $6 million, and the reassessment of tax exposures in Europe and Asia-Pacific during the year.
The effective tax rate is otherwise consistent with this earnings profile.
Accounting for tax involves a level of estimation uncertainty given the application of tax law requires a degree of judgement, which tax authorities may dispute.
Tax liabilities are recognised based on the best estimates of probable outcomes, with regard to external advice where appropriate.
The principal factors which may influence our future tax rate are changes to tax regulation in the territories in which we operate, the mix of income and expense by jurisdiction, and the timing of recognition of available tax assets.
The current tax liabilities of $21 million 2016: $6 million, as shown on the Group balance sheet, comprise a gross current tax liability of $24 million 2016: $9 million net of a current tax asset of $3 million 2016: $3 million.

Taxation continued The tax on Mans total profit before tax is lower 2016: credit on loss before tax is lower than the amount that would arise using the theoretical effective tax rate applicable to the profits losses of the consolidated companies as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December $m 2017 2016 Profit loss before tax 272 272 Theoretical tax expense credit at UK rate: 19.25% 2016: 20.00% 52 54 Effect of: Overseas tax rates compared to UK 10 11 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous periods 9 7 Recognition of US deferred tax asset 17 6 Impairment of goodwill and other adjusting items page 148 43 Share-based payments 2 Other 1 5 Tax expense credit 17 6 The effect of overseas tax rates compared to the UK includes the impact of the 0% effective tax rate of our US business.
In the current year the adjustments to the tax charge in respect of previous periods primarily relates to a $7 million credit mainly due to reassessment of tax exposures globally.
In 2016, adjustments in respect of previous periods primarily related to a $6 million credit following the reassessment of tax exposures in Europe and Asia-Pacific.
The impairment of goodwill and other adjusting items in 2016 reflects that there is no tax relief for the impairment of goodwill recognised in jurisdictions outside the US.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates expected to be applied when the deferred tax asset or liability is realised.
Movements in deferred tax are as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December $m 2017 2016 Deferred tax liability At 1 January 47 69 Acquisition of Aalto balance sheet 2 Charge credit to the Group income statement 1 22 Deferred tax liability at 31 December 48 47 Deferred tax asset At 1 January 63 59 Credit to the Group income statement 20 1 Charge credit to other comprehensive income and equity 2 3 Deferred tax asset at 31 December 81 63 The deferred tax liability of $48 million 2016: $47 million largely relates to deferred tax arising on acquired intangible assets.

Taxation continued The deferred tax asset income statement credit of $20 million 2016: $1 million relates to the recognition of the US deferred tax asset of $17 million 2016: $6 million, an increase in the deferred tax asset on employee share schemes of $2 million 2016: $3 million decrease, no change in the deferred tax asset arising on tax allowances over depreciation 2016: decrease of $2 million and an increase in the deferred tax asset on other temporary differences of $1 million 2016: $nil.
The debit to other comprehensive income and equity of $2 million 2016: $3 million credit relates to movements in the pension accrual, unrealised cash flow hedge balances and employee share schemes.
The Group has accumulated deferred tax assets in the US of $124 million 2016: $192 million.
The decrease of $68 million is principally as a result of the reduction in future tax rates in the US arising from the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective from 1 January 2018.
These assets principally comprise accumulated operating losses from existing operations of $61 million 2016: $103 million and future amortisation of goodwill and intangibles assets generated from acquisitions of $48 million 2016: $72 million that will be available to offset future taxable profits in the US.
From the maximum available deferred tax assets of $124 million 2016: $192 million, a deferred tax asset of $42 million has been recognised on the Group balance sheet 2016: $25 million, representing amounts which can be offset against probable future taxable profits.
The increase of $17 million from that recognised at 31 December 2016 represents projected year on year growth in our US business, partially offset by the reduction in the US federal tax rate from 1 January 2018.
Probable future taxable profits are considered to be forecast profits for the next three years only, consistent with the Groups business planning horizon.
As a result of the recognised deferred tax asset and the remaining unrecognised available US deferred tax assets of $82 million 2016: $167 million, Man does not expect to pay federal tax on any taxable profits it may earn in the US for a number of years.
Accordingly, any movements in this US tax asset are classified as an adjusting item page 148.
The gross amount of losses for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised is $48 million 2016: $160 million, which will expire over a period of 11 to 19 years.
Earnings per ordinary share EPS The calculation of basic EPS is based on post-tax profit of $255 million 2016: loss of $266 million, and ordinary shares of 1,640,137,392 2016: 1,679,099,266, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period after excluding the shares owned by the Man Employee Trusts.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, being ordinary shares of 1,659,830,089 2016: 1,695,995,147.

Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of identifiable net assets of the acquired business at the date ofacquisition.
Goodwill is carried on the Group balance sheet at cost less accumulated impairment, has an indefinite useful life, is not subject to amortisation and is tested for impairment annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Investment management agreements IMAs, distribution channels and brand names IMAs, distribution channels and brand names are recognised at the present value of the expected future cash flows and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, which are between three and 13 years IMAs and brands, and six and 12 years distribution channels.
Amortisation of acquired intangible assets of $84 million 2016: $94 million primarily relates to the investment management agreements recognised on the acquisition of GLG and Numeric.
Allocation of goodwill to cash generating units For statutory accounting impairment review purposes, the Group has identified five cash generating units CGUs : AHL, GLG, FRM, Numeric and GPM.
As a result of the acquisition of Aalto in 2017, the Group formally identified a new CGU, Global Private Markets GPM.
Details of the Aalto acquisition are provided on page 120.
Calculation of recoverable amounts for cash generating units An impairment expense is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows CGUs.
The recoverable amounts of the Groups CGUs are assessed each year using a value in use calculation.
The value in use calculation gives a higher valuation compared to a fair value less cost to sell approach, as this would exclude some of the revenue synergies available to Man through its ability to distribute products using its well established distribution channels, which may not be fully available to other market participants.
Man Group plc Annual Report 2017 117 Financial statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 10.
Goodwill and acquired intangibles continued The value in use calculations at 31 December 2017 use cash flow projections based on the Board approved financial plan for the year to 31 December 2018 and a further two years of projections 2019 and 2020, plus a terminal value.
The valuation analysis is based on best practice guidance whereby a terminal value is calculated at the end of a short discrete budget period and assumes, after this three year budget period, no growth in asset flows above the long-term growth rate.
In order to determine the value in use of each CGU, it is necessary to notionally allocate the majority of the Groups cost base relating to operations, product structuring, distribution and support functions, which are managed on a centralised basis.
The value in use calculations for AHL, GLG, FRM, Numeric and GPM established as a result of the acquisition of Aalto in January 2017 are presented on a post-tax basis, consistent with the prior year, given most comparable market data is available on a post-tax basis.
The value in use calculations presented on a post-tax basis are not significantly different to their pre-tax equivalent.
The assumptions applied in the value in use calculation are derived from past experience and assessment of current market inputs.
A bifurcated discountrate has been applied to the modelled cash flows to reflect the different risk profile of net management fee income and net performance fee income.
The discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital using a risk free interest rate, together with an equity risk premium and an appropriate market beta derived from consideration of Mans beta, similar alternative asset managers, and the asset management sector as a whole.
The terminal value is calculated based on the projected closing FUM at 31 December 2020 and applying a mid-point of a range of historical multiples to the forecast cash flows associated with management and performance fees.
The recoverable amount of each CGU has been assessed at 31 December 2017.
The key assumptions applied to the value in use calculations for each of the CGUs are provided below.
Key assumptions: AHL GLG FRM Numeric GPM Compound average annualised growth in FUM over three years 11% 4% 10% 7% 37% Discount rate 1 Management fees 11% 11% 11% 11% 15% 2 Performance fees 17% 17% 17% 17% 21% 3 Terminal value mid-point of range of historical multiples Management fees 13.0x 13.0x 5.9x 13.0x 13.0x Performance fees 5.5x 5.5x 3.9x 5.5x 5.5x Notes: 1 The pre-tax equivalent of the net management fees discount rate is 13%, 13%, 13%, 14% and 18% for each of the AHL, GLG, FRM, Numeric and GPM CGUs, respectively.
2 The pre-tax equivalent of the net performance fees discount rate is 20%, 20%, 20%, 21% and 25% for each of the AHL, GLG, FRM, Numeric and GPM CGUs, respectively.
3 The implied terminal growth rates are 3%, 3%, -10%, 3% and 7% for each of the AHL, GLG, FRM, Numeric and GPM CGUs, respectively.
The results of the valuations are further explained in the following sections, including sensitivity tables which show scenarios whereby the key assumptions are changed to stressed assumptions, indicating the modelled headroom or impairment that would result.
Each assumption, or set of assumptions, is stressed in isolation.
The results of these sensitivities make no allowance for actions that management would take if such market conditions persisted.
AHL cash generating unit The AHL value in use calculation at 31 December 2017 indicates a value of $3.0 billion, with around $2.5 billion of headroom over the carrying value ofthe AHL business.
Therefore, no impairment charge is deemed necessary at 31 December 2017 2016: nil.
The valuation at 31 December 2017 is around $0.5 billion higher than the value in use calculation at 31 December 2016, primarily due to higher opening FUM largely as a result of better than forecast performance in 2017.

2 An increase decrease in the value in use calculation of $68 million.
3 An increase decrease in the value in use calculation of $259 million.
GLG cash generating unit In 2016 the GLG CGU was impaired by $281 million, primarily due to lower performance and net flows compared to that previously forecast as well as a weakening of industry growth forecasts during the year.
This impaired the total GLG goodwill balance of $222 million and further impaired the other acquired intangibles balances relating to investment management agreements, distribution channels and brands by a total of $59 million.
The GLG value in use calculation at 31 December 2017 indicates a value of $387 million, with around $140 million of headroom over the carrying value ofthe GLG business.
Therefore, no impairment charge is deemed necessary at 31 December 2017.
The valuation at 31 December 2017 is around $100 million higher than the value in use calculation at 31 December 2016 largely due to a better than forecast inflows.
The headroom has also increased as a result of amortisation of acquired intangibles of $57 million during the year, which lowers the carrying value.

3 An increase decrease in the value in use calculation of $31 million.
FRM cash generating unit In 2016 the FRM CGU was impaired by $98 million, largely as a result of acceleration in the FUM mix shift towards lower margin mandates and reduced prospects for the traditional fund of funds business.
This impaired the total FRM goodwill balance of $97 million, and further impaired the other acquired intangibles balances relating to investment management agreements and brands by a total of $1 million.
The FRM value in use calculation at 31 December 2017 indicates a value of $37 million, with $5 million of headroom over the carrying value ofthe FRM business.
The valuation at 31 December 2017 is largely in line with the value in use calculation at 31 December 2016.
The headroom has increased as a result of amortisation of acquired intangibles of $6 million during the year, which lowers the carrying value.

The valuation at 31 December 2017 is around $170 million higher than the value in use calculation at 31 December 2016, primarily as a result of higher opening FUM due to stronger performance than previously forecast during 2017.

Man Group plc Annual Report 2017 119 Financial statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 10.
Goodwill and acquired intangibles continued Acquisition of Aalto On 1 January 2017, Man acquired the entire issued share capital of Aalto, a US and Europe based real asset focused investment manager with $1.8billion of funds under management at the date of acquisition.
The acquisition consideration is structured to align Aaltos interests with those of Man, and comprises of an initial payment of $18 million in cash, including $1 million for acquired working capital, and $8 million in shares, and four deferred payments.
The deferred payments are dependent on levels of run rate management fees measured following one, four, six and eight years from completion and are capped at $207 million in aggregate.
The net present value of the aggregate deferred payments at completion was $52 million.
The $8 million fair value of the 5.7 million ordinary shares issued as part of the contingent consideration paid for Aalto was measured on the basis of quoted prices at the time of issue.
The deferred payments are equivalent to an earn-out contingent consideration and deemed to be a financial liability measured initially at fair value with any subsequent fair value movements recognised through the Group income statement Note 25.
Values for the acquired business at the date of acquisition are set out below: Fair value Fair $m Book value adjustments value Intangible assets 24 24 Cash and receivables 5 5 Loans and payables 4 4 Deferred tax liability 2 2 Net assets acquired 1 22 23 Goodwill on acquisition 55 Net assets acquired including goodwill 78 Contingent consideration 52 Cash consideration 18 Value of shares issued 8 Total consideration 78 The fair value adjustments relate to the recognition of investment management agreements of $10 million and customer relationships of $14 million.
These intangible assets are recognised at the present value of the expected future cash flows generated from the assets and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives of eight and six years respectively.
Given the funds are close-ended only the future cash flows from funds existing at acquisition date are included within the investment management agreements intangible, and therefore this balance reflects a finite product portfolio and period.
The high proportion of acquired goodwill in comparison to identified other intangible assets is due to the nature of the acquired business.
The goodwill balance of $55 million primarily represents direct and efficient access to the private real estate markets, the highly skilled and experienced Aalto team and the tailor made infrastructure and strong relationships to expand Mans current offering to its existing clients.
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Acquisition related costs included in the Groups income statement for the year ended 31 December 2017 amounted to less than $1 million.
Aalto contributed $12 million of management fee revenue, $4 million of performance fee revenue and $3 million to the Groups profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2017.

Capitalised computer software includes costs that are directly associated with the procurement or development of identifiable and unique software products, which will generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year and is subject to regular impairment reviews.
Capitalised computer software is amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life three years, which is included in Other costs in the Group income statement.
Additions relate to investment in software across Mans operating platforms.

Liquidity resources support ongoing operations and potential liquidity requirements under stressed scenarios.
The amount of potential liquidity requirements is modelled based on scenarios that assume stressed market and economic conditions.
The funding requirements for Man relating to the investment management process are discretionary.
The liquidity profile ofMan is monitored on a daily basis and the stressed scenarios are updated regularly.
The Board reviews Mans funding resources at each Board meeting and on an annual basis as part of the strategic planning process.
Mans available liquidity is considered sufficient to cover current requirements and potential requirements under stressed scenarios.
In September 2014, Man issued $150 million ten-year fixed rate reset callable guaranteed subordinated notes Tier 2 notes, with associated issuance costs of $1 million.
The Tier 2 notes were issued with a fixed coupon of 5.875% until 15 September 2019.
The notes may be redeemed in whole at Mans option on 16 September 2019 at their principal amount, subject to FCA approval.
If the notes are not redeemed at this time then the coupon willreset to the five-year mid-swap rate plus 4.076% and the notes will be redeemed on 16 September 2024 at their principal amount.
Borrowings are initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
The difference between the amount repayable at maturity on the borrowings and the carrying value is amortised over the period up to the expected maturity of the associated debt in accordance with the effective interest rate method.
Cash and cash equivalents at year end comprises cash at bank on hand of $175 million 2016: $222 million, short-term deposits of $181 million 2016: $102 million and $nil US Treasury bills 2016: $65 million.
Cash ring-fenced for regulated entities totalled $37 million 2016: $28 million.
Cashis invested in accordance with strict limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite, which consider both the security and availability of liquidity.
Accordingly, cash is held in on-demand deposit bank accounts and short-term bank deposits, and at times invested in short-term US Treasury bills.
At 31 December 2017, the $356 million cash balance excluding US Treasury bills and cash held by consolidated fund entities is held with 20 banks 2016: $324 million with 18banks.
The single largest counterparty bank exposure of $84 million is held with an A rated bank 2016: $88 million with a BBB rated bank.
At 31 December 2017, balances with banks in the AA ratings band aggregate to $97 million 2016: $109 million and balances with banks in the A ratings band aggregate to $239 million 2016: $127 million.
In October 2016 the Group reduced the previous $1 billion syndicated revolving loan facility to $500 million.
The $500 million facility was undrawn at 31 December 2017 undrawn at 31 December 2016.
The facility was put in place as a five-year facility and included the option for Man to request the banks to extend the maturity date by one year on each of the first and second anniversaries.
The participant banks have the option to accept or decline Mans request.
On the first and second anniversaries in 2016 and 2017, the banks were asked to extend thematurity date of the facility by one year and banks with participations totalling 98% of the facility accepted the request on both anniversaries.
As a result of the maturity extension, $10 million is scheduled to mature in June 2020 and the remaining $490 million matures inJune 2022.
Tomaintain maximum flexibility, the facility does not include financial covenants.
Disclosures in relation to financial guarantees and commitments are included in Note 27.
Foreign exchange and interest rate risk Man is subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities.
In respect of Mans monetary assets and liabilities which earn incur interest indexed to floating rates, as at 31 December 2017 a 50bp increase decrease in these rates, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a $1 million increase decrease 2016: $1 million increase decrease innet interest income.
A 10% strengthening weakening of the USD against all other currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a foreign exchange loss gain of $1 million 2016: $3 million loss gain, with a corresponding impact on equity.
This exposure is based on USD balances held by non-USD functional currency entities and non-USD balances held by USD functional currency entities within the Group.
Man Group plc Annual Report 2017 121 Financial statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 12.
Cash, liquidity and borrowings continued In certain circumstances, the Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its risk associated with foreign exchange movements.
Where fixed foreign currency denominated costs are hedged, the associated derivatives may be designated as cash flow hedges.
Effective unrealised gains or losseson these instruments are recognised within the cash flow hedge reserve in equity and, when realised, these are reclassified to the Group income statement in the same line as the hedged item.
The realisation of foreign currency operating cash flows and the associated forward foreign currency derivative contracts generally arise on a monthly basis.
The fair value of derivatives held in relation to the Groups cash flow hedges at 31 December 2017 is an asset of $9 million 2016: liability $18 million.

Investments in fund products and other investments continued 13.1.
Investments in fund products Man uses capital to invest in our fund products as part of our ongoing business to build our product breadth and to trial investment research developments before we market the products broadly to investors.
These seeding investments are generally held for less than one year.
Where Man is deemed not to control the fund, these are classified as investments in fund products.
Investments in fund products are classified at fair value through profit or loss, with net gains due to movements in fair value of $58 million for the year ended 31 December 2017 2016: $55 million recognised through income or gains on investments and other financial instruments.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade date.
The fair values of investments in fund products are derived from the reported NAVs of each of the fund products, which in turn are based upon the value of the underlying assets held within each of the fund products and the anticipated redemption horizon of the fund product.
The valuation of theunderlying assets within each fund product is determined by external valuation service providers based on an agreed valuation policy and methodology.
Whilst these valuations are performed independently of Man, Man has established oversight procedures and due diligence processes to ensure that the NAVs reported by the external valuation service providers are reliable and appropriate.
Man makes adjustments to these NAVs where the anticipated redemption horizon, events or circumstances indicate that the NAVs are not reflective of fair value.
The fair value hierarchy offinancial assets is disclosed in Note 25.
Investments in fund products expose Man to market risk and therefore this process is subject to limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite.
The largest single investment in fund products is $79 million 2016: $186 million.
The market risk from seeding investments is modelled using a value at risk methodology using a 95% confidence interval and one-year time horizon.
The value at risk is estimated to be $29 million at 31 December 2017 2016: $72 million.
Fund investments for deferred compensation arrangements At 31 December 2017, investments in fund products included $76 million 2016: $75 million of fund products related to deferred compensation arrangements.
Employees are subject to mandatory deferral arrangements and as part of these arrangements employees can elect to have their deferral in a designated selection of Man fund products.
Changes in the fair value of the fund product awards are recognised over the relevant vesting period, which means the compensation expense changes based on the value of the fund products.
The associated fund product investments are held to offset this change in compensation during the vesting period and at vesting the value of the fund investment is delivered to the employee.
The fund product investments are recorded at fair value with any gains or losses during the vesting period recognised as income or gains on investments and other financial instruments in the Group income statement.
Consolidation of investments in funds Seed capital invested into funds may at times be significant, and therefore the fund may be deemed to be controlled by the Group Note 1.
The fund isconsolidated into the Groups results from the date control commences until it ceases.
In 2017, nine 2016: 11 investments in funds have met the control criteria and have therefore been consolidated Note 29, either classified as held for sale or consolidated on a line-by-line basis as detailed below.
Held for sale Where the Group acquires the controlling stake and actively markets the products to third-party investors, allowing the Group to redeem their share, anditis considered highly probable that it will relinquish control within one year from the date of initial investment, the investment in the controlled fund is classified as held for sale.
The seeded fund is recognised on the Group balance sheet as non-current assets and liabilities held for sale, with the interests of any other parties included within non-current liabilities held for sale.
Amounts recognised are measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The non-current assets and liabilities held for sale are as follows: 31 December 31 December $m 2017 2016 Non-current assets held for sale 145 263 Non-current liabilities held for sale 66 132 Investments in fund products held for sale 79 131 Investments cease to be classified as held for sale when the fund is no longer controlled by the Group, at which time they are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Note 13.1.
Loss of control may eventuate through sale of the investment or a dilution in the Groups holding.
Ifa held for sale fund remains under the control of the Group for more than one year, and it is unlikely that the Group will reduce or no longer control its investment in the short-term, it will cease to be classified as held for sale and will be consolidated on a line-by-line basis.
Three investments in funds which were classified as held for sale in 2016 have been consolidated on a line-by-line basis for the year ended 31 December 2017 2016: three held for sale funds at 31 December 2015.

Investments in fund products and other investments continued Line-by-line consolidation The investments relating to the five 2016: six funds which are controlled and are consolidated on a line-by-line basis are included within the Group balance sheet and income statement as follows: 31 December 31 December $m 2017 2016 Balance sheet Cash and cash equivalents 23 37 1 Transferable securities 452 490 Fees and other receivables 1 Trade and other payables 174 2 Net assets of line-by-line consolidated fund entities 302 525 Third-party interest in consolidated funds 99 240 Net investment held by Man 203 285 Income statement 2 Net gains on investments 57 45 3 Management fee expenses 9 9 3 Performance fee expenses 5 2 4 Other costs 2 3 Net gains of line-by-line consolidated fund entities 41 31 Third-party share of gains relating to interests in consolidated funds 14 15 Gains attributable to net investment held by Man 27 16 Notes: 1 Included within Investments in fund products and other investments.
2 Included within Income or gains on investments and other financial instruments.
3 Relates to management and performance fees paid by the funds to Man during the year, and are eliminated within gross management and other fees and performance fees, respectively, in the Group income statement.
The management fees elimination includes $3 million 2016: $4 million in relation to the third-party share of these investments and therefore represents externally generated management fees.
The performance fee elimination includes $2 million 2016: $nil in relation to third-party share which represents performance fees generated externally.
4 Includes $1 million 2016: $2 million in relation to the third-party share of these investments and therefore represents costs incurred externally.
Loans to fund products Loans to fund products are short-term advances primarily to Man guaranteed products, which are made to assist with the financing of the leverage associated with the structured products.
The loans are repayable on demand and are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The average balance during the year is $28 million 2016: $33 million.
The liquidity requirements of guaranteed products together with commitments to provide financial support Note 27 which give rise to loans to funds are subject to our routine liquidity stress testing and any liquidity requirements are met by available cash resources, or the syndicated revolving credit facility.
Loans to fund products expose Man to credit risk and therefore the credit decision making process is subject to limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite.
The carrying value represents Mans maximum exposure to this credit risk.
Loans are closely monitored against the assets held in the funds.
The largest single loan to a fund product at 31 December 2017 is $12 million 2016: $4 million.
Fund entities are not externally rated, however our internal modelling suggests that fund products have a probability of default that is equivalent to a credit rating of A.
Structured entities Man has evaluated all exposures and concluded that where Man holds an investment, loan, fees receivable and accrued income, guarantee or commitment with an investment fund or a collateralised loan obligation, this represents an interest in a structured entity as defined by IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements.
As with structured entities, investment funds are designed so that their activities are not governed by way of voting rights and contractual arrangements are the dominant factor in affecting an investors returns.
The activities of these entities are governed by investment management agreements or, in the case of a collateralised loan obligation, the indenture.
The key considerations in assessing whether the Group controls a structured entity, and therefore should be consolidated into the Groups financial statements, are outlined in Note 1.
Consolidated structured entities are detailed in Note 13.2.

Performance fees can only be earned after a high water mark is achieved.
For performance fee eligible funds, performance fees are within the range of 10% to 20%.
Support by way of loans provided to unconsolidated structured entities is detailed in Note 13.3, and is included within the maximum exposure to loss above.
Furthermore, on occasion Man agrees to purchase illiquid investments from the funds at market rates in order to facilitate investor withdrawals.
Man has not provided any other non-contractual support to unconsolidated structured entities.

Feereceivables and accrued income represent management and performance fees from fund products and are received in cash when the funds net asset values are determined.
The majority of fees are deducted from the NAV of the respective funds by the independent administrators and therefore the credit risk of fee receivables is minimal.
No balances are overdue or delinquent at year end.
The increase in accrued income in 2017 primarily relates to the increase in performance fee income which crystallised on 31 December 2017.
Performance fees receivable at year end are $196 million 2016: $32 million.

All provisions are current, other than onerous property lease contracts as outlined below, given the Group does not have the unconditional right to defer settlement.
Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the obligation arises, following communication of the formal plan.
The $6 million charge for onerous property lease contracts is included within other costs as detailed in Note 5.
Provisions for onerous property leasecontracts represent the present value of the future lease payments that the Group is presently obliged to make under non-cancellable onerous operating lease contracts, less the future benefit expected to be generated from these, including sub-lease revenue where applicable.
The unexpired terms of the onerous leases range from one to 18 years, with all onerous property lease contracts therefore non-current.
The credit of $24 million in relation to litigation provisions is as a result of the reassessment of the Groups exposure to claims and other settlements.

Investments in associates Associates are entities in which Man holds an interest and over which it has significant influence but not control, and are accounted for using the equity method.
In assessing significant influence Man considers the investment held and its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee through its voting or other rights.
Further details of Mans equity investment holdings are included in Note 29.
Under the equity method associates are carried at cost plus or minus our share of cumulative post-acquisition movements in undistributed profits orlosses.
Gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interests in these entities.
An impairment assessment of the carrying value of associates is performed annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, and any impairment is expensed in the Group income statement.
Mans investments in associates are as follows: Year ended 31 December 2017 Year ended 31 December 2016 Nephila Nephila $m Holdings Ltd Other Total Holdings Ltd Other Total At beginning of the year 30 1 31 28 2 30 Share of post-tax profit loss 7 1 8 3 1 2 Dividends received 8 8 1 1 Sale of investment in associate 2 2 At year end 29 29 30 1 31 Nephila Holdings Limited is an alternative investment manager based in Bermuda specialising in the management of funds which underwrite natural catastrophe reinsurance and invest in insurance-linked securities and weather derivatives.

Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful life, which for leasehold improvements is over the shorter of the life of the lease and the improvement up to 24 years and for equipment is between three and ten years.
Deferred compensation arrangements Man operates equity-settled share-based payment schemes as well as fund product based compensation arrangements.
For compensation plans whereby deferred compensation is invested in fund products managed by Man, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the fund units is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, with a corresponding liability.
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, which is remeasured at each reporting date, and equates to the fair value of the underlying fund products at settlement date.
During the year, $59 million 2016: $55 million relating to share-based payment and deferred fund product plans is included within compensation costs Note 4, consisting of share-based payments of $19 million 2016: $18 million and deferred fund product plans of $40 million 2016: $37 million.
The unamortised deferred compensation at year end is $51 million 2016: $43 million and has a weighted average remaining vesting period of 2.2 years 2016: 1.9 years.

Deferred compensation arrangements continued 19.1 Employee Trusts The Employee Trusts have the obligation to deliver shares, options and fund product based payments which have been granted to employees.
Mancontributed funds of $22 million in 2017 2016: $38 million in order for the Trusts to meet their current period obligations.
The Employee Trusts are fully consolidated into Man and shares held are treated as treasury shares for EPS purposes Note 8.
The shares held by theEmployee Trusts are deducted from Tier 1 Capital Note 20.
The Employee Trusts are controlled by independent trustees and their assets are held separately from those of Man.
At 31 December 2017, the net assets of the Employee Trusts amounted to $73 million 2016: $69 million.
These assets include 20,272,423 2016: 19,614,073 ordinary shares in the Company, $10 million notional value options over Man shares 2016: $10 million, and $25million of fund units 2016: $24 million to deliver against the future obligations.
The shares are recorded at cost and shown as a deduction from shareholders funds.

19.2 Share-based payments Share-based payments are remuneration payments to selected employees that take the form of an award of shares in Man Group plc.
Awards typically vest over three years, although conditions vary between different types of award.
In respect of equity-settled share-based payment schemes, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the share awards and options granted is recognised as an expense, with the corresponding credit being recognised in equity.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the share awards and options at grant date.
The fair value of the share awards and options granted in exchange for employee services is calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model that takes into account the effect of both financial and demographic assumptions.
Forfeiture and early vesting are based on historical observable data.
Changes to the original estimates, ifany, are included in the Group income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Share options The fair values of share options granted in the year under the Sharesave share option scheme, and the assumptions used in the calculations, are asfollows: Grant date 12 09 2017 15 09 2016 1 Weighted average share price at grant date $ 2.2 1.5 2 Weighted average exercise price at grant date $ 1.7 1.2 Share options granted in the period 1,899,586 3,589,100 Vesting period years 35 35 Expected share price volatility % 45 45 Dividend yield % 6 6 Risk-free rate % 0.3 0.2 Expected option life years 3.3 3.3 Number of options assumed to vest 1,447,617 2,732,645 Average fair value per option granted $ 0.5 0.4 Notes: 1 Sterling share price each year of 1.67 and 1.16, respectively.
2 Sterling exercise price each year of 1.32 and 0.90, respectively.

Capital management Details of the Groups capital management and dividend policy are provided within the Chief Financial Officers Review on pages 28 and 29.
Share capital and capital reserves Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax.
Own shares held through the Employee Trusts Note 19 are recorded at cost, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of tax, and are deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are transferred to employees or sold.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.

They do not confer any rights of redemption.
Ordinary shareholders have the right to receive notice of, attend, vote and speak at general meetings.
A holder of ordinary shares is entitled to one vote per ordinary share held when a vote is taken on a poll and one vote only when a vote is taken on a show of hands.

Pension Man operates 12 2016: 12 defined contribution plans and two 2016: two funded defined benefit plans.
Defined contribution plans Man pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
Man has no further payment obligation once the contributions have been paid.
Defined contribution pension costs totalled $8 million for the year to 31 December 2017 2016: $10 million and are recognised as pension costs in the Group income statement when they are due.
Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan creates a financial obligation to provide funding to the pension plan to provide a retired employee with pension benefits usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
As with the vast majority of similar arrangements, Man ultimately underwrites the risks related to the defined benefit plans.
The risks that this exposes Man to include: Uncertainty in benefit payments: The value of Mans liabilities for post-retirement benefits will ultimately depend on the amount of benefits paid out.
This in turn will depend on the level of inflation for those benefits that are subject to some form of inflation protection and how long individuals live.
Volatility in asset values: Man is exposed to future movements in the values of assets held in the plans to meet future benefit payments.
Uncertainty in cash funding: Movements in the values of the obligations or assets may result in Man being required to provide higher levels of cash.
The two defined benefit plans operated are the Man Group plc Pension Fund in the UK the UK Plan and the Man Group Pension Plan in Switzerland theSwiss Plan.
At 31 December 2017, the UK plan comprised 93% 31 December 2016: 93% of the Groups total defined benefit pension obligations.
The UK Plan is operated separately from Man and managed by independent trustees.
The trustees are responsible for payment of the benefits and management of the UK Plans assets.
Under UK regulations, Man and the trustees of the UK Plan are required to agree a funding strategy and contribution schedule for the UK Plan.
130 Man Group plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements 21.
Pension continued In order to maintain flexibility with regards to the funding of the UK Plan, Man set up the Man Group Reservoir Trust the Reservoir Trust in 2010.
Man contributed $76 million 50 million of assets to the Reservoir Trust on 31 March 2010 and has committed to ensure the Reservoir Trust value remains at least 69 million from 1 April 2013 or at the level of the funding deficit in the UK Plan, if lower.
The Reservoir Trust gave the pension trustees comfort that Man could fund a deficit at 31 December 2017 and in the event that the UK Plan was fully funded, allowed Man to recover the assets so that the UK Plan was not over funded.
The Reservoir Trust is treated as an asset of the UK Plan as: 1 the Reservoir Trust is legally separate from Man and exists solely to fund employee benefits: 2 the assets of the Reservoir Trust are passed to the UK Plan in the event of any default or insolvency situation, such that they are not available to Mans creditors: and 3 the funding position of the UK Plan is in deficit.
The Reservoir Trust assets are due to be transferred to the Man Group plc Pension Fund before 31 March 2018.
The latest funding valuation of the UK Plan was carried out by independent qualified actuaries as at 31 December 2014 and indicated a deficit of 11 million, after including 59m of assets in the Reservoir Trust.
To remove the funding deficit, Man agreed to make a cash payment of 11.8m to the UK Plan during 2015 along with a further payment in March 2018 from the Reservoir Trust to cover any remaining funding deficit.
No cash contributions were made to the UK Plan in the year to 31 December 2017.
A funding update as at 31 December 2017 will be available later in 2018.
The assets of the Reservoir Trust may be required to cover any remaining funding deficit.
If following this payment there is still a funding deficit and therefore the UK Plan assets are insufficient to pay the benefits due, Man may need to make further contributions.
The actuarial valuation with an effective date of 31 December 2017 is currently underway.
As part of this valuation, a new recovery plan may be agreed.
For the UK Plan, the Group has concluded that it has no requirement to adjust the balance sheet to recognise either a current surplus or a minimum funding requirement on the basis that the Group has an unconditional right to a refund of a current or projected future surplus at some point in the future.
For the Swiss Plan, there is an asset restriction at the 2017 year end.
The Swiss Plan holds some of its assets in an employer contribution reserve, which can be used to reduce the Groups future contributions into the Plan.
As the employer contribution reserve is less than the measured surplus as at 31 December 2017, the surplus has been restricted to the value of the employer contribution reserve.
The UK Plan was closed to new members in May 1999 and to future accrual in May 2011.
Employed members of the UK Plan retain enhanced benefits, including a link to salary, on their accrued benefits in the Plan.
Future benefits are provided via a defined contribution plan.
In Switzerland, the Group operates a retirement foundation with assets which are held separately from the Group.
This foundation covers the majority of employees in Switzerland and provides benefits on a cash balance basis.
Each employee has a retirement account to which the employee and the Group make contributions at rates set out in the plan rules based on a percentage of salary.
Every year the pension fund commission composed of employer and employee representatives decides the level of interest, if any, to apply to retirement accounts based on their agreed policy.
At retirement an employee can take their retirement account as a lump sum or have this paid as a pension.
The amounts recognised in the Group balance sheet are determined as follows: 31 December 31 December $m 2017 2016 Present value of funded obligations 464 426 Fair value of plan assets 499 455 Surplus 35 29 Amount not recognised due to asset ceiling Swiss Plan see above 3 2 Net pension asset in the Group balance sheet at year end 32 27 The increase in the net pension asset from 31 December 2016 to 31 December 2017 is driven by the UK Plan, largely as a result of assets performing above the liability growth rate discount rate and changes to the expected mortality rates, partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate assumption due to a fall in corporate bond yields.
Our economic capital model includes capital in respect of a possible deficit in the pension plans.

Pension continued The assets held by the two plans as at 31 December 2017 are as follows: UK Plan Swiss Plan $m % $m % Swiss equities 3 9 Non-Swiss equities 6 17 Index-linked government bonds 45 10 Absolute return bonds 49 10 Swiss bonds 5 13 Non-Swiss bonds 7 21 Property 4 11 Hedge funds 1 1 LDI 121 26 Diversified growth funds 106 23 Cash 46 10 9 24 Other 2 4 Reservoir Trust fund of hedge funds 95 21 Total assets 462 100 37 100 The plans do not invest directly in property occupied by Man or in Mans own transferable financial securities.
The UK Plans investment strategy is set by the trustees of the plan.
The current strategy is broadly split into growth and matching portfolios.
The growth portfolio is invested in diversified growth funds.
The matching portfolio is invested primarily in government and corporate bonds the latter through the Absolute return bonds holding, and liability driven investment LDI funds.
The government bond assets and diversified growth funds have prices quoted in active markets and the absolute return bonds and LDI are primarily unquoted.
At 31 December 2017, around 65% of the plan assets relate to those with quoted prices and 35% with unquoted prices 2016: around 65% quoted and 35% unquoted.
The actual return on plan assets for the year to 31 December 2017 was $23 million 2016: $75 million.
Part of the investment objective of the UK Plan is to minimise fluctuations in the plans funding levels due to changes in the value of the liabilities.
This is primarily achieved through the use of the LDI funds, whose main goal is to hedge movements in the liabilities due to changes in interest rate and inflation expectations.
The current investment strategy aims to hedge around 100% of the movement in the technical provisions funding measure, as opposed to the IAS19 accounting measure, due to both interest rate and inflation expectation changes.
LDI primarily involves the use of government bonds including re-purchase agreements and derivatives such as interest rate and inflation swaps.
There are no annuities or longevity swaps.
These instruments are typically priced and collateralised daily by the UK Plans LDI manager and or central clearing houses.
Given that the purpose of LDI is to hedge corresponding liability exposures, the main risk is that the investments held move differently to the liability exposures.
This risk is managed by the Trustees, their advisers and the UK Plans LDI manager, who regularly assess the position.
As the Swiss Plan is essentially a defined contribution plan with guarantees, the assets held aim to be at least as much as the total of the member account balances at any point in time.
Member account balances cannot reduce, but interest is only applied to the account balances when sufficient surplus assets are available.
As such there is no specific asset liability matching strategy in place, but if the liabilities the sum of the member account balances ever exceed the value of the assets, the Company will consider how to remove a deficit as quickly as possible.
Segmental analysis The criteria for identifying an operating segment is that it is a component of Man whose results are regularly reviewed by the Board and the Senior Management Executive Committee to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance.
Management information regarding revenues, gross management fee margins, investment performance and distribution costs relevant to the operation of the investment managers, products and the investor base are reviewed by the Board and the Senior Management Executive Committee.
A centralised shared infrastructure for operations, product structuring, distribution and support functions for each of the five investment managers which Man incorporates AHL, GLG, FRM, Numeric and GPM means that operating costs are not allocated to constituent parts of the investment management business.
As a result, performance is assessed, resources are allocated and other strategic and financial management decisions are determined by the Board and the Senior Management Executive Committee on the basis of the investment management business of Man as a whole.
Accordingly, we operate and report as a single segment investment management business, together with relevant information regarding FUM flows, gross margins and distribution costs, to allow for analysis of the direct contribution of products and the respective investor base.

Revenue from any single fund during the year did not exceed 10% of total revenues.
Non-current assets are allocated based on where the assets are located, and include investments in associates, leasehold improvements and equipment, and goodwill and other intangible assets.
Foreign currencies The majority of revenues, assets, liabilities and financing are denominated in USD and therefore Mans presentation currency is USD.
For consolidated entities with a USD functional currency, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at each balancesheet date rate.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at the spot rate at the date of the transaction or, if appropriate, the average rate for the month in which the transaction occurs.
Resulting exchange differences are recognised in the Group income statement.
For consolidated entities that have a functional currency other than USD, the assets and liabilities are translated into USD at the balance sheet date rate.
Income and expenses are translated at the average rate for the period in which the transactions occur.
Resulting exchange differences are recorded in other comprehensive income.
Fair value of financial assets liabilities Man discloses the fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities using three levels, as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities can be analysed as follows: 31 December 2017 31 December 2016 $m Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets held at fair value: Investments in fund products and other investments Note 13 3 137 112 252 3 207 68 278 Investments in line-by-line consolidated funds Note 13 452 452 490 490 Derivative financial instruments Note 14 9 9 2 2 3 598 112 713 3 699 68 770 Financial liabilities held at fair value: Derivative financial instruments Note 15 10 10 22 22 Contingent consideration Note 15 243 243 161 161 10 243 253 22 161 183 During the year, there were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances that affected the fair value of Mans financial assets and no significant transfers of financial assets or liabilities held at fair value between categories.
For investments in fund products, Level 2 investments comprise holdings primarily in unlisted, open-ended, active and liquid funds, such as seeding investments, which have daily or weekly pricing derived from third-party information.
A transfer into Level 3 would be deemed to occur where the level of prolonged activity, as evidenced by subscriptions and redemptions, is deemed insufficient to support a Level 2 classification.
This, as well as other factors such as a deterioration of liquidity in the underlying investments, would result in a Level 3 classification.
The material holdings within this category are priced on a recurring basis based on information supplied by third-parties, with a liquidity premium adjustment applied based on the expected timeframe for exit.
Reasonable changes in the liquidity premium assumptions would not have a significant impact on the fair value.

Fair value of financial assets liabilities continued The fair values of non-current assets and liabilities held for sale Note 13.2 are equal to the carrying values of $145 million 2016: $263 million and $66 million respectively 2016: $132 million, and would be classified within Level 2.
The fair value of borrowings Note 12 is $156 million 2016: $157 million and would have been classified as Level 1.
The basis of measuring the fair value of Level 3 investments is outlined in Note 13.1.
The movements in Level 3 financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value are as follows: Year ended 31December 2017 Year ended 31December 2016 Financial Financial liabilities at Financial assets Financial assets at fair fair value at fair value liabilities at fair value through through profit through profit value through $m profit or loss or loss or loss profit or loss Level 3 financial assets liabilities held at fair value At beginning of the year 68 161 62 206 Assets reclassified from held for sale 11 Purchases losses 47 52 8 Total gains losses in the Group statement of comprehensive income 5 41 1 20 Profit loss included in income statement 5 41 1 20 Included in other comprehensive income Sales or settlements 8 11 14 25 At year end 112 243 68 161 Total gains losses for the year included in the Group statement of comprehensive income for assets liabilities held at year end 5 41 1 20 The financial liabilities in Level 3 primarily relate to the contingent consideration payable to the former owners of Numeric and Aalto, with the other contingent consideration relating to smaller acquisitions including FRM, Pine Grove, and BAML fund of funds.
Year ended 31 December 2017 Year ended 31 December 2016 $m Numeric Aalto Other Total Numeric Other Total Contingent consideration payable At beginning of the year 150 11 161 164 42 206 Purchases 52 52 Revaluation of contingent consideration 15 1 1 15 28 12 40 Unwind of contingent consideration discount Note 6 18 7 1 26 18 1 19 Finance expense 1 1 Sales or settlements 8 3 11 4 21 25 At year end 175 60 8 243 150 11 161 The revaluation of contingent consideration in the Group income statement is an adjustment to the fair value of expected acquisition earn-out payments.
The $15 million increase in the fair value of contingent consideration is largely as a result of better than expected Numeric performance during 2017.
The $28 million reduction in the fair value of the Numeric contingent consideration in 2016 was largely due to a decrease in the forecast management fees on long only products and net inflows.
The Numeric contingent consideration relates to an ongoing 18.3% equity interest of Numeric management in the business and profit interests of 16.5%, pursuant to a call and put option arrangement.
The call and put option structure means that it is virtually certain that Man will elect to, or be obliged to, purchase the interests held by Numeric management at five call option or five and a half put option years post-closing 5 September 2014.
The maximum aggregate amount payable by Man in respect of the option consideration is capped at $275 million.
The Aalto contingent consideration is dependent on levels of run rate management fees measured following one, four, six and eight years from completion.
The maximum aggregate amount payable by Man is capped at $207 million.
The fair values are based on discounted cash flow calculations, which represent the expected future profits of each business as per the earn-out arrangements.
The fair values are determined using a combination of inputs, such as weighted average cost of capital, net management fee margins, performance, operating margins and the growth in FUM, as applicable.
The post-tax discount rates applied are 11% for management fees and 17% for performance fees for Numeric and Other, and 15% for Aalto.
The most significant inputs into the valuations at 31 December 2017 are as follows: Numeric Aalto Weighted average net management fee margin over the remaining earn-out period 0.4% 0.8% Compound growth in average FUM over the remaining earn-out period 7% 19% 136 Man Group plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements 25.
Fair value of financial assets liabilities continued Changes in inputs would result in the following increase decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration creditor at 31 December 2017, with a corresponding expense gain in the Group income statement: Numeric Aalto Weighted average net management fee margin 0.1% increase 51 6 1 0.1% decrease 51 10 Compound growth in average FUM 1% increase 6 4 1% decrease 6 3 Note: 1 Any increase in net management fee margins would have less of an impact on the contingent consideration given the calculation is close to the maximum capped earn-out for the year 1 payment.
Related party transactions Related parties comprise key management personnel, associates and fund entities which Man is deemed to control.
All transactions with related parties were carried out on an arms length basis.
Refer to Note 17 for details of income earned from associates.
Management fees earned from fund entities in which Man holds a controlling interest are detailed in Note 13.
Contingent consideration payable to Numeric and Aalto management is detailed in Note 25.
The Executive Committee, together with the non-executive directors, are considered to be the Groups key management, being those directors, partners and employees having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities at Man.
The average key management headcount for the year ended 31 December 2017 has increased by around 3% from 2016.

Financial guarantees and commitments 27.1 Daylight settlement facilities From time to time Man provides a guarantee over certain bank accounts of structured product entities to secure daylight settlement facilities which allow for the efficient movement of cash during the trading day.

Mans participation in the profits of Nephila is governed by the share class rights and therefore does not relate proportionately to the ownership interest held.
