In addition, in the US and UK various plans operate which provide members with post-retirement medical benefits.
The Groups post-employment plans in the UK, US and Germany together account for 98% of plan assets and 98% of plan liabilities.
The Groups post-employment plans include both funded and unfunded arrangements.
The UK pension schemes are funded, albeit in deficit in common with many other UK pension schemes, with the scheme assets held in trustee-administered funds.
The German and other European plans are generally unfunded, with pension payments made from company funds as they fall due, rather than from scheme assets.
The US schemes include a combination of funded and unfunded pension and medical plans, while Japan also operates a funded pension plan.
The Groups defined benefit pension arrangements provide benefits to members in the form of an assured level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided typically depends on length of service and salary levels in the years leading up to retirement.
In the UK and Germany, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with inflation, whereas in the US pensions generally do not receive inflationary increases once in payment.
The UK and German schemes are closed to new entrants, while the US schemes are closed to future accrual.
Independent actuarial valuations of all major defined benefit scheme assets and liabilities were carried out at 31 December 2017.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related service cost elements were measured using the projected unit credit method.
a Defined benefit schemes assumptions and estimates Estimating the post-employment obligation involves a number of significant assumptions, which are detailed below.
Key assumptions and estimates: UK GKN2 GKN3 Americas Europe ROW % % % % % 2017 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries past service n a n a n a 2.50 Rate of increase in payment and deferred pensions 3.00 3.00 n a 1.75 n a Discount rate past service 2.60 2.40 3.60 1.70 0.50 Inflation assumption past service 3.20 3.15 n a 1.75 n a Rate of increase in medical costs: Initial long-term 5.4 5.4 6.5 5.0 n a n a 2016 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries past future service 4.30 4.25 n a n a 2.50 Rate of increase in payment and deferred pensions 3.20 3.30 n a 1.75 n a Discount rate past future service 2.60 2.70 2.45 4.10 1.60 0.50 Inflation assumption past future service 3.30 3.25 3.35 n a 1.75 n a Rate of increase in medical costs: Initial long-term 5.4 5.4 6.75 5.0 n a n a In prior years, there were separate assumptions for past and future service in relation to the UK pension scheme.
However, following the closure of GKN2 to future accrual from 1 July 2017, this is no longer relevant.
The UK schemes each use a duration-specific discount rate derived from the LCP Treasury Model, which is based on corporate bonds with two or more AAratings.
The European discount rate was calculated with reference to Aon Hewitts German discount rate yield curve.
For the US, the discount rate referenced the Citigroup intermediate pension liability index, the Merrill Lynch US corporate AA 10 years index and the Towers Watson Rate:LINK benchmark.
The approach taken in Europe and the US is consistent with the prior year.
com 155 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 continued 24 Post-employment obligations continued a Defined benefit schemes assumptions and estimates continued Key assumptions and estimates continued During the year, the Group has taken the decision to change the model used in deriving the discount rates used in post-employment obligation valuations.
Previously, gilt yields were used to extrapolate AA rated corporate bond yields to durations where no deep market in corporate bonds existed.
The current year approach looks at a number of different factors to set discount rates and is intended to remove the distortions inherent in the gilt yield curve resulting from high demand from institutional investors.
This change increased the discount rate by 0.1% and remains consistent with the requirements of IAS 19.
The underlying mortality assumptions for the major schemes, are as follows: UK The key current year mortality assumptions for both GKN2 and GKN3 use S2PA year of birth mortality tables adjusted for GKN experience with CMI 2016 improvements and a 1.25% per annum long-term improvement trend.
These assumptions give the following expectations for each scheme: for GKN3 a male aged 65 lives for a further 22.0 years and a female aged 65 lives for a further 24.6 years, while a male aged 40 is expected to live a further 24.8 years from age 65 and a female aged 40 is expected to live a further 26.5 years from age 65.
For GKN2 a male aged 65 lives for a further 22.3 years and a female aged 65 lives for a further 25.1 years, while a male aged 40 is expected to live a further 24.2 years from age 65 and a female aged 40 is expected to live a further 27.0 years from age 65.
Overseas In the US, RP-2014 tables have been used, while in Germany the RT2005-G tables have been used.
In the US, the longevity assumption for a male aged 65 is that he lives a further 20.7 years female 22.7 years, while in Germany a male aged 65 lives for a further 19.1 years female 23.2 years.
The longevity assumption for a US male currently aged 45 is that he also lives for a further 22.3 years once attaining 65 years female 24.2 years, with the German equivalent assumption for a male being 21.8 years female 25.7 years.
These assumptions are based on the prescribed tables, rather than GKN experience.
Assumption sensitivity analysis The impact of a one percentage point movement in the primary assumptions longevity: 1 year on the defined benefit obligations as at 31 December 2017 is set out below: UK Americas Europe ROW Liabilities Liabilities Liabilities Liabilities m m m m Discount rate 1% 478 39 102 2 Discount rate -1% 622 48 132 1 Rate of inflation 1% 525 1 89 Rate of inflation -1% 407 74 Life expectancy 1 year 122 10 25 Life expectancy -1 year 124 10 23 Health cost trend 1% 2 2 Health cost trend -1% 2 1 The above sensitivity analyses are based on isolated changes in each assumption, while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and there is likely to be some level of correlation between movements in different assumptions.
In addition, these sensitivities relate only to potential movement in the defined benefit obligations.
The assets, including derivatives held by the schemes, have been designed to mitigate the impact of these movements to some extent, such that the movements in the defined benefit obligations shown above would, in practice, be partly offset by movements in asset valuations.
However, the above sensitivities are shown to illustrate at a high level the scale of sensitivity of the defined benefit obligations to key actuarial assumptions.
The same actuarial methods have been used to calculate these sensitivities as are used to calculate the relevant balance sheet values, and have not changed compared to the previous period.
156 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION Key estimates It has been determined that the key estimates within the calculation of the defined benefit plans are discount rates, the rates of inflation and life expectancies.
It is reasonably probable that a change in these could occur within the next year that could materially change the value of the defined benefit plans.
Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken in the above table to illustrate the impact of a 1% or one-year increase and decrease in these metrics.
Pension partnership interest During the year, the Group has paid 30 million 2016: 30 million to the UK pension schemes through its pension partnership arrangement and this is included within the amount of contributions benefits paid.
Funding update and closure of GKN2 to future accrual During the year, the Groups two UK defined benefit pension schemes completed their triennial funding valuations as at 5 April 2016 for GKN2 and 31 December 2016 for GKN3.
The outcome of these discussions resulted in a lump sum contribution of 250 million paid in October 2017 to GKN2, and annual contributions of 6 million until 2022 to GKN3.
These contributions along with investment outperformance is expected to close the deficits on the Trustees funding basis by April 2022 for GKN3 and June 2031 for GKN2.
During the year, a decision was also taken to close GKN2 to future accrual and following a consultation process with the scheme members, the closure took place effective 30 June 2017.
UK pension benefits are now provided on a defined contribution basis.

The contribution for deficit funding expected to be paid by the Group during 2018 to the UK schemes is 6 million.
In addition, a distribution of 30 million is expected to be made from the UK pension partnership to GKN2 in the first half of 2018, which brings the total expected UK cash requirement for 2018 to 36 million.

com 159 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 continued 24 Post-employment obligations continued c Defined benefit scheme risk factors Through its various post-employment pension and medical plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below.
The Groups focus is on managing the cash demands which the various pension plans place on the Group, rather than balance sheet volatility in its own right.
For funded schemes, cash requirements are generally determined by funding valuations which are performed on a different basis from accounting valuations.
Asset volatility: plan liabilities are calculated using discount rates set with reference to bond yields although the discount rate methodology differs for accounting and funding purposes.
If plan assets deliver a return which is lower than the discount rate, this will create or increase a plan deficit.
GKNs various pension plans hold a significant proportion of equities and similar growth assets, which are expected to out-perform bonds in the long term, albeit at the risk of short-term volatility.
As the plans mature, with a shorter time horizon to cope with volatility, the Group will gradually reduce holdings of growth assets in favour of increased matching assets bonds and similar.
In the meantime, the Group considers that equities and similar assets are an appropriate means of managing pension funding requirements, given the long-term nature of the liabilities and the strength of the Group to withstand volatility.
Changes in bond yields: a decrease in bond yields will typically increase plan liabilities and vice versa, although this will be offset partially by an increase in the value of bonds held in the asset portfolios of the various plans.
The effect of changes in bond yields is more pronounced in unfunded schemes where there is no potential for an offsetting movement in asset values.
Inflation risk: as UK and some European pension obligations are linked to inflation, higher inflation expectations will lead to higher liabilities, although caps are in place to protect against unusually high levels of inflation.
The UK asset portfolio includes some inflation-linked bonds to provide an element of protection against this risk, while additional protection is provided by inflation derivatives.
Member longevity: as the Groups post-employment obligations are generally to provide benefits for the life of the member, increases in life expectancy will generally result in an increase in plan liabilities and vice versa.
d Defined benefit schemes demographic factors Weighted average duration is a measurement technique designed to represent the estimated average time to payment of all cash flows arising as a result of defined benefit obligations i. e. pension payments and similar.
The weighted average duration years of the defined benefit obligations in the UK, US and Germany are as follows: 2017 2016 years years UK GKN2 19 19 GKN3 11 11 US 12 12 Germany 17 18 Defined benefit obligations are classified into those representing active members of a scheme or plan i. e. those who are currently employed by the Group, deferred members i. e. those who have accrued benefit entitlements, but who are no longer employed by the Group and are not yet drawing a pension and pensioner members i. e. those who are currently in receipt of a pension.
Additional information regarding the average age, number of members and value of the defined benefit obligation in each of these categories for the UK, US and Germany are given below: Active Deferred Pensioner Value Value Value Age Number m Age Number m Age Number m UK GKN2 53 10,070 1,583 72 7,843 1,161 GKN3 56 2,913 58 80 9,490 490 US 54 2,367 111 57 1,216 43 75 4,413 206 Germany 55 2,386 293 57 843 53 72 3,068 280 Within the UK, there are two pension schemes referred to as GKN2 and GKN3.
GKN3 is a mature scheme, comprised primarily of pensioner members, which is already at peak annual cash outflow benefit payments : while GKN2 is less mature, with a larger deferred population.
Benefit payments from GKN2 are forecast to continue to rise until the mid 2030s, when they will peak, before beginning to decline.
e Defined contribution schemes The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes.
The charge to the income statement in the year was 84 million 2016: 62 million.
