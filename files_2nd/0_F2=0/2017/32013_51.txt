The disclosures have been prepared in accordance with IFRIC 14.
In particular, where the calculation for a plan results in a surplus, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of any available future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan, and any additional liabilities are recognised as required.
At this stage, the company does not believe the IASBs proposed amendments to IFRIC 14 will materially affect its ability to recognise these surpluses, but will review this fully once any amendments are finalised.
Financial statements Financial statements of the group: Operating assets and liabilities DIAGEO ANNUAL REPORT 2017 125 b Principal risks and assumptions The material post employment plans are not exposed to any unusual, entity specific or scheme specific risks but there are general risks: Inflation the majority of the plans obligations are linked to inflation.
Higher inflation will lead to increased liabilities which is partially offset by holdings of inflation linked gilts and swaps and the plans provide for caps on the level of inflationary increases.
Interest rate The plan liabilities are determined using discount rates derived from yields on AA-rated corporate bonds.
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities though this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the bonds held by the post employment plans.
Mortality The majority of the obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members and their partners, so any increase in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
Asset returns Assets held by the pension plans are invested in a diversified portfolio of equities, bonds and other assets.
Volatility in asset values will lead to movements in the net asset deficit reported in the consolidated balance sheet for post employment plans which in addition will also impact the post employment expense in the consolidated income statement.
The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the groups deficit surplus in the main post employment plans at 30 June in the relevant year.
The assumptions used to calculate the charge credit in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 30 June are based on the assumptions disclosed as at the previous 30 June.

1 T he sensitivity analyses above have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions and may not be representative of the actual change.

126 DIAGEO ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Financial statements of the group: Operating assets and liabilities c Investment and hedging strategy movements in the liabilities of the plans.
At 30 June 2017, The investment strategy for the groups funded post employment approximately 38% and 78% 2016 27% and 80% of the UK plans is decided locally by the trustees of the plan and or Diageo, as Schemes liabilities were hedged against future movements in appropriate, and takes account of the relevant statutory interest rates and inflation, respectively, through the combined effect requirements.
The objective of the investment strategy is to achieve a of bonds and swaps.
At 30 June 2017, approximately 36% and 68% target rate of return in excess of the movement on the liabilities, 2016 28% and 60% of the Irish Schemes liabilities were hedged while taking an acceptable level of investment risk relative to the against future movements in interest rates and inflation, respectively, liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using the funds of the through the combined effect of bonds and swaps.
plans to invest in a variety of asset classes that are expected over the The discount rates used are based on the yields of high quality long term to deliver a target rate of return.
The majority of the fixed income investments.
For the UK plans, which represent investment strategies have significant amounts allocated to equities, approximately 69% of total plan liabilities, the discount rate is with the intention that this will result in the ongoing cost to the determined by reference to the yield curves of AA-rated corporate group of the post employment plans being lower over the long term, bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows are similar within acceptable boundaries of risk.
Significant amounts are to those of the plans.
A similar process is used to determine the invested in bonds in order to provide a natural hedge against discount rates used for the non-UK plans.
