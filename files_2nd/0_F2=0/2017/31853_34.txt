Sharesave scheme Shareholder approval was obtained at the 2013 AGM for the introduction of a new HM Revenue & Customs approved Savings-Related Share Option scheme, known as The Go-Ahead Group plc 2013 Savings-Related Share Option Scheme the Sharesave scheme for employees of the Group and its operating companies.
The Sharesave scheme is open to all full time and part-time employees including executive directors who have completed at least six months of continuous service with a Go-Ahead Group company at the date they are invited to participate in a scheme launch.
To take part, qualifying employees have to enter into a savings contract for a period of three years under which they agree to save a monthly amount, from a minimum of 5 to a maximum not exceeding 500 specified by the Group at the time of invitation.
For the February 2016 launch, the maximum monthly savings limit set by the Group was 50.
At the end of the savings period, employees can buy shares at a 20% discount of the market price set at the date of invitation or take their full savings back.
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The key assumptions input into the model are future share price volatility, future dividend yield, future risk free interest rate, forfeiture rate and option life.
