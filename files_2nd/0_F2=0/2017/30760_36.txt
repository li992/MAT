The Group focuses instead on a Group adjusted operating profit measure that incorporates an expected return on investments supporting its long-term business, as described below.
a Definitions Group adjusted operating profit for long-term business is based on expected investment returns on financial investments backing shareholder and policyholder funds over the reporting period, with consistent allowance for the corresponding expected movements in liabilities.
Group adjusted operating profit includes the effect of variance in experience for non-economic items, such as mortality, persistency and expenses, and the effect of changes in non-economic assumptions, where not treated as other items.
Changes due to economic items, such as market value movements and interest rate changes, which give rise to variances between actual and expected investment returns, and the impact of changes in economic assumptions on liabilities, are disclosed separately outside Group adjusted operating profit.
b Economic volatility The investment variances and economic assumption changes excluded from the long-term business Group adjusted operating profit are as follows: 2017 2016 Life business m m Investment variances and economic assumptions 34 379 Investment variances and economic assumption changes were 34 million positive 2016: 379 million positive.
The variance in 2017 is driven by positive variances in the UK, which are partially offset by negative variances in France.
Positive variances in the UK are mainly due to economic modelling developments implemented in 2017.
These include a one-off development to align the approach to calculating the valuation interest rate across the heritage Aviva and Friends Life portfolios and also a development to the approach to calculating the valuation interest rate for certain deferred annuity business.
Positive variances also reflect fewer than expected defaults and downgrades on corporate bonds, better than expected experience on equity release mortgages in terms of losses related to no negative equity guarantees and a reduction in the default allowances for commercial mortgages.
The negative variance in France is primarily due to an increase in life annuity pension reserves, resulting from a reduction to the discount rate cap used in the calculation of these reserves.
This economic assumption change reflects the current environment of prolonged low interest rates.
A further negative variance stems from losses realised in 2017 on derivative-based funds.
During 2017 the Group has kept its long-term assumptions for future property prices and rental income under review to allow for the possible future adverse impact of the decision for the UK to leave the European Union.
The aim has been to maintain the same allowance in these assumptions in 2017 as was included in 2016, as the impact of the Brexit process on the UK economy remains uncertain.
In 2016, investment variances and economic assumption changes were 379 million positive.
Positive variances in the UK reflected lower interest rates and narrowing credit spreads, which increased asset values more than liabilities.
In the first half of 2016 the Group revised its expectation of future property prices and rental income in light of the UK referendum vote for the UK to leave the European Union.
The adverse impact of this adjustment on the Groups equity release and commercial mortgage portfolios was broadly offset in the second half of the year as expectations for future property price and rental growth have increased.
In addition, in the UK the investment variance reflected a refined approach of assuming best estimate expected credit defaults on corporate bonds, with a resulting increase in Group adjusted operating profit in the period.
The positive variance in the UK was partially offset by negative variances in France and Italy.
The negative variance in France reflected losses on equity hedges managed on an economic basis rather than an IFRS basis and falling interest rates, while the negative variance in Italy reflected widening credit spreads.
