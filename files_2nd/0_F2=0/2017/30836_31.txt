180 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 BEWARE OF SHARE FRAUD Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure investors into scams.
They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for upfront payment.
While high profits are promised, if you buy or sell shares in this way you will probably lose your money.

Do not get into a conversation, note the name of the person and rm contacting you and then end the call.
Check the Financial Services Register from www.
uk to see if the person and rm contacting you is authorised by the FCA.
Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised rm, copying its website or giving you false contact details.
Use the rms contact details listed on the Register if you want to call it back.
Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the rm does not have contact details on the Register or you are told they are out of date.
Search the list of unauthorised rms to avoid at www.
Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised rm you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
Think about getting independent financial and professional advice before you hand over any money.
Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
REPORT A SCAM If you are approached by fraudsters please tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at www.
