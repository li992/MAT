The deferred tax asset is based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 17%, which was substantively enacted in September 2016 and is effective from 1 April 2020.
It is unlikely that the Company will generate sufficient taxable profits in the future to utilise these expenses and deficits and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Due to the Companys tax status as an investment trust and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval of such status in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided tax on any capital gains arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments held by the Company.

This exposes the Company to a range of financial risks that could impact on the assets or performance of the Company.
The main risks arising from the Companys pursuit of its investment objective are market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and gearing risk and the Directors approach to the management of them is set out below.
The risks have remained unchanged since the beginning of the year to which the Financial Statements relate.
The Companys exposure to financial instruments comprise: Equity and non-equity shares which are held in the investment portfolio in accordance with the Companys investment objective.
Term loans and bank overdrafts, the main purpose of which is to raise finance for the Companys operations Cash, liquid resources and short-term receivables and payables that arise directly from the Companys operations.
Derivative transactions which the Company enters into which may include equity or index options, index future contracts, forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.
The purpose of these is to manage the market price risks, foreign exchange risks and interest rate risks arising from the Companys investment activities.
The overall management of the risks is determined by the Board and its approach to each risk identified is set out below.
The Board and the Investment Manager co-ordinate the risk management and the Investment Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision.
a Market Risk Market risk comprises three types of risk: market price risk see note 28 a i, currency risk see note 28 a ii, and interest rate risk see note 28 a iii.
i Market Price Risk The Company is an investment company and as such its performance is dependent on the valuation of its investments.
Consequently market price risk is the most significant risk that the Company faces.
Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys operations.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
A detailed breakdown of the investment portfolio is given on pages 30 to 36.
Investments are valued in accordance with the Companys accounting policies as stated in Note 2 f. At the year end, the Companys portfolio included derivative instruments of 716,000 30 April 2016: 2,244,000 Management of the risk In order to manage this risk it is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce both the statistical risk and the risk arising from factors specific to a particular technology sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets, together with stock selection covering small, medium and large companies, and the use of index options, are other factors which act to reduce price risk.
The Investment Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board which meets regularly in order to consider investment strategy.

Management of the risk The Investment Manager mitigates the individual currency risks through the international spread of investments and may make use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Borrowings in foreign currencies are entered into to manage the asset exposure to those currencies, which vary according to the asset allocation.

Based on the year end position, if Sterling had depreciated by a further 10% against the currencies shown, this would have the following effect: 30 April 2017 000 Hong Kong Korean Taiwan US Dollar Euro Yen Dollar Won Dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 464 25 99 9 82 94 Capital return 107,740 6,022 8,073 3,860 7,744 4,354 Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 108,204 6,047 8,172 3,869 7,826 4,448 Change to Shareholders' funds 108,204 6,047 8,172 3,869 7,826 4,448 30 April 2016 000 Hong Kong Korean Taiwan US Dollar Euro Yen Dollar Won Dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 356 32 33 5 19 110 Capital return 70,904 3,677 3,330 1,854 1,327 3,448 Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 71,260 3,709 3,363 1,859 1,346 3,558 Change to Shareholders' funds 71,260 3,709 3,363 1,859 1,346 3,558 Polar Capital Technology Trust plc 103 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2017 Shareholder Information Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Section Overview Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 April 2017 continued 28 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Based on the year end position, if Sterling had appreciated by a further 10% against the currencies shown, this would have the following effect: 30 April 2017 000 Hong Kong Korean Taiwan US Dollar Euro Yen Dollar Won Dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income - profit after tax Revenue return 380 20 81 8 67 77 Capital return 88,151 4,928 6,605 3,158 6,336 3,563 Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 88,531 4,948 6,686 3,166 6,403 3,640 Change to Shareholders' funds 88,531 4,948 6,686 3,166 6,403 3,640 30 April 2016 000 Hong Kong Korean Taiwan US Dollar Euro Yen Dollar Won Dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income - profit after tax Revenue return 291 26 27 5 16 90 Capital return 58,013 3,009 2,725 1,517 1,086 2,821 Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 58,304 3,035 2,752 1,522 1,102 2,911 Change to Shareholders' funds 58,304 3,035 2,752 1,522 1,102 2,911 In the opinion of the Directors, neither of the above sensitivity analyses are representative of the year as a whole since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Companys objectives.
iii Interest Rate Risk Interest rate changes may affect the income received from cash at bank and interest payable on borrowings.
All cash balances earn interest at a variable rate.
The Company finances its operations through its term loans as well as bank overdrafts and any retained gains arising from operations.
The Company uses borrowings in the desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest to both generate the desired interest rate profile and manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Management of the risk The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
The Company may also enter into interest rate swap agreements.
Polar Capital Technology Trust plc 104 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2017 Interest rate exposure The exposure, at 30 April, of financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates i. e. giving cash flow interest rate risk when the rate is due to be reset: fixed interest rates i. e. giving fair value interest rate risk when the financial instrument is due forrepayment.
30 April 2017 30 April 2016 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: 63,602 63,602 70,325 70,325 Cash and Cash equivalents Exposure to fixed interest rates: Bank loan 37,193 37,193 33,565 33,565 Total exposure to interest rates 26,409 26,409 36,760 36,760 Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
The table below illustrates the Companys sensitivity to interest rate movements, with a change of 0.25% p. a. in the rates of interest available to the Companys financial assets and a change of 0.25% p. a in the rates of interest available to the Companys financial liabilities.
The effect on the revenue and capital return after tax and the value of Shareholders funds are as follows if rates increased: 30 April 2017 30 April 2016 000 000 Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax: Revenue return 66 92 Capital return Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 66 92 Change to Shareholders funds 66 92 A corresponding decrease in the rate would have equal and opposite effect to that shown in the table above.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
This is not representative of the year as a whole, since the exposure changes as level of cash loans held during the year will be affected by the strategy being followed in response to the Investment Managers perception of market prospects and the investment opportunities available at any particular time.

Polar Capital Technology Trust plc 106 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2017 d Gearing risk The Companys policy is to increase its exposure to equity markets through the judicious use of borrowings.
When borrowings are invested in such markets, the effect is to magnify the impact on Shareholders funds of changes, both positive and negative, in the value of the portfolio.
Management of the risk The Company uses short-term loans to manage gearing risk, details of which can be found in Note 17.
Gearing risk exposure The loans are valued at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method in the Financial Statements.
The Board regulates the overall level of gearing by raising or lowering cash balances.
e Capital Management Policies and Procedures The Companys capital, or equity, is represented by its net assets which are managed to achieve the Companys investment objective set out on page 37.
The Board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This reviewincludes: i the planned level of gearing through the Companys fixed rate loan facility and ii the need to issue or buy back equity shares for cancellation, which takes account of the difference between the net asset value per share and the share price ie the level of share price discount or premium.
The Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
The Company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements through the Companies Act with respect to its status as a public company.
