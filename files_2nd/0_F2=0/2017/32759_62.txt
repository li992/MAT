Financial statements Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is that the commitments held by the Holding Company are not able to be met.
The Holding Company holds no cash and has no access to debt and instead relies on liquidity from the Partnership.
The liquidity risk associated with the Partnership is set out in the Partnership section above.
The table below details the Holding Companys liquidity analysis for its financial assets and liabilities.
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash flows on the financial assets and liabilities that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross cash flows on those financial assets and liabilities that require gross settlement.
Fair value measurement IFRS 13 requires the Group to establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritises the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3 measurements.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 13 are set as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices or other market corroborated inputs: and Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
For this purpose, the significance of an input is assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety.
If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 measurement.
Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgement, considering factors specific to the asset or liability.
The determination of what constitutes observable requires significant judgement by the Company.
The Group considers observable data to be that market data that is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market.

IFRS 13 requires the fair value measurement of the Partnership to be classified in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the overall valuation of the Partnership.
Given their quantum, the Directors do not consider the Level 3 investments to be significant to the overall fair value of the investment.
As such, and in accordance with IFRS 13, the Partnership investment has been disclosed within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The Directors have provided additional information in respect of the assets and liabilities of the Partnership below.
