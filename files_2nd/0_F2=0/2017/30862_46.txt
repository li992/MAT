Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other securities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the Features page.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These financial risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys classes of financial instruments are as follows: investments in US equity shares, which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: cash held within a liquidity fund: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: a debenture issued by the Company and bank loans, the purpose of which is to finance the Companys operations: forward foreign currency contracts, the purpose of which is to manage the currency risk arising from the Companys investment activities.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market risk is given in parts i and iii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk The majority of the Companys assets and income are denominated in US dollars.
Sterling is the Companys functional currency and the currency in which it reports.
As a result, movements in exchange rates will affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least five occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
The Company has a 50 million debenture in issue which is repayable in June 2018.
It is the Companys policy to hedge the currency risk in respect of this geared portion of the portfolio using three month forward contracts.
At 31st December 2017 the Company held a number of open contracts with UBS, HSBC, Goldman Sachs and Citibank.
The net effect of these contracts is to purchase 50 million for settlement in US dollars and the latest settlement date of these contracts was 23rd January 2018.
Upon maturity, these contracts were rolled over with ANZ, Morgan Stanley, Toronto Dominion and State Street and the settlement date of these new contracts is 24th April 2018.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of return after taxation for the year and net assets with regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and the income receivable in foreign currency and assumes a 10% 2016: 20% appreciation or depreciation in sterling against the US Dollar which is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued a Market risk continued ii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and the liquidity fund.
The Companys exposure to floating interest rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are reset, is as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates Cash and short term deposits 19 10 JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund 13,670 10,104 Bank loans 55,443 44,511 Total exposure 41,754 34,397 Interest receivable on cash balances, or paid on overdrafts, is at a margin below or above LIBOR respectively 2016: same.
The target interest earned on the JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund is the 7 day US dollar London Interbank Bid Rate.
Details of the bank loans are given in notes 13 and 14 on pages 57 and 58.
Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to a 1.0% 2016: 0.5% increase or decrease in interest rates in regards to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

Management of other price risk The Board considers on a regular basis the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risk exposure The Companys total exposure to other changes in market prices at 31st December comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss 1,070,243 1,068,848 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to other price risk during the current and comparative year.
Other price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% 2016: 10% in the market values.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities, adjusting for changes in the management fee but with all other variables held constant.

Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued b Liquidity risk continued Liquidity risk exposure Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at the year end, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: 2017 More than Three three months months but less than One year or less one year or more Total 000 000 000 000 Creditors: Other creditors and accruals 98 98 Bank loans Scotiabank, including interest 233 37,529 37,762 Debenture, including interest 51,719 51,719 Bank loans National Australia Bank NAB, including interest 111 294 18,985 19,390 442 89,542 18,985 108,969 2016 More than Three three months months but less than One year or less one year or more Total 000 000 000 000 Creditors: Securities purchased awaiting settlement 105 105 Other creditors and accruals 119 119 Bank loans, including interest 262 642 45,519 46,423 Debenture, including interest 3,438 51,718 55,156 486 4,080 97,237 101,803 The liabilities shown above represent future contractual payments and therefore may differ from the amounts shown in the Statement of Financial Position.

Management of credit risk Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate Delivery Versus Payment DVP settlement.
The process of DVP mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during the settlement process.
The Manager continuously monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, a process that involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.
Cash and cash equivalents Counterparties are subject to regular credit analysis by the Manager and deposits can only be placed with counterparties that have been approved by JPMAMs Counterparty Risk Group.
The Board regularly reviews the counterparties used by the Manager.
Exposure to JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase Bank, N. A. is the custodian of the Companys assets.
The Companys assets are segregated from JPMorgan Chases own trading assets.
Therefore these assets are designed to be protected from creditors in the event that JPMorgan Chase were to cease trading.
The Depositary, BNY Mellon Trust and Depositary UK Limited, is responsible for the safekeeping of all custodial assets of the Company and for verifying and maintaining a record of all other assets of the Company.
However, no absolute guarantee can be given on the protection of all the assets of the Company.
Credit risk exposure The amounts shown in the Statement of Financial Position under debtors and cash and cash equivalents represent the maximum exposure to credit risk at the current and comparative year ends.
d Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are either included in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value or the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value except for the debenture which the Company has in issue.
The fair value of this debenture has been calculated using discounted cash flow techniques using the yield on a similarly dated gilt plus a margin based on the five year average yield for the AA Barclays Sterling Corporate Bond.
