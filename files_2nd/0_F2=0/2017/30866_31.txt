SEGMENT INFORMATION Management has determined its operating segments based on the analysis used to make strategic decisions.
BUSINESS SEGMENT ANALYSIS The Group is organised on a worldwide basis into three main segments: Risk & Insurance, Employee Benefits and Head Office & Other operations.
These segments are consistent with the internal reporting structure of the Group.
The Risk & Insurance segment comprises JLTs global specialist and reinsurance broking activities.
The Employee Benefits segment consists of pension administration, outsourcing and employee benefits consultancy, healthcare and wealth management activities.
Certain Risk & Insurance and Employee Benefits operating segments have been disclosed within the reporting segments given their individual size.
The Head Office & Other segment consists mainly of holding companies, central administration functions, the Groups captive insurance companies and the Groups investments in associates.
Following the disposal of Thistle in 2016, the majority of what was classified as JLT Insurance Services, plus Northern Europe which was previously in JLT Europe, Middle East and Africa, both included in Other Risk & Insurance in the 2016 financial year, now together with JLT Specialty, form the business group JLT Europe.
Prior period numbers have been restated to reflect this change.
JLT Re principal locations include North America, the United Kingdom and Asia.
SEGMENT RESULTS Management assesses the performance of the operating segments based upon a measure of underlying trading profit.
Segment results include the net income or expense derived from the trading activities of the segment together with the investment income earned on fiduciary funds.
Interest income on the Groups own funds and finance costs are excluded since the trading activities of the Groups primary segments are not of a financial nature.
Income tax expense and the charge in respect of non-controlling interests are excluded from the segmental allocation.
SEGMENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Assets and liabilities are not allocated to individual segments and are therefore all reported within Head Office & Other.
INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES The Group owns the following stakes in its principal associates: 20% of GrECo, which operates mainly in Austria and Eastern Europe: 25% of MAG JLT, which operates mainly in Italy and 25% of March-JLT, which operates mainly in Spain.
The investment and the Groups share of the net results of these associates are included in the Head Office & Other segment, together with the investment and results of the Groups other associates, Sterling Re Intermediaro fide Reaseguro SA fide CV, JLT Insurance Management Malta, JLT Energy France SAS and JLT Independent Insurance Brokers Private Ltd. Subject to local regulations, the Group agreed to the disposal of its Mexican associate, Sterling Re Intermediaro fide Reaseguro SA fide CV, in December 2017.

INVESTMENT INCOME 2017 2016 000 000 Interest receivable - fiduciary funds 7,474 4,730 Prior year investment income 4,730 3,689 Effect of: - average cash balance variance 100 190 - interest yield variance 2,268 799 - foreign exchange variance 376 432 7,474 4,730 The Groups investment income arises from its holdings of cash and investments relating to fiduciary funds.
Equivalent average cash and investment balances during the year amounted to 801 million 2016: 797 million denominated principally in US dollars 57%, Sterling 13% and Australian dollars 12%.
Based upon average invested balances each 1% movement in the average achieved rate of return would impact anticipated interest income by approximately 8 million.
FINANCE INCOME AND COSTS 2017 2016 000 000 Interest receivable - own funds 2,607 1,938 Investment income from available-for-sale other investments 371 209 Interest expense: - bank and other borrowings 16,667 17,434 - finance leases 71 57 - interest in respect of liability discounting 5,141 1,862 Pension financing: - expected return on retirement benefits scheme assets 15,020 19,065 - interest on retirement benefits scheme liabilities 20,468 23,937 Net pension financing expense 5,448 4,872 Finance costs - net 24,349 22,078 Finance costs 27,327 24,225 Finance income 2,978 2,147 Finance costs - net 24,349 22,078 INTEREST RATE RISK The Group has both interest bearing assets, explained in note 4, and interest bearing liabilities that give rise to net exposures to changes in interest rates, primarily in US dollars and Sterling.
Where appropriate, the Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge or match these interest rate exposures.
The Groups policy is to continue to manage net interest rate exposures arising from the Groups cash including fiduciary funds and borrowings.
Each 1% movement in the average achieved interest rate impacts interest expense by approximately 5.9 million based on average net borrowings in 2017.

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017 125 6.
EMPLOYEE INFORMATION CONTINUED SENIOR EXECUTIVE SHARE SCHEME The Group operates a Senior Executive Share Scheme for senior management and employees.
The majority of awards have no specific performance criteria attached, other than the requirement that employees remain in employment with the Group.
Certain awards have been granted with specific performance targets defined for the individual executives.
In general these require targets for revenue and profit growth to be met over the vesting period.
The awards have a 10 year life from the date of grant.
Options granted prior to 1 January 2014 attract unconditional DDEs throughout the vesting period, this means that DDEs are paid to the option holders as and when dividends are paid to ordinary shareholders, there is no clawback on the dividends in the event of a forfeiture of the options.
The options granted post 1 January 2014 attract DDEs that are rolled up and paid in cash, on vesting.
The Group amended the plan rules on the 8 June 2016.
From that date, all vested options are no longer eligible to DDEs.
EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME Options were granted at a fixed price usually market price and are exercisable after the vesting period usually 3 years.
Options are satisfied by the issue of new shares or market-purchased shares.
Some options carry performance conditions where they are only exercisable when earnings per share is in excess of RPI for the three consecutive financial accounting periods preceding the date of exercise.
This scheme is now closed for new grants and options were last granted under this scheme on 29 September 2006.
FAIR VALUE OF AWARDS Under IFRS 2 the fair value of awards granted during the year, calculated using a Black-Scholes model, is set out below: Black-Scholes model assumptions Exercise Share price Dividend Risk free Fair value of price Performance on grant date Volatility yield Maturity Interest rate one award pence period pence % % years % pence JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2013 Senior Executive Share Scheme 2017 05 April - 2017-20 1,133.00 22.02 - 2 - 3 0.23 1,133.00 2017 12 April - 2017-20 1,128.00 22.04 - 1 - 3 0.18 1,128.00 2017 29 September - 2017-21 1,224.00 20.53 - 1 - 4 0.59 1,224.00 The option holders who have awards under the JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 2013 and the Senior Executive Share Scheme also receive payments equating to the dividends payable on their shares subject to meeting the performance criteria.
Assuming that the dividend yield is zero and that the options are issued with no cost to the employees, then the fair value will equal the share price at date of grant.
The volatility has been calculated based on the historical share price of the Company, using a 3 year term.
All options granted under the share option schemes are conditional upon the employees remaining in the Groups employment during the vesting period of the option, the actual period varies according to the scheme in which the employee participates.
In calculating the cost of options granted, a factor is included to take account of anticipated lapse rates.
For Executive Share Option this is 20%.
For the JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 2013 and the Senior Executive Share Scheme it is nil as both are issued with no cost to the employee.

As in prior years, the limit set by the Audit & Risk Committee of 1 million remained applicable in the year.
The audit fees increased as a result of the imminent implementation of IFRS 9 & 15, as referred to in the Significant Accounting Policies and certain component auditor scope changes.

EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to shareholders by the sum of the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year and the vested share options eligible to discretionary dividends equivalents, excluding unallocated shares held by the Trustees of the Employees' Share Ownership Plan Trust which are treated as treasury shares.
The profit attributable to shareholders is the profit attributable to the owners of the parent adjusted for the dividends equivalents and undistributed earnings attributable to the unvested share options carrying unconditional dividends equivalents rights.
Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to take account for the potential dilutive effect of outstanding share options.
Basic and diluted EPS are also calculated based on underlying earnings attributable to shareholders, which exclude any exceptional items.

GOODWILL CONTINUED IMPAIRMENT TESTS FOR GOODWILL Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units CGUs identified according to country of operation and business segment.
A summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period and are discounted using the weighted average cost of capital.
2 Pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections.
The key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations were: The budgeted trading profit growth: Management determines budgeted trading profit based on past experience and its expectation for market development.
The budgeted investment income growth is based on past experience and long-term interest rates projections.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segment and country of operation.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with long-term economic forecasts in the countries of operation.
The value-in-use is compared to an adjusted goodwill.
The adjusted goodwill is the goodwill grossed up to reflect a 100% ownership by the Group.
The key sensitivity analysis are: A decrease of 1% in the growth rate resulted in a reduction of 30% in the excess between the value in use and the adjusted carrying value of goodwill.
An increase of 2% in the discount rate resulted in a reduction of 50% in the excess between the value in use and the adjusted carrying value of goodwill.
A combined decrease of 1% in the growth rate and an increase of 2% in the discount rate resulted in a reduction of 58% in the excess between the value in use and the adjusted carrying value of goodwill.

Instruments included in level 1 are financial instruments traded in active markets for which the fair value is based upon quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms-length basis.
Instruments included in level 2 are financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives and for which the fair value is determined by using internal and external models.
These models maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
If all significant inputs required to measure the fair value of an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Level 2 includes derivatives used for hedging, which are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology incorporating observable market forward foreign exchange and interest rates.
During the year there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2.
There were no changes in valuation techniques during the year.
Instruments included in level 3 are financial instruments for which one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data.
In respect of deferred and contingent consideration and redemption liabilities option contracts, unobservable inputs include managements assessment of the expected future performance of relevant acquired businesses and are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology.
A 1% movement in the discount rate applied in the calculation of the redemption liability in respect of Construction Risk Partners LLC, the largest item within the redemption liability, would result in a change of the overall redemption liability of 6%.

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES CONTINUED Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefits through the future taxable profits is considered probable.
A deferred tax asset relating to tax losses of 14,030,000 2016: 14,340,000 has not been recognised in the balance sheet in respect of certain of the Group's operations, principally US, China, Singapore and Japan, where it is considered likely that the losses will expire before use or are unlikely to be realised in the short term.
A deferred tax asset relating to other deferred tax balances of 6,853,000 2016: 7,473,000 has not been recognised in the balance sheet in respect of certain of the Group's overseas operations, principally the US, where it is considered that the asset is unlikely to be realised in the short term.
Following the recent US tax reform the federal tax rate has reduced from 35% to 21%, the non recognised deferred tax assets in relation to the US have been calculated using the reduced rate of 21%.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised on temporary differences of 136 million 2016: 124 million representing the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures.
Such amounts are permanently reinvested.

Litigation provisions At any point in time the Group can be involved in a variety of litigation, regulatory and other government authorities investigations and disputes around the world.
A provision is established in respect of such issues when it is probable that the liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated.
The Group analyses its litigation exposures based on available information, including external legal consultation where appropriate, to assess its potential liability.
Where appropriate the Group also provides for the cost of defending or initiating such matters.
However, the final outcome could differ materially from the amount provided.
PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES AND CHARGES CONTINUED Where a litigation provision has been made it is stated gross of any third party recovery.

The company also operates a defined contribution scheme, namely The Jardine Lloyd Thompson 2004 Retirement Benefits Scheme, which is held and administered under a separate trust.
The most recent triennial actuarial valuation for funding purposes was carried out by an appropriately qualified independent actuary as at 1 January 2017. f The Belgibo DB and DC Plans has two sections: one pension plan providing defined benefits based primarily on the pensionable salary and two pension plans providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, subject to certain guaranteed minimum asset returns.
The employer pension contribution for the defined contribution plan ranges from 2% to 6% based on category and service.
The defined benefit scheme was amended on 1 January 2007 in order to close the plan to new entrants.
The defined benefit schemes last formal valuation was undertaken as at 31 December 2017 by a qualified third party actuary.

b In line with IAS 19 Revised the expected return on scheme assets assumption is the same as the discount rate assumed for the liabilities.
c Mortality assumptions for the UK scheme are based on 105% of the S2PxA tables, with improvements based on CMI 2016 tables with a 1.25% per annum long-term rate of improvement.
Mortality assumptions for the US Scheme and US Stable Value Plan are based on the RP2014 Mortality Table with MP2017 projections.
Mortality assumptions for the Canadian Scheme are based on the CPM-2014 Private Table with generational projection using scale CPM-B.
Mortality assumptions for the Irish Scheme, assume that deaths after retirement will be in accordance with standard mortality tables 90% PxA92C 2004 with allowance for expected future mortality improvements.
There is assumed to be no pre-retirement mortality.
Mortality assumptions for the Belgian Schemes are based on the Belgian mortality table MR-3 FR-3.
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is: Impact on defined benefit obligation Change in Change to assumptions obligation Discount rate decrease of 0.1% increase of 2.0% Inflation rate increase of 0.1% increase of 1.0% Life expectancy increase of 1 year increase of 4.0% The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet.
Note this sensitivity is for defined benefit obligations only and does not consider the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the assets, in particular the assets held in respect of the insured pensioners.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the previous year.

Significant management judgement is required to comply with this guidance.
The Group analyses its litigation exposure based on available information, including external legal consultation where appropriate, to assess its potential liability.

Pending the outcome of the UK Financial Conduct Authoritys review a provision has been created for the estimated administration costs of completing the work for this review.
It is too early to determine whether any further liability exists.
