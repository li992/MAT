146 MERLIN ENTERTAINMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO MERLIN ENTERTAINMENTS PLC COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016 I ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to items recognised directly in equity, when it is recognised directly in equity, or when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income, when it is recognised through the statement of comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided on certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and taxation purposes respectively.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
After considering forecast future profits, deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those assets can be utilised.
Share-based payments The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and charged as the employees become unconditionally entitled to the rights.
The Groups equity-settled share plans are settled either by the issue of shares by Merlin Entertainments plc or by the purchase of shares in the market.
The fair value of the share plans is recognised as an expense over the expected vesting period net of deferred tax with a corresponding entry to retained earnings.
The fair value of the share plans is determined at the date of grant.
Non-market based vesting conditions i. e. earnings per share and return on capital employed targets are taken into account in estimating the number of awards likely to vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each accounting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued.
No adjustment is made after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or are not exercised.
The Group operates cash-settled versions of the employee incentive schemes for employees in certain territories.
The issues and resulting charges of these schemes are not material to the financial statements.
Loans to Group undertakings Loans to Group undertakings are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group Financial instruments often consist of a combination of debt and equity and the Group has to decide how to attribute values to each.
They are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: i they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group: and ii where the instrument will or may be settled in the Groups own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Groups own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Group exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability, and the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance costs.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
MERLIN ENTERTAINMENTS PLC 147 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings These are initially recognised at the principal value of the loan concerned, less any related fees.
These fees are then amortised through the income statement on an effective interest rate basis over the expected life of the loan or over the contractual term where there is no clear indication that a shorter life is appropriate.
If the Groups estimate of the expected life based on repayment subsequently changes, the resulting adjustment to the effective interest rate calculation is recognised as a gain or loss on re-measurement and presented separately in the income statement.
Dividends Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Companys shareholders or their payment.

The proceeds were partly used to repay 50 million 43 million of the floating rate term debt due to mature in March 2020.
The facilities are: Bank facilities comprising 250 million and $540 million floating rate term debt to mature in March 2020.
The relevant floating interest rates are LIBOR and the USD benchmark rate, which were 0.51% 2016: 0.37% and 1.61% 2016: 0.99% respectively at 30 December 2017.
The margin on the bank facilities is dependent on the Groups adjusted leverage ratio and at 30 December 2017 was 2.0% 2016: 2.0%.
A 300 million multi-currency revolving credit facility of which nil had been drawn down at 30 December 2017 2016: nil.

700 million 2016: 500 million notes with a coupon rate of 2.75% to mature in March 2022.
The Group has estimated that a refinancing of the bank facilities and multi-currency revolving credit facility is likely within the next 18 months, which is earlier than that previously assumed for accounting purposes.
As a result, the amortisation of financing costs in respect of these facilities has been accelerated.
The fees related to the fixed rate notes are being amortised to the maturity of the notes as the notes are currently expected to be held to their full term.
The borrowings including the revolving credit facility and the 700 million notes are unsecured but guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.
The Company is required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants in the bank facilities, including a requirement to maintain certain ratios of EBITDA on a consolidated basis to both net finance costs and net debt.
It is also required to comply with certain non-financial covenants in the 700 million notes.
All covenant requirements were satisfied throughout the year.
