NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions Statement of compliance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101 The company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 FRS 100 issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
Accordingly, these financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS101 and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation These financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK accounting standards and present information about the company as an individual undertaking, and not about its group.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention except for the measurement of derivative instruments at fair value.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its individual profit and loss account and related notes.
The financial statements are presented in GBP sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest million pounds million.
As permitted by FRS 101, the company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available in relation to: a the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: b the requirements of paragraphs 10 d, 10 f, 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D, 111 and 134 to 136 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: c the requirements of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: d the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors in relation to standards not yet effective: e the requirements of paragraphs 17 and 18A of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures: and f the requirements of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements of Britvic plc.
Significant accounting policies: use of judgement, estimates and assumptions The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for income and expenditure during the year.
However, the nature of estimation means that the actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
There are no significant judgements and estimates relevant to these financial statements.
Foreign currency translations The companys financial statements are presented in sterling, which is also the companys functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the entitys functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Any resulting exchange differences are included in the income statement and should be read in conjunction with the information provided under Derivative financial instrument and hedging in Notes 3, 24 and 25 of the consolidated financial statements.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
Investments The company recognises its investments in subsidiaries at cost less any provisions made for impairment.
The company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount.
Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In respect of IFRS 2 Share based payment, the company records an increase in its investment in subsidiaries to reflect the share-based compensation expense recorded by its subsidiaries.
com Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information 1.
Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions continued Share-based payments The cost of the equity-settled transactions with employees of other members within of the group is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which equity instruments are granted and is recognised as a capital contribution in investments in subsidiary undertakings over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the employees become fully entitled to the award.
A corresponding credit is recognised within equity.
Fair value is determined by using an appropriate, widely used, valuation model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the company market conditions.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, bank overdrafts repayable on demand are a component of cash and cash equivalents.
Income taxes The current income tax is based on taxable profits for the period, after any adjustments in respect of prior periods.
It is calculated using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Provision is made for deferred tax liabilities, or credit taken for deferred tax assets, on all material temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Financial assets All financial assets held by the company are classified as loans and receivables.
Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, other receivables and loans.
The company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Financial assets are recognised initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price plus directly attributable transaction costs.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in active markets, do not qualify as trading assets and have been designated as either fair value through profit or loss or available for sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account when loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired.
Finance costs arising from the outstanding loan balance and finance charges are charged to the profit and loss account using an effective interest rate method.
Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value less directly attributable transactions costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Gain and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance cost.
Dividends Dividend income is recognised when the companys right to receive payment is established.
Final dividends are recorded in the financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are declared.
Derivative financial instruments The company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is appropriate, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the profit and loss account.
The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the hedging relationship, as follows: Britvic plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 143 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions continued Cash flow hedges Hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the profit and loss account in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale occurs.
However, when the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the profit and loss account.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are then transferred to the profit and loss account or included in the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above.
Fair value hedges Hedges of the change in fair value of recognised assets or liabilities are classified as fair value hedges.
For fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in the profit and loss account.
The gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is also recognised in the profit and loss account.
If the hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedged item would no longer be adjusted and the cumulative adjustment to its carrying amount would be amortised to the profit and loss account based on a recalculated effective interest rate.
The fair value gain on loss on the hedging instrument would continue to be recorded in the profit and loss account.
Issued share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Other reserves Share premium account The share premium account is used to record the excess of proceeds over the nominal value on the issue of shares.
Own shares reserve The own shares reserve is used to record purchases and issues by the company of its own shares, which will be distributed to employees as and when share awards made under the Britvic employee share plans vest.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve records the effective portion of movements in the fair value of forward exchange contracts, interest rate and cross currency swaps that have been designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges.
Merger reserve The merger reserve arose as a result of the non pre-emptive share placement which took place on 21 May 2010.
It was executed using a structure which created a merger reserve under Section 612-3 of the Companies Act 2006.
Own shares The cost of own shares held in employee share trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, the fair value of any consideration received is also included in shareholders equity.

These swaps expire in line with the loan notes and are discussed in note 25 of the consolidated financial statements.
See note 24 of the consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the interest rate profile and the maturity of the borrowings and related interest rate swaps.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Hierarchy The company uses the following valuation hierarchy to determine the carrying value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
Unless otherwise stated, the valuation basis used to calculate fair value is level 2.
All derivatives are valued using discounted cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments.
Forward currency contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
Cross currency interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on quoted forward exchange rates and the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
Equity derivatives are measured using share prices and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
The fair value of derivatives also includes the non-performance risk of both Britvic and its derivatives trading counterparties.
As in the prior year, the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities are considered to be reasonable approximations of their fair values, except for fixed rate borrowings.

These cross currency interest rate swaps have the effect of fixing both the value of the USD borrowings into sterling and the rate of interest payable.
The cross currency interest rate swaps are designated as part of a cash flow hedge relationship with the Notes.
Cash flows due under these cross currency interest rate swaps match the interest payment dates and maturity profile of the USPP Notes.
The maturity profile of the USPP Notes can be seen in note 8.
During the period the cash flow hedge has been tested for effectiveness and this showed no ineffectiveness in the current period therefore nil 2016: 0.4m gain has been recognised in the income statement in respect of ineffectiveness.
Fair value hedges Cross currency interest rate swaps The company has a number of cross currency interest rate swaps in respect of the 2009 and 2010 USPP Notes.
These instruments swap the principal and interest from fixed rate US dollar into floating rate sterling the 2009 and 2010 USD GBP cross currency interest rate swaps.
The cross currency interest rate swaps are designated as part of a fair value hedge relationship with the Notes.
The fair value movements on the 2009 and 2010 USD GBP cross currency interest rate instruments are recorded in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the Notes where the hedge is deemed effective.
The decrease in fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps, excluding maturities, of 10.3m 2016: 29.7m increase has been recognised in finance costs and offset with a similar gain on the borrowings of 10.8m 2016: 30.2m loss.
The net gain of 0.5m 2016: 0.5m loss represents the ineffective portion on the hedges of the debt.
