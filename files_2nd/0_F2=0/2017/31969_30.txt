6.12 Financial risk management Note 5.7 to the consolidated financial statements includes the Groups policy on capital management, its exposure to financial risks and its policies and processes to manage those risks.
There are financial instruments in the Company made up of amounts receivable from subsidiaries and the Employee Benefit Trust and amounts payable to subsidiaries.
The nature and extent of risks arising from these financial instruments are as follows: a Liquidity risk The Company is exposed to liquidity risk, namely the risk that it may be unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due.
The payment obligations primarily relate to amounts payable to subsidiaries which are more than offset by the amounts owed from subsidiaries.
In addition, the Company holds significant cash balances on short-term deposit to ensure that it has sufficient available funds to meet its obligations and fund its operations.
At the end of the reporting period, none of the liabilities of the Company are past due or represent a significant long-term liability.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty fails to perform its financial obligations, resulting in financial loss: however, the amounts owed to the Company are primarily from its own subsidiaries.
Given the profitability and net assets of the majority of subsidiaries, credit risk is felt to be minimal.
As per the wider Group, cash is held with UK licensed banks.
The credit risk on liquid funds is minimised because the counterparties are banks with strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group takes a conservative approach to treasury management and selection of banking counterparties, and carries out regular reviews of all its banks and custodians credit ratings.
As at the end of the reporting period, no financial assets were individually determined to be impaired.
The balance of assets past due isimmaterial.
The following table discloses the Companys maximum exposure to credit risk on financial assets.
