Goodwill, allocated by cash generating unit, is analysed as follows: 2017 2016 m m 1 UK and Ireland 932 911 2 Germany and Austria 3,192 3,018 3 Italy 806 784 4,930 4,713 Impairment reviews were performed on these goodwill balances at 30 June 2017, which did not indicate impairment.
Recoverable amounts for each of the cash generating units CGUs were calculated on the basis of value in use, using cash flows calculated for the next four years as forecast by management.
A long-term growth rate of 2% was applied to all units in order to extrapolate cash flow projections beyond this period 2016: 3%.
The cash flows of the UK and Ireland CGU were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10% 2016: 8%, the cash flows of the Germany and Austria CGU were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 8% 2016: 7% and the cash flows of the Italy CGU were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10% 2016: 9%.
In determining the applicable discount rate, management applied judgement in respect of several factors, which included, inter alia: assessing the risk attached to future cash flows and making reference to the capital asset pricing model the CAPM.
Management gave consideration to the selection of appropriate inputs to the CAPM, which included the risk free rate, the equity risk premium and a measure of systematic risk.
Management also considered capital structure and an appropriate cost of debt in arriving at the discount rate.
The key assumptions, on which the forecast cash flows of each unit were based, include the number of gross customer additions, the rate of churn, the average revenue per user, levels of programming spend, acquisition costs per customer and anticipated changes in the product mix and marketing mix of the broadcast activities.
The values assigned to each of these assumptions were determined based on the extrapolation of historical trends within the Group, and external information on expected future trends in the entertainment and communications industry in each territory.
