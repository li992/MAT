STRATEGIC REPORT IRON ORE AND MANGANESE IRON ORE AND MANGANESE Anglo Americans iron ore operations provide customers with niche, high iron content ore, a large percentage of which is direct-charge product for blast furnaces.
In South Africa, we have a majority share 69.7% in Kumba Iron Ore, while in Brazil we have developed the integrated Minas-Rio operation.
In manganese, we have a 40% shareholding in Samancor, with operations based in South Africa and Australia.
