Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
REFERENCE INFORMATION Sirius Minerals Plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 Registration number 04948435.
The Company is registered in England and its registered address is Third Floor, Greener House, 68 Haymarket, London, SW1Y 4RF.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
BASIS OF PREPARATION These consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries together, the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The standards used are those published by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and endorsed by the EU as at 31 December 2017.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by financial assets and financial liabilities principally derivatives stated at fair value through profit or loss.
The principal accounting policies set out both below and throughout the subsequent notes have been consistently applied to all periods presented.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling rounded to the nearest thousand, which is the functional currency of the Company and its principal subsidiaries.
GOING CONCERN The Group continues to incur losses and cash outflows due to the significant level of development activity that it is undertaking in supporting the construction of its polyhalite project in North Yorkshire the Project.
The Group does not currently anticipate generating any revenues from the Project until late 2021.
Therefore its ability to continue as a going concern for the time being is dependent upon it attracting sufficient financial investments from external parties to enable it to complete commercial development of the Project.
The stage 1 financing conducted in November 2016 generated sufficient funds to allow the Group to commence construction of the Project.
As a result the Group continues to hold total cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits of 393,982,000 at 31 December 2017 2016: 582,345,000.
In addition, the Group currently anticipates that a further US$300 million of cash will be received in the second half of 2018 in relation to its royalty financing arrangements with Hancock British Holdings Limited, subject to the satisfaction of certain contractual conditions precedent.
The Group is in the process of negotiating its stage 2 financing and has mandated a group of six financial institutions on the basis of a non-binding but mutually agreed term sheet.
The UK Governments Infrastructure and Projects Authority formally IUK has also confirmed its interest in supporting the stage 2 financing for the Project.
The Group expects to complete its stage 2 financing during the second half of 2018 which will provide it with sufficient funding to complete the construction of the Project and result in the ongoing generation of revenues and profits.
The Groups latest cash flow forecasts indicate that it will have sufficient liquidity to continue development of the Project on its current schedule for at least the next 12 months.
Should there be any delay in securing the stage 2 financing, the Group would be able to curtail certain expenditures until further financing was secured.
Having assessed the principal risks and having regard for the above, based on the current likelihood of the success of the stage 2 financing and the technical completion of construction of the Project, the Directors consider it appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
Therefore, these financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result if the going concern basis of preparation was inappropriate.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The Groups consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
All intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting policies that are material to the financial statements are generally described in the specific note in relation to the individual component of the financial statements indicated by a symbol.
The accounting policies set out in the following paragraphs within this note are considered to be general to the financial statements and not covered by a specific subsequent note.
114 Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 1.
REFERENCE INFORMATION CONTINUED All accounting policies applied are consistent with those used in the preparation of the prior year financial statements with the exception of the presentation of foreign exchange revaluations described within this note in the next section below.
Segment reporting IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires information to be disclosed about each business activity and economic environment in which the Group operates.
Management has determined the operating segments by considering the business from both a geographic and activity perspective.
The Group is currently organised into one business division: the UK segment which consists of Project-related activities and the corporate operations.
This division is the segment for which the Group reports information internally to the Board of Directors.
The Groups operations are predominantly in the United Kingdom.
The Group has a number of non-UK based entities that are either dormant or whose operations are insignificant in the context of the Group.
Therefore disclosures required under IFRS 8 are already included in the primary statements and so no further information requires disclosure.
Foreign currencies The presentation and functional currency of the Group is Sterling.
Transactions denominated in a foreign currency are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
At the balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rate prevailing at that date.
All exchange differences are reported as part of finance costs in the income statement.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations which have a functional currency other than Sterling are translated into Sterling at foreign exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
The expenses of these subsidiary undertakings are translated at average exchange rates applicable in the period.
All resulting exchange differences are recognised through other comprehensive income and accumulated within other reserves.
Upon the disposal or dissolution of foreign subsidiaries all historic exchange differences associated with that subsidiary are recycled from other reserves through the income statement.
The year-end rate which was applied in translating balances denominated in US Dollars into Sterling in the financial statements at 31 December 2017 was 1 $1.35 2016: 1 $1.23.
The average exchange rate which was applied to US Dollar transactions occurring during 2017 was 1 $1.29 2016: 1 $1.35.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include various instant access deposits and short-term fixed deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank deposits Amounts reported as bank deposits represent short-term investments held by the Group which it intends to hold until maturity, at which point it will receive cash from the counterparty.
These amounts are recorded at amortised cost using theeffective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are recognised by the Group when it becomes party to contractual arrangements which include derivative features on a standalone basis or embedded within a linked host non-derivative instrument.
Derivatives are measured at fairvalue at each reporting date with all changes in fair value being recognised within finance costs within the income statement.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY From 1 January 2017 the Group has elected to change its accounting policy in accounting for foreign exchange revaluation gains and losses in relation to cash, restricted cash and bank deposits.
Previously these were classified within operating costs but the Group has now chosen to classify these within finance costs.
This is on the basis that such gains andlosses are more representative of outcomes from the Groups finance hedging strategy rather than a part of underlying operating costs.
The Group has retrospectively made this restatement from 1 January 2016 in these financial statements, resulting in an increase in reported operating costs and a reduction in finance costs of 4,986,000 for the year ended 31 December 2016 compared to those amounts disclosed in the 2016 financial statements.
The effect on the current period has been a decrease in operating costs and increase in finance costs of 22,595,000.
This change in accounting policy has not led toany change in any balance on the statement of financial position nor statement of changes in equity in any period.

REFERENCE INFORMATION CONTINUED NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS ADOPTED BY THE GROUP There are no new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning after 1 January 2017 that have had a material impact on the Group.
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2017 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
The majority of these are expected by the Group to not have a material impact upon the consolidated financial statements.
The new accounting standards with the most potentially significant impact upon these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The Group is in the process of assessing the full impact of adopting IFRS 9, but based on the current nature of the Groups financial instruments it is not currently expected that this will have a material impact upon adoption.
IFRS 16 Leases is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The Group is yet to complete its impact assessment of the new standard however, based on the current level of operating lease commitments the Group has entered into as set out in note 19 on page 129, as well as the absence of any finance leases, then the effect of transition to this new standard is unlikely to materially impact the Groups financial statements.
The Group currently expects to adopt each of these standards in the period that they become mandatory.
JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND UNCERTAINTIES The preparation of financial statements requires the exercise of judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity are summarised below and set out in more detail in the related notes in the boxes denoted by a symbol.
Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The judgements that carry the most significant risk of an outcome that differs from the amount recognised in the financial statements are as follows: ACCOUNTING FOR ROYALTY FINANCING AGREEMENT In November 2016 the Group entered into a royalty financing agreement.
IFRS does not provide explicit guidance on how transactions with the features of this agreement should be accounted for and therefore judgement is required in applying the most appropriate and faithful accounting treatment for the contract.
For more information see note 14 on page 126.
FAIR VALUATION OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group has certain financial instruments associated with the stage 1 financing which it is required to classify as derivatives and measure at fair value.
The fair value of each of the derivatives is not directly observable from market prices and so the Group is required to exercise judgement in estimating the appropriate fair values.
For more information see note 21 on page 133.
Other accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions ESTIMATION OF PROVISIONS As part of the planning permissions that the Group must comply with as it develops its Project, it is required to restore environmental disruption caused on the sites on which it operates.
Such restoration costs are not expected to be settled until the final exhaustion of the Project, however the cost of liabilities incurred by each balance sheet date must be estimated and provided against.
For more information see note 12 on page 124.
IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that any of its assets may be impaired and recognises an impairment if the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
Estimation is required in assessing the recoverable amount of a given asset at each measurement date.
For more information see note 7 on page 120.

Total Directors emoluments and emoluments of the highest paid Director, together with full details of Directors remuneration, pensions and benefits in kind are given in the Annual report on remuneration on pages 86 to 98.
FINANCE COSTS Interest income is accrued using the effective interest rate method.
Interest expense is expensed as incurred except where it relates to the financing of construction or development of qualifying assets.
Interest on borrowings directly relating to the financing of qualifying assets in the course of construction is added to the capitalised cost of those projects under Capital works in progress, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Where funds have been borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred net of all interest income earned on the temporary re-investment of those borrowings prior to utilisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised as part of interest expense in the period in which they are incurred.

TAXATION Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Research and development tax credits are recognised within current tax when they can be reasonably estimated.
2017 2016 000s 000s Corporation tax credit received 362 468 Total tax recognised in statement of comprehensive income 362 468 The tax credit for the year is lower 2016: lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK for the year ended 31 December 2017 of 19.25% 2016: 20%.
The differences are explained below: 2017 2016 000s 000s Loss on ordinary activities before taxation 79,249 23,422 Loss on ordinary activities multiplied by the standard rate of corporation taxation in the UK of 19.25% 2016: 20% 15,255 4,684 Taxation effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 7,930 15 Tax losses not recognised see note 17 7,325 4,669 Research and development tax credit 362 468 Total tax credit for the year 362 468 The standard rate of corporation tax changed from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017.
Accordingly the Groups loss for the year is taxed at an effective rate of 19.25%.
Changes to the UK corporation tax rates were substantively enacted as part of the Finance Bill 2017 on 6 September 2016.
These include reductions to the main rate to reduce the rate to 17% from 1 April 2020.
Deferred taxes at the balance sheet date have been measured using these enacted tax rates and reflected in these financial statements The research and development tax credit is in relation to the HMRC Research and Development Relief Scheme for SMEs and enables the Group to realise tax losses on certain qualifying expenditure to be received immediately in cash rather than waiting for taxable profits to set them against in the future.
LOSS PER SHARE Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For all periods presented, the Groups potentially dilutive ordinary share equivalents being share options issued under equity-settled share-based payment schemes, the convertible loans, and share options issued to Hancock British Holdings Limited under the royalty financing arrangement reduce the loss per share and have therefore not been included in determining the total weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the purposes of calculating diluted loss pershare.
2017 2016 000s 000s Loss for the purposes of basic and diluted earnings per share 78,887 22,954 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share number in thousands 4,322,854 2,472,762 Basic and diluted loss per share pence 1.82 0.93 118 Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 7.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS EXPLORATION COSTS AND RIGHTS Costs arising from exploration and evaluation activities are accumulated separately for each area of interest and only capitalised as part of intangible assets where such costs are expected to be recouped through successful development.
Expenditure capitalised comprises direct costs that have a specific connection with a particular area of interest.
Capitalised expenditure in respect of areas of interest is written off in the income statement when the above criteria do not apply or when the Directors assess that the carrying value may exceed the expected recoverable amount.
Capitalised costs in respect of an area of interest that is abandoned are written off in the period in which the decision to abandon is made.
When technical feasibility and commercial viability of an area of interest have been demonstrated, all capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure in respect of that area of interest is reclassified from intangible assets to capital works in progress within property, plant and equipment.
All subsequent development expenditures on that area of interest are capitalised and classified as capital works in progress within property, plant and equipment, provided commercial viability conditions continue to be satisfied.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of subsidiaries are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of cost of acquisition over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Goodwill arising on consolidation is recognised as an asset andallocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
Any goodwill recognised is stated at cost less accumulated impairment and any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
OTHER INTANGIBLES Research expenditure is expensed to the income statement as incurred.
Development costs on activities that have moved past the research phase are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives.
Prior to any sales occurring of the products to which the development costs relate, they are held at cost and tested annually for impairment.
Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairments, and is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful life ranging between three and five years.
Amortisation of software isincluded within operating costs in the income statement.
IMPAIRMENT At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that any of its intangible assetsmay be impaired.
Where an indication of impairment exists or, on an annual basis in the case of goodwill, the Group makes a formal estimate of recoverable amount.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount estimated as the value-in-use of the asset the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and otherfactors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances based on the Groups latest approved forecasts.

As a result the Group was required to estimate the value in use of each of these assets based on predicted future cash flows to compare to the assets carrying values.
The estimation of these future cash flows is inherently uncertain and the use of different assumptions could lead to an impairment being recognised.
All of the net book value of goodwill relates to the Groups acquisition of York Potash Limited the legal entity developing the Project in January 2011.
Recoverable amount has been assessed using fair value less costs of disposals based on discounted cash flow techniques where the resulting estimate is based on the detailed long-term production plan which was made public as part of the Groups stage 1 financing.
The lowest-output future production plan in that document calculated a net present value of the Project of US$7.1 billion as at October 2016.
A discount rate of 10% which is considered to be appropriate for a project of this nature and size and consistent with industry norms, was applied in calculating that valuation.
No reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the goodwills recoverable amount is based would cause its value to fall short of its carrying amount as at 31 December 2017.
120 Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 8.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation and any recognised impairment losses.
Cost includes all expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of these items and, for assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, borrowing costs.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the costs can be measured reliably.
All other costs, including repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Capital works in progress include all spend directly attributable to the development of the Project, including buildings, civil works, equipment, labour, direct services and professional fees.
These assets are not depreciated.
At the point in time in the future when the Project commences production, all assets within this category will be transferred to appropriate separate asset classes and depreciation will commence from that point.
The plant and equipment category currently represents assets used for generally administrative purposes and which are not directly involved in development of the Project, including the Groups head office leasehold improvements and IT hardware.
Depreciation is provided on all assets within this category overthe estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally between three and five years.
Freehold land is not depreciated.

Sterling amounts are in respect of local authorities security requirements which reflect a combination of providing environmental restoration for construction works and the security requirements of the Section 106 agreements.
All amounts are classified as non-current except for those amounts which are expected to be released back to the Group within the next 12months.
SHARE CAPITAL An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments generally ordinary shares issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, with the par value of shares issued being recorded within ordinary share capital and any surplus, net of any direct issue costs, being recorded in the share premium account.
The Company has only one class of share capital, being ordinary shares with a par value of 0.25p each.
Shares included in the table below are all allotted, issued and fully paid up.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain Directors, senior managers, employees and consultants.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
For employees employed directly in relation to the Project, any charge in relation to options or awards held by them is capitalised as part of additions to property, plant and equipment.
At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options and awards that are expected to vest and immediately recognises any impact of the revision to original estimates.
The accumulated expense recorded prior to vesting in respect of each share-based payment is recognised within the share-based payment reserve and reclassified to share capital upon the issuance ofthe underlying shares.
If fully vested share options are not exercised and expire then the accumulated expense in respect of these is reclassified to accumulated losses.
The Group operates three equity-settled share-based payment arrangements as part of its employee remuneration strategy which are detailed below.
The total expense recognised within the income statement in relation to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the year is 822,000 2016: 884,000.
Further amounts of 1,217,000 2016: 127,000 have been capitalised within property, plant and equipment 2016: intangible assets in relation to the fair value of share-based payments earned by employees who are employed solely on direct development work on the Project.
Share options The Groups share option scheme provides for the grant of share options to certain parties at stipulated exercise prices.
The options are generally conditional upon the completion of a set service period between one and three years and typically expire ten years after grant date.
The Group used the Black-Scholes model to value the share options that it awarded under the scheme.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2017 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 3.9 years 2016: 3.1 years and exercise prices between 10.2p-43.7p 2016: 10.2p-43.7p.
For the options exercised during 2016, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 22.86p.

PROVISIONS The Group is required to rehabilitate sites and associated facilities during construction and at the end of their lives to a condition acceptable to the relevant authorities in compliance with licence requirements and other commitments made to stakeholders.
The costs associated with these obligations are provided for in the accounting period when the obligation arising from the related disturbance occurs.
Such costs do not include any additional obligations which are expected to arise from disturbance expected to be caused in future years.
Provisions are initially recognised at the net present value of the future cash flows associated with them.
When provisions are initially recognised, the corresponding cost is capitalised as an asset within property, plant and equipment, representing part of the cost of acquiring the future economic benefits of the operation.
2017 000s At 1 January New amounts capitalised as part of property, plant and equipment 2,753 At 31 December 2,753 The initiation of the Groups development work at the Project during the year has given rise to the future need to undertake restoration activities in order to maintain compliance with relevant planning consents.
The Groups obligation is to undertake the necessary restoration activities at the end of the Projects life in order to restore sites to their previous character.
124 Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 12.
PROVISIONS CONTINUED In order to estimate the value of the provision, the Group has relied upon valuations which were undertaken for the purposes of determining the value of local security requirements that are held in restricted cash at the end of the year.
These amounts were valued by third parties based on the estimated present-day cost that would be required to remediate the disruption caused by the Groups activities by the end of the year.
These costs, which the Group does not plan to be incurred for in excess of 50 years, have been discounted at a real risk free rate of 2% per annum, based on an estimate of the long-term, risk free, cost of borrowing.
The Group is required to estimate the net present value of future restoration obligations in settling upon the value of provisions to recognise at each measurement date.
The actual costs of restoration may vary from estimates made at the reporting date.
Such obligations will not be settled for many years and the extent of restoration works that will ultimately be required is inherently uncertain.
Estimates can also be impacted by the emergence of new restoration techniques and experience gained between the measurement date and prior to the costs incurrence.
Where possible, the Group relies upon third-party valuations to assist with reliably estimating the value of provisions liable at each measurement date.
CONVERTIBLE LOANS Convertible loans represent liabilities entered into by the Group which are principally loans that require repayment, but which may ultimately be settled by conversion into shares at the option of the Group and or counterparty based on the terms of a conversion element which is written into the terms of the loancontract.
Convertible loans are assessed according to the substance of the contractual arrangements.
The conversion element of each agreement is split out of the host loan and is classified as a liability or equityon the basis of the contractual characteristics of the conversion features.
Conversion features of convertible loans denominated in the Groups functional currency of Sterling are typically classified as equity amounts and not re-measured while conversion features of convertible loans denominated in a currency other than Sterling are classified as derivative financial instruments.
All transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the convertible loans are deducted from the initial carrying value of the host loan.
These transaction costs are amortised in line with the host loan and recognised as part of finance costs.
At inception the conversion element is separated from the host loan and is assigned a fair value based on an appropriate fair-valuation technique.
The initial carrying amount of the host loan is equal to the funds raised less the fair value attributable to the conversion option at inception and less transaction costs.
The host loan is held at amortised cost and measured using the effective interest rate method, with all interest being charged to finance costs.
Conversion elements that are derivative instruments are re-measured to fair value at each balance sheet and conversion date with any movement in fair value being recorded in finance costs.
Upon conversion, the carrying value of the host loan and conversion derivative is extinguished from liabilities and reclassified into equity as share capital and share premium.
FAIR VALUE ESTIMATION OF THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE The Group is required to apply judgement in estimating the fair value of the embedded derivative at each point in time.
Further information about the nature and sensitivity of this estimate is provided in note 21 on page 133.

CONVERTIBLE LOANS CONTINUED 2017 2016 Host loan Derivative Host loan Derivative 000s 000s 000s 000s Opening balance on 1 January 278,933 42,433 Amount initially recognised 283,234 36,689 Transaction costs incurred 11,577 Interest charge 27,671 2,839 Interest and make-whole payments 33,034 Fair value re-measurement 42,498 5,744 Conversions 51,001 36,465 Foreign exchange revaluation 21,710 4,437 Closing balance on 31 December 200,859 48,466 278,933 42,433 On 28 November 2016 the Group issued US$400 million of seven year, 8.5% quarterly coupon US Dollar-denominated convertible loans at par, receiving gross proceeds of 319,923,000.
The key terms of the convertible loans are that at any date subsequent to 8 January 2017 up until maturity a loanholder may convert their loans into ordinary shares in the Company at a conversion price of US$0.31 per share.
If a loanholder elects to convert prior to 28 November 2018 then, as well as receiving ordinary shares in the Company, they will also receive a make-whole cash payment equal to the total value of coupon payments that they would have been owed had they held their loans until 28 November 2018.
The Group also has a call option to redeem all loans at par should the Companys share price consistently exceed US$0.54 from 19 December 2018 onwards.
Loanholders may not request early cash-repayment of their bonds except under certain protective clauses relating to changes of ownership in the Group.
Under the terms of the convertible loan, the Group has also been required to set aside an amount in an Escrow bank account in respect of all coupon payments due until 28 November 2019, which is disclosed as part of restricted cash.
The Group is not able to use this restricted cash for any purpose other than the payment of quarterly coupons and make-whole payments.
Due to the conversion terms of the loans leading to the issuance of a fixed number of ordinary shares in the Company in return for the extinguishment of the bonds whose value is variable in terms of the Companys functional currency of Sterling, the Group has accounted for the bonds as a host loan instrument containing an embedded derivative liability in respect of the conversions features.
During 2017, conversion notices in respect of 22.4% of the US$400 million convertible loans were delivered by convertible loanholders to the Group, leading to the creation of 291,287,368 new ordinary shares in the Company.
ROYALTY FINANCING AGREEMENT ACCOUNTING FOR ROYALTY FINANCING AGREEMENT The Group entered into a royalty financing agreement during 2016.
Significant judgement is required in determining how the agreement should be accounted for due to the lack of explicit guidance for these types of arrangements under IFRS.
Based on the precise contractual terms of the agreement, the Group has concluded that the agreement should be accounted for as a financial instrument, to be accounted for in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Furthermore, the Group has concluded that prior to drawdown occurring the agreement is analogous to a loan commitment and therefore no recognition of it is necessary in the financial statements until drawdown occurs.
LOAN COMMITMENTS Loan commitments are a financial instrument, to be accounted for in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IAS 39 specifically excludes loan commitments from recognition and measurement prior to drawdown.
Once drawdown of the loan commitment occurs, the loan will be initially recognised at fair value generally the value of loan proceeds received and will be subsequently re-measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
126 Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 14.
ROYALTY FINANCING AGREEMENT CONTINUED On 25 October 2016 the Group entered into a royalty financing agreement with Hancock British Holdings Limited Hancock.
Under the agreement Hancock will pay consideration of US$250 million in return for future royalty payments amounting to 5% of gross revenues on the first 13 million tonnes of product sold in each calendar year and a further 1% of gross revenues on sales in excess of 13 million tonnes, for the life of the Project.
Drawdown of the US$250 million consideration is subject to certain conditions precedent being met, principally the Group giving notice to Hancock that it has expended US$630 million of the proceeds of the Groups November 2016 stage 1 financing and that all material permits, commercial arrangements and authorisations for the Project remain in place.
TheGroup has until October 2020 to achieve these conditions.
The agreement also commits Hancock to subscribe for 200 million new ordinary shares in the Company for an additional consideration of US$50 million at the time of drawdown of the royalty consideration.
A derivative liability 2016: asset is recognised in respect of this commitment and its fair value is measured as the difference between the fair value of the US$50 million that will be received and the fair value of 200 million new ordinary shares that will be issued on the drawdown date.
Further information about the fair value estimation of this derivative is provided in note 21 on page 133.
TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Interest-bearing debt includes only the host loan element of the US$400 million convertible loans and not the embedded conversion derivative on the basis that the Group has no obligation to cash-settle the embeddedderivative.
127 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 17.
DEFERRED TAXATION Deferred taxation represents temporary differences in the accounting carrying values of assets and liabilities and the tax base of those same assets and liabilities.
Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
In line with IAS 12 Income taxes, no deferred tax is recognised on the initial recognition of an asset or liability that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting, nor taxable profit or loss unless the transaction is a business combination.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised, or to the extent that they offset deferred tax liabilities.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
The following table shows the nature of deferred tax assets liabilities recognised by the Group: Non-current Convertible assets loans Tax losses Net total 000s 000s 000s 000s At 1 January 2016 6,580 6,580 Charged credited to income statement 122 9,187 9,065 At 31 December 2016 6,458 9,187 15,645 Charged credited to income statement 4,290 5,381 1,091 At 31 December 2017 10,748 3,806 14,554 All deferred tax balances arise from timing differences in relation to UK corporation taxes and are expected to be able to be offset between companies.
Deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses are only recognised to the extent that they offset deferred tax liabilities.
In addition to those tax losses recognised above, the Group has further unused UK tax losses which would represent a deferred tax asset of 9,716,000 2016: 2,297,000.
These losses have not been recognised due to uncertainty over the availability of future taxable profits against which to set them.
In the UK tax losses generally have no expiry.
However for companies which have not yet begun formal trading including the Groups main subsidiary, only expenditure from the seven years prior to the date of commencement of trade are available for future use.
Consequently, 1,129,000 of the potential deferred tax asset in respect of unrecognised losses noted above are expected to expire before the expected commencement of trading and therefore will likely not be available for use by the Group.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS There have been no material related party transactions in the year ended 31 December 2017 2016: nil, except for key management compensation.
The key management compensation below includes eight 2016: seven Sirius Minerals Plc Directors and three 2016: four further executive management employees who are not Sirius Minerals Plc Directors.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Operating lease commitments Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
The Group leases certain buildings under operating lease agreements.
The lease terms are between two and fifteen years and the majority of agreements are renewable at the end of the lease period, at market rate.
The lease expenditure charged to the income statement during the year is disclosed in note 2 on page 117.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments outstanding under operating leases agreements are: 2017 2016 000s 000s No later than 1 year 376 185 Later than 1 year and no later than 5 years 1,800 249 Later than 5 years 1,925 Total amounts due under operating leases 4,101 434 Capital expenditure commitments and contingent liabilities At 31 December 2017 the Group had contracted but unrecognised capital expenditure commitments of 20,806,000.

POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS On 14 February 2018 the Group announced that it had signed a design and build contract with DMC Mining Services UK Ltd for the construction for the Projects shafts.
The target price of this contract is consistent with the previously announced allocated Project budget.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs liquidity risk and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates market risk.
Liquidity risk and capital management Liquidity risk The Groups policy on overall liquidity is to ensure that it can call on sufficient funds to facilitate all ongoing operations and planned expansion of the Project on its optimal production timetable.
The Group monitors its levels of working capital and financial investments to ensure that it can meet its payments as they fall due.
The following table shows the gross contractual maturities of the Groups recognised financial liabilities, including unrecognised future interest payments: Trade and other Convertible payables loans Total 31 December 2017 000s 000s 000s Amount due within 1 year or less 29,387 19,556 48,943 Amount due within 1-2 years 19,556 19,556 Amount due within 2-5 years 58,669 58,669 Amount due after 5 years 249,634 249,634 Total contractual cash flows 29,387 347,415 376,802 129 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 21.

Capital management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to ensure that it is best placed to further its development of the Project, whilst also safeguarding the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
The Group defines capital as being cash and cash equivalents plus bank deposits.
The Board of Directors monitors the level of capital as compared to the Groups commitments and approves plans to adjust the level of capital accordingly in the best interests of shareholders.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
As part of the annual budgeting and long-term planning process the Groups cash flow forecast is reviewed and approved by the Board.
The cash flow forecast is updated on a monthly basis taking account of the latest expenditure forecasts.
Based on the size and timing of the forecast expenditures, the Group adjusts the mix of holdings of its cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits in order to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its expenditures, whilst maximising the return on its funds, within the bounds of the Groups Board-approved treasury policy.
Foreign currency exchange rate risk The Groups operations are essentially based in the United Kingdom and it is expected that future revenues will be denominated in US Dollars.
The majority of the Groups operating and capital expansion costs are denominated in Sterling although a significant portion of capital expansion costs are expected to be denominated in Euros and Canadian Dollars.
The Groups debt financing is denominated in US Dollars.
The table below shows the currency denomination of the Groups recognised financial instruments: Cash and cash Trade and other Convertible equivalents Bank deposits Restricted cash payables Derivatives loans Total 31 December 2017 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Sterling 147,993 60,063 35,255 23,032 220,279 US Dollars 69,679 59,391 39,234 196 10,033 249,325 91,250 Euros 9,064 30,111 4,932 34,243 Canadian Dollars 8,733 8,885 1,200 16,418 Other 63 27 36 Total 235,532 158,450 74,489 29,387 10,033 249,325 179,726 Cash and cash Trade and other Convertible equivalents Bank deposits Restricted cash payables Derivatives loans Total 31 December 2016 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Sterling 158,262 200,095 3,397 354,960 US Dollars 101,851 122,093 82,924 2,457 1,041 321,366 15,914 Euros 28 28 Canadian Dollars 5 5 Other 11 11 Total 260,157 322,188 82,924 5,854 1,041 321,366 339,090 Foreign exchange differences on retranslation of monetary items upon settlement and at period-end is recognised as part of finance costs in the income statement, except for financial assets in a designated cash flow hedge relationship where these differences are recognised as part of other comprehensive income.
130 Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 21.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The Group is exposed to foreign currency transaction risk on transactions that are denominated in currencies other than theproceeds of the stage 1 financing Sterling and US Dollars.
It is the Groups policy to hedge foreign currency exposures associated with committed or probable expenditures in order to mitigate this potential transaction risk.
The Group achieves this by purchasing cash and bank deposits in the relevant foreign currencies ahead of the occurrence of the transactions and simultaneously designating these foreign cash and bank deposits as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships.
As a result the Group is able to significantly mitigate its exposures to movements in the Sterling Euro and Sterling Canadian Dollar exchange rates, both in its expected cash flows and upon its income statement.
The Group is also exposed to foreign currency translation risk since its convertible loan debt financing net of surplus cash that the Group holds which was received on issuance of the convertible loan is denominated in US Dollars.
It is the Groups policy to not hedge this risk.
As a result, movements in the Sterling US Dollar exchange rate will impact upon the Groups reported financial position and performance.
A strengthening of the US Dollar against Sterling would have an adverse impact on reported losses and the Groups financial position.
It is expected that this exposure will reduce over time by conversion of the convertible loans which will crystallise all currency fluctuations in equity without requiring any cash settlement by the Group, meaning that this is not expected to give rise to a material cash flow risk.
The impact of a 10% weakening in the Sterling US Dollar exchange rate compared to the rate prevailing at 31 December 2017 would be an increase in reported loss of 9,125,000 December 2016: 1,440,000 and a reduction of 9,126,000 December 2016: 1,456,000 to the Groups reported equity.
The Group has put in place a foreign exchange risk management system within its intercompany borrowing structure to minimise the risk that any adverse fluctuations in the Sterling US Dollar exchange rate indicated by the sensitivities in the paragraph above could give rise to any material cash tax exposures.
c. Interest rate risk The Groups convertible loans have a fixed rate of interest of 8.5% and so interest payments due under these loans are not exposed to any cash flow risk arising from fluctuations in market interest rates.
The Group has no other interest-bearing liabilities.
Cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and restricted cash held by the Group all earn interest which is either floating orfixed for no longer than one year.
The Group seeks to invest its interest-bearing financial assets in such a way so as to maximise the interest earned based on prevailing market rates, within the bounds of first minimising credit risk associated with the investments and ensuring that the investments are sufficiently liquid to allow the Group to service its day-to-day operating and expected capital expenditures.
d. Credit risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and restricted cash.
The Groups maximum credit exposure is equal to the carrying value of its financial assets as reported in the statement of financial position.
This risk is mitigated by placing bank deposits and entering into financial instruments only with approved institutions who have an S&P credit rating of at least A-.
Furthermore, to prevent concentration risk, the Groups treasury policy mandates that no more than 20% of the Groups surplus funds can be placed with any single institution other than the Groups primary relationship bank.

132 Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 21.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED f. Fair value The Group is required to exercise judgement in appropriately estimating the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments held by the Group do not have observable market prices and so the Group is required to identify appropriate valuation models in calculating these fair values.
In making its estimates, priority is given to inputs based on actual market data and transactions, although these valuations nevertheless require some level of subjective assessment and the use of different valuation assumptions could have a significant impact upon the Groups reported financial performance and position.
Financial instruments measured at fair value are grouped into one of three levels as set out by IFRS 13 Fair Value based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
These levels are as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted based on active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices : Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The only assets or liabilities that the Group has which are measured at fair value are the derivatives associated with the convertible loans and the royalty financing.
These have both been assessed to be a level 2 financial liability since the derivatives themselves are not traded on an active market but their fair values are determined by valuation techniques thatare based solely on observable market data.
The main inputs to the derivatives valuations are: the traded price of the Groups convertible loans: the traded price of the Groups shares: forward exchange rates and the debt yields of entities withsimilar credit profiles to the Group.
In order to estimate the fair value of the convertible loans embedded derivative at any point in time, the Group estimates the fair value of the cash flows due under the host loan at an assumed discount rate that would likely apply to any debt issued by the Group which was not convertible and subtracting this from the market value of the convertible loans based on the quoted trading price at the measurement date.
In estimating this assumed discount rate, the Group considers publicly quoted bond yield data of comparable entities with similar credit profiles and their prevailing bond yields at the measurement date.
The fair value of the royalty equity investment derivative is estimated as the net present value of the difference between the US$50 million receivable in Sterling terms and the 200 million shares to be issued on the royalty drawdown date whose value is based on their spot price at the measurement date.
The inputs used in the fair valuation estimates of these derivatives exposes the Group to further market risks.
Movements in these inputs cause the fair valuation but not the cash flows of the derivatives to fluctuate and affect reported finance costs.
Increases in the convertible loans price and share price which generally move synchronously would cause an increase in the loss reported from both derivatives while an increase in the discount rate assumed would cause an increase in the loss reported from the convertible loans embedded derivative.
Conversely, a fall in the Groups share price would cause a gain to be reported on these instruments fair value.
The sensitivity of the derivatives valuation upon the reported loss for the year and total equity resulting from a 10% change in these inputs is as follows: 2017 2016 000s 000s Convertible loans and share price increase decrease 33,089 33,089 36,632 36,632 Discount rate increase decrease 8,226 8,634 14,533 15,650 133 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 22.
