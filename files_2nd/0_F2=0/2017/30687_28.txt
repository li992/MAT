Decommissioning costs note 22 : There is uncertainty around the cost of decommissioning as cost estimates can vary in response to many factors, including changes to the relevant legal requirements, the emergence of new technology or experience at other assets.
The expected timing, work scope, amount of expenditure and risk weighting may also change.
Therefore significant estimates and assumptions are made in determining the provision for decommissioning.
The estimated decommissioning costs are reviewed annually by an internal expert and the results of this review are then assessed alongside estimates from Operators.
Provision for environmental clean-up and remediation costs is based on current legal and contractual requirements, technology and price levels.
Provisions for onerous service contracts note 22 : Due to the historical reduction in original planned future work programmes the Group identified a number of onerous service contracts in prior years.

Taxation on loss on ordinary activities continued Factors affecting tax credit for the period The tax rate applied to profit on ordinary activities in preparing the reconciliation below is the UK corporation tax rate applicable to the Groups non-upstream UK profits.
The difference between the total tax credit shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax applicable to UK profits of 19% 2016: 20% to the loss before tax is as follows: 2017 2016 $m $m 299.1 908.3 Group loss on ordinary activities before tax Tax on Group loss on ordinary activities at the standard UK corporation tax rate of 19% 2016: 20% 56.8 181.7 Effects of: Non-deductible exploration expenditure 21.6 25.8 Other non-deductible expenses 12.6 22.7 Derecognition of deferred tax previously recognised 30.2 Recognition of deferred tax previously unrecognised 21.5 Impairment of goodwill 127.9 Utilisation of tax losses not previously recognised 0.3 9.5 Net losses not recognised 18.4 61.7 Petroleum revenue tax PRT 6.7 Adjustment relating to prior years 1.9 2.1 Adjustments to deferred tax relating to change in tax rates 12.6 0.8 Higher rate of taxation on Norway losses 13.1 286.4 Other tax rates applicable outside the UK and Norway 88.0 86.8 PSC income not subject to corporation tax 15.4 1.6 Tax incentives for investment 2.8 3.7 Other income not subject to corporation tax 6.0 110.6 311.0 Group total tax credit for the year The Finance Act 2016 further reduced the main rate of UK corporation tax applicable to all companies subject to corporation tax, except for those within the oil and gas ring fence, to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 2020.
These changes were substantively enacted on 6 September 2016 and hence the effect of the change on the deferred tax balances has been included, depending upon when deferred tax is expected to reverse.
The Groups profit before taxation will continue to arise in jurisdictions where the effective rate of taxation differs from that in the UK, such as Ghana 35%, Gabon 55%, and Equatorial Guinea 35%.
Furthermore, unsuccessful exploration expenditure is often incurred in jurisdictions where the Group has no taxable profits, such that no related tax benefit arises.
Accordingly, the Groups tax charge will continue to vary according to the jurisdictions in which pre-tax profits and exploration costs written off arise.
The Group has tax losses of $3,642.0 million 2016: $2,844.0 million that are available for offset against future taxable profits in the companies in which the losses arose.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group due to uncertainty of recovery.
The Group has recognised deferred tax assets of $530.0 million 2016: $535.3 million in relation to tax losses only to the extent of anticipated future taxable income or gains in relevant jurisdictions.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of $7.9 million 2016: $8.2 million relating to unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax relating to components of other comprehensive income During 2017 $24.3 million 2016: $108.8 million of tax has been recognised through other comprehensive income of which $24.9 million 2016: $107.8 million is current and $0.6 million 2016: $1.0 million is deferred tax relating to all debit 2016: credits on cash flow hedges arising in the year.
Current tax assets As at 31 December 2017, current tax assets were $57.7 million 2016: $138.3 million of which $44.6m relates to the UK 2016: $29.0 million and $3.1 million relates to Norway 2016: $90.0 million, where 78% of exploration expenditure is refunded as a tax refund in the year following the incurrence of such expenditure.

Loss per ordinary share Basic loss per ordinary share amounts are calculated by dividing net loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted loss per ordinary share amounts are calculated by dividing net loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued if employee and other share options or the convertible bonds were converted into ordinary shares.
Due to losses incurred in 2017 and 2016 all potential ordinary shares are antidilutive.

Property, plant, and equipment continued During 2017 and 2016 the Group applied the following nominal oil price assumptions for impairment assessments: Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Year 6 onwards 2017 Forward curve Forward curve $59 bbl $66 bbl $68 bbl $75 bbl inflated at 2016 Forward curve Forward curve $70 bbl $70 bbl $90 bbl $90 2% bbl The prices assumed in 2017 decreased due to downward revisions by expert forecasters.
Oil prices stated above are benchmark prices to which an individual field price differential is applied.
All impairment assessments are prepared on a value-in-use basis using discounted future cash flows based on 2P reserves profiles.
A reduction or increase in the two year forward curve of $20 bbl, based on the approximate volatility of the oil price over the previous two years, and a reduction or increase in the medium and long term price assumptions of $15 bbl, based on the range seen in external oil price market forecasts, are considered to be reasonably possible changes for the purposes of sensitivity analysis.
Decreases to oil prices specified above would increase the impairment charge by $1,189.7 million, whilst increases to oil prices specified above would result in a credit to the impairment charge of $1,024.1 million.
A 1% increase in the pre-tax discount rate would increase the impairment by $152.5 million.
A 1% decrease in the pre-tax discount rate would decrease the impairment by $139.7 million The Group believes a 1% change in the pre-tax discount rate to be a reasonable possibility based on historical analysis of the Groups and a peer group of companies impairment discount rates.

In addition to the cash held in joint venture bank accounts the Group had $16.1 million 2016: $20.3 million held in restricted bank accounts.
Assets classified as held for sale In 2017, Tullow announced that it had agreed a substantial farm-down of its assets in Uganda.
Under the Sale and Purchase Agreement, Tullow has agreed to transfer 21.57% of its 33.33% Uganda interests for a total consideration of $900 million.
Upon completion, the farm-down will leave Tullow with an 11.76% interest in the upstream and pipeline projects.
This is expected to reduce to a 10% interest in the upstream project when the Government of Uganda formally exercises its back-in right.
Although it has not yet been determined what interests the Governments of Uganda and Tanzania will take in the pipeline project, Tullow expects its interests in the upstream and pipeline projects to be aligned.
The consideration is split into $200 million in cash, consisting of $100 million payable on completion of the transaction, $50 million payable at FID and $50 million payable at First Oil.
The remaining $700 million is in deferred consideration and represents reimbursement in cash of a proportion of Tullows past exploration and development costs.
The deferred consideration is payable to Tullow as the upstream and pipeline projects progress and these payments will be used by Tullow to fund its share of the development costs.
Tullow expects the deferred consideration to cover its share of upstream and pipeline development capex to First Oil and beyond.
Completion of the transaction is subject to certain conditions, including the approval of the Government of Uganda, after which Tullow will cease to be an operator in Uganda.
The disposal is expected to complete in mid-2018.
The estimated fair value of the consideration was $829.7 million on recognition which, when compared to the carrying value of the Groups interest in Uganda, resulted in an exploration write-off of $330.4 million in 2016.
The fair value of the deferred consideration was calculated using expected timing of receipts based on managements best estimate of the expected capital profile of the project discounted at the relevant counterpartys cost of borrowing.
Additions to this value have been recognised in relation to capitalised interest.
The present value of the consideration will be determined on completion and assessed against the carrying value of the net assets of the disposal group.
This represents a level 3 financial asset.
The divestment of the Norway business was completed during 2017 with $7.4 million of assets held for sale at 31 December 2016 being disposed in full during 2017.
Consequently, there were no Norwegian assets held for sale at 31 December 2017.
The divestment of the Netherlands business was completed during 2017 with $113.1 million of assets held for sale at 30 June 2017 being disposed in full.
Consequently, there were no Netherlands assets held for sale at 31 December 2017.

In February 2017, the Company agreed a 12 month extension to the maturity of the Revolving credit facility RCF to April 2019.
The commitments were reduced from $1,000 million to $600 million in the year.
The facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at US dollar LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
In November 2017, the Company completed the refinancing of the Reserves Based lending credit facility RBL.
Commitments were reduced from $3,255 million from the beginning of the year to $2,500 million.
The $2,500 million of credit facilities are split between a commercial bank facility of $2,400 million and an International Finance Corporation facility of $100 million.
The refinancing was concluded to not result in a substantial modification to the previous facility.
Consequently, previously deferred costs are to be amortised over the life of the refinanced facility.
The RBL facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at US dollar LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
The outstanding debt is repayable in line with the amortisation of bank commitments over the period to the final maturity date of 21 November 2024, with an initial three-year grace period, or such time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier.
In November 2017, the Revolving Norwegian exploration finance facility EFF of NOK 1,000 million was repaid in full and cancelled.
The facility was used to finance certain exploration activities on the Norwegian Continental Shelf which were eligible for a tax refund.
At 31 December 2017, available headroom under the RBL and RCF facilities amounted to $945 million: $345 million under the RBL and $600 million under the RCF.
At 31 December 2016, the available headroom under the facilities amounted to $875 million: $255 million under the RBL, $620 million under the RCF and $nil under the EFF.
Capital management The Group defines capital as the total equity and net debt of the Group.
Capital is managed in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits to stakeholders and to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Tullow is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may put in place new debt facilities, issue new shares for cash, repay debt, engage in active portfolio management, adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, or undertake other such restructuring activities as appropriate.
No significant changes were made to the capital management objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2017.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing, being net debt divided by adjusted EBITDAX and maintains a policy target of below 2.5x.
A summary of the gearing calculation and a reconciliation of the metric to IFRS measures can be found in the finance review on page 35. www.

Financial instruments Financial risk management objectives The Group is exposed to a variety of risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency risk and liquidity risk.
The Group holds a portfolio of commodity derivative contracts, with various counterparties, covering its underlying oil and gas businesses.
The Group holds a mix of fixed and floating rate debt as well as a portfolio of interest rate derivatives.
The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits are monitored and reviewed internally on a regular basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivatives, for speculative purposes.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities With the exception of the Senior Notes and the convertible bonds, the Group considers the carrying value of all its financial assets and liabilities to be materially the same as their fair value.
The fair value of the Senior Notes, as determined using market values at 31 December 2017, was $1,310.7 million 2016: $1,223.1 million compared to carrying values of $1,286.0 million 2016: $1,298.7 million.
The fair value of the convertible bonds, as determined using market values, as at 31 December 2017, was $374.0 million 2016: $395.5 million compared to the carrying value of $256.9 million 2016: $257.3 million.
The Group has no material financial assets that are past due.
No material financial assets are impaired at the balance sheet date.
All financial assets and liabilities with the exception of derivatives are measured at amortised cost.
Fair values of derivative instruments All derivatives are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet with valuation changes recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives have been designated as a cash flow hedge.
Fair value is the amount for which the asset or liability could be exchanged in an arms length transaction at the relevant date.
Where available, fair values are determined using quoted prices in active markets.
To the extent that market prices are not available, fair values are estimated by reference to market-based transactions, or using standard valuation techniques for the applicable instruments and commodities involved.
The Groups derivative carrying and fair values were as follows: 2017 2017 2016 2016 Less than 1-3 2017 Less than 1-3 2016 1 year years Total 1 year years Total $m $m $m $m $m $m Assets liabilities Cash flow hedges Oil derivatives 3.7 4.4 0.7 139.7 40.2 179.9 Gas derivatives 1.4 1.4 Interest rate derivatives 0.8 0.8 1.0 0.6 0.4 2.9 4.4 1.5 137.3 40.8 178.1 Deferred premium Oil derivatives 49.4 28.4 77.8 51.5 35.9 87.4 49.4 28.4 77.8 51.5 35.9 87.4 1.8 0.8 2.6 91.7 15.8 107.5 Total assets 53.1 25.8 78.9 5.9 10.9 16.8 Total liabilities Derivatives maturity and the timing of their recycling into income or expense coincide.
The following provides an analysis of the Groups financial instruments measured at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques which include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
All the Groups derivatives are Level 2 2016: Level 2.
There were no transfers between fair value levels during the year.
For financial instruments which are recognised on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels by reassessing categorisation based on the lowest-level input which is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.

Financial instruments continued Offset of financial assets and financial liabilities Deferred premiums on derivatives are settled at the same time as the maturity of the derivative contracts, with the cash flows settled on a net basis.
Netting agreements are also in place to enable the Group and its counterparties to set-off liabilities against available assets in the event that either party is unable to fulfil its contractual obligations.
The following table provides the offsetting relationship within assets and liabilities in the balance sheet.

Such commodity derivatives will tend to be priced using benchmarks, such as Dated Brent, D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren, which correlate as far as possible to the underlying oil and gas revenues respectively.
The Group hedges its estimated oil and gas revenues on a portfolio basis, aggregating its oil revenues from substantially all of its African oil interests and its gas revenues from substantially all of its UK gas interests.
As at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, all of the Groups oil and gas derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges.
The Groups oil and gas hedges have been assessed to be highly effective within the range prescribed under IAS 39 using regression analysis.
There is, however, the potential for a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups oil hedges arising from, among other factors, the discount on the Groups underlying African crude relative to Brent and the timing of oil liftings relative to the hedges.
There is also the potential for a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups gas hedges which arises from, among other factors, daily field production performance.
The following table demonstrates the timing, volumes and the average floor price protected for the Groups commodity hedges: 2018 2019 2020 Hedging position as at 31 December 2017 Oil volume bopd 45,000 22,232 997 Average floor price protected $ bbl 52.23 48.87 50.00 Gas volume mmscfd Average floor price protected p therm 2017 2018 2019 Hedging position as at 31 December 2016 Oil volume bopd 42,500 22,000 7,979 Average floor price protected $ bbl 60.23 51.88 45.53 Gas volume mmscfd 3.67 Average floor price protected p therm 40.47 The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Groups derivative financial instruments to reasonably possible movements in Dated Brent oil price and UK D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren natural gas prices: Effect on equity 2017 2016 Market movement $m $m Brent oil price 25% 139.0 145.0 Brent oil price 25% 115.5 183.6 UK D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren natural gas price 25% 2.3 UK D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren natural gas price 25% 2.3 www.

Financial instruments continued Commodity price risk continued The following assumptions have been used in calculating the sensitivity in movement of oil and gas prices: the pricing adjustments relate only to the point forward mark-to-market MTM valuations, the price sensitivities assume there is no ineffectiveness related to the oil and gas hedges and the sensitivities have been run only on the intrinsic element of the hedge as management considers this to be the material component of oil and gas hedge valuations.
Fair value movements recognised in the income statement Fair value movements relating to the non-intrinsic element of the commodity derivatives have been immediately recognised in the income statement during the year, and were as follows: 2017 2016 $m $m Loss profit on hedging instruments Cash flow hedges Oil derivatives Time value 11.8 18.2 11.8 18.2 11.8 18.2 Total net loss profit for the year in the income statement Hedge reserve summary The hedge reserve represents the portion of deferred gains and losses on hedging instruments deemed to be effective cash flow hedges.

Financial instruments continued Cash flow and interest rate risk Subject to parameters set by management the Group seeks to minimise interest costs by using a mixture of fixed and floating debt.
Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance from overnight to three months at rates determined by US dollar LIBOR, Sterling LIBOR and Norwegian NIBOR.
Fixed rate debt comprises Senior Notes, convertible bonds, bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance for periods greater than three months or bank borrowings where the interest rate has been fixed through interest rate hedging.
The Group hedges its floating interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis through the use of interest rate swaps.
The mark-to-market position of the Groups interest rate portfolio as at 31 December 2017 is an asset of $0.8 million 2016: $0.4 million liability.
Interest rate hedges are included in fixed rate debt in the table below.
The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, excluding trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, at 31 December 2017 and 2016 was as follows: 2017 2017 2016 2016 2017 Fixed rate Floating rate 2017 2016 Fixed rate Floating rate 2016 Cash at bank debt debt Total Cash at bank debt debt Total $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m US$ 219.4 1,900.0 1,855.0 3,535.6 200.8 1,900.0 3,080.0 4,779.2 Euro 3.1 3.1 8.6 8.6 Sterling 21.4 21.4 33.1 33.1 Other 40.1 40.1 39.4 83.8 44.4 284.0 1,900.0 1,855.0 3,471.0 281.9 1,900.0 3,163.8 4,781.9 Cash at bank consisted mainly of deposits which earn interest at rates set in advance for periods ranging from overnight to one month by reference to market rates.

The primary credit exposures for the Group are its receivables generated by the marketing of crude oil and amounts due from JV partners including in relation to their share of the TEN FPSO finance lease.
These exposures are managed at the corporate level.
The Groups crude sales are predominantly made to international oil market participants including the oil majors, trading houses and refineries.
JV partners are predominantly international major oil and gas market participants.
Counterparty evaluations are conducted utilising international credit rating agency and financial assessments.
Where considered appropriate, security in the form of trade finance instruments from financial institutions with an appropriate credit ratings, such as letters of credit, guarantees and credit insurance, are obtained to mitigate the risks.
The Group generally enters into derivative agreements with banks who are lenders under the Reserve-Based lending credit facility.
Security is provided under the facility agreement which mitigates non-performance risk.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties.
The maximum financial exposure due to credit risk on the Groups financial assets, representing the sum of cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivative assets, trade receivables, current tax assets and other current assets, as at 31 December 2017 was $2,217.7 million 2016: $1,661.7 million.
Foreign currency risk The Group conducts and manages its business predominately in US dollars, the operating currency of the industry in which it operates.
The Group also purchases the operating currencies of the countries in which it operates routinely on the spot market.
From time to time the Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in other currencies.
These exposures are often managed by executing foreign currency financial derivatives.
There were no material foreign currency financial derivatives in place as at 31 December 2017 2016: $nil.
Cash balances are held in other currencies to meet immediate operating and administrative expenses or to comply with local currency regulations.
As at 31 December 2017, the only material monetary assets or liabilities of the Group that were not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were $45.1 million in non-US-dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents 2016: $16.9 million.

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework covering the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk.
Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities run for different scenarios including, but not limited to, changes in commodity prices, different production rates from the Groups producing assets and delays to development projects.
In addition to the Groups operating cash flows, portfolio management opportunities are reviewed to potentially enhance the financial capability and flexibility of the Group.
The Group had $1.1 billion 2016: $1.0 billion of total facility headroom and free cash as at 31 December 2017.

The finance lease for the TEN FPSO met the criteria for recognition on 1 August 2017.
A finance lease liability has been recorded at a gross value of $1,521.0 million as Tullow entered the lease on behalf of the TEN Joint Venture.
The present value of the lease liability unwinds over the expected life of the lease and is reported within finance costs as interest on obligations under finance leases.
A receivable from Joint Venture Partners of $719.0 million has been recognised in other assets to reflect the value of future payments that will be met by cash calls from partners.
The present value of the receivable from Joint Venture Partners unwinds over the expected life of the lease and is reported within finance revenue.
The net cash outflows of $62.6 million related to the lease agreement since its recognition as a finance lease have been reported in the repayment of obligations under finance leases line in the cash flow statements.
A right of use property, plant, and equipment asset of $807.7 million was also recorded at 31 December 2017.
Prior to recognition as a finance lease, it was accounted for as an operating lease, and included as operating lease payments within cost of sales note 4.
The fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximates the carrying amount.
The average expected remaining lease term as at 31 December 2017 was 7 years 2016: 10 years.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the effective borrowing rate was 7.1% 2016: 6.5%.
Due to the historical reduction in original planned future work programmes the Group identified a number of onerous service contracts in prior years.
The expected unutilised capacity has been provided for in 2016 and 2017 resulting in an income statement credit of $1.0 million 2016: charge of $114.9 million.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable.
This involves an assessment of when those deferred tax assets are likely to reverse, and a judgement as to whether or not there will be sufficient taxable profits available to offset the tax assets when they do reverse.
This requires assumptions regarding future profitability and is therefore inherently uncertain.
To the extent assumptions regarding future profitability change, there can be an increase or decrease in the level of deferred tax assets recognised which can result in a charge or credit in the period in which the change occurs.

Share-based payments continued 2005 Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP Under the DSBP, the portion of any annual bonus above 75% of the base salary of a Senior Executive nominated by the Remuneration Committee was deferred into shares.
Awards normally vest following the end of three financial years commencing with that in which they were granted.
They were granted as nil exercise price options, normally exercisable from when they vest until ten years from grant.
Awards granted before 8 March 2010 as conditional awards to acquire free shares were converted into nil exercise price options to provide flexibility to participants.
A dividend equivalent is paid over the period from grant to vesting.
From 2014, Senior Executives participate in the TIP instead of the DSBP.
The weighted average remaining contractual life for DSBP awards outstanding at 31 December 2017 was 3.6 years.
Employee Share Award Plan ESAP Most Group employees are eligible to be granted nil exercise price options under the ESAP.
These are normally exercisable from three to ten years following grant.
An individual must normally remain in employment for three years from grant for the share to vest.
Awards are not subject to post-grant performance conditions.
Phantom options that provide a cash bonus equivalent to the gain that could be made from a share option being granted over a notional number of shares have also been granted under the ESAP in situations where the grant of share options was not practicable.
The weighted average remaining contractual life for ESAP awards outstanding at 31 December 2017 was 7.3 years.
2010 Share Option Plan 2010 SOP and 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme 2000 ESOS Participation in the 2010 SOP and 2000 ESOS was available to most of the Groups employees.
Options have an exercise price equal to market value shortly before grant and are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of the grant subject to continuing employment.
Options granted prior to 2011 were granted under the 2000 ESOS where exercise was subject to a performance condition.
Performance was measured against constituents of the FTSE 100 index excluding investment trusts.
100% of awards vested if the Companys TSR was above the median of the index companies over three years from grant.
The 2010 SOP was replaced by the ESAP for grants from 2014.
During 2013 phantom options were granted under the 2010 SOP to replace certain options granted under the 2000 ESOS that lapsed as a result of performance conditions not being satisfied.
These replacement phantom options provide a cash bonus equivalent to the gain that could be made from a share option being granted over a notional number of shares with a notional exercise price.
Phantom options have also been granted under the 2010 SOP and the 2000 ESOS in situations where the grant of share options was not practicable.
Options outstanding at 31 December 2017 had exercise prices of 468p to 1305p 2016: 365p to 1530p and remaining contractual lives between 72 days and 5.6 years.
The weighted average remaining contractual life is 3.4 years.
UK & Irish Share Incentive Plans SIPs These are all-employee plans set up in the UK and Ireland, to enable employees to save out of salary up to prescribed monthly limits.
Contributions are used by the SIP trustees to buy Tullow shares Partnership Shares at the end of each three-month accumulation period.
The Company makes a matching contribution to acquire Tullow shares Matching Shares on a one-forone basis.
Under the UK SIP, Matching Shares are subject to time-based forfeiture over three years on leaving employment in certain circumstances or if the related Partnership Shares are sold.
The fair value of a Matching Share is its market value when it is awarded.
Under the UK SIP: i Partnership Shares are purchased at the lower of their market values at the start of the accumulation period and the purchase date which is treated as a three-month share option for IFRS 2 purposes and therefore results in an accounting charge, and ii Matching Shares vest over the three years after being awarded resulting in their accounting charge being spread over that period.
Under the Irish SIP: i Partnership Shares are bought at the market value at the purchase date which does not result in any accounting charge, and ii Matching Shares vest over the two years after being awarded resulting in their accounting charge being spread over that period.

In accordance with the Plan rules, the number of outstanding awards as at 17 March 2017 has been multiplied by 1.1732 and the option exercise prices and previously calculated fair values for these awards have been divided by 1.1732 to allow for the rights issue.
