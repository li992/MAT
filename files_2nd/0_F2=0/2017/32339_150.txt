Commitments and guarantees BDUK Under the Broadband Delivery UK programme, grants received by the group may be subject to reinvestment or repayment to the customer depending on the level of take-up.
Telefnica UK Limited leases Weve provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by Telefnica UK Limited formerly O2 UK Limited prior to the demerger of mmO2 from BT on 19 November 2001. mmO2 plc now part of the Telefnica Group has given BT a counter indemnity for these guarantees.
There is no exposure in the event of credit default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations.
The guarantee lasts until Telefnica UK Limited has discharged all its obligations.
Legal proceedings The group is involved in various legal proceedings, including actual or threatened litigation, government or regulatory investigations.
However, save as disclosed below, the group does not currently believe that there are any legal proceedings, government or regulatory investigations that may have a material adverse impact on the operations or financial condition of the group.
In respect of each of the claims below, the nature and progression of such proceedings and investigations can make it difficult to predict the impact they will have on the group.
There are many reasons why we cannot make these assessments with certainty, including, among others, that they are in early stages, no damages or remedies have been specified, and or the often slow pace of litigation.
