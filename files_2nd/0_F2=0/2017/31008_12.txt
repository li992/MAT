Excluding the London office fit-out costs, new investment accounted for approximately 79% of capital expenditure in 2017 2016: 67%, with the balance being maintenance and replacement of existing software and equipment.
This is more weighted to new investment than in prior years due to the development of the CRM system and improvements relating to the introduction of MiFID II Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR.
