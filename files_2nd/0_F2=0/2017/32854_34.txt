A reconciliation of 2020 Non GAAP EBITDA to U. S. GAAP Net income cannot be provided because we are unable to forecast with reasonable certainty many of the items necessary to calculate such comparable GAAP measures, including asset impairments, acquisitions and integration related expenses, divestments, reorganizations and discontinued operations related expenses, legal settlement costs, as well as other unusual or non-recurring gains or losses.
These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to our results computed in accordance with GAAP.
We believe the inherent uncertainties in reconciling Non GAAP measures for periods after 2018 to the most comparable GAAP measures would make the forecasted comparable GAAP measures nearly impossible to predict with reasonable certainty and therefore inherently unreliable.
