Contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill See Note 2 for information on contingent liabilities related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
Contingent liabilities not related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill There were contingent liabilities at 31December2017 in respect of guarantees and indemnities entered into as part of the ordinary course of the groups business.
No material losses are likely to arise from such contingent liabilities.
Further information on financial guarantees is included in Note 27.
In the normal course of the groups business, legal and regulatory proceedings are pending or may be brought against BP group entities arising out of current and past operations, including matters related to commercial disputes, product liability, antitrust, commodities trading, premisesliability claims, consumer protection, general health, safety and environmental claims and allegations of exposures of third parties to toxic substances, such as lead pigment in paint, asbestos and other chemicals.
BP believes that the impact of these legal proceedings on the groups results of operations, liquidity or financial position will not be material.
The group files tax returns in many jurisdictions throughout the world.
Various tax authorities are currently examining the groups tax returns.
Tax returns contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations including the tax deductibility of certain intercompany charges.
The resolution of tax positions through negotiations with relevant tax authorities, or through litigation, can take several years to complete and the amounts could be significant and could be material to the groups results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
While it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome in some cases, the group does not anticipate that there will be any material impact upon the groups results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
