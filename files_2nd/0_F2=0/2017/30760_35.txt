This resulted in a 522 million reclassification of claims and benefits paid from non-participating to participating investment contracts, a 4,495 million increase in investment income allocated to investment contracts, a 8,411 million decrease in other changes in provisions and a 3,916 million increase in the change in reinsurance asset for investment contract provisions.
These adjustments have no impact on the total expenses incurred by the Group.
Integration and restructuring costs were 141 million 2016: 212 million, which has decreased mainly due to lower integration spend following the Friends Life acquisition and lower Solvency II project costs, partially offset by costs related to the integration of RBC and restructuring costs in France.
