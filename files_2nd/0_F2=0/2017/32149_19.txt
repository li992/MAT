General information Pennon Group plc is a company registered in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is given on page 115.
During 2016 17 Pennon Groups business was operated through two main subsidiaries.
South West Water Limited includes the merged water companies of South West Water and Bournemouth Water, providing water and wastewater services in Devon, Cornwall and parts of Dorset and Somerset and water only services in parts of Dorset, Hampshire and Wiltshire.
Viridor Limiteds business is recycling, energy recovery and waste management.
Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to the years presented.
a Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost accounting basis except for fair value items, principally acquisitions, transfers of assets from customers and certain financial instruments as described in accounting policy notes b, w and o respectively and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee as adopted by the European Union, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
A summary of the principal accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards and interpretations in the year.
The going concern basis has been adopted in preparing these financial statements as stated by the Directors on page 103.
The new standards or interpretations which were mandatory for the first time in the year beginning 1 April 2016 did not have a material impact on the net assets or results of the Group.
It is anticipated that adoption of the following standard could impact the Groups future results as set out below: IFRS 16 Leases no longer distinguishes between an on the balance sheet finance lease and an off the balance sheet operating lease.
Instead, for virtually all lease contracts, the lessee recognises a lease liability reflecting future lease payments and a right-of-use asset.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and is subject to EU endorsement.
The Dir ectors anticipate that the adoption of IFRS 16 on 1 April 2019 will affect primarily the accounting for the Groups operating leases.
As at the reporting date, the group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of 143 million, see note 41.
The Group is assessing the extent to which these commitments will result in the recognition of an asset and a liability for future payments and how this will affect the groups profit and classification of cash flows.
Existing borrowing covenants are not impacted by changes in accounting standards.
Other new standards or interpretations in issue, but not yet effective, including IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers and IFRS 9 Financial instruments are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups net assets or results.
b Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements include the results of Pennon Group plc and its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associate undertakings.
The results of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associate undertakings are included from the date of acquisition or incorporation, and excluded from the date of disposal.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated where the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The results of joint ventures and associate undertakings are accounted for on an equity basis.
Intra-group trading, loan balances and transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the purchase of subsidiaries.
The excess of the value transferred to the seller in return for control of the acquired business, together with the fair value of any previously held equity interest in that business over the Groups share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets, is recorded as goodwill.
119 Financial statements Pennon Group plc Annual Report 2017 Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Principal accounting policies continued c Revenue recognition Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable in the ordinary course of business for the provision of goods and services to customers, and is recognised to the extent that it can be reliably measured and that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group.
Revenue excludes value added tax, trade discounts and revenue arising from transactions between Group companies.
In respect of ongoing, continuous services to customers, such as the provision of drinking water and wastewater services, revenue is recognised in line with the customer using those services.
Where applicable, this includes both billed amounts for estimated usage and an estimation of the amount of unbilled usage at the period end.
Revenue in respect of construction services on long-term contracts, including the provision of service concession arrangements, is recognised based on the fair value of work performed during the year with reference to the total sales value and the stage of completion of those services.
Where a contract with a customer includes more than one service, such as a long-term service concession arrangement, revenue for each service is recognised in proportion to a fair value assessment of the total contract value split across the services provided.
Revenue in respect of goods, such as recyclate, is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer.
For other services, encompassing waste management services, revenue is recognised once the services have been provided to the customer.
Revenue from the sale of electricity from our generating assets is measured based upon metered output delivered at rates specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates as applicable.
Payments received in advance of services provided are held within liabilities.
d Landfill tax Landfill tax is recognised in both revenue and operating costs at the point waste is disposed of at a licensed landfill site.
e Segmental reporting Each of the Groups business segments provides services which are subject to risks and returns which are different from those of the other business segments.
The Groups internal organisation and management structure and its system of internal financial reporting are based primarily on business segments.
The reportable business segments comprise the water business which includes the regulated water and wastewater services undertaken by South West Water, and the waste management business of Viridor.
Segmental revenue and results include transactions between businesses.
Inter-segmental transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
f Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation from the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired, less any subsequent impairment charges.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units or group of cash generating units, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes.
Goodwill is allocated and monitored at the reportable operating segment level.
Further details are contained in accounting policy j.
When a subsidiary undertaking is sold, the profit or loss on disposal is determined after including the attributable amount of unamortised goodwill.
g Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are recognised in relation to long-term service concessions contracts to the extent that future amounts to be received are not contracted.
Other intangible assets include assets acquired in a business combination and are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, finite life intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, with the expense charged to the income statement through operating costs.
h Property, plant and equipment i Infrastructure assets being water mains and sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, dams, pipelines and sea outfalls Infrastructure assets were included at fair value on transition to IFRS, and subsequent additions are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges.
Expenditure to increase capacity or enhance infrastructure assets is capitalised where it can be reliably measured, and it is probable that incremental future economic benefits will flow to the Group.
The cost of day-to-day servicing of infrastructure components is recognised in the income statement as it arises.
120 Infrastructure assets are depreciated evenly over their useful economic lives, and are principally: Dams and impounding reservoirs 200 years Water mains 40 120 years Sewers 40 120 years Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
ii Landfill sites Landfill sites are included within land and buildings at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost includes acquisition and development expenses.
The cost of a landfill site is depreciated to its residual value which is linked to gas production at the site post-closure over its estimated operational life taking account of the usage of void space.
iii Landfill restoration Where the obligation to restore a landfill site is an integral part of its future economic benefits, a non-current asset within property, plant and equipment is recognised.
The asset recognised is depreciated based on the usage of void space.
iv Other assets including energy recovery facilities, property, overground plant and equipment Other assets are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other assets are depreciated evenly to their residual value over their estimated economic lives, and are principally: Land and buildings freehold buildings 30 60 years Land and buildings leasehold buildings Over the estimated economic lives or the finance lease period, whichever is the shorter Operational properties 40 80 years Energy recovery facilities including major refurbishments 25 40 years Fixed plant 20 40 years Vehicles, mobile plant and computers 3 10 years Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
The cost of assets includes directly attributable labour and overhead costs which are incremental to the Group.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of a qualifying asset an asset necessarily taking a substantial period of time to be prepared for its intended use are capitalised as part of the asset.
Assets transferred from customers are recognised at fair value as set out in accounting policy v. The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing sale proceeds with carrying amounts.
These are included in the income statement.
i Leased assets Assets held under finance leases are included as property, plant and equipment at the lower of their fair value at commencement or the present value of the minimum lease payments, and are depreciated over their estimated economic lives or the finance lease period, whichever is the shorter.
The corresponding liability is recorded as borrowings.
The interest element of the rental costs is charged against profits using the actuarial method over the period of the lease.
Rental costs arising under operating leases are charged against profits on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
j Impairment of non-financial assets Assets with an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment, or whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Assets subject to amortisation or depreciation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which an assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value, less costs to sell, and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units.
Value in use represents the present value of projected future cash flows expected to be derived from a cash generating unit, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate which reflects an assessment of the market cost of capital ofthe cash generating unit.
Impairments are charged to the income statement in the year in which they arise.
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have been impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Where a previously impaired asset or cash generating units recoverable amount is in excess of its carrying amount, previous impairments are reversed to the carrying value that would have expected to be recognised had the original impairment not occurred.
k Investment in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are initially recorded at cost, being the fair value of the consideration paid.
Subsequently investments are reviewed for impairment on an individual basis annually or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
l Investment in joint ventures Joint ventures are entities over which the Group exercises joint control.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the joint venture at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill and is included in the carrying value of the investment in the joint venture.
121 Financial statements Pennon Group plc Annual Report 2017 Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Principal accounting policies continued The carrying value of the Groups investment is adjusted for the Groups share of post-acquisition profits or losses recognised in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income.
Losses of a joint venture in excess of the Groups interest are not recognised unless the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to fund those losses.
m Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress includes raw materials and the cost of bringing stocks to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less cost to sell.
n Cash and cash deposits Cash and cash deposits comprise cash in hand and short-term deposits held at banks.
Bank overdrafts are shown within current borrowings.
o Derivatives and other financial instruments The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories: i Loans and receivables All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Following initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when instruments are derecognised or impaired.
Premia, discounts and other costs and fees are recognised in the income statement through the amortisation process.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
ii Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest receivable and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original terms of the receivables.
iii Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
iv Financial assets arising from service concession arrangements Where the provision of waste management services is performed through a contract with a public sector entity which controls a significant residual interest in asset infrastructure at the end of the contract, then consideration is treated as contract receivables, split between profit on the construction of assets, operation of the service and the provision of finance which is recognised in notional interest within finance income.
v Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts and cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge risks associated with interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations.
Derivative instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value for the reported balance sheet.
The Group designates certain hedging derivatives as either: a hedge of a highly probable forecast transaction or change in the cash flows of a recognised asset or liability a cash flow hedge or a hedge of the exposure to change in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability a fair value hedge.
The gain or loss on remeasurement is recognised in the income statement except for cash flow hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, when the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument which is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity, and the ineffective portion in the income statement.
The gains or losses deferred in equity in this way are subsequently recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged underlying transaction or firm commitment is recognised in the income statement.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
This effectiveness testing is reperformed at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Where a non-derivative transaction or series of transactions with the same counterparty has the aggregate effect in substance of a derivative instrument, the transaction or series of transactions shall be recognised as a single derivative instrument at fair value with associated movements recorded in the income statement.
122 The full fair value of a hedging derivative is apportioned on a straight-line basis between non-current and current assets and liabilities based on the remaining maturity of the hedging derivative.
Derivative financial instruments deemed held for trading, which are not subject to hedge accounting, are classified as a current asset or liability with any change in fair value recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group uses cross-currency swaps for some of its foreign currency denominated private placement borrowings.
The swaps either have the effect of i converting variable rate foreign currency borrowings into fixed rate sterling borrowings, ii converting fixed rate foreign currency borrowings into fixed rate sterling borrowings, or iii converting fixed rate foreign currency borrowings into floating rate sterling borrowings.
vi Financial instruments at fair value through profit Financial instruments at fair value through profit reflect the fair value movement of the hedged risk on a hedged item which has been designated in a fair value hedging relationship.
The fair values of these financial instruments are initially recognised on the date the hedging relationship is entered into and thereafter remeasured at each subsequent balance sheet date.
The gain or loss on remeasurement for the period is recognised in the income statement.
p Taxation including deferred tax The tax charge for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in the statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity.
In this case the tax is also recognised in the statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity as appropriate.
Current tax is calculated on the basis of tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Management periodically evaluates tax items subject to interpretation and establishes provisions on individual tax items, where in the judgement of management, the position is uncertain.
The Group includes a number of companies, including the parent company, which are part of a tax group for certain aspects of the tax legislation.
One of these aspects relates to group relief whereby current tax liabilities can be offset by current tax losses arising in other companies within the same tax group.
Payments for group relief are included within the current tax disclosures.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the tax base, except where they arise from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be realised.
Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and expected to apply when the deferred tax liability is settled or the deferred tax asset is realised.
q Provisions Provisions are made where there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that there will be an outflow of economic benefits to settle this obligation and a reliable estimate of this amount can be made.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material the current amount of a provision is the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle obligations.
The unwinding of the discount to present value is included as notional interest within finance costs.
The Groups policies on specific provisions are: i Landfill restoration costs Provisions for the cost of restoring landfill sites are made when the obligation arises.
Where the obligation recognised as a provision gives access to future economic benefits, an asset in property, plant and equipment is recognised.
Provisions are otherwise charged against profits based on the usage of void space.
ii Environmental control and aftercare costs Environmental control and aftercare costs are incurred during the operational life of each landfill site and for a considerable period thereafter.
Provision for all such costs is made over the operational life of the site and charged to the income statement on the basis of the usage of void space at the site.
Further provisions required after the operational life of a site are recognised immediately in the income statement.
iii Underperforming contracts Where the unavoidable costs of meeting a contracts obligations exceed the economic benefits derived from that contract, the unavoidable costs, less revenue anticipated under the terms of the contract, are recognised as a provision and charged to the income statement.
An impairment loss on any assets dedicated to that contract is also recognised as described in accounting policy j. r Share capital and treasury shares Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Where the Company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares the consideration paid, including any directly attributable costs, is deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, is included in equity.
The Group balance sheet includes the shares held by the Pennon Employee Share Trust, relating to employee share-based payments, which have not vested at the balance sheet date.
These are shown as a deduction from shareholders equity until such time as they vest.
s Dividend distributions Dividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid: final dividends when approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
t Employee benefits i Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
123 Financial statements Pennon Group plc Annual Report 2017 Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Principal accounting policies continued Defined benefit pension schemes The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the year less the fair value of plan assets.
If the value of a plans assets exceeds the present value of its obligations, the resulting surplus is only recognised if the Group has an unconditional right to that surplus.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries who advise on the selection of Directors best estimates, using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
The increase in liabilities of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes, expected to arise from employee service in the year, is charged against operating profit.
Changes in benefits granted by the employer are recognised immediately as past service cost in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Defined contribution scheme Costs of the defined contribution pension scheme are charged to the income statement in the year in which they arise.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
ii Share-based payment The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment plans for employees.
The fair value of the employee services required in exchange for the grant is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the grant.
Fair values are calculated using an appropriate pricing model.
Non-market-based vesting conditions are adjusted for in assumptions as to the number of shares which are expected to vest.
u Pre-contract and development costs Pre-contract and development costs, including bid costs are expensed as incurred, except where it is probable that the contract will be awarded or the development completed, in which case they are recognised as an asset which is amortised to the income statement over the life of the contract.
v Fair values The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on the market price to transfer the asset or liability at the balance sheet date in an ordinary transaction between market participants.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values.
In the case of non-current bank loans and other loans, the fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
w Transfers of assets from customers Where an item of property, plant and equipment that must be used to connect customers to the network is received from a customer, or where cash is received from a customer for the acquisition or construction of such an item, that asset is recorded and measured on initial recognition at its fair value.
The credit created by the recognition of the asset is recognised in the income statement.
The period over which the credit is recognised depends upon the nature of the service provided, as determined by the agreement with the customer.
Where the service provided is solely a connection to the network, the credit is recognised at the point of connection.
If the agreement does not specify a period, revenue is recognised over a period no longer than the economic life of the transferred asset used to provide the ongoing service.
The fair value of assets on transfer from customers is determined using a cost valuation approach allowing for depreciation.
x Foreign exchange Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the closing balance sheet rate.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
y Perpetual capital securities Perpetual capital securities are issued securities that qualify for recognition as equity.
Accordingly any periodic returns are accounted for as dividends and recognised directly in equity and as a liability at the time the Company becomes obligated to pay the periodic return.
This reflects the nature of the periodic returns and repayment of principal being only made at the Companys discretion.
Any associated tax impacts are recognised directly in equity.
z Non-underlying items Non-underlying items are those that in the Directors view are required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Groups financial performance.
Financial risk management a Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: liquidity risk, market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk and credit risk.
The Groups treasury function seeks to ensure that sufficient funding is available to meet foreseeable needs and to maintain reasonable headroom for contingencies, and manages inflation and interest rate risk.
The principal financial risks faced by the Group relate to liquidity, interest rate and credit counterparty risk.
These risks and treasury operations are managed by the Chief Financial Officer in accordance with policies established by the Board.
Major transactions are individually approved by the Board.
Treasury activities are reported to the Board and are subject to review by internal audit.
Financial instruments are used to raise finance, manage risk, optimise the use of surplus funds and manage overall interest rate performance.
The Group does not engage in speculative activity.
i Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities which are designed to ensure the Group has sufficient available funds for operations and planned expansions equivalent to at least one years forecast requirements at all times.
Details of undrawn committed facilities and short-term facilities are provided in note 28.
Refinancing risk is managed under a Group policy that requires that no more than 20% of Group net borrowings should mature in any financial year.
The Group and Water Business have entered into covenants with lenders.
While terms vary, these typically provide for limits on gearing primarily based on the Water Businesss Regulatory Capital Value and Viridor Limiteds EBITDA plus interest receivable on service concession arrangements and interest cover.
Existing covenants are not impacted by subsequent changes to accounting standards.

125 Financial statements Pennon Group plc Annual Report 2017 Notes to the financial statements continued 3.
Financial risk management continued ii Market risk The Group has a policy of maintaining at least 50% of interest-bearing liabilities at fixed rates.
The Group uses a combination of fixed rate and index-linked borrowings and fixed rate interest swaps as cash flow hedges of future variable interest payments to achieve this policy.
At the year-end 69% 2016 67% of Group net borrowings were at fixed rates including at least 50% of South West Waters borrowings after the impact of financial derivatives.
The notional principal amounts of the interest rate swaps are used to determine settlement under those swaps and are not therefore an exposure for the Group.
These instruments are analysed in note 23.
20% 2016 22% of the Groups net borrowings are RPI index-linked.
The interest rate for index-linked debt is based upon an RPI measure, which is also used in determining the amount of income from customers in South West Water.
The Group has no significant interest-bearing assets upon which the net return fluctuates from market risk.
Deposit interest receivable is expected to fluctuate in line with interest payable on floating rate borrowings.
Consequently the Groups income and cash generated from operations note 38 are independent of changes in market interest rates.
For 2017 if interest rates on variable net borrowings had been on average 0.5% higher lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year and equity would have increased decreased by 0.3 million 2016 0.1 million, for the equity sensitivity fair value, with derivative impacts excluded.
For 2017 if RPI on index-linked borrowings had been on average 0.5% higher lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year and equity would have decreased increased by 1.9 million 2016 1.9 million.
Foreign currency risk occurs at transactional and translation level from borrowings and transactions in foreign currencies.
These risks are managed through forward contracts, which provide certainty over foreign currency risk.
iii Credit risk Credit counterparty risk arises from cash and cash deposits, derivative financial instruments and exposure to customers, including outstanding receivables.
Further information on the credit risk relating to trade receivables is given in notes 19 and 22.
Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Board has agreed a policy for managing such risk which is controlled through credit limits, counterparty approvals, and rigorous monitoring procedures.
The Group has no other significant concentration of credit risk.
The Groups surplus funds are managed by the Groups treasury function and are usually placed in short-term fixed interest deposits or the overnight money markets.
Deposit counterparties must meet board approved minimum criteria based on their short-term credit ratings and therefore of good credit quality.
b Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to minimise the cost of capital.
The Groups policy is to have a minimum of 12 months pre-funding of projected capital expenditure.
At 31 March 2017 the Group had cash and facilities, including restricted funds, of 1.4 billion, meeting this objective.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group seeks to maintain a balance of returns to shareholders through dividends and an appropriate capital structure of debt and equity for each business segment and the Group.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net borrowings divided by total capital.
Net borrowings are analysed in note 39 and calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash deposits.
Total capital is calculated as total shareholders equity plus net borrowings.
The gearing ratios at the balance sheet date were: 2017 2016 m m Net borrowings note 39 2,664.9 2,484.4 Total equity 1,509.2 1,487.6 Total capital 4,174.1 3,972.0 Gearing ratio 63.8% 62.5% 126 The Water segment is also monitored on the basis of the ratio of its net borrowings to Regulatory Capital Value RCV.
Ofwats optimum gearing for the K6 2015-2020 regulatory period is set at 62.5%.
Water Business 2017 2016 m m Regulatory Capital Value 3,290.6 3,150.2 Net borrowings 2,033.8 1,880.0 Net borrowings Regulatory Capital Value 61.8% 59.7% The Group has entered into covenants with lenders and, while terms vary, these typically provide for limits on gearing and interest cover.
The Group has been in compliance with its covenants during the year.
c Determination of fair values The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
The Groups financial instruments are valued principally using level 2 measures as analysed in note 23.
The fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market for example over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
A variety of methods and assumptions are used based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt.
Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The carrying values, less impairment provision, of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities, principally environmental provisions, is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates The Groups principal accounting policies are set out in note 2.
Management is required to exercise significant judgement and make use of estimates and assumptions in the application of these policies.
Estimates are based on factors including historical experience and expectations of future events that management believe to be reasonable.
However, given the judgemental nature of such estimates, actual results could be different from the assumptions used.
Estimates Environmental and landfill restoration provisions Environmental control and aftercare costs are incurred during the operational life of each landfill site and for a considerable period thereafter.
The period of aftercare post-closure and the level of costs expected are uncertain and can vary significantly from site to site.
Key factors are the type of waste, the speed at which it decomposes, the volume of leachate requiring treatment and regulatory requirements specific to the site.
The amounts expected to be incurred are based on landfill site operating lives, taking account of the anticipated decline in landfill activity.
The provisions are based on latest assumptions reflecting recent historic data and future cost estimates.
The aftercare provision is particularly sensitive to the estimated volumes of leachate and their associated cost, together with the discount rate used to establish the provision.
The provisions are recognised in the financial statements at the net present value of the estimated future expenditure required to settle the Groups obligations.
A discount rate is applied to recognise the time value of money and is unwound over the life of the provision.
This is included in the income statement as a financial item within finance costs.
As at 31 March 2017 the Groups environmental and landfill restoration provisions were 183.8 million 2016 182.1 million note 32.
Where a restoration provision gives access to future economic benefits, an asset is recognised and depreciated in accordance with the Groups depreciation policy.
As at 31 March 2017 these assets had a net book value of 14.3 million 2016 11.7 million note 17.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes for which actuarial valuations are carried out as determined by the trustees at intervals of not more than three years.
The last such valuation of the main scheme was as at 31 March 2016.
The pension cost and liabilities under IAS 19 are assessed in accordance with Directors best estimates using the advice of an independent qualified actuary and assumptions in the latest actuarial valuation.
The assumptions are based on member data supplied to the actuary and market observations for interest rates and inflation, supplemented by discussions between the actuary and management.
The mortality assumption uses a scheme-specific calculation based on CMI 2015 actuarial tables with an allowance for future longevity improvement.
The principal assumptions used to measure schemes liabilities, sensitivities to changes in those assumptions and future funding obligations are set out in note 30.
127 Financial statements Pennon Group plc Annual Report 2017 Notes to the financial statements continued 4.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates continued Estimates continued Taxation The Groups current tax provision of 26.8 million, reduced from 37.1 million in 2015 16, includes 18.6 million related to prior year tax items 2016 37.1 million.
In 2015 16 the Group reported significant judgement around uncertain tax items related to the interpretation of tax legislation regarding financial arrangements entered into in the normal course of business, which could have resulted in a range of outcomes of additional liabilities of c20 million, to a reduction in liabilities of 52 million.
Following engagement and subsequently resolution with HMRC across a number of areas, achieved through a process designed to expedite outstanding tax matters, these items are no longer an area of significant judgement and there is no such range related to ongoing uncertain tax items.
The Group has a small number of ongoing uncertain tax items related to capital allowances for expenditure incurred in the normal course of business, where the Group has paid in full the tax HMRC interpret as due, and therefore would receive up to 20 million 2015 16 70 million should these tax items be concluded in the Groups favour.
Service concession arrangements Consideration from public sector entities for the operation of waste management service concessions is treated as contract receivables or other intangible assets, depending upon the right to receive cash from the asset.
At the balance sheet date the Group recognised contract receivables of 217.6 million 2016 201.9 million and other intangible assets of 61.3 million 2016 55.0 million in relation to its service concession arrangements.
Consideration relating to contract receivables is split between profit on the construction of assets, operation of the service and provision of finance recognised as interest receivable.
Managements judgement is used in the allocation between these three elements, this assessment reflects external market conditions according to the type of service provided and project specific cash flow expectations, including the recovery of costs from the original contractor on our Glasgow concession.
Revenue recognition The Group recognises revenue at the time of delivery of services.
Payments received in advance of services delivered are recorded as liabilities.
South West Water raises bills and recognises revenue in accordance with its entitlement to receive revenue in line with the limits established by the Periodic Review price-setting process.
For water and wastewater customers with water meters, revenue recognised is dependent upon the volume supplied including an estimate of the sales value of units supplied between the date of the last meter reading and the year-end.
Estimated usage is based on historic data, judgement and assumptions.
The accrued income balance in this area at the balance sheet date was 77.7 million 2016 67.8 million.
Viridor estimates income from certain contractual revenue streams based on tonnages, cost and historic data which are dependent on agreement with the customer after the delivery of the service.
Revenue is accrued from the sale of electricity from our generating assets based upon metered output delivered at rates specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates as applicable.
The total accrued income balance in relation to these areas at the balance sheet date was 42.8 million 2016 37.8 million.
Provision for doubtful debts At the balance sheet date each subsidiary evaluates the collectability of trade receivables and records provisions for doubtful debts based on experience including comparisons of the relative age of accounts and consideration of actual write-off history.
The actual level of debt collected may differ from the estimated levels of recovery.
As at 31 March 2017 the Groups current trade receivables were 321.6 million 2016 303.6 million, against which 98.1 million 2016 95.6 million had been provided for impairment note 22.
Judgements Impairment of non-financial assets In order to determine whether impairments, or reversals of previous impairments, are required for non-financial assets, the Group assesses whether there are any indicators for further impairment or reversal during the year.
The assessment includes a review of changes in markets and discount rates over the year, together with a review of CGU business performance against expectations.
The 2016 17 review concluded there were no indicators of further impairment or reversal.
Non-underlying items In establishing which items are disclosed separately as non-underlying, to enable a full understanding of the Groups financial performance, the Directors exercise their judgement in assessing the size, nature or incidence of specific items.
See note 6 for further details.

The 10.7 million charge consists of a 9.5 million non-cash charge to other operating expenses relating to a rationalisation of systems leading to an asset fide-recognition, and a 1.1 million charge to manpower costs and a 0.1 million charge to other operating costs in relation to restructuring provisions.
The charge is considered non-underlying due to its size and non-recurring nature.
Last year a one-off charge of 10.2 million was made to the restructuring provision reflecting announced reorganisations across the Group.
b In the year a credit of 16.0 million was recognised relating to non-cash derivative fair value movements associated with derivatives that are not designated as being party to an accounting hedge relationship.
These movements are non-underlying due to the nature of the item being market dependant and potentially can be significant in value size.
c Since 2011 the Group has received a fixed interest rate on a 200 million financial asset and paid an index-linked interest rate on a 200 million loan, designed to improve the Groups overall interest rate performance.
The counterparty to both instruments was Peninsula MB Limited PMB.
In combination, these instruments were accounted for as a derivative, with a net interest income of 8 million p. a. c7 million in 2016 17, cash settled.
In periods of index underperformance, losses arose in PMB which were group relieved with the Group.
Following a change in legislation, which saw the value of the derivative to the Group moving from a liability of 4 million to a liability of c. 40 million, the Group made the decision to exit the transaction.
On 10 February 2017 the Company unwound this transaction.
The derivative had been due to end in 2027, however, following a change in the economic benefit of this derivative due to a change in legislation which impacted the derivatives future cash flows, the Company exercised its option to unwind the transaction early.
The process for unwinding the derivative resulted in the Group acquiring a financial asset for 283 million and a financial liability for 239 million from Nomura Structured Holdings plc.
The counterparty to both these transactions was PMB.
Simultaneously, the Company also acquired the remaining 25% of PMBs share capital from Nomura Structured Holdings plc, for a consideration of 36,000, with all PMBs liabilities being due to the Company from that point.
The Company has since settled these liabilities through intercompany transactions with PMB.
PMB has ceased all operating activities and will be liquidated in due course.
The net consideration due to Nomura Structured Holdings plc in respect of these transactions is 44 million with an agreed payment date of June 2018.
The impact for the Group is a net cost of 35 million post tax.
PMB is a private limited company, incorporated in England and Wales on 5 December 2011 as a subsidiary of Nomura Structured Holdings plc, part of the Nomura Group.
Prior to the transaction on 10 February 2017, PMBs share capital was 75% owned by the Company and 25% owned by Nomura Structured Holdings plc, who had control of PMB for accounting purposes.
The group relief claimed by the Group has been treated as an uncertain tax item and has been substantially provided for over recent years.
Followingthe conclusion of discussions with HMRC, no further amounts are required to be recognised by the Group.
A tax credit of 8 million relates to the overall cost to unwind this derivative transaction.
Post the unwind of the transaction the Groups interest will no longer include the c8 million p. a. income, c7 million in 2016 17, and the underlying tax charge will reduce by a similar amount.
The liability recognised is non-underlying by its size and nature.
d Following the enactment during the year the rate of corporation tax reduced from 18% to 17% from April 2020, resulting in a one-off credit of 21.3 million being recognised in the income statement.
In addition a charge of 1.7 million has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and a credit of 0.1 million was recognised directly in equity.
Last year the rate of corporation tax reduced from 20% to 19% from April 2017, reducing further to 18% from April 2020, resulting in a one-off credit of 33.1 million recognised in the income statement.
In addition, a charge of 3.8 million was recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and a charge of 0.1 million was recognised directly in equity.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust note 36, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to include all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two types of dilutive potential ordinary shares those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year: and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups Performance and Co-investment Plan and the deferred shares element of the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan, to the extent that the performance criteria for vesting of the awards are expected to be met.
The weighted average number of shares and earnings used in the calculations were: 2017 2016 Number of shares millions For basic earnings per share 413.0 410.9 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares from share options 1.9 1.8 For diluted earnings per share 414.9 412.7 Basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share Earnings per ordinary share before non-underlying items and deferred tax are presented as the Directors believe that this measure provides a more useful comparison on business trends and performance, since deferred tax reflects distortive effects of changes in corporation tax rates and the level of long-term capital investment.

Goodwill m Cost: At 1 April 2015 339.3 Recognised on acquisition of subsidiaries 45.7 At 31 March 2016 385.0 At 31 March 2017 385.0 Carrying amount: At 1 April 2015 339.3 At 31 March 2016 385.0 At 31 March 2017 385.0 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the cash generating unit CGU expected to benefit from that business combination.
342.7 million of the goodwill balance is allocated to the waste management business, with the remaining 42.3 million allocated to the water business, representing the lowest levels at which goodwill is monitored and tested.
The acquisition of Peninsula MB Limited, as detailed in note 6, did not give rise to the recognition of goodwill.
Impairment testing of goodwill The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that impairment may have arisen.
The recoverable amount of the water business segment, for which goodwill was recognised on acquisition of Bournemouth Water in 2016, is assessed using level 2 fair value hierarchy techniques, with reference to the market value of the merged water business, using a market based observable premium to Regulated Capital Value.
The recoverable amount of the waste management segment, to which the majority of goodwill is allocated, is determined based on value-in-use calculations which, under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, require the use of base cash flow projections that reflect reasonable and supportable assumptions with specific restrictions on the estimates to be used.
These include limitations on reflecting cash flows to take account of future cost restructuring, or improvement or enhancement of asset performance.
Discount rates are required to be derived independently of the Groups capital structure and those used reflect managements prudent estimate of a rate that investors would require if they were to choose a similar investment ranging from 6-9% across the CGUs business activities.
The base cash flow projections have been derived from the Groups detailed budget and strategic plan projections.
These cover a period of seven years and are prepared as part of the annual planning cycle.
This period is believed to lead to a more realistic estimate of future cash flows than five years.
Long-term growth rates of 3%, based on forecast of growth in waste management markets and the UK economy, are applied to cash flows beyond the seven year period, with overheads expected to grow at 1% based on ongoing efficiency expectations of 2% per annum.
These plans are based on detailed market-by-market forecasts of projected volumes, prices and costs for each business activity.
These forecasts reflect, on an individual operational site basis, numerous assumptions and estimates.
The key assumptions include anticipated changes in market size and volumes: recyclate prices: energy selling prices: gate fees: the level of future landfill tax: and cost inflation.
Management has determined the value assigned to each assumption based on historical experience, market surveys, industry analysis and current legislation.
For business activities with an indefinite life a terminal growth rate has been used.
The results of tests performed during the year demonstrate significant headroom in all CGUs, and it is judged that no reasonable change in the key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed the recoverable amount.

The ineffective portion recognised in the income statement arising from hedging relationships was nil 2016 nil.
During the year a 10.8 million charge 2016 7.9 million was recognised in profit and loss relating to cash flow hedges previously recognised through other comprehensive income and recorded in the hedging reserve.
Interest rate swaps, primarily cash flow hedges, and fixed rate borrowings are used to manage the mix of fixed and floating rates to ensure at least 50% of Group net borrowings are at fixed rate.
At 31 March 2017 69% of Group net borrowings were at fixed rate 2016 67%.
At 31 March 2017 the Group had interest rate swaps to swap from floating to fixed rate and hedge financial liabilities with a notional value of 1,078.0 million and a weighted average maturity of 2.9 years 2016 1,078.0 million, with 3.9 years.
The weighted average interest rate of the swaps for their nominal amount was 2.0% 2016 2.0%.
Derivatives deemed held for trading at 31 March 2016 included a derivative with a fair value of 4.2 million which did not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39, but was designed to improve the Groups overall interest rate performance.
During the year this derivative position was unwound as set out in note 6.
The periods for which cash flow hedges are expected to affect future profit or loss are as follows: Due within Due between Due between Due over 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years Total m m m m m Group 31 March 2017 Assets 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.1 1.3 Liabilities 16.0 12.1 11.3 0.6 40.0 31 March 2016 Liabilities 14.4 10.8 20.7 0.5 46.4 Company 31 March 2017 Assets 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.1 1.3 Liabilities 2.1 1.3 3.4 31 March 2016 Liabilities 2.7 1.9 2.7 0.2 7.5 In addition, the Group has cash flow hedges that are expected to affect future amounts recognised in property, plant and equipment, amounting to assets of 4.9 million 2016 2.9 million.
146 Valuation hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
The fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market level 2, for example over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
The Groups financial instruments are valued principally using level 2 measures: Group Company 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m m m Assets Derivatives used for cash flow hedging 6.2 3.4 1.3 Derivatives used for fair value hedging 2.8 1.8 2.9 1.8 Derivatives not in a hedge accounting relationship 78.7 67.0 Total assets 87.7 72.2 4.2 1.8 Liabilities Derivatives used for cash flow hedging 40.0 46.9 3.4 7.5 Derivatives not in a hedge accounting relationship 2.5 4.8 Total liabilities 42.5 51.7 3.4 7.5 Financial instruments valued using level 3 measures are valued by the counterparty using cash flows discounted at prevailing mid-market rates.

Retirement benefit obligations During the year the Group operated a number of defined benefit pension schemes and also a defined contribution section within the main scheme.
The principal plan within the Group is the Pennon Group Pension Scheme, which is a funded defined benefit, final salary pension scheme in the UK.
The Groups pension schemes are established under trust law and comply with all relevant UK legislation.
The assets of the Groups pension schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The trustees of the funds are required to act in the best interest of the funds beneficiaries.
The appointment of schemes trustees is determined by the schemes trust documentation.
The Group has a policy for the main fund that one-half of all trustees, other than the Chairman, are nominated by members of the schemes, including pensioners.
Defined contribution schemes Pension costs for defined contribution schemes were 5.3 million 2016 7.5 million.
Defined benefit schemes Assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions at 31 March were: 2017 2016 2015 % % % Rate of increase in pensionable pay 3.2 2.9 2.9 Rate of increase for current and future pensions 2.0 2.9 2.9 Rate used to discount schemes liabilities and expected return on schemes assets 2.55 3.30 3.35 Inflation 3.2 2.9 2.9 Mortality Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics and experience.
The average life expectancy in years of a member having retired at age 62 on the balance sheet date is projected as: 2017 2016 2015 Male 24.8 25.1 25.0 Female 27.2 27.3 27.2 The average life expectancy in years of a future pensioner retiring at age 62, 20 years after the balance sheet date, is projected as: 2017 2016 2015 Male 26.2 26.5 26.4 Female 29.5 29.6 29.5 The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the schemes liabilities are: Impact on Change in schemes assumption liabilities Rate of increase in pensionable pay 0.5% 0.6% Rate of increase in current and future pensions 0.5% 6.2% Rate used to discount schemes liabilities 0.5% 9.3% Inflation 0.5% 6.4% Life expectancy 1 year 4.5% The sensitivity analysis shows the effect of changes in the principal assumptions used for the measurement of the pension liability.
The method used to calculate the sensitivities is approximate and has been determined taking into account the duration of the liabilities and the overall profile of each schemes membership.
This is the same approach as has been adopted in previous years.

The schemes hold a significant proportion of growth assets equities and diversified growth funds which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term, but can give rise to volatility and risk in the short-term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored such that it is suitable with the schemes long-term objectives.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the schemes liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk The majority of the schemes benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
In conjunction with its investment advisers, the trustees have structured the schemes investments with the objective of balancing investment returns and levels of risk.
The asset allocation for the main scheme has three principal elements: holding of cash funds and bonds which are expected to be less volatile than most other asset classes and reflects market movements in the schemes liabilities a proportion of equities, with fund managers having freedom in making investment decisions to maximise returns investment of a proportion of the schemes assets in alternative asset classes which give the potential for diversification currently property and diversified growth.
The liabilities of the defined benefit schemes are measured by using the projected unit credit method which is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected increases in pensionable pay.
The future cash flows arising from the payment of the defined benefits are expected to be settled primarily in the period between 15 and 40 years from the balance sheet date.
The 2016 triennial actuarial valuation of the principal defined benefit scheme has been agreed, with the actuarial valuation deficit and schedule of contributions being in line with the 2013 triennial actuarial valuation, requiring deficit recovery contributions of c. 12 million per annum from 2019 to 2022.
The Group has made a deficit recovery contribution of 0.5 million to the main scheme during the year 2016 23.7 million.
The Group monitors funding levels on an annual basis and expects to pay total contributions of around 10 million during the year ended 31 March 2018.
