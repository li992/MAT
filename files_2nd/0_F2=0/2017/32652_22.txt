Segmental Analysis The Groups operating segments are determined based on the Groups internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM has been determined to be the Group Chief Executive, with support from the Board.
The performance of operating segments is assessed on profits before interest and tax, excluding equity-settled share option charges recognised under IFRS 2 Share-based payment and unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses on derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
The activities, products and services of the operating segments are detailed in the Strategic Report on page 26.
The Property Management segment holds properties and property leases which are sublet to other segments and external parties.
The NEXT International Retail segment comprises franchise and wholly owned stores overseas.
International online sales are included in the NEXT Directory segment.
Where third-party branded goods are sold on a commission basis, only the commission receivable is included in statutory revenue.
Total sales represents the amount payable by the customer, excluding VAT.
As the prior year was a 53 week period, to aid comparability the 52 week equivalent sales and profit figures are also shown.

Taxation Tax charge for the year Our tax charge for the year is shown below.
Tax is made up of current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the amount payable on the taxable income in the year and any adjustments to tax payable in previous years.
Deferred tax is explained on page 113.

Taxation continued The deferred tax movement in the year is as follows: 2017 2016 m m At the beginning of the year 2.7 13.3 Recognised in the income statement: Accelerated capital allowances 0.7 2.8 Revaluation of derivatives to fair value 0.1 1.2 Pension benefit obligations 1.7 0.3 Share-based payments 2.1 0.8 Other temporary differences 5.4 1.5 Recognised in other comprehensive income 2.2 1.5 Recognised in the statement of changes in equity 12.8 14.1 At the end of the year 5.7 2.7 There has been a reduction in the deferred tax asset for share-based payments due to a reduction in the Companys share price during the year.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
No recognition has been made of the following deferred tax assets: Unrecognised Unrecognised Gross value deferred tax Gross value deferred tax 2017 2017 2016 2016 m m m m Capital losses 34.5 5.8 42.6 8.5 The benefit of unrecognised capital losses will only accrue if taxable profits are realised on future disposals of the Groups capital assets.
Factors affecting tax charges in future years Changes to the UK corporation tax rates were substantively enacted as part of the Finance Bill 2016 on 6 September 2016.
These include reductions to the main rate of corporation tax to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 17% from 1 April 2020.
Deferred taxes at the balance sheet date have been measured using these enacted tax rates and reflected in these financial statements.
The Groups effective tax rate is forecast to remain broadly in line with UK corporation tax rates.
Provisions, which are immaterial to the accounts, have been recognised in relation to uncertain tax positions.
These relate to the interpretation of tax legislation, including changes arising from the OECDs Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, that impact our NEXT Sourcing operation in its ordinary course of business.
Any uncertainty is likely to lessen as the business responds to these rule changes.
NEXT seeks to manage its tax affairs responsibly and proactively to comply with tax legislation.
We seek to build solid and working relationships with all tax authorities.

The liability of 88.3m was recorded in the January 2016 balance sheet on the basis that it could not realistically have been cancelled after the ex-dividend date, and was paid on 1 February 2016.
It is intended that this years ordinary final dividend of 105p per share will be paid to shareholders on 1 August 2017.
NEXT plc shares will trade ex-dividend from 6 July 2017 and the record date will be 7 July 2017.
The estimated amount payable is 149.8m.
The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
The Trustee of the ESOT has waived dividends paid in the year on shares held by the ESOT.
Earnings Per Share 2017 2016 Basic Earnings Per Share Total 52 weeks v 53 weeks 441.3p 450.5p Underlying 52 weeks v 52 weeks 441.3p 442.5p Basic Earnings Per Share is based on the profit for the year attributable to the equity holders of the Parent Company divided by the net of the weighted average number of shares ranking for dividend less the weighted average number of shares held by the ESOT during the period.
2017 2016 Diluted Earnings Per Share Total 52 weeks v 53 weeks 438.1p 443.0p Underlying 52 weeks v 52 weeks 438.1p 435.1p Diluted Earnings Per Share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares used for the calculation of basic Earnings Per Share as increased by the dilutive effect of potential ordinary shares.
Dilutive shares arise from employee share option schemes where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the period.
Their dilutive effect is calculated on the basis of the equivalent number of nil cost options.
Where the option price is above the average market price, the option is not dilutive and is excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.
There were 2,578,878 non-dilutive share options in the current year 2016: nil.

Underlying fully diluted Earnings Per Share is used for the purposes of the Share Matching Plan, described further in the Remuneration Report.
The table below shows the key variables used in the Earnings Per Share calculations: 2017 2016 m m Profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company 635.3 666.8 Less 53rd week profit in current year post-tax 11.8 52 week underlying profit for underlying EPS 635.3 655.0 Weighted average number of shares millions Weighted average shares in issue 148.4 152.7 Weighted average shares held by ESOT 4.4 4.7 Weighted average shares for basic EPS 144.0 148.0 Weighted average dilutive potential shares 1.0 2.5 Weighted average shares for diluted EPS 145.0 150.5 Weighted average shares for basic EPS 144.0 148.0 Weighted average total share options outstanding 5.1 5.5 Weighted average shares for fully diluted EPS 149.1 153.5 As detailed in the Remuneration Report, the annual bonus for executive directors is determined by reference to underlying pre-tax Earnings Per Share of 548.9p 2016: 554.8p.
This is calculated using 52 week underlying pre-tax profit of 790.2m 2016: 821.3m as shown in Note 1 divided by the net of the weighted average number of shares in issue less the weighted average number of shares held by the ESOT during the period.

As this exceeded carrying value for each of the cash generating units concerned, no impairment loss was recognised 2016: nil.
NEXT Sourcing The key assumptions in testing the goodwill for impairment are the future sourcing requirements of the Group and the ability of NEXT Sourcing to meet these requirements based on past experience.
In assessing value in use, budgets for the next year were used and extrapolated for four further years with no subsequent growth assumed and discounted at 10% 2016: 10%.
Lipsy In assessing the recoverable amount of goodwill, internal budgets for next year were used and extrapolated for nine further years using a growth rate of 2% 2016: 2% and discounted at 12% 2016: 12%.
For both NEXT Sourcing and Lipsy, the calculated value in use significantly exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill.
Therefore, there is no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions that would give rise to an impairment.

Pension Benefits The Group operates three pension arrangements in the UK: the Next Group Pension Plan the Original Plan, the 2013 Next Group Pension Plan the 2013 Plan and the Next Supplementary Pension Arrangement the SPA.
The Groups UK pension arrangements include defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The Original Plan and 2013 Plan are established under trust law and comply with all relevant UK legislation.
Pension assets are held in separate trustee administered funds which have equal pension rights with respect to members of either sex in so far as this is required by current legislation.
The Group also provides additional retirement benefits through the SPA to some plan members whose benefits would otherwise be affected by the lifetime allowance.
The defined benefit section was closed to new members in 2000 and over recent years the Group has taken steps to manage the ongoing risks associated with its defined benefit liabilities.
The Original Plan comprises predominantly members with pensions in payment, following the transfer of active and deferred members and associated liabilities to the 2013 Plan.
The risks associated with the payment of pensions of the Original Plan have been largely mitigated by the purchase of two insurance contracts buy-ins with Aviva in 2010 and 2012 to cover the liabilities of this Plan, although it remains the ultimate responsibility of the Company to provide members with benefits.
The pensions and matching insurance contracts held by the Original Plan are being converted to buy-out and the Original Plan will then be dissolved.
The 2013 Plan was established in 2013 via the transfer of liabilities and assets from the Original Plan.
This arrangement provides benefits to the majority of members whose pensions were not insured with Aviva.
From November 2012, the future accrual of benefits for remaining active employee members has been based on pensionable earnings frozen at that time, rather than final earnings.
Further information on the Groups pension arrangements is given in the Remuneration Report on pages 76 and 77.
Principal risks The following table summarises the principal risks associated with the Groups defined benefit arrangements: Investment risk The present value of defined benefit liabilities is calculated using a discount rate set by reference to high quality corporate bond yields.
If plan assets underperform corporate bonds, this will create a deficit.
The strategic allocation of assets in the 2013 Plan is currently weighted towards equity and property assets as its liability profile is relatively immature and it is expected that these asset classes will, over the long term, outperform gilts and corporate bonds.
Interest rate risk A fall in bond yields would increase the value of the liabilities.
This would be only partially offset by an increase in the value of bond investments held.
Inflation risk Pensions in payment are increased annually in line with RPI or CPI for Guaranteed Minimum Pensions built up since 1988.
Pensions built up since 2005 are capped at 2.5% and pensions built up between 1997 and 2005 are capped at 5%.
When discretionary increases have been awarded for pensions built up before 1997, they too have tended to reflect RPI, capped at 2.5%.
Therefore an increase in inflation would increase the value of pension liabilities.
The assets would be expected to also increase, to the extent that they are linked to inflation, but this would not be expected to fully match the increase in liabilities.
Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit liabilities is calculated having regards to a best estimate of the mortality of plan members.
If members live longer than this mortality assumption, this will increase the liabilities.
The buy-in insurance contracts represent over 99% of the Original Plan pension liabilities and 18% of the total pension liabilities.
This provides a partial hedge to the total risks described above.
Derivatives are not used to hedge any of the risks noted above.

The fair values of the above equity and debt instruments are determined based on quoted prices in active markets.
The property assets relate to investments in property funds and their fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets.
The majority of the benefits within the Original Plan are covered by two insurance contracts with Aviva.
The insurance assets have been valued so as to match the defined benefit obligations, the value of which was calculated by Aviva.
Principal assumptions The IAS 19 accounting valuation of the defined benefit obligation was undertaken by an external qualified actuary as at January 2017 using the projected unit credit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in the valuation were as follows: 2017 2016 Original 2013 and Original 2013 and Plan SPA Plan SPA Discount rate 2.65% 2.80% 3.40% 3.65% Inflation RPI 3.60% 3.40% 3.05% 3.05% Inflation CPI 2.60% 2.40% 2.05% 2.05% Salary increases Pension increases in payment RPI with a maximum of 5% 3.25% 3.10% 3.05% 3.05% RPI with a maximum of 2.5% and discretionary increases 2.10% 2.00% 2.50% 2.50% 2017 2016 NonNonPensioner pensioner Pensioner pensioner aged 65 aged 45 aged 65 aged 45 Life expectancy at age 65 years Male 22.9 23.3 22.8 25.0 Female 25.3 25.8 25.2 27.5 The discount rate has been derived as the single average discount rate appropriate to the term of the liabilities, based on the yields available on high quality Sterling corporate bonds.
The expected average duration of the Original Plans liabilities is 13 years and for the SPA and 2013 Plans it is 26 years.
n e x t p l c. c o. u k 125 slugline Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 18.
Pension Benefits continued The rate of retail price inflation RPI has been derived in a consistent way to the discount rate, so that it is appropriate to the term of the liabilities.
As in previous years, the RPI assumption for the 2013 and SPA allow for the inflation risk premium of 0.2% whereas that for the Original Plan does not, because its assets and liabilities are almost fully matched.
The rate of consumer price inflation CPI is set at 1.0% lower than the assumption for retail price inflation, reflecting the long term expected gap between the two indices.
In 2017, the approach to setting the assumptions for pension increases in payment has been revised to take account of future inflation volatility and how this is likely to interact with the caps of 2.5% and 5% that apply to different tranches of pension.
This results in lower pension increase assumptions and a reduction in the defined benefit obligation of approximately 40m, but no direct impact on the income statement.
For the 2013 Plan and the SPA, the mortality assumptions reflect the best estimate output from a postcode mortality study and the most recent 2015 Core Projection model for future improvements published by the CMI Mortality Projections Committee.
Post retirement mortality is therefore assumed to follow the standard SAPS Series 2 All Pensioner tables with a multiplier of 95% for males and 92% for females with improvements based on the CMI 2015 Core Projection model with a long term trend towards 1.5% pa from 2007.
The mortality assumption for the Original Plan is in line with the standard SAPS Series 1 All Pensioner tables with medium cohort improvements to 2009 and CMI 2013 improvements with a long term trend towards 1.5% per annum from 2009.
Future improvements from 2016 have been allowed for in line with the most recent CMI 2015 core projections model, with a long term trend towards 1.5%.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity of the net pension asset to changes in the principal assumptions is: Impact on net pension asset as at 28 January Sensitivity analysis 2017 Discount rate 0.5% decrease 86.5m decrease Price inflation 0.5% increase to RPI and CPI 47.5m decrease Price inflation 0.1% decrease to CPI i. e. increase in the gap between RPI and CPI 4.3m increase Mortality CMI 2014 improvements instead of CMI 2015 from 2016 2.7m decrease The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Aside from the matching insurance contracts held in the Original Plan, no allowance has been made for any change in assets that might arise under any of the scenarios set out above.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant assumptions, the same method has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the consolidated balance sheet.
The sensitivities shown are just one possible outcome and should not be taken as an indication of the likelihood of a change occurring in the future.
Economic markets have been particularly volatile in recent months and market metrics used to derive the discount rate and price inflation assumptions could increase or decrease in the future, by more or less than the change set out.
Pension Benefits continued Full actuarial valuation The latest full actuarial valuation of the 2013 Plan was undertaken as at 30 September 2016 by Willis Towers Watson who act as Actuary to the Trustees.
The valuation showed a funding deficit on the Technical Provisions basis required by legislation of 70.2m at that date.
The Group has agreed a recovery plan to meet the technical deficit, which is intended to restore the scheme assets to a fully funded position on a Technical Provisions basis by 30 September 2021.
Under that agreement, the Group will contribute five annual payments of up to 14.0m by 31 January each year.
The first payment of 14.0m under this agreement was made in January 2017 and future contributions will only be required to be paid to the extent that there is a funding deficit at the preceding 31 December.
At the Companys year end date the 2013 Plan was estimated to be fully funded on a Technical Provisions basis with a surplus in the region of 5m.
With effect from January 2018, the Company has also agreed to pay contributions of 31.3% pa of members frozen pensionable salaries as at 31 October 2012 towards the future accrual of benefits for active members, an increase from 17.5% pa.
Contributions Members of the defined benefit section of the 2013 Plan contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings.
With effect from January 2018, employer contributions will increase from 17.5% pa to 31.3% c6m to c8m pa. Members of the defined contribution section contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings which is matched by the Group.
Contributions paid by the Group are set out below: 2017 2016 m m Defined contribution recognised as an expense 10.8 10.0 Automatic enrolment recognised as an expense 1.8 1.6 Defined benefit 27.2 7.3 39.8 18.9 The 27.2m paid into the defined benefit section of the 2013 Plan in 2017 included an additional contribution of 14m paid in respect of the recovery plan agreed with the Trustees following the September 2016 full actuarial valuation and a prepayment of contributions of 6m for the cost of future accrual in the year to January 2018.
Employer contributions for the defined contribution and automatic enrolment schemes are expected to be similar in the year ahead.
Employer contributions to the defined benefit section in the year ahead are expected to be around 23m assuming a contribution of 14m is paid in January 2018, although in practice this is contingent on there being a deficit on a funding Technical Provisions basis at this time refer to details in the Full actuarial valuation section above.

Share-based Payments The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes as follows: Management share options The NEXT Management Share Option Plan provides for options over shares, exercisable between three and ten years following their grant, to be allocated to Group employees at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
This plan is primarily aimed at middle management and senior store staff.
No options were granted to any directors or changes made to existing entitlements in the year under review.
No employee is entitled to be granted options under the scheme if, in the same financial year, they have received an award under NEXTs LTIP or SMP.
The total number of options which can be granted is subject to limits.
There are no cash settlement alternatives and they are therefore accounted for under IFRS 2 as equity-settled awards.
Option prices are set at the prevailing market price at the time of grant.
The maximum total market value of shares i. e. the acquisition price of shares over which options may be granted to any person during any financial year of the Company is three times salary, excluding bonuses and benefits in kind.
This limit may be increased to five times salary in circumstances considered by the Committee to be exceptional, for example on the grant of options following recruitment.
Grants are generally made annually.
Sharesave options The Companys Save As You Earn Sharesave scheme is open to all UK employees.
Invitations to participate are generally issued annually and the scheme is subject to HMRC rules.
The current maximum monthly savings for the schemes detailed below is 250.
Options are granted at the prevailing market rate less a discount of 20% and are exercisable three or five years from the date of grant.
A similar Sharesave scheme is open to the Companys Eire employees.
Sharesave options are also accounted for as equity-settled awards under IFRS 2.

The SMP is an equity-settled scheme.
Prior to January 2014, all LTIP awards were accounted for as cashsettled share-based payments.
From January 2014 onwards, new LTIP grants to executive directors will be settled in shares with no cash settlement alternative.
Those awards are therefore accounted for under IFRS 2 as equity-settled.
Awards to other senior executives and legacy awards to executive directors will continue to be treated as cash-settled.
From January 2014, executive directors are no longer granted SMP awards.
Performance conditions for SMP and LTIP awards are detailed in the Remuneration Report.

Share-based Payments continued Fair value calculations The fair value of Management, Sharesave and SMP options granted is calculated at the date of grant using a BlackScholes option pricing model.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the option.
The expected life applied in the model is based on historical analyses of exercise patterns, taking into account any early exercises.

Financial Instruments: Risk Management and Hedging Activities NEXT operates a centralised treasury function which is responsible for managing the liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks associated with the Groups activities.
As part of its strategy for the management of these risks, the Group uses derivative financial instruments.
In accordance with the Groups treasury policy, derivative instruments are not entered into for speculative purposes.
Treasury policy is reviewed and approved by the Board and specifies the parameters within which treasury operations must be conducted, including authorised counterparties, instrument types and transaction limits, and principles governing the management of liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, are cash and short term deposits, bank overdrafts and loans, and corporate bonds.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
In addition, the Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables arising directly from its operations.

Financial Instruments: Risk Management and Hedging Activities continued Liquidity risk The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirements centrally to minimise net interest expense within risk parameters agreed by the Board, whilst ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of its businesses.
The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored to ensure that adequate headroom remains under committed borrowing facilities.

Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate corporate bonds and cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.
The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored regularly to assess the mix of fixed and variable rate debt, and the Group uses interest rate derivatives where appropriate to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates and the economic environment.

Financial Instruments: Risk Management and Hedging Activities continued Interest rates: fair value hedges The Group has interest rate swap agreements in place as fair value hedges of part of the interest rate risk associated with the corporate bonds.
Under the terms of the swaps, which have the same key features as the bonds, the Group receives a fixed rate of interest equivalent to the relevant coupon rate, and pays a variable rate.
Details of the effective rates payable are given in Note 17.
The fair values of the Groups interest rate swaps, including accrued interest, are as follows: 2017 2016 m m Derivatives in designated fair value hedging relationships 40.8 44.8 The fair values of derivatives have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and are based on market prices at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency risk The Groups principal foreign currency exposures arise from the purchase of overseas sourced products.
Group policy allows for these exposures to be hedged for up to 24 months ahead in order to fix the cost in Sterling.
This hedging activity involves, the use of spot, forward and option contracts.
The market value of outstanding foreign exchange contracts is reported regularly at Board level, and reviewed in conjunction with percentage cover taken by season and current market conditions in order to assess and manage the Groups ongoing exposure.
The Group does not have a material exposure to currency movements in relation to the translation of overseas investments and consequently does not hedge any such exposure.
The Groups net exposure to foreign currencies, taking hedging activities into account, is illustrated by the sensitivity analysis in Note 27.

Financial Instruments: Risk Management and Hedging Activities continued Credit risk Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative instruments are made through banks and companies which must fulfil credit rating and investment criteria approved by the Board.
Concentrations of risk are mitigated by the use of various counterparties at any one time.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the Directory customer base being large and diverse.
The Groups outstanding receivables balances are detailed in Note 11.
Capital risk The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, as analysed in Note 28, and equity attributable to the equity holders of the Parent Company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The Group manages its capital with the objective that all entities within the Group continue as going concerns while maintaining an efficient structure to minimise the cost of capital.
The Group is not restricted by any externally imposed capital requirements.
As part of its strategy for delivering sustainable long term growth in Earnings Per Share, the Group has been returning capital to shareholders by way of share buybacks in addition to dividends including special dividends.
Share buybacks may be transacted through both on-market purchases and contingent contracts for off-market share purchases.

Financial Instruments: Fair Values The fair values of each category of the Groups financial instruments are the same as their carrying values in the Groups balance sheet, other than as noted below: 2017 2016 Carrying Carrying amount Fair value amount Fair value m m m m Corporate bonds In hedging relationships 463.5 478.5 516.2 533.9 Not in hedging relationships 450.0 481.3 312.6 345.4 913.5 959.8 828.8 879.3 Corporate bonds are held at amortised cost adjusted for the effect of the change in fair value hedge.
The fair values of corporate bonds are their market values at the balance sheet date IFRS 13 Level 1 reflecting quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Market values include accrued interest and changes in credit risk and interest rate risk, and are therefore different to the reported carrying amounts.
Financial Instruments: Sensitivity Analysis Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Groups principal foreign currency exposures are to US Dollars and the Euro.
The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and closing equity to a 10% increase and decrease in the US Dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates at the year end date, assuming all other variables remain unchanged.
The sensitivity rate of 10% represents the directors assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historic volatility.
The analysis assumes that exchange rate fluctuations on currency derivatives that form part of an effective cash flow hedge relationship affect the fair value reserve in equity and the fair value of the hedging derivatives.
For foreign exchange derivatives which are not designated hedges, movements in exchange rates impact the income statement.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.
Income statement Equity 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m m m Sterling strengthens by 10% US Dollar 3.6 2.8 64.2 41.9 Euro 2.2 3.1 Sterling weakens by 10% US Dollar 0.4 5.6 73.0 51.6 Euro 2.7 3.8 Year end exchange rates applied in the above analysis are US Dollar 1.25 2016: 1.42 and Euro 1.17 2016: 1.31.
Strengthening and weakening of Sterling may not produce symmetrical results depending on the proportion and nature of foreign exchange derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Financial Instruments: Sensitivity Analysis continued Interest rate sensitivity analysis The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and closing equity to a 0.5% increase or decrease in interest rates, assuming all other variables were unchanged.
The sensitivity rate of 0.5% represents the directors assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historic volatility.
The analysis has been prepared using the following assumptions: For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of the asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to have been outstanding for the whole year.
Fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.

Related Party Transactions During the year to January 2016, the directors became aware that certain dividends paid in 2014 and 2015 totalling 311.2m had been made otherwise than in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 because interim accounts had not been filed at Companies House prior to payment.
At a General Meeting of the Companys shareholders held on 10 February 2016, a resolution was passed which authorised the appropriation of distributable profits to the payment of the relevant dividends and removed any right for the Company to pursue shareholders or directors for repayment.
This constituted a related party transaction under IAS 24 Related party disclosures.
The overall effect of the resolution being passed was to return all parties to the position they would have been in had the relevant dividends been made in full compliance with the Act.
During the year the Group sold goods and services in the normal course of business to its associate undertaking, Choice Discount Stores Limited, as follows: 2017 2016 m m Sales 8.6 7.7 Trade receivables 0.4 0.7 The Groups other related party transactions were the remuneration of key management personnel refer to Note 4.
