For the 2016 allocations, the minimum release of 15% of the allocation is subject to achieving underlying earnings per share uEPS growth of 4% compound per annum over the three year period and the full release is subject to uEPS growing by at least 10% compound per annum.
For the 2015 allocations, the minimum release of 15% is subject to achieving uEPS growth of 6% compound per annum and the full release is subject to uEPS growing by at least 12% compound per annum.
For allocations prior to 2015, the minimum release of 15% is subject to achieving uEPS growth of 6% compound per annum and the full release is subject to uEPS growing by at least 15% compound per annum.
The number of allocated shares released will vary on a straight line basis between these points.
Allocations will lapse if the uEPS growth is less than the minimum.
Allocations in 2014 onwards to the executive directors only are also subject to a deferred release whereby a third is released on the third anniversary of the allocation date and the remaining vested shares are released in equal instalments on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the allocation date: plus the Remuneration Committee is entitled to claw back the allocations in cases of misstatement or misconduct.
