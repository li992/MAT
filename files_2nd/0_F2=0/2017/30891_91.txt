Financial assets All financial assets held by the company are classified as loans and receivables.
Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, receivables and other investments.
The company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Financial assets are recognized initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price plus directly attributable transaction costs.
The company derecognizes financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire or the financial asset is transferred to a third party.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognized in income when the loans and receivables are derecognized or impaired, and when interest is recognized using the effective interest method.
This category of financial assets includes trade and other receivables.
Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Financial liabilities All financial liabilities held by the company are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortized cost.
Financial liabilities include other payables, accruals, and most items of finance debt.
The company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost All financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs.
For interest-bearing loans and borrowings this is the fair value of the proceeds received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.
After initial recognition, financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognized in interest and other income and finance costs respectively.
This category of financial liabilities includes trade and other payables and finance debt.
