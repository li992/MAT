Transfers between hierarchy levels There were no transfers during the year between level 1 and level 2 nor between levels 1 or 2 and level 3.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations are explained in the accounting policies in note 1 f. Sensitivity information The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy of investment properties are: l Estimated rental value: 4-50 per sq ft 2016: same l Capitalisation rates: 3.5%-9.75% 2016: 4.0%-9.0% significant increases decreases in estimated rental value in isolation would result in a signicantly higher lower fair value measurement.
A significant increase decrease in Capitalisation Rates in isolation would result in a signicantly lower higher fair value measurement.

Management of the risk The Manager runs a diversied portfolio and reports to the Board on the portfolio activity and performance at each board meeting.
The Board monitors the investment activity and strategy to ensure it is compatible with the stated objectives.
The Groups exposure to changes in market prices on its quoted equity investments, CFDs and investment property portfolio, was as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 Investments held at fair value 1,144,776 1,098,560 CFD long gross exposure 114,186 99,476 Concentration of exposure to price risks As set out in the Investment Policies on page 25, there are guidelines to the amount of exposure to a single company, geographical region or direct property.
These guidelines ensure an appropriate spread of exposure to individual or sector price risks.
As an investment company dedicated to investment in the property sector, the Group is exposed to price movements across the property asset class as a whole.
Price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the value of shareholders funds to an increase or decrease of 15% in the fair values of the Groups equity, xed interest, CFD and direct property investments.
The level of change is consistent with the illustration shown in the previous year.

Management of the risk The Board receives a report at each board meeting on the proportion of the investment portfolio held in Sterling, Euros or other currencies.
The Group may sometimes hedge foreign currency movements outside the Eurozone by funding investments in overseas securities with unsecured loans denominated in the same currency or through forward currency contracts.
Cash deposits are held in Sterling and or Euro denominated accounts.

Property companies usually have borrowings themselves and the level of gearing and structure of its debt portfolio is a key factor when assessing the investment in a property company.
The Group has xed and variable rate borrowings.
The interest rates on the loan notes is xed, details are set out in note 13.
At 31 March 2017, in addition to the loan notes the Group had unsecured, multi-currency revolving loan facilities which carry variable rates of interest based on the currencies drawn, plus a margin.
The Manager considers both the level of debt on the balance sheet of the Group i. e. the loan notes and any bank loans drawn and the see-through gearing, taking into account the assets and liabilities of the underlying investments, when considering the investment portfolio.
These gearing levels are reported regularly to the Board.
TR Property Investment Trust 77 TR Property pp58-87 08 06 2017 15:51 Page 78 Notes to the Financial Statements continued continued 11 Financial Instruments 11.3 Interest rate risk continued The majority of the Groups investment portfolio is non-interest bearing.
As a result the Groups financial assets are not directly subject to significant amounts of risk due to uctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.
Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 March of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates: when the interest rate is due to be re-set fixed interest rates: when the financial instrument is due to be repaid.
The Groups exposure to oating interest rates on assets: 27,943,000 2016: 42,146,000.
The Groups exposure to xed interest rates on assets: nil 2016: 951,000.
The Groups exposure to xed interest rates on liabilities: 57,768,000 2016: 54,643,000.
The Groups exposure to oating interest rates on liabilities: 5,000,000 2016: 15,000,000.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts, is at a margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2016: same Interest paid on borrowings under the multi-currency loan facilities, is at a margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent for the type of loan The finance charges on theq50m and 15m loan notes are at interest rates of 1.92% and 3.59% respectively.
The year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year as the level of exposure changes as investments are made in xed interest securities, borrowings are drawn down and repaid, and the mix of borrowings between oating and xed interest rates changes.
Interest rate sensitivity A change of 2% on interest rates at the reporting date would have had the following direct impact: 2017 2017 2016 2016 2% 2% 2% 2% Increase Decrease Increase Decrease 000 000 000 000 Change to shareholders funds 557 557 440 440 Change to total earnings per Ordinary share 0.18 p 0.18p 0.14 p 0.14p This level of change is not representative of the year as a whole, since the exposure changes throughout the period.
This assessment does not take into account the impact of interest rate changes on the market value of the investments the Group holds.
11.4 Liquidity risk Unquoted investments in the portfolio are subject to liquidity risk.
The Group held one unquoted investment at the year end see 11.6 below.
In certain market conditions, the liquidity of direct property investments may be reduced.
At 31 March 2017,8% 2016: 9% of the Groups investment portfolio was held in direct property investments.
At 31 March 2017, 92% 2016: 91% of the Groups investment portfolio is held in listed securities which are predominantly readily realisable.
The debenture loan of 15m was repaid in February 2016.
Bank loan facilities are short term revolving loans which it is intended are renewed or replaced but renewal cannot be certain.
Loan notes of q50m and 15m are repayable in February 2026 and 2031 respectively.

A 30m one year facility with ING Luxembourg was entered into in July 2016.
Discussions for a renewal when this is due to expire in July 2017 are underway.
5m was drawn on this facility at the balance sheet date.
Management of the risk The Manager sets guidelines for the maximum exposure of the portfolio to unquoted and direct property investments.
These are set out in the Investment Policies on page 25.
All unquoted investments and direct property investments with a value over 5 million must be approved by the Board for purchase.
The Company maintains regular contact with the banks providing revolving facilities and renewal discussions commence well ahead of facility renewal dates.
In addition the Company is exploring new opportunities for the provision of debt on an ongoing basis.
11.5 Credit risk The failure of a counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Group suffering a loss.
At the period end the largest counterparty risk, which the Group was exposed to was within Debtors and Cash and cash equivalents where the total bank balances held with one counterparty was 22,882,000 2016: 22,094,000.
Management of the risk Investment transactions are carried out with a number of brokers, whose credit standing is reviewed periodically by the Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
Cash at bank is only held with banks with high quality external credit ratings.

An ISDA Master Agreement is an agreement between the Group and the counterparty that governs OTC derivatives and foreign exchange contracts and typically contains, among other things, collateral posting terms and netting provisions in the event of a default and or termination event.
Under an ISDA Master Agreement, the Group has a contractual right to offset with the counterparty certain derivative financial instruments payables and or receivables with collateral held and or posted and create one single net payment in the event of default including the bankruptcy or insolvency of the counterparty.
However, bankruptcy or insolvency laws of a particular jurisdiction may impose restrictions on or prohibitions against the right of offset in bankruptcy, insolvency or other events.
The disclosures set out in the following tables include financial assets and financial liabilities that are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement.
