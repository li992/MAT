THE STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 9.
Taxation Current and deferred income tax What critical judgements and estimates do we make in accounting for taxation?
We pay tax in accordance with the laws of the countries where we do business.
In some areas these laws arent clear, and it can take many years to agree an outcome with a tax authority or through litigation.
We estimate our tax on country-by-country and issue-by-issue bases.
Our key uncertainties are whether EEs tax losses will be available to us, whether our intra-group trading model will be accepted by a particular tax authority and whether intra-group payments are subject to withholding taxes.
We provide for the most likely outcome where an outflow is probable, but the agreed amount can differ materially from our estimates.
Approximately 80% by value of the provisions are under active tax authority examination and are therefore likely to be re-estimated or resolved in the coming 12 months.
281m 2015 16: 278m is included in current tax liabilities in relation to these uncertainties.
Under a downside case an additional amount of 372m could be required, of which 273m would relate to EE losses.
This amount is not provided as we dont consider this outcome to be probable.
Deciding whether to recognise deferred tax assets is judgemental.
We only recognise them when we believe it is probable that they can be recovered.
In making this judgement we consider evidence such as historical financial performance, future financial plans and trends, the duration of existing customer contracts and whether our intra-group pricing model has been agreed by the relevant tax authority.
The value of the groups income tax assets and liabilities is disclosed on the Group balance sheet on page 167.
The value of the groups deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the deferred tax asset recognised in respect of EE Limiteds historical tax losses, is disclosed below.

The majority of the deferred tax assets and liabilities noted above are anticipated to be realised after more than 12 months.
Weve recognised a deferred tax asset at 31 March 2017 of 172m in respect of EE Limiteds historical tax losses.
We expect to be able to utilise these against future taxable profits in EE Limited.
If EE Limiteds business were subject to a major change in the nature or conduct of trade on or before 5 February 2018, these losses would be forfeited and a current tax liability of 273m would be created.
Based on our current plans, we do not expect a major change to arise.
Deferred tax balances for which there is a right of offset within the same jurisdiction are presented net on the face of the group balance sheet as permitted by IAS 12, with the exception of deferred tax related to our pension schemes which is disclosed within deferred tax assets.
What factors affect our future tax charges?
The rate of UK corporation tax changed from 20% to 19% on 1 April 2017 and will change to 17% on 1 April 2020.
As deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods of the reversal, deferred tax balances at 31 March 2017 have been calculated at the rate at which the relevant balance is expected to be recovered or settled.
This reduction in rate has been recognised as a deferred tax credit specific item of 63m in the income statement note 8 and as a deferred tax expense in reserves.
