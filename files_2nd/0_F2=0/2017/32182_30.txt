4.0 SCOPE 3 VOLUNTARY SUPPLY CHAIN GHG EMISSION Scope 3 supply chain emissions are Greenhouse gases from electricity supplier losses during transmission and distribution of electricity to our stores.
See page 58 for their independent assurance report.
Note: Peak energy use was 2011 13,925,217 kWh : total CO e Scope 2 tonnage was 6,758 tCO e: Scope 3 was 544 tCO e: and total tonnage 2 2 2 was 7,302 tCO e. 2 The Transmission and Distribution Conversion Factor for 2017 was 0.03727.
The energy efficiency investment programmes within our stores have reduced electricity demand from our suppliers power stations.
Total transmission and distribution losses Scope 3 losses have therefore reduced by 34.4% since 2011.
Scope 3 Store Waste Supply Chain Recycling & Emissions Waste Sources and Segregation Our main source of waste is from the operational activities of our stores, mainly retail and office activities that have a relatively low environmental impact.
Our store staff apply best practice waste segregation for general and mixed dry recyclable materials.
Waste Recycling Contractor Our recycling contractor provides further segregation and recycling of our waste.
Since our total waste benchmark of 2011 244 t our store portfolio has increased from 62 to 73 stores, and total waste has increased to 325.1 t in 2017, an increase of 33% from 2011.
The percentage of waste recycled has reduced from 73% in 2013 to 59% in 2017.
This reduction in our contractors recycling is an increasing trend due to a reduction in the supply price of some mixed dry recycled materials, such as paper and cardboard.
Waste to Landfill and Landfill Tax An increasing amount of General waste, 130 tonnes 41% of general waste went to landfill in 2017, as compared to 69 tonnes 28% of general waste in 2011, an increase of 53% over six years.
Landfill Tax is an environmental tax paid in addition to normal landfill costs.
Reducing, re-using and recycling waste can reduce the Landfill Tax rate to 2.65 per ton for more inert waste.
If no segregation or recycling occurs, an increase in the tax to 84.40 per ton can apply to more active waste.
These changes have increased our landfill tax by 32%, mainly due to the reduction in the market value of our recyclate that is now sent to landfill due to its low price.
Note: 2011 Waste was 244 t: mixed dry recycling was 172 t 70.5% : Landfill was 69 t: GHG emission was 10.8 tCO e 2 55
