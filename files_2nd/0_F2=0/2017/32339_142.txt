The remaining balance of 2m 2015 16: 7m, 2014 15: 9m was held in escrow accounts, or in commercial arrangements akin to escrow.
The classification of the items noted above represents a change in our definition of restricted cash.
We previously included in our definition cash held in countries where capital or exchange controls imposed local compliance obligations upon the group.
Upon further review, we have concluded these controls do not necessarily restrict access providing these obligations are satisfied.
We now also include cash balances held in arrangements akin to escrow as well as balances physically held in escrow accounts.
We have updated the comparative balances to reflect this change by reducing reported restricted cash by 50m in 2015 16 and 61m in 2014 15.
Cash equivalents are classified as loans and receivables and are held on the group balance sheet at amortised cost which equates to fair value.
Loans and other borrowings Whats our capital management policy?
The objective of our capital management policy is to target an overall level of debt consistent with our credit rating target while investing in the business, supporting the pension scheme and paying progressive dividends.
In order to meet this objective, we may issue or repay debt, issue new shares, repurchase shares, or adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders.
Wemanage the capital structure and make adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the group.
The Board regularly reviews the capital structure.
No changes were made to these objectives and processes during 2016 17, 2015 16 or 2014 15.
For details of share issues and repurchases in the year see note 21.
Our capital structure consists of net debt and shareholders equity.
The analysis below summarises the components which we manage as capital.
