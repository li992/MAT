However, due to the changes endorsed by the EU in the definition of a lease term and potential embedded leases that we believe need to be identified and recognised on the balance sheet, it has not yet been possible to estimate the amount of right of use assets and lease liabilities that will be recognised on the balance sheet.
We have also not yet decided which exemptions will be adopted.
During the year we have established a project team and begun an initial impact assessment exercise.
We have also begun a review of the systems and processes that will need to be updated as a result of this change.
We expect to conclude preparations by the end of 2018.

Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial Statements 97 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNILEVER GROUP CONTINUED 4B.
PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS For defined benefit plans, operating and finance costs are recognised separately in the income statement.
The amount charged to operating cost in the income statement is the cost of accruing pension benefits promised to employees over the year, plus the costs of individual events such as past service benefit changes, settlements and curtailments such events are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The amount charged or credited to finance costs is a net interest expense calculated by applying the liability discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
Any differences between the expected interest on assets and the return actually achieved, and any changes in the liabilities over the year due to changes in assumptions or experience within the plans, are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The defined benefit plan surplus or deficit on the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit liabilities using a discount rate based on high-quality corporate bonds, or a suitable alternative where there is no active corporate bond market.
All defined benefit plans are subject to regular actuarial review using the projected unit method, either by external consultants or by actuaries employed by Unilever.
The Group policy is that the most material plans, representing approximately 85% of the defined benefit liabilities, are formally valued every year.
Other material plans, accounting for a further 13% of the liabilities, have their liabilities updated each year.
Group policy for the remaining plans requires a full actuarial valuation at least every three years.
Asset values for all plans are updated every year.
For defined contribution plans, the charges to the income statement are the company contributions payable, as the companys obligation is limited to the contributions paid into the plans.
The assets and liabilities of such plans are not included in the balance sheet of the Group.
DESCRIPTION OF PLANS The Group increasingly operates a number of defined contribution plans, the assets of which are held in external funds.
In certain countries the Group operates defined benefit pension plans based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
The majority of defined benefit plans are either career average, final salary or hybrid plans and operate on a funded basis.
Benefits are determined by the plan rules and are linked to inflation in some countries.
Our largest plans are in the UK and Netherlands.
In the UK, we operate a combination of an open career average defined benefit plan with a salary limit for benefit accrual, and a defined contribution plan.
In the Netherlands, we operate a collective defined contribution plan for all new benefit accrual and a closed career average defined benefit plan for benefits built up to April 2015.
The Group also provides other post-employment benefits, mainly post-employment healthcare plans in the United States.
These plans are predominantly unfunded.
GOVERNANCE The majority of the Groups externally funded plans are established as trusts, foundations or similar entities.
The operation of these entities is governed by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the Trustees or equivalent and their composition.
Where Trustees or equivalent are in place to operate plans, they are generally required to act on behalf of the plans stakeholders.
They are tasked with periodic reviews of the solvency of the fund in accordance with local legislation and play a role in the long-term investment and funding strategy.
The Group also has an internal body, the Pensions and Equity Committee, that is responsible for setting the companys policies and decisionmaking on plan matters, including but not limited to design, funding, investments, risk management and governance.
INVESTMENT STRATEGY The Groups investment strategy in respect of its funded plans is implemented within the framework of the various statutory requirements of the territories where the plans are based.
The Group has developed policy guidelines for the allocation of assets to different classes with the objective of controlling risk and maintaining the right balance between risk and long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the Group of the benefits provided.
To achieve this, investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
The plans continue to invest a good proportion of the assets in equities, which the Group believes offer the best returns over the long-term, commensurate with an acceptable level of risk.
The plans expose the Group to a number of actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and, in certain markets, inflation risk.
There are no unusual entity or plan-specific risks to the Group.
For risk control, the pension funds also have significant investments in liability matching assets bonds as well as in property and other alternative assets: additionally, the Group uses derivatives to further mitigate the impact of the risks outlined above.
The majority of assets are managed by a number of external fund managers with a small proportion managed in-house.
Unilever has a pooled investment vehicle Univest which it believes offers its pension plans around the world a simplified externally managed investment vehicle to implement their strategic asset allocation models, currently for bonds, equities and alternative assets.
The aim is to provide high-quality, well diversified, cost-effective, risk-controlled vehicles.
The pension plans investments are overseen by Unilevers internal investment company, the Univest Company.
ASSUMPTIONS With the objective of presenting the assets and liabilities of the pensions and other post-employment benefit plans at their fair value on the balance sheet, assumptions under IAS 19 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities vary according to the country in which the plan is situated.
The following table shows the assumptions, weighted by liabilities, used to value defined benefit plans representing approximately 96% of total pension liabilities and other post-employment benefits.

PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED The valuations of other post-employment benefit plans generally assume a higher initial level of medical cost inflation, which falls from 7% to the long-term rate within the next five years.
Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for healthcare plans.
For the most important pension plans, representing approximately 68% of all defined benefit plans liabilities, the assumptions used at 31 December 2017 and 2016 were: United Kingdom Netherlands 2017 2016 2017 2016 Discount rate 2.5% 2.7% 1.8% 1.8% Inflation 3.1% 3.2% 1.7% 1.7% Rate of increase in salaries 3.0% 3.1% 2.2% 2.2% Rate of increase for pensions in payment where provided 3.0% 3.1% 1.7% 1.7% Rate of increase for pensions in deferment where provided 3.0% 3.1% 1.7% 1.7% Number of years a current pensioner is expected to live beyond age 65: Men 22.1 22.5 22.5 21.8 Women 24.0 24.6 24.3 24.0 Number of years a future pensioner currently aged 45 is expected to live beyond age 65: Men 22.6 23.8 24.6 24.1 Women 25.6 26.5 26.6 26.3 Demographic assumptions, such as mortality rates, are set with having regard to the latest trends in life expectancy including expectations of future improvements, plan experience and other relevant data.
These assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension plans.
The years of life expectancy for 2017 above have been translated from the following tables: UK: The year of use S2 series all pensioners S2PA tables have been adopted, which are based on the experience of UK pension schemes over the period 2004-2011.
Scaling factors are applied reflecting the experience of our pension funds appropriate to the members gender and status.
Future improvements in longevity have been allowed for in line with the 2016 CMI core projections Sk 7.5 and a 1% pa long-term improvement rate.
Netherlands: The Dutch Actuarial Societys AG Prognosetafel 2016 table is used with correction factors 2017 to allow for the typically longer life expectancy for fund members relative to the general population.
This table has an in-built allowance for future improvements in longevity.
The remaining defined benefit plans are considered immaterial.
Their assumptions vary due to a number of factors including the currency and long term economic conditions of the countries where they are situated.

The fair value of private equity, properties, derivatives and hedge funds are not based on quoted market prices in active markets.
The Group uses swaps to hedge some of its exposure to inflation and interest rate risk the degree of this hedging of liabilities was 45% for the UK plan 2016: 35% and 30% for the Netherlands plan 2016: 35%.
Foreign currency exposures in part are also hedged by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Assets included in the Other category are commodities, cash and insurance contracts which are also unquoted assets.
Equity securities include Unilever securities amounting to 14 million 0.1% of total plan assets and 12 million 0.1% of total plan assets at 31 December 2017 and 2016 respectively.
Property includes property occupied by Unilever amounting to 32 million at 31 December 2017 2016: 34 million.
The pension assets above exclude the assets in a Special Benefits Trust amounting to 63 million 2016: 79 million to fund pension and similar liabilities in the United States see also note 17A on pages 127 to 128.
In 2016, pensions assets also excluded 68 million in an escrow account that would otherwise have been payable to the UK pension fund.
In 2017, as a result of the triennial valuation of the UK fund, the monies held in escrow have been returned to the Group see also note 11 page 112 and 113.
SENSITIVITIES The sensitivity of the overall pension liabilities to changes in the weighted key assumptions are: Change in liabilities Change in assumption UK Netherlands Total Discount rate Increase by 0.5% -8% -9% -7% Inflation rate Increase by 0.5% 7% 9% 6% Life expectancy Increase by 1 year 4% 4% 4% b Long-term medical cost inflation Increase by 1.0% 0% 0% 1% An equivalent decrease in each assumption would have an equal and opposite impact on liabilities.
b Long-term medical cost inflation only relates to post retirement medical plans.
The sensitivity analyses above have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period and may not be representative of the actual change.
It is based on a change in the key assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
When calculating the sensitivity to the assumption, the same method used to calculate the liability recognised in the balance sheet has been applied.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared with the previous period.

The Groups funding policy is to periodically review the contributions made to the plans while taking account of local legislations.
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS The fair value of awards at grant date is calculated using appropriate pricing models.
This value is expensed over their vesting period, with a corresponding credit to equity.
The expense is reviewed and adjusted to reflect changes to the level of awards expected to vest, except where this arises from a failure to meet a market condition.
Any cancellations are recognised immediately in the income statement.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had share-based compensation plans in the form of performance shares, share options and other share awards.
The numbers in this note include those for Executive Directors shown in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 47 to 76 and those for key management shown in note 4A on page 97, Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the share-based compensation plans.

The awards of each plan will vest between 0 and 200% of grant level, subject to the level of satisfaction of performance measures limits for Executive Directors may vary, and are detailed in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 47 to 76.
Under the GSIP, Unilevers managers receive annual awards of NV and PLC shares.
The performance measures for GSIP are underlying sales growth, underlying operating margin, and cumulative operating cash flow for the Group, although GSIP awards to certain managers below Unilever Leadership Executive level may be subject to similar performance measures specific to their business unit.
There is an additional target based on relative total shareholder return for senior executives.
GSIP awards will vest after three years.
From 2017, the MCIP allows Unilevers managers to invest a proportion of their annual bonus a maximum of 60% for Executive Directors, 100% for other managers in shares in Unilever, and to receive a corresponding award of performance-related shares.
The performance measures for MCIP are underlying sales growth, underlying EPS growth, and sustainability progress index for the Group.
There is an additional target of return on invested capital for senior executives.
MCIP awards will vest after four years.

INCOME TAX Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Current tax in the consolidated income statement will differ from the income tax paid in the consolidated cash flow statement primarily because of deferred tax arising on temporary differences and payment dates for income tax occurring after the balance sheet date.
Unilever is subject to taxation in the many countries in which it operates.
The tax legislation of these countries differs, is often complex and is subject to interpretation by management and the government authorities.
These matters of judgement give rise to the need to create provisions for tax payments that may arise in future years.
Provisions are made against individual exposures and take into account the specific circumstances of each case, including the strength of technical arguments, recent case law decisions or rulings on similar issues and relevant external advice.
The provision is estimated based on the individual most likely outcome approach.

For this reason, the rate may vary from year to year according to the mix of profit and related tax rates.
b See note 3 for explanation of non-underlying items Our tax rate is reduced by incentive tax credits, the benefit from preferential tax regimes that have been legislated by the countries and provinces concerned in order to promote economic development and investment.
The tax rate is increased by business expenses which are not deductible for tax, such as entertainment costs and some interest expense and by irrecoverable withholding taxes on dividends paid by subsidiary companies and on other cross-border payments such as royalties and service fees, which cannot be offset against other taxes due.
In 2017 the effective tax rate has been increased by disposals in relatively high taxed locations and the significant impact of non-deductible costs relating to the buy-back of preference shares.
Impact of US Tax Reform On 22 December 2017 HR1, formerly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was signed into law in the United States.
As a result of this, we have recognized a tax benefit of 578 million, primarily due to a re-measurement of US deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new lower 21% federal tax rate.
This benefit is excluded from underlying earnings per share.
The US tax rate reduction will have a positive impact on our future tax rate but the Act includes other provisions related to cross border payments which could offset this benefit.
We are still assessing the overall impact on our future effective tax rate but at this stage we do not expect it to be significant.
The Groups future tax charge and effective tax rate could be affected by several factors, including changes in tax laws and their interpretation and still to be determined tax reform proposals in the EU and Switzerland, as well as the impact of acquisitions, disposals and any restructuring of our businesses.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial Statements 105 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNILEVER GROUP CONTINUED 6B.
DEFERRED TAX Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method on taxable temporary differences between the tax base and the accounting base of items included in the balance sheet of the Group.
Certain temporary differences are not provided for as follows: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the year end.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unused tax losses of 4,179 million 2016: 3,622 million and tax credits of 612 million 2016: 629 million, as it is not probable that there will be future taxable profits within the entities against which the losses can be utilised.
The majority of these tax losses and credits arise in tax jurisdictions where they do not expire with the exception of 2,934 million 2016: 2,363 million comprising corporate income tax losses in the Netherlands which expire between now and 2026 and state and federal tax losses in the US which expire between now and 2037.
Other deductible temporary differences of 51 million 2016: 52 million have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset.
There is no expiry date for these differences.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 1,719 million 2016: 1,557 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.

COMBINED EARNINGS PER SHARE The combined earnings per share calculations are based on the average number of share units representing the combined ordinary shares of NV and PLC in issue during the period, less the average number of shares held as treasury shares.
In calculating diluted earnings per share and underlying earnings per share, a number of adjustments are made to the number of shares, principally, the exercise of share options by employees.
Underlying earnings per share is calculated as underlying profit attributable to shareholders equity divided by the diluted combined average number of share units.
In calculating underlying profit attributable to shareholders equity, net profit attributable to shareholders equity is adjusted to eliminate the post-tax impact of non-underlying items in operating profit and any other significant unusual items within net profit but not operating profit.
Earnings per share for total operations for the 12 months were as follows: 2017 2016 2015 Basic earnings per share 2.16 1.83 1.73 Diluted earnings per share 2.15 1.82 1.72 Underlying earnings per share 2.24 2.03 1.93 Millions of share units Calculation of average number of share units 2017 2016 2015 Average number of shares: NV 1,714.7 1,714.7 1,714.7 PLC 1,310.2 1,310.2 1,310.2 Less treasury shares held by employee share trusts and companies 223.3 184.7 184.8 Combined average number of share units - used for basic earnings per share 2,801.6 2,840.2 2,840.1 Add dilutive effect of share-based compensation plans 12.4 13.7 15.3 Diluted combined average number of share units used for diluted and underlying earnings per share 2,814.0 2,853.9 2,855.4 million million million Calculation of earnings Notes 2017 2016 2015 Net profit 6,486 5,547 5,259 Non-controlling interests 433 363 350 Net profit attributable to shareholders equity used for basic and diluted earnings per share 6,053 5,184 4,909 3 Post tax impact of non-underlying items 262 601 605 Underlying profit attributable to shareholders equity used for underlying earnings per share 6,315 5,785 5,514 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial Statements 107 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNILEVER GROUP CONTINUED 8.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS GOODWILL Goodwill is initially recognised based on the accounting policy for business combinations see note 21.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less amounts provided for impairment.
The Group has 13 cash generating units CGUs, of which 12 are based on the three geographical areas and four product categories excluding Spreads from the Foods category.
A separate CGU has been recognised for the global Spreads business on the announcement to dispose of the business.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the Groups CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
These might not always be the same as the CGUs that include the assets and liabilities of the acquired business.
Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and is not larger than an operating segment.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS Separately purchased intangible assets are initially measured at cost, being the purchase price as at the date of acquisition.
On acquisition of new interests in group companies, Unilever recognises any specifically identifiable intangible assets separately from goodwill.
These intangible assets are initially measured at fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Development expenditure for internally-produced intangible assets is capitalised only if the costs can be reliably measured, future economic benefits are probable, the product is technically feasible and the Group has the intent and the resources to complete the project.
Research expenditure to support development of internally-produced intangible assets is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Indefinite-life intangibles mainly comprise trademarks and brands.
These assets are not amortised but are subject to a review for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate this is necessary.
Any impairment is charged to the income statement as it arises.
Finite-life intangible assets mainly comprise software, patented and non-patented technology, know-how and customer lists.
These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis in the income statement over the period of their expected useful lives, or the period of legal rights if shorter.
None of the amortisation periods exceeds ten years.. 108 Financial Statements Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2017 9.

There are no significant carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets that are allocated across multiple cash generating units.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to Unilevers cash generating units for the purposes of impairment testing.
The assets acquired in business combinations are also assessed to determine the impact on the Groups cash generating units, particularly whether new cash generating units are created.
This assessment and allocation has not been completed for acquisitions completed during 2017, except for goodwill and assets acquired for Living Proof which are included in the Personal Care The Americas cash generating unit.
At 31 December 2017 goodwill of 2,405 million has not been allocated to Unilevers cash generating units for the purposes of impairment testing, there is no indication that the acquired goodwill and assets are impaired.

SIGNIFICANT CGUS The goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets held in the three CGUs relating to Foods excluding spreads across the geographical areas and Personal Care The Americas are considered significant within the total carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets at 31 December 2017 in terms of size, headroom and sensitivity to assumptions used.

The growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on the conservative end of the range of estimates from past performance, our annual forecast and three year strategic plan extended to year 4 and 5.
We have performed sensitivity analyses around the base assumptions.
There are no reasonably possible changes in a key assumption that would cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost including eligible borrowing costs less depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the expected average useful lives of the assets.
Residual values are reviewed at least annually.
Estimated useful lives by major class of assets are as follows: Freehold buildings no depreciation on freehold land 40 years Leasehold land and buildings 40 years or life of lease if less Plant and equipment 220 years Property, plant and equipment is subject to review for impairment if triggering events or circumstances indicate that this is necessary.
If an indication of impairment exists, the assets or cash generating units recoverable amount is estimated and any impairment loss is charged to the income statement as it arises.

Associates are undertakings where the Group has an investment in which it does not have control or joint control but can exercise significant influence.
Interests in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method and are stated in the consolidated balance sheet at cost, adjusted for the movement in the Groups share of their net assets and liabilities.
The Groups share of the profit or loss after tax of joint ventures and associates is included in the Groups consolidated profit before taxation.
Where the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in the equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of the investment is reduced to zero and the recognition of further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has an obligation to make payments on behalf of the investee.

TRADE AND OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES Trade and other current receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequently these assets are held at amortised cost, using the effective interest method and net of any impairment losses.
We do not consider the fair values of trade and other current receivables to be significantly different from their carrying values.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited, due to the Groups customer base being large and diverse.
Our historical experience of collecting receivables, supported by the level of default, is that credit risk is low across territories and so trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets.

TRADE PAYABLES AND OTHER LIABILITIES TRADE PAYABLES Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs.
Trade payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
OTHER LIABILITIES Other liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement depends on the type of liability: Accruals are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
Social security and sundry taxes are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
Deferred consideration is subsequently measured at fair value with changes in the income statement as explained below.
Others are subsequently measured either at amortised cost, using the effective interest method or at fair value, with changes being recognised in the income statement.
Deferred Consideration Deferred consideration represents any payments to the sellers of a business that occur after the acquisition date.
These typically comprise of contingent consideration and fixed deferred consideration: Fixed deferred consideration is a payment with a due date after acquisition that is not dependent on future conditions Contingent consideration is a payment which is dependent on certain conditions being met in the future and is often variable All deferred consideration is initially recognised at fair value as at the acquisition date, which includes a present value discount.
Subsequently, deferred consideration is measured to reflect the unwinding of discount on the liability, with changes recognised in finance cost within the income statement.
In the balance sheet it is re-measured to reflect the latest estimate of the achievement of the conditions on which the consideration is based: changes in value other than the discount unwind are recognised as acquisition and disposal-related costs within non-underlying items in the income statement.
We do not consider the fair values of trade payables and other liabilities to be significantly different from their carrying values.

CAPITAL AND FUNDING ORDINARY SHARES Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.
INTERNAL HOLDINGS The ordinary shares numbered 1 to 2,400 inclusive in NV Special Shares and deferred stock of PLC are held as to one half of each class by N. V. Elma a subsidiary of NV and one half by United Holdings Limited a subsidiary of PLC.
This capital is eliminated on consolidation.
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION The Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans involving options and awards of ordinary shares of NV and PLC.
Full details of these plans are given in note 4C on pages 103 to 104.

SHARES HELD BY EMPLOYEE SHARE TRUSTS AND GROUP COMPANIES Certain PLC trusts, NV and group companies purchase and hold NV and PLC shares to satisfy performance shares granted, share options granted and other share awards see note 4C.
The assets and liabilities of these trusts and shares held by group companies are included in the consolidated financial statements.
The book value of shares held is deducted from other reserves, and trusts borrowings are included in the Groups liabilities.
The costs of the trusts are included in the results of the Group.
These shares are excluded from the calculation of earnings per share.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, less any directly related transaction costs.
Certain bonds are designated as being part of a fair value hedge relationship.
In these cases, the bonds are carried at amortised cost, adjusted for the fair value of the risk being hedged, with changes in value shown in profit and loss.
Other financial liabilities, excluding derivatives, are subsequently carried at amortised cost.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Groups use of, and accounting for, derivative instruments is explained in note 16 on page 121 and on pages 125 to 126.
The Groups Treasury activities are designed to: maintain a competitive balance sheet in line with at least A A2 rating see below : secure funding at lowest costs for the Groups operations, M&A activity and external dividend payments see below : protect the Groups financial results and position from financial risks see note 16 : maintain market risks within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns see note 16 : and protect the Groups financial investments, while maximising returns see note 17.
The Treasury department provides central deposit taking, funding and foreign exchange management services for the Groups operations.

CAPITAL AND FUNDING CONTINUED Key instruments used by the department are: short-term and long-term borrowings: cash and cash equivalents: and plain vanilla derivatives, including interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.
The Treasury department maintains a list of approved financial instruments.
The use of any new instrument must be approved by the Chief Financial Officer.
The use of leveraged instruments is not permitted.
Unilever considers the following components of its balance sheet to be managed capital: total equity retained profit, other reserves, share capital, share premium, non-controlling interests notes 15A and 15B : short-term debt current financial liabilities note 15C : and long-term debt non-current bank loans, bonds and other loans note 15C.
The Group manages its capital so as to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to optimise returns to our shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity.
The capital structure of the Group is based on managements judgement of the appropriate balance of key elements in order to meet its strategic and day-to-day needs.
We consider the amount of capital in proportion to risk and manage the capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
Our current long-term credit rating is A A1 and our short-term credit rating is A1 P1.
We aim to maintain a competitive balance sheet which we consider to be the equivalent of a credit rating of at least A A2 in the long-term.
This provides us with: appropriate access to the debt and equity markets: sufficient flexibility for acquisitions: sufficient resilience against economic and financial uncertainty while ensuring ample liquidity: and optimal weighted average cost of capital, given the above constraints.
Unilever monitors the qualitative and quantitative factors utilised by the rating agencies.

Information in relation to the derivatives used to hedge bonds and other loans within a fair value hedge relationship is shown in note 16.
120 Financial Statements Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2017 16.
TREASURY RISK MANAGEMENT DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING Derivatives are measured at fair value with any related transaction costs expensed as incurred.
The treatment of changes in the value of derivatives depends on their use as explained below.
a I FAIR VALUE HEDGES Certain derivatives are held to hedge the risk of changes in value of a specific bond or other loan.
In these situations, the Group designates the liability and related derivative to be part of a fair value hedge relationship.
The carrying value of the bond is adjusted by the fair value of the risk being hedged, with changes going to the income statement.
Gains and losses on the corresponding derivative are also recognised in the income statement.
The amounts recognised are offset in the income statement to the extent that the hedge is effective.
When the relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value hedge adjustment made to the bond is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest method.
a II CASH FLOW HEDGES Derivatives are also held to hedge the uncertainty in timing or amount of future forecast cash flows.
Such derivatives are classified as being part of cash flow hedge relationships.
For an effective hedge, gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in equity.
Any ineffective elements of the hedge are recognised in the income statement.
If the hedged cash flow relates to a non-financial asset, the amount accumulated in equity is subsequently included within the carrying value of that asset.
For other cash flow hedges, amounts deferred in equity are taken to the income statement at the same time as the related cash flow.
When a derivative no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss remains in equity until the related cash flow occurs.
When the cash flow takes place, the cumulative gain or loss is taken to the income statement.
If the hedged cash flow is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss is taken to the income statement immediately.
a III NET INVESTMENT HEDGES Certain derivatives are designated as hedges of the currency risk on the Groups investment in foreign subsidiaries.
The accounting policy for these arrangements is set out in note 1.
IV DERIVATIVES FOR WHICH HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS NOT APPLIED Derivatives not classified as hedges are held in order to hedge certain balance sheet items and commodity exposures.
No hedge accounting is applied to these derivatives, which are carried at fair value with changes being recognised in the income statement.
a Applying hedge accounting has not led to material ineffectiveness being recognised in the income statement for both 2017 and 2016.
The Group is exposed to the following risks that arise from its use of financial instruments, the management of which is described in the following sections: liquidity risk see note 16A : market risk see note 16B : and credit risk see note 17B.
MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will face in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due without incurring unacceptable losses.
In doing this, management considers both normal and stressed conditions.
A material and sustained shortfall in our cash flow could undermine the Groups credit rating, impair investor confidence and also restrict the Groups ability to raise funds.
The Group maintained a cautious funding strategy.
This was the result of cash delivery from the business, coupled with the proceeds from bond issuances.
This cash has been invested conservatively with low risk counter-parties at maturities of less than six months.
Cash flow from operating activities provides the funds to service the financing of financial liabilities on a day-to-day basis.
The Group seeks to manage its liquidity requirements by maintaining access to global debt markets through short-term and long-term debt programmes.
In addition, Unilever has committed credit facilities for general corporate use.
On 31 December 2017 Unilever had undrawn revolving 364-day bilateral credit facilities in aggregate of US$7,865 million 2016: US$6,550 million with a 364-day term out.
As part of the regular annual process, the intention is that these facilities will again be renewed in 2018.
In addition, Unilever had undrawn revolving 364-day bilateral credit facilities in aggregate of 4,000 million 2016: nil Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial Statements 121 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNILEVER GROUP CONTINUED 16A.

MANAGEMENT OF MARKET RISK Unilevers size and operations result in it being exposed to the following market risks that arise from its use of financial instruments: commodity price risk: currency risk: and interest rate risk.
The above risks may affect the Groups income and expenses, or the value of its financial instruments.
The objective of the Groups management of market risk is to maintain this risk within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns.
Generally, the Group applies hedge accounting to manage the volatility in profit and loss arising from market risk.
The Groups exposure to, and management of, these risks is explained below.
It often includes derivative financial instruments, the uses of which are described in note 16C.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING CONTINUED MASTER NETTING OR SIMILAR AGREEMENTS A number of legal entities within our Group enter into derivative transactions under International Swap and Derivatives Association ISDA master netting agreements.
In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counter-party on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other.
In certain circumstances, such as when a credit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions.
The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting the positive and negative values in the consolidated balance sheet.
This is because the Group does not have any currently legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, between various Group and bank affiliates, because the right to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of future credit events such as a default.
The column Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet Financial instruments shows the netting impact of our ISDA agreements, assuming the agreements are respected in the relevant jurisdiction.

INVESTMENT AND RETURN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet include deposits, investments in money market funds and highly liquid investments.
To be classified as cash and cash equivalents, an asset must: be readily convertible into cash: have an insignificant risk of changes in value: and have a maturity period of three months or less at acquisition.
Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement also include bank overdrafts and are recorded at amortised cost.
OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS Other financial assets are first recognised on the trade date.
At that point, they are classified as: held-to-maturity investments: loans and receivables: available-for-sale financial assets: or financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
126 Financial Statements Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2017 17.
INVESTMENT AND RETURN CONTINUED I HELD-TO-MATURITY INVESTMENTS These are assets with set cash flows and fixed maturities which Unilever intends to hold to maturity.
They are held at cost plus interest using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
II LOANS AND RECEIVABLES These are assets with an established payment profile and which are not listed on a recognised stock exchange.
They are initially recognised at fair value, which is usually the original invoice amount plus any directly related transaction costs.
Afterwards, loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost, less any impairment.
III AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS Any financial assets not classified as either loans and receivables or financial assets at fair value through profit or loss or held-to-maturity investments are designated as available-for-sale.
They are initially recognised at fair value, usually the original invoice amount plus any directly related transaction costs.
Afterwards, they are measured at fair value with changes being recognised in equity.
When the investment is sold or impaired, the accumulated gains and losses are moved from equity to the income statement.
Interest and dividends from these assets are recognised in the income statement.
IV FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS These are derivatives and assets that are held for trading.
Related transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Unless they form part of a hedging relationship, these assets are held at fair value, with changes being recognised in the income statement.
IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS Each year, the Group assesses whether there is evidence that financial assets are impaired.
A significant or prolonged fall in value below the cost of an asset generally indicates that an asset may be impaired.
If impaired, financial assets are written down to their estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment losses on assets classified as loans and receivables are recognised in profit and loss.
When a later event causes the impairment losses to decrease, the reduction in impairment loss is also recognised in profit and loss.
Impairment losses on assets classified as available-for-sale are recognised by moving the loss accumulated in equity to the income statement.
Any subsequent recovery in value of an available-for-sale debt security is recognised within profit and loss.
However, any subsequent recovery in value of an equity security is recognised within equity, and is recorded at amortised cost.
FINANCIAL ASSETS The Groups Treasury function aims to protect the Groups financial investments, while maximising returns.
The fair value of financial assets is the same as the carrying amount for 2017 and 2016.
The Groups cash resources and other financial assets are shown below.

b Current loans and receivables include short-term deposits with banks with maturities of longer than three months.
c Current available-for-sale financial assets include government securities and Aor higher rated money and capital market instruments.
Non-current available-forsale financial assets predominantly consist of investments in a number of companies and financial institutions in Europe, India and the US, including 63 million 2016: 79 million of assets in a trust to fund benefit obligations in the US see also note 4B.

These companies provide loans to our subsidiaries that are also funded through retained earnings and third party borrowings.
We maintain access to global debt markets through an infrastructure of short and long-term debt programmes.
We make use of plain vanilla derivatives, such as interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts, to help mitigate risks.
More detail is provided in notes 16, 16A, 16B and 16C on pages 121 to 126.
The remaining 2.3 billion 69% of the Groups cash and cash equivalents are held in foreign subsidiaries which repatriate distributable reserves on a regular basis.
For most countries, this is done through dividends which are in some cases subject to withholding or distribution tax.
This balance includes 206 million 2016: 240 million, 2015: 284 million of cash that is held in a few countries where we face cross-border foreign exchange controls and or other legal restrictions that inhibit our ability to make these balances available for general use by the wider business.
The cash will generally be invested or held in the relevant country and, given the other capital resources available to the Group, does not significantly affect the ability of the Group to meet its cash obligations.
CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Additional information in relation to credit risk on trade receivables is given in note 13.
These risks are generally managed by local controllers.
Credit risk related to the use of treasury instruments is managed on a Group basis.
This risk arises from transactions with financial institutions involving cash and cash equivalents, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets.
To reduce this risk, Unilever has concentrated its main activities with a limited number of counter-parties which have secure credit ratings.
Individual risk limits are set for each counter-party based on financial position, credit rating and past experience.
Credit limits and concentration of exposures are actively monitored by the Groups treasury department.
Netting agreements are also put in place with Unilevers principal counter-parties.
In the case of a default, these arrangements would allow Unilever to net assets and liabilities across transactions with that counter-party.
To further reduce the Groups credit exposures on derivative financial instruments, Unilever has collateral agreements with Unilevers principal counter-parties in relation to derivative financial instruments.
Under these arrangements, counter-parties are required to deposit securities and or cash as a collateral for their obligations in respect of derivative financial instruments.
At 31 December 2017 the collateral held by Unilever under such arrangements amounted to 6 million 2016: 3 million, of which 6 2016: Nil was in cash, and Nil million 2016: 3 was in the form of bond securities.
The non-cash collateral has not been recognised as an asset in the Groups balance sheet.
Further details in relation to the Groups exposure to credit risk are shown in note 13 and note 16A.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FAIR VALUE RISK The Group is exposed to the risks of changes in fair value of its financial assets and liabilities.
The following table summarises the fair values and carrying amounts of financial instruments.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FAIR VALUE RISK CONTINUED The fair value of trade receivables and payables is considered to be equal to the carrying amount of these items due to their short-term nature.
The instruments that have a fair value that is different from the carrying amount are classified as Level 2 for both 2016 and 2017 with exception of preference shares which are classified as Level 1 for both years.
FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY The fair values shown in notes 15C and 17A have been classified into three categories depending on the inputs used in the valuation technique.
The categories used are as follows: Level 1: quoted prices for identical instruments: Level 2: directly or indirectly observable market inputs, other than Level 1 inputs: and Level 3: inputs which are not based on observable market data.
For assets and liabilities which are carried at fair value, the classification of fair value calculations by category is summarised below: million million million million million million million million Total fair Total fair Level 1 Level 1 Level 2 Level 2 Level 3 Level 3 value value Notes 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 Assets at fair value Other cash equivalents 17A - - 80 90 - - 80 90 Available-for-sale financial assets 17A 215 138 7 98 342 273 564 509 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: a Derivatives 16C - - 173 226 - - 173 226 Other 17A 137 - - 131 2 1 139 132 Liabilities at fair value b Derivatives 16C - - 534 331 - - 534 331 14 - - - - 445 380 445 380 Contingent consideration a Includes 57 million 2016: 135 million derivatives, reported within trade receivables, that hedge trading activities.
b Includes 113 million 2016: 146 million derivatives, reported within trade payables, that hedge trading activities.
There were no significant changes in classification of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities since 31 December 2016.
There were also no significant movements between the fair value hierarchy classifications since 31 December 2016.
The impact in the 2017 income statement due to Level 3 instruments is a gain of 26 million 2016: gain of 94 million.
Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements of financial assets is given below: million million Reconciliation of movements in Level 3 valuations 2017 2016 1 January 106 346 Gains and losses recognised in profit and loss 26 94 Gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income 2 12 Purchases and new issues 89 247 Sales and settlements 17 187 Transfers into Level 3 83 - Transfers out of Level 3 - 100 31 December 101 106 SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED IN LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUES The largest asset valued using Level 3 techniques is an executive Life Insurance of 22 million 2016: 25 million.
A change in one or more of the inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not change the value significantly.
During the year 2017, a Split-Dollar life insurance asset with a carrying value of 43 million as at 31 December 2016 2015: 41 million was derecognised.
The asset was previously valued using Level 3 techniques and related to an unlisted investment recognised as an available for sale financial asset.
The asset was disposed for a total consideration of 45 million and the carrying value at the time of disposal was 36 million.
The 2017 impact on profit or loss was 9 million gain.
CALCULATION OF FAIR VALUES The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values are consistent with those used in the year ended 31 December 2016.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial Statements 129 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNILEVER GROUP CONTINUED 18.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FAIR VALUE RISK CONTINUED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE The fair values of quoted investments falling into Level 1 are based on current bid prices.
The fair values of unquoted available-for-sale financial assets are based on recent trades in liquid markets, observable market rates, discounted cash flow analysis and statistical modelling techniques such as the Monte Carlo simulation.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
Derivatives are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs.
The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counter-parties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying commodities.
For listed securities where the market is not liquid, and for unlisted securities, valuation techniques are used.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow calculations.
OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FAIR VALUES FOR DISCLOSURE PURPOSES ONLY Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other current receivables, bank loans and overdrafts, trade payables and other current liabilities have fair values that approximate to their carrying amounts due to their short-term nature.
The fair values of preference shares and listed bonds are based on their market value.
Non-listed bonds, other loans, bank loans and non-current receivables and payables are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash flows associated with these instruments using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.
Fair values for finance lease creditors have been assessed by reference to current market rates for comparable leasing arrangements.
POLICIES AND PROCESSES USED IN RELATION TO THE CALCULATION OF LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUES Assets valued using Level 3 valuation techniques are primarily made up of long-term cash receivables and unlisted investments.
Valuation techniques used are specific to the circumstances involved.
Unlisted investments include 195 million 2016: 172 million of investments within Unilever Ventures companies.
PROVISIONS Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the balance sheet date, as a result of a past event, where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated and where the outflow of economic benefit is probable.

The group expects these provisions to be substantially utilised within the next few years.
The Group is involved from time to time in legal and arbitration proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
As previously disclosed, along with other consumer products companies and retail customers, Unilever is involved in a number of ongoing investigations by national competition authorities.
These proceedings and investigations are at various stages and concern a variety of product markets.
Where specific issues arise, provisions are made to the extent appropriate.
Due to the nature of the legal cases, the timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain.
In 2017, the group recognised a provision of 80 million in relation to investigations by national competition authorities including those within Italy and South Africa.
Provisions for Brazil indirect taxes are comprised of disputes with Brazilian authorities, in particular relating to tax credits that can be taken for the PIS and COFINS indirect taxes.
These provisions are separate from the matters listed as contingent liabilities in note 20: Unilever does not have provisions and contingent liabilities for the same matters.
Due to the nature of disputed indirect taxes the timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain.
In 2017, the Group successfully applied for federal tax amnesty in relation to 31 cases in Brazil.
This resulted in a 261 million reduction in the provision for disputed indirect taxes, of which 193 million was utilised and 68 million was credited into the income statement.
130 Financial Statements Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2017 20.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised at the lower of fair value at the date of commencement of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Subsequent to initial recognition, these assets are accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy relating to that specific asset.
The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs in the income statement and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Lease payments under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Contingent liabilities are either possible obligations that will probably not require a transfer of economic benefits, or present obligations that may, but probably will not, require a transfer of economic benefits.
It is not appropriate to make provisions for contingent liabilities, but there is a chance that they will result in an obligation in the future.
Assessing the amount of liabilities that are not probable is highly judgemental so contingent liabilities are disclosed on the basis of the known maximum exposure.

Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial Statements 131 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNILEVER GROUP CONTINUED 20.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES CONTINUED CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Contingent liabilities are possible obligations that are not probable.
They arise in respect of litigation against group companies, investigations by competition, regulatory and fiscal authorities and obligations arising under environmental legislation.
In many markets, there is a high degree of complexity involved in the local tax regimes.
The majority of contingent liabilities are in respect of fiscal matters in Brazil.
Assessing the amount of liabilities that are not probable is highly judgemental.
During 2017 we have reviewed our approach and now contingent liabilities are disclosed on the basis of the known maximum exposure.
In the case of Brazil fiscal matters the known maximum exposure is the amount included on a tax assessment.
A summary of our contingent liabilities is shown in the table below.
million million 2017 2016 a Corporate reorganisation IPI, PIS and COFINS taxes and penalties 2,092 1,464 b Inclusion of ICMS in the tax base for PIS and COFINS taxes - 655 Inputs for PIS and COFINS taxes 16 113 Goodwill amortisation 121 36 Other tax assessments over 600 cases 1,095 1,093 Total Brazil Tax 3,324 3,361 Brazil other 19 42 Contingent liabilities outside Brazil 324 224 Total contingent liabilities 3,667 3,627 a During 2004, and in common with many other businesses operating in Brazil, one of our Brazilian subsidiaries received a notice of infringement from the Federal Revenue Service in respect of indirect taxes.
The notice alleges that a 2001 reorganisation of our local corporate structure was undertaken without valid business purpose.
The 2001 reorganisation was comparable with restructurings done by many companies in Brazil.
The original dispute was resolved in the courts in the Groups favour.
However, in 2013 a new assessment was raised in respect of a similar matter.
Additionally, during the course of 2014 and again in December 2017 other notices of infringement were issued based on the same grounds argued in the previous assessments.
The total amount of the tax assessments in respect of this matter is 2,092 million 2016: 1,464 million.
The judicial process in Brazil is likely to take a number of years to conclude.
b During 2006, Unilever filed a judicial measure to obtain the right to exclude the Brazilian ICMS indirect tax from the taxable base for the Brazilian PIS and COFINS indirect taxes, and obtained a favourable decision in 2007.
In November 2016, this favourable decision was reversed on appeal to a higher court, and the Group lodged a further appeal.
In 2017, the Supreme Court published a favourable decision on the leading case, which we expect to be applied to the Groups case.
As such, we have assessed the risk of outflow in relation to this case to now be remote and therefore is not a contingent liability.
The Group believes that the likelihood that the tax authorities will ultimately prevail is low, however there can be no guarantee of success in court.
In each case we believe our position is strong so they have not been provided for and are considered to be contingent liabilities.
Due to the fiscal environment in Brazil the possibility of further tax assessments related to the same matters cannot be ruled out.
The contingent liabilities reported for indirect taxes relating to disputes with the Brazilian authorities are separate from the provisions listed in note 19: Unilever does not have provision and contingent liabilities for the same matters.
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method as at the acquisition date, which is the date at which control is transferred to the Group.
Goodwill is measured at the acquisition date as the fair value of consideration transferred, plus non-controlling interests and the fair value of any previously-held equity interests less the net recognised amount which is generally fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is subject to an annual review for impairment or more frequently if necessary in accordance with our accounting policies.
Detailed information relating to goodwill is provided in note 9 on pages 108 to 110.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, within non-underlying items.
Changes in ownership that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions and therefore do not have any impact on goodwill.
The difference between consideration and the non-controlling share of net assets acquired is recognised within equity.
