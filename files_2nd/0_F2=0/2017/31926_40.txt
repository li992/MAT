In determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been those described in the summary of significant accounting policies on made.
The key assumptions, which are given below, are largely pages 117 to 122.
The Group evaluates segmental information on dependent on factors outside the control of the Group: the basis of profit or loss from operations before non-underlying Expected return on plan assets: items, interest and income tax expense.
The segmental results that Inflation rate: are reported to the Chief Executive include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a Mortality: reasonable basis.

Details of the assumptions used are included in note 8. d Provisions Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount and therefore in making a reliable estimate of the amount and timing of liabilities judgement is applied and re-evaluated at each reporting date.
e Goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of cash generating units CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimate to be made of the timing and amount of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and the application of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the net present value.
Cash flow forecasts for the next three years are based on the Groups budgets and forecasts.
Other key inputs in assessing each CGU are revenue growth, operating margin and discount rate.
The assumptions are set out in note 12 together with an assessment of the impact of reasonably possible sensitivities.
f Non-underlying items Non-underlying items are items of financial performance which the Group believes should be separately identified on the face of the income statement to assist in understanding the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group.
Determining whether an item is part of underlying or non-underlying items requires judgement.

co. uk 125 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 125 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 30 June 2017 1 4 Non-underlying items continued Portfolio simplification closure of businesses The ongoing programme of portfolio simplification, including the wind down and closure of the Hong Kong and Caribbean businesses and related final accounts contract settlements, resulted in costs of 86.7m.
The single remaining contract in the Caribbean is nearing completion.
The final contract in Hong Kong is complete with the final account in the final stages of negotiation.
The prior years charge included a 10.6m impairment of the UK Mining business which the Group is in the process of winding down and, consequently, the results are presented as continuing but non-underlying.
As a result of the charge in the prior year, the result of the mining operations in 2017 was nil.
Portfolio simplification sale of assets and other M&A activity The disposal of Mouchel Consulting in October 2016 generated a profit on sale of 40.0m and net cash proceeds of 58.9m.
Biogen Holdings Limited was sold in April 2017 generating a loss of 7.6m and net cash proceeds of 9.7m, following an impairment charge of 5.0m in the prior year.
The integration of Mouchel is complete and consequently there are no further costs of acquisition or integration in the current year 2016: 49.9m.
Other minor M&A activity took place during the year, including the sale of mining operations in Saudi Arabia, resulting in a total charge of 3.8m and 1.6m of transaction costs relating to the McNicholas acquisition, which took place post year end 2016: gain on sale of Kier FPS Limited: 1.7m.
Other non-underlying costs The Group continues to work through the legacy contract issues in the Environmental Services business against a backdrop of recyclate pricing pressure.
As a result of exiting one contract four years early and the current year impact of reduced recyclate income, a further charge of 11.1m has been taken.
The prior year charge of 35.6m similarly comprised of both contract costs and recyclate price impact.
A provision of 8.0m has been made for a potential increase in Health & Safety Executive fines arising from revised sentencing guidelines.
The establishment of the Cross Keys Homes joint venture in March 2017 resulted in initial costs of 2.2m.
Closure of acquired Mouchel Pension schemes to future accrual has resulted in a one-off pension curtailment gain of 6.0m.
Further details on amortisation of intangible contract rights and financing costs are given in note 12 and note 5.

8 Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of pension schemes for eligible employees as described below.
Kier Group scheme This is the principal scheme and includes a defined benefit section and a defined contribution section.
The assets of the scheme are held in trust separate from the assets of the Group.
The trustees are responsible for investing the assets and delegate day-to-day decisions to independent professional investment managers.
The defined benefit section of the scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 January 2002: existing members continued to accrue benefits for service until the scheme was closed to future accrual on 28 February 2015.
The contributions paid during the year were 16.9m 2016: 15.5m which included contributions of 15.5m 2016: 15.5m to fund the past service deficit.
Going forward, contributions will include an allowance for funding the past service deficit identified at the 2016 valuation date.
The Group expects to make contributions of 12.8m for funding the past service deficit and ongoing scheme administration costs in the year to 30 June 2018.
The Pension Protection Fund levy is payable in addition to the above contributions.
The scheme as at 30 June 2017 has 2,838 deferred members and 2,803 retirees.
Other defined benefit schemes Acquired with the May Gurney Group The May Gurney defined benefit scheme was acquired with May Gurney in the year to 30 June 2014.
This defined benefit scheme has closed to future accrual and the deficit contributions payable in the period to 30 June 2017 amounted to 2.1m 2016: 1.9m.
The trustees are responsible for decisions and holding the assets, and delegate day-to-day decisions to independent professional investment managers.
An actuarial valuation of the May Gurney scheme was undertaken by the trustees independent actuaries as at 31 March 2014 using the projected unit method.
The market value of the schemes assets at that date was 62.0m which represented approximately 83% of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date, after allowing for future increases in pensionable salaries.
Deficit contributions for the financial year to 30 June 2018 of 2.4m have been agreed with the trustees.
The scheme as at 30 June 2017 has 365 deferred members and 274 retirees.
Acquired with the Mouchel Group The Group acquired a number of defined benefit pension schemes with the Mouchel Group.

Other than the public sector comparable parts, the Mouchel schemes were closed to future accrual in 2010.
The remaining parts of most of the Mouchel schemes were closed to future accrual in the current year, resulting in a total curtailment gain of 6.0m.
A single public sector comparable scheme remains open to future accrual.
There is a deficit recovery plan in place for the Mouchel schemes, requiring deficit contributions of 8.6m in the year to 30 June 2018.
The contributions paid during the year were 12.3m 2016: 9.7m which included contributions of 10.7m 2016: 8.0m to fund the past service deficit.
In total, the schemes as at 30 June 2017 have 18 active members, 1,994 deferred members and 1,444 retirees.
The Mouchel schemes were formally valued by the trustees independent actuaries as at 31 March 2016.
Other defined contribution schemes Contributions are also made to a number of other defined contribution arrangements.
The Group paid contributions of 41.9m 2016: 43.2m during the year to these arrangements.
The Group also makes contributions to local government defined benefit pension schemes in respect of certain employees who have transferred to the Group under TUPE transfer arrangements.
The Group is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the schemes on a consistent and reasonable basis and consequently the pension costs for these schemes are treated as if they were defined contribution schemes.

In addition, the asset position may also be volatile as it will be influenced by changes in market conditions.
However, the risk of significant changes to the overall balance sheet position has been mitigated to an extent due to the asset hedging strategies in place for the schemes.
Pension sensitivity The following tables show the change in deficit arising from a change in the significant actuarial assumptions used to determine the retirement benefits obligations: Kier Group scheme: 2017 2016 0.25% 1 year -0.25% -1 year 0.25% 1 year -0.25% -1 year m m m m Discount rate -0.25% 45.4 48.2 43.7 46.4 Inflation rate -0.25% 43.2 41.5 41.6 40.7 Increase in life expectancy -1 year 36.1 36.3 32.9 32.9 May Gurney defined benefit schemes: 2017 2016 0.25% 1 year -0.25% -1 year 0.25% 1 year -0.25% -1 year m m m m Discount rate -0.25% 3.5 3.7 3.3 3.5 Inflation rate -0.25% 3.3 3.2 3.2 3.0 Increase in life expectancy -1 year 2.3 2.3 2.1 2.1 Mouchel defined benefit schemes: 2017 2016 0.25% 1 year -0.25% -1 year 0.25% 1 year -0.25% 1 year m m m m Discount rate -0.25% 21.3 22.5 20.8 22.2 Inflation rate -0.25% 22.4 21.2 22.1 20.8 Increase in life expectancy -1 year 14.2 14.2 13.1 13.1 The sensitivity analyses above have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period and may not be representative of the actual change, which is based on a change in a key assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
When calculating the sensitivity to the assumption, the same method used to calculate the liability recognised in the balance sheet has been applied.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses did not change compared with the previous period.

Amortisation disclosed as non-underlying separately relates to the amortisation of contract right costs held as intangibles on the balance sheet.
Kier Group and its subsidiaries are based predominantly in the UK and are subject to UK corporation tax.
The Group does not have an aggressive tax policy and since 1 July 2012 Kier has not entered into any tax avoidance schemes which were or should have been notified under the Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Scheme DOTAS rules.
The tax charge before non-underlying items and amortisation of contract rights of 21.9m 2016: 20.9m shown in the table above equates to an effective tax rate of 17.4% 2016: 18.0% on adjusted profit before tax of 127.0m 2016: 116.8m.
This effective rate is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax of 19.75% 2016: 20.00% due to a number of items shown in the table above.
The nondeductible expenses included in underlying mainly relate to depreciation on non-qualifying assets.
In accordance with UK tax legislation, capital gains arising on disposal of certain investments, including some of the joint ventures disposed of during the year, are not subject to tax.
Tax relief on expenses not recognised in the income statement includes the impact of the tax deduction received in respect of the cost of shares exercised under the Groups employee Save As You Earn Scheme and Long Term Incentive Plan.
The net charge adjustment of 2.3m 2016: credit of 1.4m in respect of prior years results arise from differences between the estimates of taxation included in the previous years financial statements and the actual tax liabilities calculated in the tax returns submitted to and agreed by HMRC.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 10.6m 2016: 23.3m of income tax losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams against which these losses could be offset.
Under present tax legislation, these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

Goodwill largely relates to the Services cash generating unit CGU.
This has been built up by the acquisition of MRBL Limited Mouchel Group 309.3m, May Gurney Integrated Services PLC 194.7m, Kier Partnership Homes Limited 5.2m, Pure Recycling Limited 4.8m, Beco Limited 2.6m and Southdale 0.8m.
These balances have been subject to an annual impairment review based upon the projected profits of each CGU.
The cost of contract rights relates to: The acquisition of the businesses and assets of the construction and business services operations of Sheffield City Council 21.3m, Stoke-on-Trent City Council 1.9m and North Tyneside Council 7.2m.
These contracts are in partnership with the respective councils that have retained a participatory ownership interest and the rights for a minority share in the profits.
These profit shares are reflected in the income statement as minority interests.
The amounts for the year to 30 June 2017 are: Stoke-onTrent City Council 0.5m 2016: 0.5m, North Tyneside Council 0.2m 2016: 0.2m, Unity Partnership 0.4m 2016: nil : The acquisition of Pure Recycling Limited 2.0m and Stewart Milne 1.0m : The acquisition of a commercial refuse collections business from Wealdon District Council 3.6m : The acquisition of May Gurney Integrated Services plc 106.7m : and The acquisition of MRBL Limited Mouchel Group 138.6m.

The recoverable amount of the goodwill and intangibles has been determined based on value in use calculations, which use cash flow projections based on the Groups forecasts approved by management, covering a three-year period.
The resulting cash flows are discounted to present value, with the discount rate used in the value in use calculations based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted as necessary to reflect the risk associated with the assets being tested.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the forecast revenues and gross margins during the forecast period and the discount rates applied to future cash flows.
Cash flows for periods beyond those forecast have a terminal growth rate assumption applied.
Significant headroom exists in all CGUs and management considers that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not lead to an impairment being recognised.
Services CGU A revenue growth rate of 1.9% and a fixed operating margin of 5.0% have been applied to the Services CGU cash flows into perpetuity.
These assumptions are in line with current trading and current forecasts of UK GDP growth rate.
The pre-tax discount rate used is 9.2% 2016: 9.3%.
Based on the value in use calculation, these assumptions derived a recoverable amount for the Services CGU that is 510.0m above the carrying value of CGU assets.
The Services CGU impairment review is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions: discount rate, revenue growth rate and the operating margin, although management do not consider that any reasonable possible change in any single assumption would give rise to an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles.
The assumptions would have to change as follows for any single assumption change to bring headroom down to nil: Discount rate increase from 9.2% to 14.0%: Growth rate reduce from positive 1.9% to negative 6.1%: and Underlying operating margin reduce from 5.0% to 2.2%.

The fair value of the TSR element incorporates an assessment of the number of shares that will be awarded, as the performance conditions are market conditions under IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
The performance conditions of the EPS and the net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ratio Net Debt:EBITDA elements are non-market conditions under IFRS 2.
The fair value therefore does not include an assessment of the number of shares that will be awarded.
Instead the amount charged for this element is based on the fair value factored by a true-up for the number of awards that are expected to vest.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
An amount of 2.7m relating to share-based payments has been recognised in the income statement as employee costs 2016: 5.6m.
Included in other payables is an amount of 0.7m 2016: 0.8m relating to provisions for employers national insurance.

During the year, the directors have reviewed the aggregate potential liability which may arise from certain safety, health and environmental incidents which took place before the implementation of relevant sentencing guidelines in February 2016.
Following this review, a provision has been made for the directors current estimate of the financial impact on the Group.
For further details, please see note 4 to the financial statements.
27 Financial instruments Capital risk management The Groups capital management objectives are: to ensure the Groups ability to continue as a going concern: and to optimise the capital structure in order to minimise the cost of capital: whilst maintaining a strong balance sheet to support business development and tender qualification.
The four operating divisions of the Group have complementary capital characteristics, with the Construction division, and to a lesser extent the Services division, generating a net cash surplus, whilst the Property and Residential divisions require net capital to fund developments.
The Groups capital management strategy is to use a blend of capital types with different risk, return and maturity profiles to support the operating divisions and deliver the Groups capital management objectives.
The Groups overall capital risk management strategy remains unchanged from 2016.
The capital structure of the Group comprises: equity, consisting of share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity: and cash, cash equivalents and borrowings as disclosed in note 20 and described further below.
The Group forecasts and monitors short, medium and longer-term capital needs on a regular basis and adjusts its capital structure as required through the payment of dividends to shareholders, the issue of new share capital and the increase or repayment of borrowings.
All investment decisions are made with regard to the Groups weighted average cost of capital and typically a pre-tax annualised return of at least 15.0% is required to ensure such investments are value enhancing for shareholders.
Financial risk management Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk.
The overall aim of the Groups financial risk management policies is to minimise any potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
The Groups treasury team manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating limits approved by the Board.
The treasury function is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest and exchange rates and some commodity prices.
redit risk Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and interest rate and currency hedges.
Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
The Groups most significant clients are public or regulated industry entities which generally have high credit ratings or are of a high credit quality due to the nature of the client.
Short-term bank deposits and hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major ratings agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are within acceptable limits.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are stated net of bad debt provisions which have been estimated by management following a review of individual receivable accounts.
There is no Group-wide rate of provision and provision made for debts that are overdue is based on prior default experience and known factors at the balance sheet date.
Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below: 2017 2016 m m Provision as at 1 July 20.0 14.3 Credited charged to the income statement 0.8 5.7 Divested in the year 11.0 Provision as at 30 June 8.2 20.0 146 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 146 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements There were 82.9m 2016: 88.4m of trade receivables that were overdue at the balance sheet date that have not been provided against, of which 48.5m 2016: 43.2m had been received by the end of August 2017.
There are no indications as at 30 June 2017 that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are overdue and un-provided.
The proportion of trade receivables at 30 June 2017 that were overdue for payment was 37.8% 2016: 41.7%.
Credit terms vary across the Group: the average age of trade receivables was as follows: Construction 16 days 2016: 19 days Services 14 days 2016: 12 days Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to significant credit risk.
Market risk Interest rate risk The Group has borrowing facilities to finance short-term working capital requirements and term loans to finance medium-term capital requirements, which carry interest at floating rates, at a margin over LIBOR.
The Groups borrowings, excluding the effect of derivatives, can be analysed as follows: 2017 2016 m m Fixed rate 288.0 276.2 Variable rate 346.5 30.0 Cost of raising finance 2.7 3.0 631.8 303.2 In addition, a number of the Groups joint ventures have entered into interest rate swaps where there is significant interest rate risk.
Foreign currency risk The Group operates primarily within the UK such that its exposure to currency risk is not considered to be significant.
Where significant foreign currency exposures are identified, these are hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts or swaps.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund operations without the need to carry significant net debt over the medium term.
The Groups principal borrowing facilities are provided by a syndicate of relationship banks and established investors, and in the case of a number of our Loan Notes, in the form of unsecured committed borrowing facilities.
The amount of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
On the 6 July 2017 the Group renegotiated the Revolving Credit Facility, extending the renewal date and total facility level.
See note 32 for further details.
Derivative financial instruments During 2013 the Group entered into three cross-currency swaps to hedge the currency risk on a US dollar denominated loan, nominal value US$28.0m.
During 2014 the Group entered into four cross-currency swaps to hedge the currency risk on a US dollar denominated loan, nominal value US$116.0m.
During 2016 the Group entered into two cross-currency swaps to hedge the currency risk on a Euro denominated loan, nominal value 20.0m, and three interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk on a GBP denominated loan, nominal value 58.5m.
During 2017 the Group reduced the value on the HSBC interest rate swap from 15.0m to 10.0m and entered into an additional swap of 12.0m bringing the total value to 65.5m.
These swaps continue to meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
The following table indicates the periods in which the cash flows associated with cash flow hedges are expected to occur, how those cash flows will impact the income statement and the fair value of the related hedging instruments: Expected cash flows More than Fair value Total 01 years 12 years 25 years 5 years m m m m m m Continuing operations Cross-currency swaps: asset Gross settled inflows 163.1 5.4 5.4 46.1 106.2 Gross settled outflows 135.6 4.6 4.6 38.9 87.5 18.9 27.5 0.8 0.8 7.2 18.7 Interest rate swaps: liability Net settled 0.3 1.5 0.4 0.4 0.7 In addition to the above, a number of the Groups PFI and property joint ventures have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
Interest-bearing debts and associated interest rate derivatives within these joint ventures have a typical term of between 20 and 25 years and are without recourse to the Group.
At 30 June 2017 the aggregate amount outstanding on these interestbearing debts against which interest rate derivatives are held is 82.9m 2016: 121.9m.
The Groups share of the total net fair value liability of these interest rate derivatives at 30 June 2017 amounted to 6.3m 2016: 8.0m which, together with the related deferred tax asset of 1.1m 2016: 1.4m, have met the criteria for hedge accounting.

158 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 158 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 32 Events after the end of the reporting period Acquisition of McNicholas On 12 July 2017, the Group acquired the entire share capital of McNicholas Construction Holdings Limited McNicholas, a leading infrastructure services provider.
The acquisition of McNicholas builds on the Groups strategy to accelerate growth and hold leading positions in its chosen markets.
The Board believes the acquisition is a highly complementary addition to the Groups utility services business and enhances the Groups presence in the power, rail and telecoms markets, with its long-standing client relationships.
The maximum consideration payable for the acquisition is 27.4m, comprising 13.4m in cash paid at completion and 14.0m of deferred contingent consideration.
The 14.0m of deferred contingent consideration comprises: 9.5m in cash payable on achieving certain EBITDA earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation targets: and 4.5m payable on achieving debt-recovery targets.
The fair value of the total consideration expected to be paid is 21.9m.
The fair value of net liabilities acquired totalled 33.0m.
Due to the proximity of the acquisition to the Groups reporting date, the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired are provisional to allow for further adjustments in the measurement period.
The difference between the fair value of consideration and net liabilities acquired of 54.9m will be attributed to goodwill and intangible fixed assets including contract rights.
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The majority of the 1.8m of acquisition costs were incurred in the year and were expensed to the income statement as a nonunderlying item.
As McNicholas was acquired after the end of the current reporting period, the business made no contribution to the Group revenue or underlying profit before taxation in the year.
Renegotiation of financing facilities On 6 July 2017 the Group extended the tenor, to April 2022, of its core multi-bank Revolving Credit Facility.
In addition to a lower borrowing rate, the banking group has been extended and the total available facilities have been increased to 670.0m from 400.0m.
