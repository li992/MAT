The amount of the dilution is taken to be the average market price of shares during the period minus the exercise price.
There were no material awards considered anti-dilutive at the reporting date.
The average market price of one share during the year was 285.56p 2016: 283.67p.

Net of 0.2m derecognised on the finalisation of the accounting for prior year acquisitions previously reported on a provisional basis Cash-generating units CGUs, defined as individual business centres, are grouped by country of operation for the purposes of carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill as this is the lowest level at which it can be assessed.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is held at a country level and is subject to impairment reviews based on the cash flows of the CGUs within that country.
98, : 3 & $118$ 5 3257 $1' $&&28176 Strategic report Governance Financial statements The goodwill attributable to the reportable business segments is as follows: 2017 2016 Carrying amount of goodwill included within: m m Americas 285.8 311.1 EMEA 125.1 119.4 Asia 34.7 35.4 United Kingdom 221.1 219.4 666.7 685.3 The carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles allocated to two countries, the USA and the UK, is material relative to the total carrying value, comprising 73% of the total.

The value in use for each country has been determined using a model which derives the individual value in use for each country from the value in use of the Group as a whole.
Although the model includes budgets and forecasts prepared by management it also reflects external factors, such as capital market risk pricing as reflected in the market capitalisation of the Group and prevailing tax rates, which have been used to determine the risk adjusted discount rate for the Group.
Management believes that the projected cash flows are a reasonable reflection of the likely outcomes over the medium to long term.
In the event that trading conditions deteriorate beyond the assumptions used in the projected cash flows, it is also possible that impairment charges could arise in future periods.
The following key assumptions have been used in calculating the value in use for each country: Future cash flows are based on forecasts prepared by management.
The model excludes cost savings and restructurings that are anticipated but had not been committed to at the date of the determination of the value in use.
Thereafter, forecasts have been prepared by management for a further four years from 2018 that reflect an average annual growth rate of 3% 2017: 3% : These forecasts exclude the impact of acquisitive growth expected to take place in future periods: Management considers these projections to be a reasonable projection of margins expected at the mid-cycle position.
Cash flows beyond 2021 have been extrapolated using a 2% growth rate which management believes is a reasonable long-term growth rate for any of the markets in which the relevant countries operate.
A terminal value is included in the assessment, reflecting the Groups expectation that it will continue to operate in these markets and the long-term nature of the businesses: and The Group applies a country specific pre-tax discount rate to the pre-tax cash flows for each country.
The country specific discount rate is based on the underlying weighted average cost of capital WACC for the Group.
The Group WACC is then adjusted for each country to reflect the assessed market risk specific to that country.
The Group pre-tax WACC decreased from 11.3% in 2016 to 9.9% in 2017 post-tax WACC: 7.9%.
The country specific pre-tax WACC reflecting the respective market risk adjustment has been set between 9.3% and 12.8% 2016: 10.7% to 14.2%.
The amounts by which the values in use exceed the carrying amounts of goodwill are sufficiently large to enable the Directors to conclude that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not result in an impairment charge in any of the countries.
Foreseeable events are unlikely to result in a change in the projections of such a significant nature as to result in the goodwill carrying amount exceeding their recoverable amount.
The forecast models used in assessing the impairment of goodwill are based on the related business centre structure at the end of the year.
The US model assumes an average centre contribution of 17% over the next five years.
Revenue and costs grow at 3% per annum from 2018.
A terminal value centre gross margin of 17% is adopted from 2021, with a 2% long-term growth rate assumed on revenue and costs into perpetuity.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10% 2016: 14%.
The UK model assumes an average centre contribution of 17% over the next five years.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10% 2016: 11%.
