The arrangements can be complex, with amounts spanning multiple products over different time periods, and there can be multiple triggers and discounts.
The accrued value at the reporting date is included in trade receivables or trade payables, depending on the right of offset.
The four key types are as follows: Discounts and supplier incentives these represent the majority of all supplier arrangements and are linked to individual unit sales.

5 Operating profit Accounting policies Revenue Revenue consists of sales through retail outlets and online and, in the case of Financial Services, interest receivable, fees and commissions and excludes Value Added Tax.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of goods and services have been passed to the buyer and it can be measured reliably.
a Retail sale of goods Sales through retail outlets are shown net of returns, the cost of Nectar reward points issued and redeemed, colleague discounts, vouchers and sales made on an agency basis.
Commission income is recognised in revenue based on the terms of the contract.
Sales of in-store goods are generally recognised at the point of cash receipt.
Where Nectar credits such as vouchers or loyalty points are provided as part of the sales transaction, the amount allocated to the credits is deferred and recognised when the credits are redeemed and the Group fulfils its obligations to supply the credit.
For delivered goods, sales are recognised when the goods have been delivered.
b Other income Other income generally consists of profits and losses on disposal of assets.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
c Financial Services interest receivable Interest income is recognised in the income statement for all instruments measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
This calculation takes into account all amounts that are integral to the yield as well as incremental transaction costs.
The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the expected future cash flows over the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability at initial recognition.
d Financial Services fees and commissions Fees and commissions that are not integral to the effective interest rate calculation relate primarily to certain credit card and storecard fees, ATM interchange fees, insurance introduction commission and warranty commission receivable.
These are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis as services are provided.
Where in the case of insurance commissions the income comprises an initial commission and profit share, both are recognised on completion of the service to the extent reliably measurable.
Where there is a risk of potential claw back, an appropriate element of the commission receivable is deferred and amortised over the clawback period.
Where the relevant contract requires Financial Services to perform future services in respect of the income receivable, initial commission is recognised on completion of the service provided, with an element deferred to reflect services yet to be performed in future periods.
e Financial Services other operating income Margin from the sale of travel money, representing the difference between the cost price and the selling price, is recognised when the sale to the customer takes place within other operating income.
Cost of sales Cost of sales consists of all costs that are directly attributable to the point of sale including warehouse, transportation costs and all the costs of operating retail outlets.
In the case of Financial Services, cost of sales includes interest expense on operating activities, calculated using the effective interest method.

122 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 6 Finance income and finance costs Accounting policies Finance income and costs, excluding those arising from Financial Services, are recognised in the income statement for financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
For Financial Services, finance income and finance costs are recognised in revenue and cost of sales.
Interest paid and interest received for the purpose of the cash flow statement relates to retail only, with Financial Services interest paid and interest received included in the net operating cash flow.
The coupons on the perpetual capital securities and perpetual convertible bonds are accounted for as dividends in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and hence are not a finance cost.

Financial Statements 123 7 Taxation Accounting policies Current tax Current tax is accounted for on the basis of tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Current tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged to equity or other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is accounted for on the basis of temporary differences arising from differences between the tax base and accounting base of assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences, except to the extent where it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit.
It is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures except where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The main rate of UK corporation tax is reducing from 20 per cent to 19 per cent effective from 1 April 2017.
A further reduction in the corporation tax rate to 17 per cent, rather than 18 per cent, effective from 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted in the year, so its effect is reflected in these financial statements.
Deferred tax on temporary differences and tax losses as at the balance sheet date is calculated at the substantively enacted rates at which the temporary differences and tax losses are expected to reverse.
Income tax charged or credited to equity and or other comprehensive income during the year is as follows: Retirement Perpetual benefit Fair value security 1 1 2 obligations movements coupons Total m m m m 52 weeks to 11 March 2017 Current tax recognised in equity or other comprehensive income 41 1 5 45 Deferred tax recognised in equity or other comprehensive income 28 5 33 Income tax charged credited 69 4 5 78 52 weeks to 12 March 2016 Current tax recognised in equity or other comprehensive income 6 6 Deferred tax recognised in equity or other comprehensive income 36 3 33 Income tax charged credited 36 3 6 27 1 Recognised in other comprehensive income.

8 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan trusts note 22, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the earnings attributable to the ordinary shareholders are adjusted by the interest on the senior convertible bonds net of tax and by the coupons on the perpetual subordinated convertible bonds net of tax.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the number of shares that would be issued if all senior convertible bonds and perpetual subordinated convertible bonds are assumed to be converted.
Underlying earnings per share is provided by excluding the effect of any non-underlying items as defined in note 3.
This alternative measure of earnings per share is presented to reflect the Groups underlying trading performance.
