Financial Statements 135 Notes to the Group Financial Statements 1.
General Information Vesuvius plc Vesuvius or the Company is a public company limited by shares.
It is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Company and its subsidiary and joint venture companies the Group is set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 73 and its registered address is shown on page 189.
Basis of Preparation 2.1 Basis of accounting The Group Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, with the exception of fide ned bene t pension plans, certain provisions, available-for-sale investments and derivative financial instruments.
2.2 Basis of consolidation The Group Financial Statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Control exists when the Company has the power to direct the relevant activities of an entity that signi cantly affect the entitys return so as to have rights to the variable return from its activities.
In assessing whether control exists, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are taken into account.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Group Income Statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Group Financial Statments are set out in the Notes.
These policies have been consistently applied to all of the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those detailed herein to ensure that the Group financial statements are prepared on a consistent basis.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identi ed separately from the Groups interest therein.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination together with the non-controlling interests share of pro t or loss, each component of other comprehensive income, and dividends paid since the date of the combination.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a fide cit balance.
2.3 Going concern The Directors have prepared cash ow forecasts for the Group for a period in excess of 12 months from the date of approval of the 2017 financial statements.
These forecasts re ect an assessment of current and future end-market conditions and their impact on the Groups future trading performance.
The forecasts show that the Group will be able to operate within the current committed debt facilities and show continued compliance with the Companys financial covenants.
On the basis of the exercise described above and the Groups available committed debt facilities, the Directors consider that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing of these accounts.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt a going concern basis in preparing the financial statements of the Group and the Company.
2.4 Functional and presentation currency The financial statements are presented in millions of pound sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and rounded to one decimal place.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in Note 27.1.
2.5 Disclosure of separately reported items IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements encourages the disclosure of additional line items and the reordering of items presented on the face of the income statement when appropriate for a proper understanding of the entitys financial performance.
The Company has adopted a columnar presentation for its Group Income Statement, to separately identify headline performance results, as the Directors consider that this gives a better view of the underlying results of the ongoing business.
As part of this presentation format, the Company has adopted a policy of disclosing separately on the face of its Group Income Statement, within the column entitled Separately reported items, the effect of any components of financial performance for which the Directors consider separate disclosure would assist both in a better understanding of the financial performance achieved and in making projections of future results.
Both materiality and the nature and function of the components of income and expense are considered in deciding upon such presentation.
Such items may include, inter alia, the financial effect of exceptional items which occur infrequently, such as major restructuring activity, initial recognition and subsequent increase, decrease, utilisation and impact of tax reform on US deferred tax assets, together with items always reported separately, such as amortisation charges relating to acquired intangible assets, pro ts or losses arising on the disposal of continuing or discontinued operations and the taxation impact of the aforementioned exceptional items and items reported separately.
Vesuvius plc 136 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 2.
Basis of Preparation continued 2.5 Disclosure of separately reported items continued The amortisation charge in respect of intangible assets recognised on business combniations is excluded from the trading results of the Group since they are non-cash charges and are not considered reflective of the core trading performance of the Group.
Restructuring charges are excluded from the trading results of the Group due to the material nature of these non-recurring transformational initiatives.
In its adoption of this policy, the Company applies an even-handed approach to both gains and losses and aims to be both consistent and clear in its accounting and disclosure of such items.
2.6 New and revised IFRS Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2017 reporting periods and have not been early adopted by the Group.
The Groups assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below.
Other new or amended standards or interpretations are not expected to have a signi cant impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective from 1 January 2018, for the year ending 2018 addresses the classi cation, measurement and derecognition of financial instruments, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets.
It replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments guidance and comprehensive updates have been made to IFRS 7 Financial Instrument: Disclosure and IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation.
The Group will apply IFRS 9 and the updated IFRS 7 disclosure requirements from their effective date.
The impact assessment performed by the Group included a review of the classi cation and measurement of financial instruments: the impairment of financial assets and the group hedging policy which resulted in the following conclusions: The group reviewed the classi cation and measurement of each of its financial instruments.
Although, the classi cation of instruments is altered under IFRS 9, this does not result in any changes to the measurement approach apart from the impairment of trade receivables which is addressed below.
The new impairment model for financial assets requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected credit losses ECL rather than only incurred credit losses as is the case under IAS 39.
The Group will apply the simpli ed approach to its trade receivables as per the scope exception in IFRS 9 in which all loss allowances for trade receivables will be measured at initial recognition and throughout its life at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.
This is consistent with the nature of the groups trade receivables as they do not include a signi cant nancing component.
Based on the assessments undertaken to date, the group does not expect a material movement in the loss allowance for trade debtors.
The new hedge accounting rules will align the accounting for hedging instruments more closely with the Groups risk management practices.
The Group has con rmed that its current net investment hedge relationship will qualify as a continuing hedge upon the adoption of IFRS 9.
Based on our assessment of the adoption of IFRS 9, the Group does not believe there will be a material impact on its Group Financial Statements.
From 1 January 2018 onwards, the Group will amend its financial instruments and hedging accounting policies to re ect IFRS 9 terminology and prepare the appropriate disclosures regarding the classi cation and measurement of financial instruments: impairment of financial assets and hedging.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective after 1 January 2018, for the year ending 2018 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised.
It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes.
The Group will apply IFRS 15 from its effective date.
The impact assessment performed by the Group included a review of revenue streams and customer contracts to identify distinct performance obligations and the appropriate method for allocating the transaction price.
Based on our assessment of the adoption of IFRS 15, the Group does not believe there will be a material impact on its Group Financial Statements.
During 2018, the Group will revise the revenue recognition policy to re ect IFRS 15 terminology, prepare the additional disclosures for the Group Financial Statements and continue to review contracts across all Segments.
The Group will continue to disaggregate revenue over Steel and Foundry in the Segmental Analysis note.
Financial Statements 137 IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 Leases effective after 1 January 2019, for the year ending 2019 replaces the existing guidance in IAS 17 Leases.
IFRS 16 provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value.
The present value of the Groups operating lease payments as fide ned under the new standard will be shown as lease liabilities on the balance sheet and included in net debt.
There are a number of differences between the two fide nitions: for example, where there is an option to extend the lease, payments for the extension period will be included in the IFRS 16 liability if the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise the option, but are not included as commitments under IAS 17.
The Group is currently assessing the potential impact on its Group Financial Statements resulting from the application of IFRS 16.
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments effective from 1 January 2019, for the year ending 2019, not yet endorsed clari es how to recognise and measure deferred and current income tax assets and liabilities where there is uncertainty over tax treatment under IAS 12.
The Group is currently assessing the potential impact on its Group Financial Statements resulting from the application of IFRIC 23.
IFRIC Interpretation - Interest and Penalties on Tax The impact of the interpretation regarding the accounting treatment of interest and penalties on tax is set out in Note 10.1.
Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Judgements and Estimates Determining the carrying amount of some assets and liabilities requires estimation of the effect of uncertain future events.
The major sources of estimation uncertainty that have a signi cant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities are noted below.
All other accounting policies are included within the respective Notes to the financial statements.
3.1 Provisions Vesuvius has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and environmental matters.
Several of the Groups subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities.
Provisions are made for the expected amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims, as described in Note 32.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing and amount of the associated out ows are subject to some uncertainty.
The Directors use their judgement and experience to make appropriate estimates of provisions in the financial statements for amounts relating to such matters.
3.2 Taxation a Current tax Tax bene ts are not recognised unless it is probable that they will result in future economic bene ts to the Group.
In assessing the amount of the bene t to be recognised in the financial statements, the Directors exercise their judgement in considering the effect of negotiations, litigation and any other matters that they consider may impact upon the potential settlement.
The Group operates internationally and is subject to tax in many different jurisdictions.
As a consequence, the Group is routinely subject to tax audits and local enquiries which, by their very nature, can take a considerable period of time to conclude.
Provisions are made for known issues based on all substantively enacted legislation, the Directors interpretation of country-speci c tax law and their assessment of the likely outcome, taking into consideration the Groups experience in agreeing tax liabilities with tax authorities and appropriate external advice.
As indicated in Note 10.5, these provisions amount to 23.2m 2016: 24.5m at the end of 2017.
Further discussion of these provisions is contained in that Note.
All income tax liabilities, provisions and assets are treated as income tax payable and recoverable in accordance with IAS 12. b Deferred tax The Group has recognised deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised losses and other timing differences arising in a number of the Groups businesses, further details of which are given in Note 10.4.
Account has been taken of future forecasts of taxable pro t in arriving at the values at which these assets are recognised.
If these forecast pro ts do not materialise or change, or there are changes in tax rates or to the period over which the losses or timing differences might be recognised, then the value of deferred tax assets will need to be revised in a future period.
Vesuvius plc 138 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 3.
Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Judgements and Estimates continued b Deferred tax continued The Group also has losses and other timing differences, also analysed in Note 10.4, for which no deferred tax assets have been recognised in these financial statements, relating either to loss-making subsidiaries where the future economic bene t of the timing difference is not probable or to where the timing difference is of such a nature that its value is dependent on certain types of pro t being earned, such as capital pro ts.
If trading or other appropriate pro ts are earned in the future in these companies, these losses and other timing differences may yield bene t to the Group in the form of a reduced tax charge.
As explained in Note 10.2, the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA enacted in late December 2017 had a material impact on the Groups deferred tax position.
TCJA was introduced very rapidly, and consequently there is much uncertainty about how some of the provisions will operate.
As explained in Note 10.6, Vesuvius currently understands that the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax BEAT will impact its tax charge in the US in 2018 and beyond, in relation to certain payments made to non-US related parties.
Further clari cation is awaited from US Treasury so the precise impact of BEAT cannot be determined with certainty at this point.
Other reasonable estimations have been made in determining how US tax reform will impact on Vesuvius US 2017 deferred tax position in particular in relation to earnings and pro ts of Vesuvius non-US investments to be included in the deemed repatriation tolling charge calculations included in its 2017 taxable income.
As guidance is given by the US Treasury Department on how these, and other provisions of TCJA, are to operate, Vesuvius tax position may be impacted.
Alternative Performance Measures The Company uses a number of alternative performance measures APMs in addition to those reported in accordance with IFRS.
The Directors believe that these APMs, listed below, are important when assessing the underlying financial and operating performance of the Group and its divisions, providing management with key insights and metrics in support of the ongoing management of the Groups performance and cash ow.
A number of these align with KPIs and other key metrics used in the business and therefore are considered useful to also disclose to the users of the financial statements.
The following APMs do not have standardised meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with similar measures presented by other companies.
4.1 Headline Headline performance, reported separately on the face of the Group Income Statement, is from continuing operations and before items reported separately on the face of the Group Income Statement.
4.2 Underlying revenue, underlying trading pro t and underlying return on sales Underlying revenue, underlying trading pro t and underlying return on sales are the headline equivalents of these measures after adjustments to exclude the effects of changes in exchange rates, business acquisitions and disposals.
Reconciliations of underlying revenue and underlying trading pro t can be found in the Financial Review.
Underlying revenue growth is one of the Groups key performance indicators and provides an important measure of organic growth of Group businesses between reporting periods, by eliminating the impact of exchange rates, acquisitions, disposals and signi cant business closures.
4.3 Return on sales ROS ROS is calculated as trading pro t divided by revenue.
It is one of the Groups key performance indicators and is used to assess the trading performance of Group businesses.
A reconciliation of ROS is included in Note 5.3.
4.4 Trading pro t Trading pro t, reported separately on the face of the Group Income Statement, is fide ned as operating pro t before separately reported items.
It is also used as one of the targets against which the annual bonuses of certain employees are measured.
4.5 Headline pro t before tax Headline pro t before tax, reported separately on the face of the Group Income Statement, is calculated as the net total of trading pro t, plus the Groups share of post-tax pro t of joint ventures and total net finance costs associated with headline performance.
It is one of the Groups key performance indicators and is used to assess the financial performance of the Group as a whole.
4.6 Effective tax rate ETR The Groups ETR is calculated on the income tax costs associated with headline performance, divided by headline pro t before tax and before the Groups share of post-tax pro t of joint ventures.
Financial Statements 139 4.7 Headline earnings per share Headline earnings per share is calculated by dividing headline pro t before tax less associated income tax costs, attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
It is one of the Groups key performance indicators and is used to assess the underlying earnings performance of the Group as a whole.
Headline earnings per share is disclosed in Note 11.
4.8 Operating cash ow Operating cash ow is cash generated from continuing operations before restructuring and net retirement bene t obligations but after deducting capital expenditure net of asset disposals.
It is used in calculating the Groups cash conversion.
A reconciliation of cash generated from operations to operating cash ow can be found in the Financial Review.
4.9 Cash conversion Cash conversion is calculated as operating cash ow from continuing operations divided by trading pro t. It is useful for measuring the rate at which cash is generated from trading pro t. It is also used as one of the targets against which the annual bonuses of certain employees are measured.
The calculation of cash conversion is detailed in the Financial Review.
4.10 Free cash ow Free cash ow is fide ned as net cash ow from operating activities after net outlays for the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment, dividends from joint ventures and dividends paid to non-controlling shareholders, but before additional funding contributions to Group pension plans.
It is one of the Groups key performance indicators and is used to assess the underlying cash generation of the Group and is one of the measures used in monitoring the Groups capital.
A reconciliation of free cash ow is included underneath the Group Statement of Cash Flows.
4.11 Average trade working capital to sales ratio The average trade working capital to sales ratio is calculated as the percentage of average trade working capital balances to the total revenue for the year, at constant currency.
Average trade working capital comprising inventories, trade receivables and trade payables is calculated as the average of the 12 previous month-end balances.
It is one of the Groups key performance indicators and is useful for measuring the level of working capital used in the business and is one of the measures used in monitoring the Groups capital.
4.12 Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA EBITDA is calculated as the total of trading pro t before depreciation and amortisation of non-acquired intangible assets.
It is used in the calculation of the Groups interest cover and net debt to EBITDA ratios.
A reconciliation of EBITDA is included in Note 12.
4.13 Net interest Net interest is calculated as interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable, excluding any item separately reported.
It is used in the calculation of the Groups interest cover ratio.
4.14 Interest cover Interest cover is the ratio of EBITDA to net interest.
It is one of the Groups key performance indicators and is used to assess the financial position of the Group and its ability to fund future growth.
This measure is also a component of the Groups covenant calculations.
4.15 Net debt Net debt comprises the net total of current and non-current interest-bearing borrowings and cash and short-term deposits.
Net debt is a measure of the Groups net indebtedness to banks and other external financial institutions.
A reconciliation of the movement in net debt is included in Note 14 of the Group Financial Statements.
4.16 Net debt to EBITDA Net debt to EBITDA is the ratio of net debt at the year-end to EBITDA for that year.
It is one of the Groups key performance indicators and is used to assess the financial position of the Group and its ability to fund future growth and is one of the measures used in monitoring the Groups capital.
4.17 Return on net assets RONA RONA is calculated as trading pro t plus share of post-tax pro t of joint ventures, divided by average net operating assets, at constant currency being the average over the previous 12 months of property, plant and equipment, trade working capital and other operating receivables and payables.
It is one of the Groups key performance indicators and is used to assess the financial performance and asset management of the Group and is one of the measures used in monitoring the Groups capital.
4.18 Constant currency Figures presented at constant currency represent 2016 amounts retranslated to average 2017 exchange rates.

Segment Information The segment information contained in this Note makes reference to several alternative performance measures, fide nitions of which can be found in Note 4.
5.1 Business segments Operating segments for continuing operations Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Executive Directors of the Board, who make the key operating decisions and are responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.
Re ecting the Groups management and internal reporting structure, segmental information is presented in respect of the two main business segments: Steel and Foundry.
The Steel segment aggregates the Flow Control, Advanced Refractories and Digital Services divisions which are subject to a similar risk pro le and return.
The principal activities of each of these segments are described in the Strategic Report on pages 32 to 49.
Segment revenue represents revenue from external customers inter-segment revenue is not material.
Trading pro t includes items directly attributable to a segment as well as those items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
5.2 Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered to customers after deducting rebates, discounts and value-added taxes, and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when persuasive evidence exists that the signi cant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
A provision for anticipated returns is made based primarily on historical return rates.
Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate elements that can be provided to customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an extra, such as the provision of supplementary materials with equipment, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contractual arrangement.

Net Finance Costs 9.1 Accounting policy Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.
Capitalised borrowing costs for 2017 were nil 2016: nil.
All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the Group Income Statement using the effective interest rate method.

Income Tax 10.1 Accounting policy Tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in pro t or loss except to the extent that they relate to items charged or credited in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income or Group Statement of Changes in Equity, in which case the associated tax is also recognised in those statements.
In arriving at its current tax charge, the Group also makes careful assessment of the likely impact of tax law changes.
In particular, it has considered the impact of US tax reform enacted in December 2017 in the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA and other recently announced tax reform, for example in Belgium.
Current tax Current tax is based on taxable pro t for the year.
Taxable pro t differs from pro t before tax as reported in the Group Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
A provision is recognised when the Group considers it has a present tax obligation as the result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions established for such uncertain tax positions are made using a best estimate of the tax expected to be paid, based on a qualitative and quantitative assessment of all relevant information.
Such a provision is typically required where the underlying tax issue is subject to interpretation and remains to be agreed, and therefore is uncertain as to outcome.
Principally the uncertain tax positions for which a provision is made relate to the interpretation of tax legislation and guidance regarding transfer pricing arrangements that have been entered into in the normal course of business.
In accordance with IAS 12, tax provisions are included as income tax payable on the face of the Group Balance Sheet, and movements in tax provisions are included within income tax charges or credits in the Group Income Statement.
In assessing any appropriate provision requirements for uncertain tax items, the Group considers progress made in discussions with the tax authorities, expert advice on the likely outcome and any recent developments in case law.
Due to the uncertainty associated with such tax items, it is possible that at a future date, on conclusion of the open matters, the final outcome may vary signi cantly.
Any such variations will affect the financial results in the year in which such a determination is made.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable pro t and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable pro ts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable pro t nor the accounting pro t. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that suf cient taxable pro ts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Change in accounting policy Previously, the common understanding and interpretation of IAS 12 allowed a company to include in its tax charges, liabilities and provisions any associated delayed settlement interest and penalties.
The recent clari cation by the IFRS Interpretations Committee previously the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, IFRIC, however, is that a company should include in its tax charges, liabilities and provisions only items meeting the strict fide nition of taxes under IAS 12.
It con rmed that items not meeting that fide nition should be reported in accordance with IAS 37.
Financial Statements 145 Vesuvius has accordingly changed its accounting policy to include interest and penalties on tax in trade and other payables in accordance with IAS 37.
This has resulted in a change to its Group Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2016 to reclassify 7.0m from its liabilities and provisions previously reported as tax to trade and other payables.
The effect of this change on its 2016 performance statements is immaterial and no restatement is therefore required to be made.

It has reduced the asset by $33.1m 25.7m, of which $31.5m 24.5m is charged to the Group Income Statement and $1.6m 1.2m is charged to the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, as it relates to the effect of the change in the US Federal rate of tax on the value of the deferred tax asset on pension fide cits recognised in that statement.
The reduction was principally due to the change in Federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, the deemed repatriation tolling charge and the impact of other changes when measuring the value of the asset which is recognised in the Group Balance Sheet.
However, no current tax liability has resulted from these provisions in 2017, due to the availability of tax losses and foreign tax credits to offset the resultant additional taxable income.
The impact of US tax reform, together with normal changes to the US deferred tax asset, resulted in the asset reducing from $81.3m 65.9m at the end of 2016 to $44.0m 32.6m at the end of 2017.
This has had the impact of reducing the deferred tax asset in Belgium by 1.4m in 2017 2016: nil.
This impact is included in the total deferred tax charge on continuing operations.
Vesuvius plc 146 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 10.
Income Tax continued 10.2 Income tax charge continued The net tax charge re ected in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year amounted to 3.1m 2016: 0.7m, 2.4m of which related to tax on net actuarial gains and losses on the employee bene ts plan.
In addition, 0.7m 2016: nil related to UK tax in respect of foreign exchange differences arising on hedged positions.
The Group operates in a number of countries that have differing tax rates, laws and practices.
Changes in any of these areas could, adversely or positively, impact the Groups tax charge in the future.
Continuing losses, or insuf ciency of taxable pro t to absorb all expenses, in any subsidiary, could have the effect of increasing tax charges in the future as effective tax relief may not be available for those losses or expenses.
Other signi cant factors affecting the tax charge are described in Notes 3.2, 10.1 and 10.6.
In 2016, pro t from discontinued operations Note 22 included a tax credit of 9.0m relating to the release of a provision for possible China taxes arising during the demerger of the Alent business in 2012.
After further consultation with advisers, and in light of the publication in 2015 by the Chinese tax authorities of additional guidance on the applicable taxes, it was decided this provision was no longer required.
No similar credit has arisen in 2017.

Note 3.2 outlines the principal judgements and estimates taken in determining the impact of that reform on the valuation of this asset.
Included in non-current deferred tax assets is 32.6m 2016: 65.9m in respect of the partial recognition of temporary differences arising in the US computed in accordance with the policy set out in Note 10.1 above.
The Group remains con dent of the recovery of this asset.
In view of its material size and nature, any tax credit re ected in the Group Income Statement arising from the recognition of this asset is presented separately from the tax charge on headline performance, in accordance with the principles outlined in Note 2.5.
Subsequent increase, decrease and utilisation of the resultant deferred tax asset would similarly be expected to be presented in this manner, as the Directors consider that the separate identi cation of deferred tax for material temporary differences would assist both in a better understanding of the financial performance achieved, and in making projections of future results of the Group.
Tax loss carry-forwards and other temporary differences with a tax value of 1m 2016: 1.4m were recognised by subsidiaries reporting a loss.
On the basis of approved business plans of these subsidiaries, the Directors consider it probable that the tax loss carry-forwards and temporary differences can be offset against future taxable pro ts.
The total deferred tax assets not recognised as at 31 December 2017 were 219.9m 2016: 263.1m, as analysed below.
In accordance with the accounting policy in Note 10.1, these items have not been recognised as deferred tax assets on the basis that their future economic bene t is not probable.
In total, there was a decrease of 43.2m 2016: 6.4m increase in net unrecognised deferred tax assets during the year, principally due to the impact of the change in the US Federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, enacted in TCJA.

As at 31 December 2017, the Group had unrecognised US tax credits with a value of 16.7m 2016: 9.1m as follows: 2017 2016 m m US research and experimentation credits due to expire 20182033 12.8 4.9 US foreign tax credits due to expire 20222024 3.9 4.2 US tax credits 16.7 9.1 There are no temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised.
The aggregate temporary differences where the exemption not to provide for the deferred taxation liability has been taken is 197.1m 2016: 175.9m.
UK corporation tax rate reductions to 17% from 1 April 2020 were enacted in 2016.
Accordingly, the Groups closing UK deferred tax liability has been provided using a tax rate of 17% except where the reversals are expected to arise prior to 1 April 2020.

These provisions cover litigated tax matters as well as provisions for other risks where the Group believes it is more likely than not that there would be a successful challenge by a tax authority to positions it has taken in its tax lings.
By its nature, litigation can result in sharp uctuations in cash ow, both in and out, relating to taxes.
Currently, management do not expect any material adjustments to these provisions in 2018.
Financial Statements 149 10.6 Key factors impacting the sustainability of the effective tax rate are as follows: Material changes in the geographic mix of pro ts The Groups effective tax rate is sensitive to changes in the geographic mix of pro ts and level of pro ts, and re ects a combination of higher rates in certain jurisdictions such as India, Mexico, Germany and Belgium, nil effective tax rates in the UK and the US due to the availability of unutilised tax losses, and rates that lie somewhere in between.
Changes in tax rates, tax reform and its interpretation Changes in tax rates and laws in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates could have a material effect on the Groups effective tax rate.
As stated in Note 10.1, the Group has taken into account the impact of US and other tax reform enacted in 2017.
One of the new taxes introduced by the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA in the US in December 2017 is the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax BEAT see also Note 3.2 b.
This is intended to counter what US tax authorities regard as erosion of the US tax base of a US company caused by payments, other than for cost of goods sold, to its to non-US af liates.
In its broadest sense, this would establish a base tax of 10% of a US companys normal taxable income as grossed up by such payments.
The rate of tax applied is 5% in 2018, increasing to 10% from 2019.
Whilst this does not impact Vesuvius in 2017, it is currently estimated to result in a US cash tax cost from 2018 onwards and thus increase the Groups effective rate of tax on Headline performance before its share of joint venture income going forward by 0.7% in 2018, and 1.2% in 2019.
The Groups effective tax rate for 2018 onwards is expected to be between 27% and 28%, including the expected adverse impact of US tax reform, re ecting the bene t of initiatives being taken.
TCJA is a major new piece of legislation, introduced very rapidly, consequently there is still much uncertainty about how some of the key provisions will operate.
The international provisions in particular are extremely complex and, with little issued guidance from the US Treasury, are not yet fully understood by the business or adviser community.
Vesuvius has taken advice on how TCJA is likely to impact on its tax position, but it is to be expected that, as guidance and interpretation clari es these new laws, then further changes to its tax charges and balances may need to be made.
Availability of tax advantaged rates Vesuvius in China quali es for a tax advantaged rate of 15% rather than the headline rate of 25%, on part of its pro ts due to the high-technology nature of its business.
Eligibility for this rate is reviewed on a regular basis by the Chinese tax authority, and was worth approximately 0.9m in 2017 2016: 1.0m.
Without that bene t, the Groups effective tax rate on headline performance would have been 0.6% higher in 2017 2016: 0.8%.
Resolution of tax judgements At any one time, the Group can be subject to a number of challenges by tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which it operates.
The outcome of these challenges is inherently uncertain, potentially resulting in a different tax charge from the amounts initially provided.
Recognition of tax bene ts arising from brought forward losses and other temporary differences in the US In accordance with the criteria set out in Note 10.1, movements in Vesuvius US deferred tax asset are recognised as separately reported items.
Consequently, such movements have no impact on the Groups effective tax rate on headline performance.
Should, however, the 2017 pro ts earned in the US have been fully subject to US Federal and State taxes, then the Groups effective tax rate on headline performance excluding the Groups share of post-tax pro t of joint ventures would have been approximately 4.2% higher 2016: 3.4% higher.
Impact of Brexit on Vesuvius tax position How Brexit impacts on Vesuvius will depend on the terms of Brexit, which are as yet unclear and therefore it is not possible at this stage to provide precise guidance on how it will impact on the Group.
If the EU Parent Subsidiary and Interest and Royalty directives were no longer to apply to dividend, interest and other payments to Vesuvius in the UK, additional withholding taxes would become payable subject to reliefs available under applicable tax treaties.

Property, Plant and Equipment 15.1 Accounting policy Freehold land and construction in progress are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Other items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Costs are capitalised only when it is probable that they will result in future economic bene ts owing to the Group and when they can be measured reliably.
Costs are capitalised to construction in progress where an asset is being developed.
This is then transferred and depreciated when the asset is ready for use.
All other repairs and maintenance expenditures are charged to the Group Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Vesuvius plc 152 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 15.
Property, Plant and Equipment continued 15.1 Accounting policy continued Freehold land is not depreciated, as it has an in nite life.
Depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment begins when the asset is available for use and is charged to the Group Income Statement on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost less residual value of the asset over its estimated useful life as follows: Asset category Estimated useful life Freehold property between ten and 50 years Leasehold property the term of the lease Plant and equipment motor vehicles and information technology equipment between one and five years other between three and 15 years The depreciation method used, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed annually and changed, if appropriate.
As described in Note 17.1, an assets carrying amount is immediately written down to its recoverable amount if its carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses arising on disposals are determined by comparing sales proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised in the Group Income Statement.

Capital expenditure on  assets was 10.7m 2016: 6.5m.
Intangible Assets Intangible assets comprise goodwill and other intangible assets that have been acquired through business combinations.
16.1 Accounting policy a Goodwill Goodwill arising in a business combination is initially recognised as an asset at cost, measured as the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest acquired over the net of the acquisition-date fair value amounts of the identi able assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in pro t or loss.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, with impairment testing carried out annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated may be impaired.
On disposal of a business, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the calculation of the pro t or loss on disposal.
b Other intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill are recognised on business combinations if they are separable, or if they arise from contractual or other legal rights, and their value can be measured reliably.
They are initially measured at cost, which is equal to the acquisition-date fair value, and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation charges and accumulated impairment losses.
Other intangible assets are subject to impairment testing when there is an indication that an impairment loss may have been incurred and are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
c Research and development costs The Groups research activity involves long-range, blue sky investigation, the findings from which may be used in the future to develop new or substantially improved products.
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the Group Income Statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Development is the application of research findings for the production of new or substantially improved products, processes and services before the start of commercial production.
Development expenditure is capitalised only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic bene ts are probable and the Group intends to and has suf cient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset.
Otherwise, it is recognised in the Group Income Statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure, where there is any, is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
In determining whether development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset, management considers whether the strict intangible asset recognition criteria set out in IAS 38, Intangible Assets, have been met at the time the expenditure is incurred.
In making this determination, management recognise that a signi cant amount of the development expenditure undertaken by the Group is focused on dealing with local customer technical support issues and incremental developments to existing products as opposed to new or substantially improved products, and that at the time the feasibility of the project is determined a signi cant proportion of the development expenditure for that project has already been incurred.
In 2017 no projects met the criteria for IAS 38 capitalisation.

Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets 17.1 Accounting policy The Directors regularly review the performance of the business and the external business environment to determine whether there is any indication that the Groups tangible and intangible assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If such indication exists, the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell of the asset is estimated and compared with the carrying value in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss.
Where it is not feasible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Directors estimate the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Groups CGUs expected to bene t from the synergies of the combination and the Directors carry out annual impairment testing of the carrying value of each CGU, to assess the need for any impairment of the carrying value of the associated goodwill and other intangible and tangible assets.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of i its fair value less costs to sell and ii its value in use.
If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
An impairment loss recognised in a prior year for an asset other than goodwill may be reversed where there has been a change in the estimates used to measure the assets recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised.
17.2 Key assumptions The key assumptions used in determining value in use are projected cash ows, growth rates and discount rates.
Projected cash ow assumptions are based on historical financial information, adjusted to factor in the anticipated impact of restructuring and rationalisation plans already announced at the balance sheet date.
Financial Statements 155 The value in use calculations of the Groups CGUs are based on three-year business plans and a terminal growth rate of 2.5% 2016: 2.5%.
The cash ows are discounted to their current value using pre-tax discount rates, which represent each CGUs weighted average cost of capital WACC.
Growth rates are determined with reference to: current market conditions: external forecasts and historical trends for the Groups key end-markets of Steel and Foundry: and expected growth in output within the industries in which each major Group business unit operates.
A perpetuity growth rate of 2.5% 2016: 2.5% has been applied.
The pre-tax discount rate is the WACC calculated for each CGU as at 31 December 2017 based on industry-speci c beta coef cients for the industries in which the CGUs operate, risk-free rates, and equity risk premiums related to the major countries in which the CGUs are located, selecting countries which contribute at least 80% of total CGU revenue.
The pre-tax discount rate used for the Steel CGU was 11.0% 2016: 10.9% and for the Foundry CGU was 11.6% 2016: 13.2%.
The decrease in Foundrys pre-tax discount rate is driven by improved global economic performance which results in reduced market risk, and consequently, lower equity risk premiums: and the Foundry industry has performed well with limited volatility resulting in a reduced beta.
In the Steel CGU, the impact of this decrease in equity risk premiums has been more than offset by increasing contributions from emerging markets, providing upward pressure on risk-free rates and equity risk premiums.
A sensitivity analysis undertaken in respect of the 2017 impairment testing, assuming a 1.0% increase in each of the CGU discount rates and a 1.0% perpetuity growth rate, still resulted in headroom remaining in which the recoverable amount of each CGU exceeded its carrying value.
A pre-tax discount rate of 16.0% would result in an impairment of Steel intangible assets and 22.7% for Foundry.
17.3 Goodwill impairment The Directors use their judgement to determine the extent to which goodwill and other capitalised intangible assets have a value that will bene t the performance of the Group over future periods.
To assist in making this judgement, the Directors undertake an assessment, at least annually, of the carrying value of the Groups capitalised goodwill and other intangible assets.
The projection period is, in the opinion of the Directors, an appropriate period over which to view the future results of the Groups businesses for this purpose.
Changes to the assumptions used in making these forecasts could signi cantly alter the Directors assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets.
In assessing goodwill for impairment, management performed its annual test at 31 October 2017 which is consistent with the prior year.
The Directors made use of detailed calculations of the recoverable amount of the Groups CGUs as at 31 October 2017.
Those calculations resulted in recoverable amounts signi cantly higher than the carrying values of the Groups CGUs and consequently no impairment charges were recognised.
A further assessment for triggers of goodwill impairment was made at the year end and the calculations were also checked against the carrying values of the Groups CGUs as at 31 December 2017.
No impairment triggers were identi ed.
Trade and Other Receivables 18.1 Accounting policy Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less impairment losses.

Trade and Other Receivables continued 18.2 Analysis of trade and other receivables continued All the Groups operating companies have policies and procedures in place to assess the creditworthiness of the customers with whom they do business.
Where objective evidence exists that a trade receivable balance may be impaired, provision is made for the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash that will be recovered.
Evidence of impairment may include such factors as the customer being in breach of contract, or entering bankruptcy or financial reorganisation proceedings.
Impairment provisions are assessed on an individual customer basis for all signi cant outstanding balances and collectively for all remaining balances, based upon historical loss experience.
Historical experience has shown that the Groups trade receivable provisions are maintained at levels that are suf cient to absorb actual bad debt write-offs, without being excessive.
The Group considers the credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired as good.

Inventories 19.1 Accounting policy Inventories are stated at the lower of cost using the first in, first out method and net realisable value.
Cost comprises expenditure incurred in purchasing or manufacturing inventories together with all other costs directly incurred in bringing the inventory to its present location and condition and, where appropriate, attributable production overheads based on normal activity levels.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value is recognised as an expense in the year in which the write-down occurs.

Derivative Financial Instruments 20.1 Accounting policy The Group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives, in the form of forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to manage the effects of its exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk.
The way in which derivatives are used to manage the Groups financial risk is detailed in Note 27.
Derivatives are measured at fair value.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated using market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of an interest rate swap is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparty.
The method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value depends upon whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Strict conditions have to be satis ed in order to qualify for hedge accounting, including a determination both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis that the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair values or cash ows attributable to the hedged risk.
The change in fair value of a derivative that is not designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement.
No derivatives are held for speculative purposes.
Net investment hedges The effective part of any gain or loss on a derivative that is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity, and is subsequently recognised in the Group Income Statement as part of the pro t or loss on disposal of the net investment.
The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately within trading pro t in the Group Income Statement.

Acquisition of Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures, Net of Cash Acquired The Group did not acquire any material interests in any companies during the year ended 31 December 2017.
Prior Year Acquisition On 1 December 2016, the Group acquired a 100% ownership interest in Mastercodi Industrial Ltda, the mould and tundish ux business of Carboox, for total consideration of 8.0m, of which 0.7m was deferred.
The fair value of the net assets acquired was 4.9m and included identi ed intangible assets relating to customer relationships and trade names of 3.8m.
The transaction resulted in the recognition of 3.1m of goodwill attributable to the synergies which are expected from combining the business with the operations of the Group.
During 2017 the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities were nalised and resulted in a 0.3m adjustment to trade and other receivables.
The final fair value of net assets acquired was 5.2m and the total goodwill recognised was 3.4m.

If approved by shareholders, the dividend will be paid on 25 May 2018 to ordinary shareholders on the register at 13 April 2018.
Financial Risk Management 27.1 Accounting policy a Non-derivative financial instruments Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
b Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates.
For the purpose of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the results and financial position of each entity are translated into pound sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency Transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each subsequent balance sheet date: i Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement or retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the Group Income Statement ii Non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated Translation from functional currency to presentational currency When the functional currency of a Group entity is different from the Groups presentational currency pound sterling, its results and financial position are translated into the presentational currency as follows: i Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date ii I ncome and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such average rates does not approximate the exchange rate at the date of a speci c transaction, in which case the transaction rate is used iii All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and are reclassi ed to pro t or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entitys net investment in a foreign operation are initially recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and reclassi ed to pro t or loss on disposal of the net investment.
27.2 Financial risk factors The Groups Treasury department, acting in accordance with policies approved by the Board, is principally responsible for managing the financial risks faced by the Group.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, the most signi cant of which are market risk and liquidity risk.
a Market risk Market risk is the risk that either the fair values or the cash ows of the Groups financial instruments may uctuate because of changes in market prices.
The Group is principally exposed to market risk through uctuations in exchange rates currency risk and interest rates interest rate risk.
Financial Statements 16 1 Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on its borrowings and financial assets being cash and short-term deposits that are denominated in currencies other than pound sterling.
The Groups general policy is proportionally to match the currency pro le of its core borrowings with the currency pro le of its earnings and net assets.
This is achieved, where necessary, by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts FX swaps.
The currency pro le of the Groups borrowings and financial assets, re ecting the effect of the FX swaps, is shown in the table below.
Based upon the currency pro le shown in the table above, while not impacting reported pro t, the change in net debt arising from a 10% strengthening of sterling would increase reported equity by 13.0m 2016: 16.5m and a corresponding 10% weakening of sterling would reduce equity by 15.9m 2016: 20.2m.
The tables below show the net unhedged monetary assets and liabilities of Group companies that are not denominated in their functional currency and which could give rise to exchange gains and losses in the Group Income Statement.

Financial Risk Management continued 27.2 Financial risk factors continued a Market risk continued Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk principally arises in relation to its borrowings.
Where borrowings are held at oating rates of interest, uctuations in interest rates expose the Group to variability in the cash ows associated with its interest payments, and where borrowings are held at xed rates of interest, uctuations in interest rates expose the Group to changes in the fair value of its borrowings.
The Groups policy is to maintain a mix of xed and oating rate borrowings, within certain parameters agreed from time to time by the Board, in order to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had $200.0m and 130.0m 261.3m in total of US Private Placement Loan Notes USPP outstanding, which carry a xed rate of interest, representing two-thirds of the Groups total borrowings outstanding at that date.
The interest rate pro le of the Groups borrowings and net debt is detailed in the tables below.

The xed rate financial liabilities of 261.3m 2016: 275.2m have a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% 2016: 4.6% and a weighted average period for which the rate is xed of 6.9 years 2016: 4.2 years.
The financial assets attract oating rate interest at the inter-bank offered rate of the appropriate currency, less a margin.
Based upon the interest rate pro le of the Groups financial assets and liabilities shown in the tables above, a 1% increase in market interest rates would increase both the net finance costs charged in the Group Income Statement and the net interest paid in the Group Statement of Cash Flows by 0.1m 2016: 0.5m, and a 1% reduction in market interest rates would decrease both the net finance costs charged in the Group Income Statement and the net interest paid in the Group Statement of Cash Flows by 0.1m 2016: 0.5m.
Similarly, a 1% increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of 15.9m 2016: 10.7m in the fair value of the Groups net debt and a 1% decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of 17.2m 2016: 11.4m in the fair value of the Groups net debt.
Financial Statements 163 b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group might have dif culties in meeting its financial obligations.
The Group manages this risk by ensuring that it maintains suf cient levels of committed borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents to ensure that it can meet its operational cash ow requirements and any maturing financial liabilities, whilst at all times operating within its financial covenants.
The level of operational headroom provided by the Groups committed borrowing facilities is reviewed at least annually as part of the Groups three-year planning process.
Where this process indicates a need for additional finance, this is normally addressed 12 to 18 months in advance by means of either additional committed bank facilities or raising finance in the capital markets.
In December 2017 the US dollar portion of the US Private Placement USPP debt of $110m matured.
This debt was replaced with a Euro-denominated USPP comprising two 50m tranches.
These were issued with maturity dates of 2027 and 2029 respectively.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had committed borrowing facilities of 563.4m 2016: 576.9m, of which 153.7m 2016: 158.3m were undrawn.
These undrawn facilities are due to expire in June 2022.
The Groups borrowing requirements are met by USPP and a multi-currency committed syndicated bank facility of 300.0m 2016: 300.0m.

Financial Risk Management continued 27.3 Capital management The Company considers its capital to be equal to the sum of its total equity and net debt.
It monitors its capital using a number of KPIs, including free cash ow, average working capital to sales ratios, net debt to EBITDA ratios and RONA Note 4.
The Groups objectives when managing its capital are: To ensure that the Group and all of its businesses are able to operate as going concerns and ensure that the Group operates within the financial covenants contained within its debt facilities To have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver acceptable future returns to investors To maintain suf cient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events To maximise shareholder value through maintaining an appropriate balance between the Groups equity and net debt The Group operated within the requirements of its debt covenants throughout the year and has suf cient liquidity headroom within its committed debt facilities.
Details of the Groups covenant compliance and committed debt facilities can be found in the Strategic Report on page 29.
27.4 Cash pooling arrangements The Group enters into notional cash pooling arrangements as part of its ongoing Treasury management activities.
Certain cash pooling arrangements meet the criteria for offsetting as clari ed in amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments, as regards a legally enforceable right of set-off both in the ordinary course of business and in the event of default.

Employee Bene ts 28.1 Accounting policy The net surplus or net liability recognised in the Group Balance Sheet for the Groups fide ned bene t plans is the present value of the fide ned bene t obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of the plan assets.
The fide ned bene t obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method and by discounting the estimated future cash ows using interest rates on high-quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.
Any asset recognised in respect of a surplus arising from this calculation is limited to the asset ceiling, where this is the present value of any economic bene ts available in the form of refunds or reductions in future contributions in respect of the plans.
The expense for the Groups fide ned bene t plans is recognised in the Group Income Statement as shown in Note 28.8.
Actuarial gains and losses arising on the assets and liabilities of the plans are reported within the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income: and gains and losses arising on settlements and curtailments are recognised in the Group Income Statement in the same line as the item that gave rise to the settlement or curtailment or, if material, separately reported as a component of operating pro t. Financial Statements 165 28.2 Group post-retirement plans The Group operates a number of pension plans around the world, both of the fide ned bene t and fide ned contribution type, and accounts for them in accordance with IAS 19.
The Groups principal fide ned bene t pension plans are in the UK and the US, the bene ts of which are based upon the final pensionable salaries of plan members.
The assets of these plans are held separately from the Group in trustee-administered funds.
The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans bene ciaries.
The principal risks faced by these plans comprise: i the risk that the value of the plan assets is not suf cient to meet all plan liabilities as they fall due: ii the risk that plan bene ciaries live longer than envisaged, causing liabilities to exceed the available plan assets: and iii the risk that the market-based factors used to value plan liabilities and assets change materially adversely to increase plan liabilities over the value of available plan assets.
The Group also has fide ned bene t pension plans in other territories but, with the exception of those in Germany, these are not individually material in relation to the Group as a whole.
a fide ned bene t pension plans UK The Groups main fide ned bene t pension plan in the UK the UK Plan is closed to new members and to future bene t accrual.
The existing plan was established under a trust deed and is subject to the Pensions Act 2004 and guidance issued by the UK Pensions Regulator.
A full actuarial valuation of the UK Plan is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the UK Plan Trustee in line with the requirements of the Pensions Act 2004, and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2015.
At that date, the market value of plan assets was 536.7m and this represented a funding level of 102% of the accrued plan bene ts at the time of 526.4m.
Calculated on a buy-out basis using an estimation of the cost of buying out the UK Plan bene ts with an insurance company, the liabilities at that date were 687.5m, representing a funding level of 78%.
There is a long-term scheme-speci c funding standard in Part 3 of the Pensions Act 2004.
In terms of Part 3, the UK plan is subject to a requirement the statutory funding objective that it must have suf cient and appropriate assets to cover its technical provisions.
Such technical provisions are determined as part of the triennial valuation.
Under the rules of the UK Plan, the Trustees, after consultation with the company, have the power to set the funding contributions taking into account the results of the triennial valuation, and the Pension Act 2004 legislation.
Notwithstanding the latest funding valuation surplus, the Company agreed to make voluntary contributions of 2.0m in 2017.
Thereafter, the Company will fund the administration cost relating to the management of the UK Plan.
The value of the UK Plan liabilities as at 31 December 2017 decreased to 490.8m 2016: 527.4m.
The decrease in the liabilities was driven mainly by bene ts paid from the scheme of 46.8m 2016: 28.1m in line with the trust deed and relevant legislation requirements.
Correspondingly, the UK Plan assets decreased to 580.3m 2016: 601.4m as assets were liquidated to fund the bene ts paid resulting in decreases in the values of the annuity insurance contract of 13.5m and the xed income holdings of 33.1m.
Proposed amendments to IFRIC 14, The Limit on a fide ned Bene t Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their interaction, address how the powers of other parties, such as the trustees of the plan, affect an entitys right of refund of a surplus from the plan.
The Group has assessed the likely impact of the application of the interaction and concluded that it would not impact its ability to continue to recognise a pension surplus.
b fide ned bene t pension plans US The Group has a number of fide ned bene t pension plans in the US, providing retirement bene ts based on final salary or a xed bene t. The Groups principal US fide ned bene t pension plans are closed to new members and also to future bene t accrual for existing members.
Actuarial valuations of the US fide ned bene t pension plans are carried out every year and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2016.
At that date the market value of the plan assets was 49.2m, representing a funding level of 66.0% of funded accrued plan bene ts at that date using the projected unit method of valuation of 74.3m.
Funding levels for the Groups US fide ned bene t pension plans are based upon annual valuations carried out by independent quali ed actuaries and are governed by US Government regulations.
The value of US plan liabilities decreased to 82.0m 2016: 86.8m in 2017, which was mainly attributable to bene ts paid of 4.0m in line with scheme rules and exchange gains of 7.6m due to US dollar weakness.
This signi cant decrease was partially offset by an interest accrual of 3.1m and a loss of 3.8m due to the lower discount rate.
The loss arising from changes in financial assumptions is solely attributable to the decrease in the discount rates to 3.4% 2016: 3.8%.
The Groups US fide ned bene t pension plans are subject to the minimum contribution requirements of Internal Revenue Code Sections 412 and 430.
Contributions are determined by trustees, in consultation with the Company, based on the annual valuations which are submitted to the Internal Revenue Service.
For the plan year beginning 1 January 2017, the minimum required contribution was nil as signi cant company contributions of $6m were made in 2016.
However, under these funding laws and based on the plan fide cit, minimum contributions in the period 2018-2020 are likely to be required and are expected to be in the $3m to $4m range.
Voluntary contributions of $4m were made during 2017.
Vesuvius plc 166 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 28.
Employee Bene ts continued 28.2 Group post-retirement plans continued c fide ned bene t pension plans Germany The Group has a number of fide ned bene t pension arrangements in Germany which are unfunded, as is common practice in that country.
The main plan was closed to new entrants on 31 December 2016 and replaced by a fide ned contribution plan for new joiners.
The net liability of the German plans at 31 December 2017 was 49.4m 2016: 45.3m.
The increase was driven by the decrease in discount rate which resulted in an increase in the liability of 1.6m 2016: 5.8m : increased current service costs of 1.5m 2016: 1.2m : and exchange losses incurred of 1.9m 2016: 5.8m due to the strengthening of the euro against the pound.
d fide ned bene t pension plans ROW The Group has a number of fide ned bene t pension arrangements across the rest of the world, the majority of which are located in Belgium.
The net liability of the ROW plans at 31 December 2017 was 17.9m 2016: 16.2m.
The increase was mainly attributable to exchange losses of 0.5m 2016: 2.1m due to the weakening of the pound post-Brexit and signi cant services costs of 2.0m 2016: 2.3m recognised in respect of the Belgian plans.
These losses are offset by the contribution of 1.5m that was paid out during 2017, thereby decreasing the liability.
e fide ned contribution pension plans The total expense for the Groups fide ned contribution plans in the Group Income Statement amounted to 12.6m 2016: 10.8m continuing operations and represents the contributions payable for the year by the Group to the plans.
f Multi-employer plans Due to collective agreements, Vesuvius in the US participates together with other enterprises in union-run multi-employer pension plans for temporary workers hired on sites.
Some of these plans are underfunded and all participating employers are ultimately liable for any fide cit.
If a participating employer stops contributing to a plan, it is required to make a withdrawal payment to the plan to cover its share of the total fide cit in the plan.
No reliable basis exists for allocation of the plans obligations and plan assets to individual employer participants.
fide cits in the plans may necessitate increased contributions in the future but the expectation is that this will remain relatively consistent based upon historical trends.
These are currently accounted for as fide ned contribution plans.
In 2017 Vesuvius contributed 1.4m 2016: 1.2m to these plans.
28.3 Post-retirement liability valuation The main assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Groups fide ned bene t pension plans, as detailed below, are set by the Directors after consultation with independent professionally quali ed actuaries and include those used to determine regular service costs and the nancing elements related to the plans assets and liabilities.
It is the Directors responsibility to set the assumptions used in determining the key elements of the costs of meeting such future obligations.
Whilst the Directors believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used could affect the Groups pro t and financial position.
a Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the Groups UK, US and German fide ned bene t pension liabilities are summarised in the table below and have been selected to re ect the characteristics and experience of the membership of those plans.
For the UK Plan, the assumptions used have been derived from the Self-Administered Pension Schemes SAPS All table, with future longevity improvements in line with the core mortality improvement tables published in 2016 by the Continuous Mortality Investigation CMI, with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per annum.
For the Groups US plans, the assumptions used have been based on the standard RP-2016 fully generational tables with projection scale BB, and the MP-2017 mortality improvement scale.
The Groups major plans in Germany have been valued using the modi ed Heubeck Richttafeln 2005G mortality tables.
In respect of the life expectancy tables below, current pensioners are assumed to be 65 years old, while future pensioners are assumed to be 45 years old.

The UK discount rate in the above table is based on the Aon Hewitt AA-rated corporate bond yield in conjunction with the most recent projected cash ow data relating to the UK Plan liabilities: the US discount rate is based on the Citigroup pension discount curve: and the Germany discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over ten-year euro corporates AA index.
The assumptions for UK price in ation are set by reference to the difference between yields on longer-term conventional government bonds and index-linked bonds, except for CPI, for which no appropriate bonds exist, which is assumed to be 1.1 points lower 2016: 1.1 points lower than RPI-based in ation.
c Sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in signi cant IAS 19 actuarial assumptions The following table analyses, for the Groups main UK, US and Germany pension plans, the theoretical estimated impact on plan liabilities and assets resulting from changes to the most signi cant actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 valuation purposes, whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
Following the arrangement of buy-in agreements for the UK Plan pensioner liabilities in 2012, and the fact that US pensions are not in ation linked, the rate of increase in pensionable salaries and of pensions in payment is not signi cant to the valuation of the Groups overall pension liabilities.
As stated above, during 2012 the UK Plan entered into pension insurance buy-in agreements which eliminate the in ation, interest rate, investment and longevity risk in respect of the pensioner liabilities covered by the agreements.
The policy and the associated valuation are updated annually.
Please refer to Note 28.7 a for further detail.
In respect of the liabilities so covered, which currently represent some 56.5% of the total liabilities of the UK Plan, any changes in the valuation assumptions which impact on the value of those liabilities, also impact on the associated annuity assets in an equal and opposite way, thereby fully mitigating the valuation risk.
This is also re ected in the following table which includes the sensitivity of the groups material fide ned bene t obligations and plan assets, where applicable, to changes in the weighted principal assumptions as follows: Assumption Change in assumption UK US Germany Discount Increase decrease by 0.1% rate impact on plan liabilities Decrease increase by 8.2m Decrease increase by 1.0m Decrease increase by 1.0m impact on plan assets Decrease increase by 3.0m n a n a Price Increase decrease by 0.1% in ation impact on plan liabilities Increase decrease by 5.6m n a Increase decrease by 0.3m impact on plan assets Increase decrease by 2.1m n a n a Mortality Increase by one year impact on plan liabilities Increase by 21.4m Increase by 2.9m Increase by 1.8m impact on plan assets Increase by 14.6m n a n a Vesuvius plc 168 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 28.

The xed income asset class of the UK Plan includes a liability-driven investment portfolio of financial derivative contracts which reduces the risk that the UK Plans assets would fall materially, relative to the value of its economic liabilities.
The UK Plan Trustee has entered into a pension insurance buy-in agreement with the Pension Insurance Corporation PIC, whereby the UK Plan Trustee has paid insurance premiums to PIC to insure a signi cant portion of the UK Plans liabilities.
Under this arrangement, the value of the PIC insurance contract matches the value of the liabilities because the in ation, interest rate, investment and longevity risk for Vesuvius in respect of these liabilities are eliminated.
As at 31 December 2017, the IAS 19 valuation of the PIC insurance contract value associated with the bought-in liabilities was 276.1m 2016: 289.6m.
The buy-in agreement ensures that the UK pension plan obligations in respect of all its retired members and their approved dependants are insured.
The policy and the associated valuation are updated annually to re ect retirements and mortality.
In the current year, the agreement based on speci c membership data covers 56.5% of UK pension plan obligations, removing all financial risks associated with this tranche of the liability.
b fide ned bene t contributions in 2018 In 2018, the Group is expected to make contributions into its fide ned bene t pension and other post-retirement bene ts plans of around 5.3m with speci c contributions of approximately 3.0m and 0.8m anticipated for the US Plan and UK Plan respectively.

Share-based Payments 29.1 Accounting policy The Group operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangement for its employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date takes account of the effect of market-based conditions, such as total shareholder return target upon which vesting for some awards is conditional, and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
The cumulative expense recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and for the effect of other non-market-based conditions, such as growth in headline earnings per share, which are not included in the fair value determined at the date of grant.
For grants with market-based conditions attached to them, fair value is measured using a form of stochastic option pricing model.
For all other grants, fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

The fair value of options with market-related performance conditions has been measured using the Monte Carlo model.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the 2.8 years 2016: 2.75 years prior to the grant date.
The risk-free rate of return was assumed to be the yield to maturity on a UK xed gilt with the term to maturity equal to the expected life of the option.
At the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, award holders receive the value of dividends that would have been paid on their vested shares in the period between grant and vesting.
Accordingly, there is no discount to the valuation for dividends foregone during the vesting period.

There is no cost to the Group from this arrangement.
Leases 31.1 Accounting policy Leases are classi ed as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classi ed as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Group Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Bene ts received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
31.2 Operating lease commitments The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are payable as follows: 2017 2016 m m Not later than one year 8.3 9.0 Later than one year and not later than five years 13.4 15.8 Later than five years 7.9 7.0 Total operating lease commitments 29.6 31.8 The Groups property, plant and equipment assets are either purchased outright or held under lease contracts.
Where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the Group, the asset is capitalised in the Group Balance Sheet and the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised as a finance lease obligation.
Where all the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group, the lease is classi ed as an operating lease and neither the asset nor the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised in the Group Balance Sheet.
The net book value of the Groups property, plant and equipment assets held under finance lease contracts at 31 December 2017 was 4.6m 2016: 4.7m.
The cost incurred by the Group in the year in respect of assets held under operating leases, all of which was charged within trading pro t, amounted to 18.6m 2016: 17.3m.
Vesuvius plc 174 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 32.
Provisions 32.1 Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that re ects both the current market assessment of the time value of money and the speci c risks associated with the obligation.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
32.2 Analysis of provisions Disposal and Restructuring closure costs charges Other Total m m m m As at 1 January 2017 41.1 18.5 6.9 66.5 Exchange adjustments 2.6 0.3 0.4 2.7 Charge to Group Income Statement 36.3 11.7 48.0 Unused amounts released to Group Income Statement 1.7 1.7 Adjustment to discount 0.1 0.1 0.2 Cash spend 1.9 27.3 11.9 41.1 Transferred to other balance sheet accounts 5.0 5.0 As at 31 December 2017 35.0 22.9 6.3 64.2 Restated to more appropriately re ect a provision for which an associated insurance asset exists.
Of the total provision balance as at 31 December 2017 of 64.2m 2016: 66.5m, 34.4m 2016: 39.9m is recognised in the Group Balance Sheet within non-current liabilities and 29.8m 2016: 26.6m within current liabilities.
The provision for disposal and closure costs includes the Directors current best estimate of the costs to be incurred both in the ful lment of obligations incurred in connection with former Group businesses, resulting from either disposal or closure, together with those related to the demolition and clean-up of closed sites.
The provision comprises amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims, including claims relating to product liability.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing of the associated cash out ows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next ten years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated to re ect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters.
The opening balance has been restated by 7.9m to present a provision for which an associated insurance asset exists.
There was no material impact on the 2016 performance statements and no restatement is required.
Where insurance cover exists for any of these known or probable costs, a related asset is recognised in the Group Balance Sheet only when its value can be reliably measured by management.
As at 31 December 2017, 21.6m 2016: 22.8m was recorded in receivables in respect of associated insurance reimbursements, of which 20.7m 2016: 21.9m is non-current.
In assessing the probable costs and realisation certainty of provisions, or related assets, reasonable assumptions are made.
Changes to the assumptions used could signi cantly alter the Directors assessment of the value, timing or certainty of the costs or related amounts.
The provision for restructuring charges includes the costs of all of the Groups recognised initiatives to rationalise its operating activities.
The balance of 22.9m as at 31 December 2017 comprises 2.7m in relation to onerous lease provisions in respect of leases terminating between one and six years, and 20.2m in relation to expenditure on restructuring initiatives that have been announced which is expected to be paid out over the next year.
Other provisions comprise amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, workers compensation and medical claims, and from third-party claims.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to reasonable assumptions, legal or other regulatory process, the timing of the associated out ows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next five years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated to re ect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters.
During 2017 the Group recognised net charges of 11.7m 2016: 10.2m in the Group Income Statement to provide for various litigation settlements and other claims.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In compliance with current reporting requirements, certain arrangements entered into by the Group in its normal course of business are not reported in the Group Balance Sheet.
Of such arrangements, those considered material by the Directors are future lease payments in relation to assets used by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases Note 31.
Contingent Liabilities Guarantees given by the Group under property leases of operations disposed of amounted to 1.1m 2016: 1.6m.
Details of guarantees given by the Company, on behalf of the Group, are given in Note 10 to the Company Financial Statements.
Vesuvius has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and environmental matters.
Several of Vesuvius subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and the Directors are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities.
Provisions are made for the expected amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, and from third-party claims.
Certain of Vesuvius subsidiaries are subject to lawsuits, predominantly in the US, relating to a small number of products containing asbestos manufactured prior to the acquisition of those subsidiaries by Vesuvius.
These suits usually also name many other product manufacturers.
To date, Vesuvius is not aware of there being any liability verdicts against any of these subsidiaries.
A number of lawsuits have been withdrawn, dismissed or settled and the amount paid, including costs, in relation to this litigation has not had a material adverse effect on Vesuvius financial position or results of operations.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which reserve is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing and amount of the associated out ows is subject to some uncertainty see Note 32 for further information.
