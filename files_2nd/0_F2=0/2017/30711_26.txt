STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Basis of Preparation Hunting PLC is a premium-listed company with its Ordinary shares quoted on the London Stock Exchange.
Hunting PLC was incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act and is registered in England and Wales.
The address of the Companys registered office is shown on page 159.
The principal activities of the Group and the nature of the Groups operations are set out in note 2 and in the Strategic Report on pages 12 to 27.
The financial statements consolidate those of Hunting PLC the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group, include the Groups interests in associates and are presented in US dollars, the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and those International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC Interpretations as adopted by the European Union.
Thefinancial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of the defined benefit pension asset and those financial assets and financial liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss.
The Boards consideration of the applicability of the going concern basis is detailed further in the Strategic Report on page 55.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out in note 36.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented.
Adoption of New Standards, Amendments and Interpretations The following standards, amendments and interpretations have been adopted and are effective for the Groups accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2017: Amendments to IAS 12: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 20142016 Cycle Although these amendments became effective for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2017, the Group did not have to change its accounting policies or make any retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these amendments.
Therefore, the comparative figures for 2016 have not been restated, as the changes do not impact the financial performance or position of the Group.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations are effective subsequent to the year end and are being assessed to determine whether there is a significant impact on the Groups results or financial position: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers including amendments to IFRS 15: Effective date of IFRS 15 Clarifications to IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 16 Leases i IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts i Amendments to IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions i Amendments to IAS 28: Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures i IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration i IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments i Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 Cycle i Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture i Amendment to IAS 19: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement i.
Not yet endorsed by the European Union.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and establishes principles for the recognition, derecognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities, together with new requirements relating to the impairment of financial assets and new simplified hedge accounting rules.
IFRS 9 becomes effective for Hunting on 1 January 2018 and is generally applied retrospectively, except for hedge accounting requirements, which are generally applied prospectively.
The full impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Groups consolidated financial statements will depend on the financial instruments that the Group has during 2018, as well as the economic conditions and judgements that are made as at the year end.
The main changes to the standard that may have an impact on Huntings financial statements are: The classification and measurement of financial assets is now driven by the cash flow characteristics of the asset and the business model of the individual company.
All of Huntings entities have a hold to collect business model and therefore the current classification of financial assets is not expected to change.
IAS 39s incurred loss model has been replaced with a new impairment model, the expected loss model.
An entity will recognise a loss allowance from the point of initial recognition for all financial assets based on expected credit losses, which will result in the earlier recognition of credit losses i. e. a day one loss will be recognised.
This will result in the earlier recognition of bad debt provisions.
There is a simplified impairment model for short-term trade receivables, accrued revenue and contract assets and a choice of applying the simplified model to lease receivables and long-term trade receivables, accrued revenue and contract assets.
Hunting currently expects to apply the simplified model to lease receivables and long-term trade receivables, accrued revenue and contract assets.
There is a new hedge accounting model, which has been simplified and is more closely aligned to the business risk management activities.
Any changes to hedge accounting under IFRS 9 are to be applied prospectively by Hunting from 1 January 2018 as Hunting has not taken the option to continue applying IAS 39 to its hedge accounting.
HUNTING PLC 105 2017 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
Basis of Preparation continued The Group has performed a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of adopting IFRS 9 based on the financial instruments and hedging relationships as at the date of initial application of IFRS 9, 1 January 2018.
The estimated impact on Huntings financial statements has been an increase in the bad debt provision of $0.2m to $5.0m and a decrease in retained earnings of $0.2m.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers establishes when revenue should be recognised, how it should be measured and what disclosures about contracts with customers should be made.
IFRS 15 replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations.
The standard is effective for the Group from 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 requires an entity to recognise revenue when control of promised goods or services is passed to its customers for an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Revenue will either be recognised at a point in time, when the entity has completed its performance obligation or over time as, while and when the promise is performed.
Consequently, revenue that was previously recognised at a point in time may now have to be recognised over time.
Huntings revenue is principally generated from the following sources: Sales of goods to customers.
Products include manufactured goods and OCTG supplies.
Performance of services, which is principally comprised of threading plain-end pipe.
Licensed use of Huntings thread designs.
Rental of equipment such as mud motors and drilling tools.
Rental revenue does not fall within the scope of IFRS 15 and is unaffected by the requirements of the new accounting standard.
Management has performed an assessment of the impact of adopting IFRS 15 and has identified two principal revenue streams that require an amendment to the Groups revenue accounting policies.
These activities involve: 1 the manufacture of products that have been designed with the customer to their bespoke specifications and for which Hunting has an enforceable right to payment if the customer were to prematurely withdraw from the contract without cause: and 2 work performed by Hunting that enhances customer-owned products, such as lathing customer-owned plain-end pipe.
Under IFRS 15, apportionment of revenue between different financial reporting periods is required when Huntings satisfaction of performance obligations straddles two or more financial reporting periods.
The majority of Huntings performance obligations are relatively short and consequently very few in number straddle two financial reporting periods.
As a result, only a small proportion of the Groups annual revenue needs to be apportioned between financial reporting periods such that the impact on the Groups financial statements is minimal.
On the basis that the adjustments to the opening 1 January 2018 balances are not material, the Group will adopt the modified retrospective approach.
Consequently the cumulative impact of the adoption will be recognised as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in 2018 and comparatives will not be restated.
The expected impact of adopting IFRS 15 on the year ended 31 December 2017 is to increase revenue by $1.7m, decrease reported loss from operations by $0.5m and to increase retained earnings by $1.6m.
IFRS 15 requires separate presentation of contract assets and contract liabilities.
As of 1 January 2018, contract assets of $6.8m and contract liabilities of $9.1m will be recognised.
This will result in a reduction to payments on account from customers of $9.1m and inventories of $5.2m.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 Leases replaces IAS 17 Leases and its related interpretations.
IFRS 16 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors.
The standard will be effective for the Group from 1 January 2019.
Currently, no decision has been made as to which of the transitional options in IFRS 16 will be adopted.
IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognise a lease as a right-of-use asset for virtually all lease contracts, together with a corresponding liability.
IAS 17 does not require the recognition of any right-of-use asset or any liability for future payments for leases.
Instead, future operating lease commitments are disclosed, as shown in note 34.
The impact of IFRS 16 has not yet been fully assessed, however managements preliminary assessment indicates that most of these arrangements will meet the definition of a lease under IFRS 16, and hence a significant proportion of the future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, as disclosed in note 34, shall be recognised as liabilities, together with a right-of-use asset.
The majority of the Groups operating lease arrangements relate to property leases, mainly in respect of our distribution centres.
As such, the lease term is generally short-term in nature, with the majority of leases having an unexpired term of less than five years at 31 December 2017.
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of future lease payments.
Subsequently, the lease liability will be adjusted for interest and lease payments, together with any lease modifications.
There will be a positive impact on EBITDA, as lease costs will now be presented as depreciation and interest expense in the income statement, rather than as an operating lease expense.
In the cash flow statement, operating lease payments are currently presented as operating cash flows, whereas as under IFRS 16, the lease payments will be split into a principal and interest portion, which will be presented as financing cash flows.
HUNTING PLC 106 2017 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 2.
Segmental Reporting Further to the Board changes announced during the year which came into effect on 1 September 2017, the Board, which has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker, has reviewed the segmental presentation of financial information it requires to assess performance and allocate resources.
It now considers a geographic-focused reporting format based on the location of operating activities to be more meaningful from a management and forecasting perspective.
In line with these internal changes, external segmental reporting has been revised to present the performance of Huntings US, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East and Africa operations.
Further, due to its size and nature of operations, Hunting Titans activities are reported separately.
Huntings non-core Exploration and Production business unit is also reported separately as its activities are different in nature to the Groups other reporting segments.
The segment information for 2016 has been restated to reflect these changes.
The Board assesses the performance of the operating segments based on revenue and operating results.
Operating results is a profit-based measure and excludes discontinued operations and the effects of amortisation of acquired intangible assets and exceptional items such as restructuring costs, onerous provisions and asset impairments.
Interest income and expenditure are not allocated to segments, as this type of activity is driven by the central treasury function, which manages the funding position of the Group.
Inter-segment sales are priced in line with the transfer pricing policy on an arms-length basis.
Costs and overheads are apportioned to the operating segments on the basis of time attributed to those operations by senior executives.
Further, the Board is also provided revenue information by product group, in order to help with an understanding of the drivers of Group performance trends.
Hunting Titan: Hunting Titan manufactures and distributes perforating products and accessories.
The segments products include the H-1 Perforating System and the EQUAfrac shaped charge technology.
The business has four main manufacturing facilities in the US and one in Mexico, supported by a distribution centre network at 19 locations across North America.
US: The US businesses supply premium connections, OCTG, drilling tools, subsea equipment, intervention tools, electronics and complex deep hole drilling and precision machining services for the US and overseas markets.
Canada: Huntings Canadian business manufactures premium connections and accessories for oil and gas operators in Canada, often focused on heavy oil plays which require specialist tubing technologies.
Canada also manufactures perforating guns.
Europe: This segment derives its revenue primarily from the supply of OCTG and well intervention equipment to operators in the North Sea.
Asia Pacific: Revenue from the Asia Pacific segment is primarily from the manufacture of premium connections and OCTG supply.
Asia Pacific also manufactures perforating guns.
Middle East, Africa and Other: Revenue from the Middle East and Africa is from the sale of in-field well intervention services across the region which also acts as a sales hub for other products manufactured globally by the Group.
Exploration and Production: The Exploration and Production business comprises the Groups exploration and production activities in the Southern US and offshore Gulf of Mexico.
Although the Canada and Exploration and Production segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8 for reportable segments, these segments are separately reported as they are separately monitored by the Board.
Accounting policies used for segmental reporting reflect those used for the Group.
The UK is the domicile of Hunting PLC.

An impairment of property, plant and equipment totalling $7.6m has been recorded in the 2017 accounts, together with other costs of $2.4m relating to the closure of the facility.
Management implemented cost base reduction measures at all levels across the Group in 2016, resulting in restructuring costs of $12.2m being charged to profit from operations.
These costs gave rise to cash outflows of $5.9m during 2016.
As part of the Groups restructuring, a decision was made in 2016 to close the Groups European Drilling Tools business.
Following an impairment review, the assets, with a net realisable value of $1.6m were classified as held for sale at 30June 2016.
Following a further review of the net realisable value, the carrying value of the held for sale assets was written down to $nil by the end of 2016.
Both the impairment charge of $2.9m and the fair value loss of $1.6m were included in restructuring costs in 2016.
On 11 March 2016, it was agreed that the defined benefit pension section of the Groups UK pension scheme would be closed to future accrual of further benefits from 30 June 2016.
The effect of this change was recognised in the 2016 financial statements, resulting in anet charge of $3.1m.
A series of amendments to the Groups borrowing facilities became effective on 20 July 2016, see note 26 for further details.
For accounting purposes, as the revised Revolving Credit Facility RCF size and covenant terms were significantly different, the existing RCF was deemed to have been extinguished and replaced by a new facility.
Consequently, the unamortised portion of the capitalised loan facility fees of $2.5m relating to the RCF negotiated in 2015 were written off to the income statement.

The Finance Bill 2016, which received Royal Assent on 15 September 2016, included reductions to the main rate of corporation tax to reduce the rate to 17% from 1 April 2020.
The changes are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups deferred tax balances.
The US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was substantively enacted on 22 December 2017 and includes a reduction in the Federal tax rate from 35% to 21% effective from 1 January 2018.
In 2017, Hunting has recognised deferred tax assets in the US sufficient to offset deferred tax liabilities.
Therefore, the change in the US tax rate has had no overall effect.
The rate change has, however, had an impact on unrecognised deferred tax assets as shown in note 18.
In 2016 the deferred tax charge on the remeasurement of the defined benefit pension schemes of $7.5m comprises a $1.4m charge arising in the year and a charge of $6.1m due to a change in tax rates, as the refunds of the UK pension surplus attract a 35% tax rate.
Discontinued Operations The results from discontinued operations were as follows: 2017 2016 Gibson Energy $m $m Exceptional gain on disposal: Gain on disposal before tax 8.4 Tax on gain 0.2 Total profit from discontinued operations 8.2 Gibson Energy: The sale of Gibson Energy Inc, Huntings Canadian midstream services operation, was completed on 12 December 2008.
Subsequent gains relate to the settlement of tax items.

Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of outstanding Ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of alldilutive potential Ordinary shares.
The dilution in respect of share options applies where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary shares during the year and the possible issue of shares under the Groups long-term incentive plans.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of Ordinary shares used in the calculations are set out below: 2017 2016 $m $m Basic and diluted loss earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders From continuing operations 26.7 115.7 From discontinued operations 8.2 Total 26.7 107.5 i Basic and diluted loss earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders before amortisation and exceptional items From continuing operations 26.7 115.7 i Add: amortisation and exceptional items after taxation 39.1 47.5 Total 12.4 68.2 From discontinued operations 8.2 Less: exceptional items after taxation 8.2 Total millions millions Basic weighted average number of Ordinary shares 163.3 150.7 Long-term incentive plans 6.8 6.4 Adjusted weighted average number of Ordinary shares 170.1 157.1 cents cents a Reported Loss Earnings per Share Basic EPS From continuing operations 16.4 76.8 From discontinued operations 5.5 16.4 71.3 ii Diluted EPS From continuing operations 16.4 76.8 From discontinued operations 5.5 16.4 71.3 b Underlying Earnings Loss per Share Basic EPS From continuing operations 7.6 45.3 From discontinued operations 7.6 45.3 ii Diluted EPS From continuing operations 7.6 45.3 From discontinued operations 7.6 45.3 i.
For the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2017, the effect of dilutive share options and long-term incentive plans was anti-dilutive and, therefore, they have not been used to calculate diluted earnings per share.

The property in Cape Town was impaired by $4.3m: plant, machinery and motor vehicles by $2.9m and rental tools were impaired by $0.4m, totalling $7.6m.
The impairment of $7.6m has been recorded in the 2017 accounts as an exceptional item see note 6.
Included in the net book amount is expenditure relating to assets in the course of construction of $0.2m 2016 $0.1m for buildings, $3.6m 2016 $8.8m for plant and machinery and $nil 2016 $0.8m for rental tools.

In accordance with the amendments made to the Groups core committed bank facility in July 2016, security has been granted over specific properties in the UK and US, which have a carrying value of $230.8m 2016 $239.2m.
Oil and gas productive and development assets are tested for impairment at least annually.
Following a valuation of oil and gas reserves at 31 December 2017, performed for impairment purposes, no impairment charges were required 2016 $nil.
The recoverable amount of oil and gas development expenditure is based on value in use.
These calculations use discounted cash flow projections based on estimated oil and gas reserves, future production and the income and costs in generating this production.
Cash flows are based on productive lives between one and 15 years and are discounted using a nominal pre-tax rate of 10% 2016 12%.
The carrying value of PPE assets in certain CGUs remains sensitive to reasonably foreseeable declines in future revenue growth as measured by changes in compound annual growth rates CAGRs.
These sensitivities are based on the impairment test process described in note 14.
For Canada a reduction in the expected revenue CAGR for 2017 to 2022 of 2% points or more would result in impairment 2016 3% point or more reduction in revenue CAGR for 2016 to 2021.
The net book value of PPE in Canada is $3.4m 2016 $4.2m.
For Aberdeen Netherlands OCTG a reduction in the expected revenue CAGR for 2017 to 2022 of 3% points or more would result in impairment 2016 2% point or more reduction in revenue CAGR for 2016 to 2021.
The net book value of PPE in Aberdeen Netherlands OCTG is $7.6m 2016 $8.0m.
There are no other reasonably foreseeable changes in revenue growth rates that would give rise to impairment charges in other CGUs.

Goodwill continued a Impairment Tests for Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units CGUs as follows: 2017 2016 CGU $m $m Hunting Titan 180.5 180.5 Hunting Stafford Subsea formally National Coupling Company 15.0 15.0 Dearborn 12.5 12.5 US Manufacturing 12.5 12.5 Hunting Specialty 5.0 5.0 Welltonic 4.8 4.3 At 31 December 230.3 229.8 The recoverable amount for each CGU has been determined using a fair value less costs of disposal FVLCD method, which represents the value of the CGU in a sales transaction on an arms-length basis.
As there is no active market for the Groups CGUs, the FVLCD is determined using discounted cash flow techniques based on the estimated future gross cash flows that are expected to be generated by the CGU and are discounted at a rate that is determined for each CGU in isolation by consideration of their business risk profiles.
This method allows approved capital projects that are in progress to be included.
The recoverable amount calculations use discounted pre-tax nominal cash flow projections.
The key assumptions for the recoverable amount calculations are revenue growth rates, taking into account the impact these have on margins, terminal growth rates and the discount rates applied.
For 2018, cash flows are based on the approved Board budget.
For 2019 to 2022, management has made revenue projections using Spears and Associates Drilling and Production Outlook independent reports as a default basis, selecting the most appropriate geographic markets and drivers rig count, footage drilled or E&P spend for each CGU.
Management has then applied judgemental changes to revenue growth expectations, if appropriate, to reflect circumstances specific to the CGU.
Having determined the projected revenues, management has then modelled the expected impact on margins and cash flow from the resulting revenue projections.
2017 has been a much stronger year for the Group, due to the return to growth of the US onshore market and stabilisation in the main offshore markets we serve.
The recovery in offshore is expected to follow in due course.
This mixed picture impacts CGUs differently depending on their exposure to these markets and compound annual growth rates CAGR for revenue for the CGUs from 2017 to 2022 vary between 9% and 19% 2016 CAGR from 2016 to 2021 between 12% and 24%.
These growth rates should be seen in the context of the year-on-year declines in revenue in 2015 and 2016, which were 42% and 44% respectively, and the growth in revenue during 2017 of 59%.
After 2022, a terminal value has been calculated assuming growth of 50 basis points above assumed inflation, giving nominal growth rates between 2% and 3% 2016 between 2% and 3%.
Cash flows have been discounted using nominal pre-tax rates between 9% and 11% 2016 11% and 13%.
The discount rates reflect current market assessments of the equity market risk premiums, the volatility of returns, the risks associated with the cash flows, the likely external borrowing rate of the CGU and expected levels of leverage.
Consideration has also been given to other factors such as currency risk, operational risk and country risk.
No impairment charges have been recorded as a result of the impairment review carried out in the year 2016 $nil.
b Material CGU Hunting Titan Hunting Titan represents 78% of the goodwill balance at the year end 2016 79% and has a carrying value, including amounts recognised on consolidation such as goodwill, of $459.5m 2016 $448.2m.
Projected annual growth rates from 2017 to 2022 vary between 2% and 12% 2016 growth rates from 2016 to 2021 between 13% and 31%.
Growth rates are lower following the strong performance during 2017.
Cash flows have been discounted at a nominal pre-tax rate of 10% 2016 12%.
There is no reasonably foreseeable change in revenue growth rates, or terminal growth rates, or discount rates, which will give rise to impairment charges.
c Sensitivities Management has reviewed various downside sensitivities versus the base case assumptions used in our projections.
These covered revenue growth rates, terminal revenue growth rates and discount rates.
In light of current sector expectations, management has concluded that there are no reasonable possible changes in key assumptions that would give rise to an impairment.

In determining an estimate of net realisable value, management makes judgements in respect of the durability and general high quality of the Groups products, which provide a degree of protection against adverse market conditions and competitor product development and pricing activity.
Gross inventories have increased $28.4m from $286.4m at 31 December 2016 to $314.8m at 31 December 2017.
Additions to inventories were $534.2m 2016 $317.2m and foreign exchange movements of $8.0m were offset by inventories expensed to cost of sales of $509.1m 2016 $368.0m, inventories written off of $4.2m against the inventory provision and inventories transferred to PPE of $0.5m.
The inventory provision has increased by $1.9m from $26.7m at 31 December 2016 to $28.6m at 31 December 2017, with $4.2m 2016 $2.9m of the provision being utilised in the year against inventories written off.
This was offset by foreign exchange movements of $0.9m and a net charge included in cost of sales of $5.2m 2016 $10.3m, which has been included in cost of sales in the year.
Overall, Huntings provision for inventory losses has reduced from 9.3% of gross inventory balances at December 2016 to 9.1% at December 2017.

Thenetdebt reconciliation provides an analysis of the movement in the year for each component of net debt split between cash andnon-cash items.
Net debt comprises bank overdrafts, current and non-current borrowings, less cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits maturing after more than three months.

In 2016 the Groups RCF was amended.
Foraccounting purposes, as the revised facility size and covenant terms were significantly different, the RCF was deemed to have been extinguished and replaced by a new RCF.
Consequently, capitalised loan facility fees of $2.5m were written off to the income statement.
Further details on the revised terms are provided in note 26.

Provisions continued The Group has commitments in respect of leasehold properties, some of which are not used for Group trading purposes and are vacant or sub-let to third parties.
The provision for onerous contracts reflects the uncertainty of future conditions in the sub-letting market.
It is expected that $1.0m of the provision will be utilised in 2018 and the remaining balance of $4.4m will be utilised from 2019 to 2023.
Provision is made on a discounted basis, at a risk-free rate of between 0.22% and 0.72% p. a. for the net rental deficit on these properties to the end of the lease term.
Other provisions include asset decommissioning and remediation obligations of $6.2m 2016 $7.0m relating to the Groups obligation to dismantle, remove and restore items of property, plant and equipment and warranties and tax indemnities of $1.0m 2016 $1.0m.
The asset decommissioning provision reflects uncertainty in the timing and amounts of the costs expected to arise inmeeting this obligation.
Provision is made on a discounted basis, the majority of which is estimated to be utilised over a period of 14 years.
Derivatives and Hedging a Currency Derivatives The Group has used spot and forward foreign exchange contracts, together with foreign currency swaps to hedge its exposure to exchange rate movements during theyear.
At 31 December 2017, the total notional amount of the Groups outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts was $6.3m 2016$1.9m and for foreign currency swaps was $36.7m 2016 $15.6m.
Gains and losses on contracts that are not designated in a hedge relationship are taken directly to the income statement, with$0.1m gains 2016 $nil being recognised in the income statement during the year.
Certain highly probable forecast transactions have been designated in a cash flow hedge relationship and hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts during the year.
Some of these forecast transactions occurred during 2017, with the remainder expected to occur during the next 12 months.
Losses recognised during the year on forward foreign exchange contracts designated in a cash flow hedge were $0.2m 2016 immaterial.
During the year, the terms of a financial asset were revised, and so the cash flows that were forecast and designated in a cash flow hedge are no longer expected to occur in March 2018 and March 2019.
The $0.1m losses recognised in the hedge reserve up to the date that the terms were revised have been transferred to the income statement.
During the year, foreign currency swaps have been designated in a fair value hedge to hedge the foreign exchange changes in a pseudo-equity Canadian dollar inter-company loan.
Fair value losses of $0.3m have been recognised in the cumulative translation reserve, together with the changes in the loan due to movements in the USD CAD foreign exchange rate.
There was no ineffectiveness in the fair value hedge.
Forward foreign exchange contracts have also been designated in a fair value hedge, to hedge the foreign exchange movement in foreign currency trade payables.
Immaterial fair value losses have been recognised in the income statement during the year.
There was no ineffectiveness in these fair value hedges.

At 31 December 2017, the carrying amount of net Sterling borrowings was $nil 2016 $19.6m.
During 2017, foreign exchange losses of $0.7m 2016 $2.5m gains on translation of the borrowings into US dollars were recognised in the currency translation reserve.

Financial Instruments: Fair Values The carrying value of investments, non-current trade and other receivables, net trade receivables, accrued revenue, other receivables, deposits maturing after three months, cash and cash equivalents, assets classified as held for sale, trade payables, accruals, other payables, provisions, liabilities classified as held for sale, bank overdrafts, unsecured bank loans and other unsecured loans approximates their fair value.
Drawdowns under the revolving credit facility are typically for periods of one month or less and, as a result, the carrying value and the fair value are considered to be the same.
The following tables present the Groups other financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at the year end and show the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements are categorised.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year.

Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability.
The 2016 table above has been restated to show the US deferred compensation plan obligation, which is carried at fair value.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by comparing the cash flows generated by the contract with the coterminous cash flows potentially available in the forward exchange market on the balance sheet date.
The fair value of listed equities and mutual funds is based on their current bid prices in an active market, which is considered to be the most representative of fair value, at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of non-US dollar denominated financial instruments are translated into US dollars using the year end exchange rate.
The inputs used to determine the fair value of derivative financial instruments are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and so the fair value measurement is categorised in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of listed equity investments and mutual funds is based on quoted market prices and so the fair value measurement is categorised in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Financial Risk Management The Groups activities expose it to certain financial risks, namely market risk including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups risk management strategy seeks to mitigate potential adverse effects on its financial performance.
As part of its strategy, both primary and derivative financial instruments are used to hedge certain risk exposures.
There are clearly defined objectives and principles for managing financial risk established by the Board of Directors, with policies, parameters and procedures covering the specific areas of funding, banking relationships, foreign currency and interest rate exposures and cash management.
HUNTING PLC 126 2017 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 26.
Financial Risk Management continued The Groups treasury function is responsible for implementing the policies and providing a centralised service to the Group for funding, foreign exchange and interest rate management and counterparty risk management.
It is also responsible for identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating companies.
a Foreign Exchange Risk The Groups international base is exposed to foreign exchange risk from its investing, financing and operating activities, particularly in respect of Sterling and Canadian dollars.
Foreign exchange risks arise from future transactions and cash flows, and from recognised monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the Groups local operations.
The Groups material foreign exchange rates are: Sterling Canadian dollar 2017 2016 2017 2016 Average exchange rate to US dollars 0.78 0.74 1.30 1.33 Year end exchange rate to US dollars 0.74 0.81 1.25 1.34 i Transactional Risk The exposure to exchange rate movements in significant future transactions and cash flows is hedged by using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Certain forward foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedging instruments of highly probable forecast transactions.
Operating companies prepare quarterly rolling 12-month cash flow forecasts to enable working capital currency exposures to be identified.
Currency exposures arise where the cash flows are not in the functional currency of the entity.
Exposures arising from committed long-term projects beyond a 12-month period are also identified.
The currency flows to be hedged are committed foreign currency transactions greater than $400,000 equivalent per month and or currency flows that in aggregate exceed $400,000 equivalent per annum.
No speculative positions are entered into by the Group.
The table below shows the carrying values of the Groups financial instruments at 31 December, including derivative financial instruments, on which exchange differences would potentially be recognised in the income statement in the following year.
The table excludes derivatives designated in a cash flow hedge and loans to subsidiaries that are considered to be part of the net investment in a foreign operation, as exchange differences arising on these are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Financial Risk Management continued a Foreign Exchange Risk continued ii Translational Risk Foreign exchange risk also arises from the Groups investments in foreign operations.
The foreign exposure to net investments in foreign operations is managed using funding swaps that utilise the same functional currency as that of the net assets.
The borrowings are designated as a hedge of the net investment in foreign operations.
The foreign exchange exposure primarily arises from Sterling and Canadian dollar denominated net investments.
b Interest Rate Risk Variable interest rates on cash at bank, deposits, overdrafts and borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and fixed interest rates on loans and deposits expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The treasury function manages the Groups exposure to interest rate risk and uses interest rate swaps and caps, when considered appropriate.
c Credit Risk The Groups credit risk arises from its pension assets, cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivative financial instruments, loannote and outstanding receivables.
At the year end, the Group had credit risk exposures to a wide range of counterparties.
Credit risk exposure is continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered to be significant in the context of the ordinary course of the Groups activities.
Exposure limits are set for each approved counterparty, as well as the types of transactions that may be entered into.
Approved institutions that the treasury function can invest surplus cash with all must have a minimum A2, P2 or F2 short-term rating from Standard and Poors, Moodys or Fitch rating agencies respectively and AAA rating for Money Market Funds.
At the year end, cash at bank and in hand totalled $36.4m 2016 $63.5m and current investments $nil 2016 $0.8m.
Cash at bank and in hand balances of $25.1m 2016 $55.7m were deposited with banks with Fitch short-term ratings of F1 to F1.
Of the remaining $11.3m 2016 $7.8m, $9.9m 2016 $6.4m was held on deposit with two financial institutions within mainland China which, given the Groups operations in this jurisdiction, were deemed necessary.
Despite not having formal credit ratings, an internal assessment determined that the banks credit profiles were appropriate for the amounts held on deposit.
The credit risk of foreign exchange contracts is calculated before the contract is acquired and compared to the credit risk limit set for each counterparty.
Credit risk is calculated as a fixed percentage of the nominal value of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables are continuously monitored.
Credit account limits are primarily based on the credit quality of the customer and past experience through trading relationships.
To reduce credit risk exposure from outstanding receivables, the Group has taken out credit insurance with an external insurer, subject to certain conditions.
The Group operates a pension scheme in the UK, which includes a funded defined benefit section with pension plan net assets of $18.6m 2016 $33.3m.
The majority of the Schemes defined benefits are now covered by insurance company annuity policies, meaning the pensions-related risks have largely been eliminated.
The pension buy-in has been effected by using a number of insurers, so as to spread its credit risk.
The credit rating of these insurers is monitored.
The Group also operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the US, which is unfunded.
Contributions are paid into a separate investment vehicle and invested in a wide portfolio of US mutual funds that are recognised as non-current investments.
Investments at the year end amounted to $12.2m 2016 $10.2m and are expected to be fully recovered.
d Liquidity Risk The Group needs to ensure that it has sufficient liquid funds available to support its working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
All subsidiaries submit weekly and bi-monthly cash forecasts to the treasury function to enable them to monitor the Groups requirements.
The Group has sufficient credit facilities to meet both its long and short-term requirements.
The Groups credit facilities are provided by a variety of funding sources and total $205.0m 2016 $204.9m at the year end.
The facilities comprise $200.0m of secured committed facilities 2016 $200.0m, and $5.0m secured uncommitted facilities 2016 $4.9m.
In July 2016, following a breach of the covenants relating to the Groups $350m Revolving Credit Facility RCF, revised financial covenants became effective.
The main revised covenants and terms that apply throughout the suspension period, which runs up to and including the 30 June 2018 covenant test date, are: Committed facilities reduced from $350m to $200m to reflect the Groups reduced requirements.
First priority security taken by the bank group over certain trade receivables and inventories held by Group subsidiaries inthe US, Canada and UK subsidiaries, together with security over the Groups principal properties in the US and UK.
Drawings under the committed facilities to be covered by the secured assets.
The balance of discounted trade receivables and accrued revenue values shall not be less than 40% of the utilisation of the committed facilities.
Tangible net worth of the Group must exceed $450m.
Rolling 12-month cash flow targets tested semi annually.

Financial Risk Management continued d Liquidity Risk continued Capital expenditure limited to a maximum of $30m per annum in 2017 and 2018.
Cessation of dividend payments until the end of the suspension period.
An amendment fee of $400,000 was payable and the interest margin over LIBOR on funds drawn increases to 2.75%.
Throughout the year and at 31 December 2017, all covenants were covered with adequate headroom and the Group remained compliant with the amended terms and conditions of the committed facilities.
In December 2017, following improved trading throughout 2017, the Company took the decision to begin the process of exiting from the revised covenants.
This process was completed on 18 January 2018, with the previous profit-based covenants being reinstated.
The Group is now subject to the original covenants and terms that were included in the facility agreement signed in October 2015.
The original covenants include: The ratio of net debt to EBITDA permitted under the revolving credit facility must not exceed a multiple of three times.
EBITDA must also cover relevant finance charges by a minimum of four times.
For covenant testing purposes, the Groups definition of EBITDA is adjusted to exclude exceptional items, include the share of associates post-tax results and exclude the fair value charge for share awards.
Similarly, net debt and finance expenses are adjusted to accord with the definition within the facility agreement.
EBITDA, for covenant test purposes, is based on the previous 12 month period, measured twice yearly at 30 June and 31 December.
At 31 December 2017 both these covenants were met.
Further, the quantum of the committed facility has remained unchanged at $200m.
The Groups treasury function ensures flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit facilities.
The Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at the year end totalling $199.5m 2016 $179.5m, which expire between two and five years from 31 December 2017.

Financial Instruments: Sensitivity Analysis The following sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Groups financial instruments and show the impact on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
Financial instruments affected by market risk include cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis relates to the position asat 31 December 2017.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement obligations, provisions and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of foreign operations.
The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have an asymmetric impact on the Groups results, that is, an increase in ratesdoes not result in the same amount of movement as a decrease in rates.
For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to be outstanding for the whole year.
Fixed-rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.
The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost do not change as interest rates change.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.
a Interest Rate Sensitivity The sensitivity rate of 0.75% 2016 0.5% for US interest rates represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historical volatility and a review of analysts research and banks expectations of future interest rates.
The post-tax impact on the income statement, with all other variables held constant, at 31 December, for an increase or decrease of 0.75% 2016 0.5% in US interest rates, is not material 2016 not material.
There is no impact on other comprehensive income OCI for a change in interest rates.
b Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity The sensitivity rate of 10% 2016 15% for Sterling and 5% 2016 5% for Canadian dollar exchange rates represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historical volatility and a review of analysts research and banks expectations of future foreign exchange rates.
The table below shows the post-tax impact for the year of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, at 31 December.

Post-Employment Benefits a UK Pensions Within the UK, the Group operates a funded pension scheme, which includes a defined benefit section with benefits linked to price inflation and a defined contribution section with benefits dependent on future investment returns.
The defined benefit section closed to future accrual on 30 June 2016 and most existing contributing members of that section joined the defined contribution section with effect from 1 July 2016.
The defined contribution section of the scheme closed to further contributions on 31 May 2017 and from 1 June 2017, employees were able to join a new UK plan, the Hunting Retirement Savings Plan.
This UK plan is a Master Trust arrangement held with the provider Fidelity.
The majority of UK employees are now members of this UK plan.
The UK scheme and UK plan are registered with HMRC for tax purposes, and are operated separately from the Group.
The UK scheme is managed by a board of trustees.
The trustees are responsible for the payment of benefits and the management of the schemes assets.
The UK plan is also managed by a board of trustees.
The trustees are responsible for the payment of benefits and the management of the plans assets.
The UK scheme and the UK plan are subject to UK regulations.
Under the UK regulations the Group and the trustees are required to agree a funding strategy and contributions schedule for the defined benefit section of the scheme.
The trustees of the UK scheme commenced the process of winding up the scheme on 1 July 2017 and, as part of that process, the trustees bulk annuity policies held with insurers to cover members benefits in full will be transferred into individual policies for the members.
Payments totalling $15.0m were made from the scheme to the Group and HMRC during 2017, and further payments are anticipated during 2018 upon completion of the wind-up of the scheme.
Contributions to the UK plan and previously the defined contribution section of the UK scheme and other Group defined contribution arrangements are charged directly to profit and loss.
Risk exposures and investment strategy The scheme is managed so that it is well funded and represents a low risk to the Group.
In particular, the DB assets of the defined benefit section of the scheme are invested in a range of deferred annuity and immediate annuity policies with a number of insurers which match the benefits to be paid to members of the scheme.
As a result, this strategy has removed the Groups investment, inflation and demographic risks relating to the schemes obligations.
The position would change materially if one of the insurers were no longer to meet its obligations as the pension obligation ultimately rests with the Group.
Funding strategy The trustees and the Group together agree a funding strategy for the UK scheme every three years.
As the defined benefit section is being wound up and the benefits earned by the members are covered in full by annuity policies, the Group does not expect to pay any further contributions into the defined benefit section of the Scheme.

The gain due to the changes in the assumptions broadly offsets the corresponding loss on the remeasurement of the defined benefit obligation, demonstrating that the pensions-related risks have been largely mitigated by the schemes investment strategy.

To the extent this surplus is not expected to be used to secure benefits, it has been valued on an estimate of Rothesay Lifes surrender terms.
Actual terms of surrender will depend on market conditions and Rothesay Lifes terms at the time of surrender.
The UK scheme does not invest directly in property occupied by the Group or in financial securities issued by the Group.

Post-Employment Benefits continued a UK Pensions continued The current service cost includes $1.5m 2016 $1.5m of administration costs.
In addition, employer contributions of $7.1m 2016 $6.7m for various Group defined contribution arrangements including the defined contribution section of the UK scheme and UK plan are recognised in the income statement.
Special events The following special events occurred during the year: Payments of $9.7m to the Group and $5.3m to HMRC were made from the UK scheme on 24 February 2017 and 3 April 2017 respectively.
This has reduced the surplus of the scheme by the combined total of the payments.
The defined contribution section of the scheme closed to further contributions on 31 May 2017.
From that date, surplus assets in the UK scheme were no longer used to fund contributions to the defined contribution section of the UK scheme.
During 2018, it is anticipated that the UK scheme will be wound up with a further payment to the Group net of 35% tax.
The bulk annuity policies covering members benefits will be transferred into their own individual policies in the members names and the Group will have no further legal responsibility to fund these benefits.
The principal assumptions used for accounting purposes reflect prevailing market conditions are: 2017 2016 Discount rate 2.4% p. a.
3.5% p. a. Mortality assumption life expectancy 2017 2016 Years Years Male aged 65 at the accounting date 25.3 25.1 Female aged 65 at the accounting date 27.1 27.0 Male aged 65 in 20 years 27.9 27.8 Female aged 65 in 20 years 29.4 29.3 Sensitivity analysis The weighted average duration to payment of the projected future cash flows from the defined benefit section of the scheme is about17 years.
As the defined benefit section is closed to future accrual and members benefits are covered in full by annuity policies, any change in the obligation arising as a result of changes in the above assumptions is matched by a corresponding change in the value of the insurance policies, so that the impact on the net balance sheet asset has been almost entirely removed.
The net balance sheet is therefore only largely sensitive to changes in the market value of the invested assets.
The investment strategy for the defined benefit section, with all funds in either annuity policies or cash, should mean the surplus figure is stable.
The decrease in the Groups pension asset seen over 2017 principally reflects the payments, totalling $15.0m, to the Group and HMRC.
b Other Pensions The Group also operates a cash balance arrangement in the US for certain executives.
Members build up benefits in this arrangement by way of notional contributions and notional investment returns.
Actual contributions are paid into an entirely separate investment vehicle held by the Company, which is used to pay benefits due from the cash balance arrangement when the member retires.
Under IAS 19, the cash balance arrangement is accounted for as an unfunded defined benefit scheme, although in practice it operates like a defined contribution arrangement with the obligations matched by the assets in the separate investment vehicle.
The amounts recognised in the income statement during the year were $0.1m 2016 $0.1m for the employers current service cost recognised in operating expenses and $0.2m 2016 $0.3m interest cost recognised in finance expense.

Share-Based Payments continued c 2014 Hunting Performance Share Plan HPSP continued The assumptions used in this model were as follows: 2017 2016 Date of grant valuation date 03.03.17 11.03.16 Weighted average share price at grant 571.5p 379.0p Exercise price nil nil Expected dividend yield nil nil Expected volatility 53.5% 48.1% Risk-free rate 0.11% 0.57% Expected life 3 years 3 years Fair value 369.0p 258.7p 2 The fair value of performance-based awards not subject to a market-related performance condition, specifically Company performance against EPS and ROCE targets, and the time-based HPSP awards has been calculated using the Black-Scholes pricingmodel.
The assumptions used in this model were as follows: 2017 2016 Date of grant valuation date 03.03.17 11.03.16 Weighted average share price at grant 571.5p 379.0p Exercise price nil nil Expected dividend yield nil nil Expected volatility 53.5% 48.1% Risk-free rate 0.11% 0.57% Expected life 3 years 3 years Fair value 571.5p 379.0p The methods to calculate the assumptions for both models are: The expected volatility was calculated using historic weekly volatility, equal in length to the remaining portion of the performance period at the date of grant.
The expected life of the award has been calculated commensurate with the vesting period.
The risk-free rate is based on the UKgilt rate commensurate with the vesting period prevailing at the date of grant.
Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent over the number of shares that make up their award.
It is accumulated over the vesting period and released subject to the achievement of the performance conditions.
This is factored into the fair value calculation and as a result the dividend yield assumption is set to zero.
The initial accounting charge of the performance-based HPSP awards granted under the HPSP incorporates an estimate of the number of shares that are expected to lapse for those participants who cease employment during the vesting period.
The estimate of the expected forfeiture rate is 5% per annum.
The subsequent accounting charge includes an adjustment to the initial accounting charge to allow for actual lapses rather than estimated lapses.
The amount charged to the income statement attributable to the performance-based HPSP awards is $3.5m 2016 $0.5m and the charge to the income statement in respect of time-based HPSP awards is $8.1m 2016 $7.0m.
These are recognised in operating expenses.

HUNTING PLC 139 2017 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 36.
Principal Accounting Policies The Groups principal accounting policies are described below: a Consolidation The Group accounts include the results of the Company and its subsidiaries, together with its share of associates.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are fide-consolidated from the date control ceases.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.
Consequently, the consideration is determined as the fair value of the net assets transferred to the vendor and includes an estimate of any contingent consideration.
The net assets acquired are also measured at their respective fair values for initial recognition purposes on the acquisition date.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
b Discontinued Operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has either been disposed of or that is classified as held for sale, which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.
The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the income statement and are shown net of tax.
The assets and liabilities of discontinued operations, that have not been disposed of prior to the balance sheet date, are presented separately in the balance sheet as assets and liabilities classified as held for sale.
c Revenue Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of goods, services and rental supplies in the ordinary course of business, net of trade discounts, volume rebates and sales taxes.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, which is normally on delivery of the products.
Products include manufactured goods and OCTG supplies, including tubulars acquired by Hunting as plain-end pipe on which lathing work has been applied and which is resold as threaded pipe.
Revenue from the sale of services principally comprises lathing work to apply a thread on to customer-owned plain-end pipe.
Revenue is recognised when the threading work has been completed.
Revenue from the sale of other services is recognised when the services are rendered.
Revenue from the rental of plant and equipment is recognised as the income is earned.
d Amortisation and Exceptional Items Exceptional items are items of income or expense which the Directors believe should be separately disclosed by virtue of their significant size or nature to enable a better understanding of the Groups financial performance.
The Group discloses such items in the middle column of the income statement.
In applying this policy, the following items have been treated as exceptional: Costs of restructuring the Groups operations, including the cost of business closures and redundancies, in response to the decline in the oil and gas sector.
Impairment charges to property, plant and equipment were recognised following the decision to close the manufacturing facility in Cape Town.
During 2016, the following items, which did not recur in 2017, were treated as exceptional: Net losses incurred on the closure of the defined benefit section of the Groups UK pension scheme.
Derecognition of the bank facility arrangement fees that were incurred and capitalised in October 2015 upon the inception of the Groups new multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility.
The unamortised balance of these fees was written off when the terms of the facility were significantly revised in July 2016.
The tax effect of any transaction considered to be exceptional is also treated as exceptional.
Amortisation expenses for acquired intangible assets are also shown in the middle column due to the significance of these amounts and to clearly identify the effect on profits, which will arise as current balances become fully written-off, or as new acquisitions give rise to new expenses.
e Interest Interest income and expense is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
f Foreign Currencies i Individual Subsidiaries and Associates Accounts The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries and associates are denominated in their functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities, except borrowings designated as a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge, denominated in non-functional currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date and exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
Borrowings designated as a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date and exchange differences are taken direct to equity.

Exchange differences are recognised directly in equity in the currency translation reserve CTR, together with exchange differences arising on foreign currency loans used to finance foreign currency net investments.
Upon adoption of IFRS on 1 January 2004, accumulated exchange differences arising on consolidation prior to 31 December 2003 were reset to zero and the CTR recommenced under IFRS on 1 January 2004.
The balance on the CTR represents the exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-US dollar amounts into US dollars since 1 January 2004.
On the disposal of a business, the cumulative exchange differences previously recognised in the CTR relating to that business are transferred to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
g Taxation The taxation recognised in the income statement comprises current tax and deferred tax arising on the current years result before tax and adjustments to tax arising on prior years results.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable arising in the current year on the current years result before tax, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, plus adjustments to tax in respect of prior years results.
Deferred tax is the tax that is expected to arise when the assets and liabilities recognised in the Groups balance sheet are realised, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date that are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Full provision is made for deferred taxation, using the liability method, on all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised separately on the balance sheet and are reported as non-current assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable.
Deferred taxation on unremitted overseas earnings is provided for to the extent a tax charge is foreseeable.
When items of income and expense are recognised in other comprehensive income, the current and deferred tax relating to those items is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
Tax arising on the discharge of share options and awards is recognised directly in equity.
h Segmental Reporting Financial information on operating segments that corresponds with information regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM is disclosed in the accounts.
During the year, the CODM changed the focus of its review, monitoring and decision-making processes from an activity basis to a geographical basis.
Consequently, the Groups principal segmental reporting has been changed.
Geographical information is based on the location of where the sale originated and where the non-current assets are located.
Revenue is also disclosed by product group, which is provided to assist in investor understanding of the underlying performance trends.
Each product group consists of goods and services that are similar in nature or serve similar markets.
i Property, Plant and Equipment i General Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition and installation of the asset.
Land, pre-production oil and gas exploration costs and assets under construction are not depreciated.
With the exception of drilling tools and rental tools, which are depreciated using the units of production method, and oil and gas exploration and production equipment see ii below, assets are depreciated using the straight-line method at the following rates: Freehold buildings 2% to 10% Leasehold buildings life of lease 1 Plant, machinery and motor vehicles 6% to 33 3% The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
ii Exploration Expenditure Oil and gas exploration and appraisal costs are initially capitalised pending determination of the existence of commercial reserves and are included in the asset category Oil and Gas Exploration and Development.
Upon determination that commercially viable quantities of hydrocarbons are not found, the costs are charged immediately to the income statement.
Depreciation of oil and gas expenditure commences when production commences.
The costs are depreciated using the unit of production method.

Principal Accounting Policies continued j Goodwill Goodwill arises when the fair value of the consideration paid for a business exceeds the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
On the disposal of a business, goodwill relating to that business that remains on the balance sheet at the date of disposal is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
k Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses where applicable.
These assets have a finite life and are amortised in accordance with the pattern of expected future economic benefits, or when this cannot be reliably estimated, by using the straight-line method.
Intangible assets are amortised over the following periods: Customer relationships eight to ten years Patents eight to ten years Unpatented technology eight to ten years Trademarks and domain names one to five years l Impairments The Group performs goodwill impairment reviews at least annually.
The Group also assesses at least annually whether there have been any events or changes in circumstances that indicate that property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill may be impaired.
An impairment review is carried out whenever the assessment indicates that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
For the purposes of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Where impairment exists, the asset is written down to the higher of a its fair value minus costs to sell: and b its value in use.
Impairments are recognised immediately in the income statement.
An impairment to goodwill is never reversed.
When applicable, an impairment of any other asset is reversed, but only to the extent that the consequent carrying value does not exceed what would have been the carrying value had the impairment not originally been made.
m Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the first-in-first-out method and net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs of disposal in the ordinary course of business.
The cost of inventories includes direct costs plus production overheads.
n Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with a maturity of less than three months from the date of deposit that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash.
For cash flow statement purposes, cash and cash equivalents include bank overdrafts and short-term deposits with a maturity of less than three months from the date of deposit.
In the balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
o Loans and Receivables Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date which is normally the consideration paid plus transaction costs.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
If collection is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets, otherwise they are presented as non-current assets.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a loan or receivable is impaired and, if necessary, the carrying amount is reduced to the appropriate value.
The loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Loans and receivables cease to be recognised when the right to receive cash flows has expired or the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
p Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date which is normally the consideration received less, in the case of financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs.
The Group subsequently remeasures all of its non-derivative financial liabilities, including trade payables, at amortised cost.
Payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year, otherwise they are presented as non-current liabilities.
q Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation.
The measurement of a provision is based on the most likely amount and timing of the expenditures.
Payments that are expected to arise after more than one year are discounted to their present value using a risk-free interest rate that is relevant to the region in which the past event occurred.
The risk-free interest rate is based on the redemption yields of government securities.

Principal Accounting Policies continued r Post-Employment Benefits i Defined Contribution Retirement Schemes Payments to defined contribution retirement schemes are charged to the income statement when they fall due.
ii Defined Benefit Retirement Schemes Payments to defined benefit retirement schemes are recognised as increments to the assets of the schemes.
The amount charged to the income statement with respect to these schemes, within profit from operations, is the increase in the retirement benefit obligation resulting from the additional service provided by the participating employees during the current year, which for the funded scheme is measured using the Projected Unit method and for the unfunded scheme is equal to the contributions paid.
Net interest arising on the net assets of the schemes is also recognised in the income statement within net finance costs.
Curtailment gains and losses are recognised fully and immediately in the income statement.
Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised fully and immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The assets of the funded scheme, which are invested in insurance policies, have been valued using the same methodology and assumptions used to calculate the defined benefit obligation so that, where the assets match the liabilities, the value of the assets is equal to the value of the corresponding obligation.
s Share-Based Payments The Group issues equity-settled, share-based payments HPSP awards to certain employees as consideration for services received from the employees.
The fair value of the employees services is recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of awards that will ultimately vest.
The obligation to settle these awards is recognised within other components of equity.
t Share Capital The Companys share capital comprises a single class of Ordinary shares, which are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are charged to equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax.
u Merger Reserve The merger reserve comprises the proceeds received, net of transaction costs, in excess of the nominal value of the Ordinary shares issued by way of the share placing completed on 31 October 2016.
In accordance with section 612 of the Companies Act 2006, the premium was credited to the merger reserve, instead of to the share premium account, because the share placing was pursuant to the Company securing over 90% of another entity.
The proceeds were used to pay down the Groups borrowings at that time.
The reserve is currently non-distributable and will be transferred to distributable retained earnings when the proceeds meet the definition of a qualifying consideration.
v Dividends Dividends to the Groups shareholders are recognised as liabilities in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
All dividends are dealt with in the statement of changes in equity.
