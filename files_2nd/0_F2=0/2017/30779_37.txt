The accounts have been prepared on the going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except for the recognition of derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale investments detailed below, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
In applying these policies, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 Financial Reporting Standard 100 issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
Accordingly, these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework as issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
The Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under FRS 101 in relation to share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are included within the consolidated accounts.

188 188 Financial Statements Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC Notes to the Company Accounts continued Notes to the Company Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2017 For the year ended 31 December 2017 1 Accounting policies continued Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
After initial recognition, interestbearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Hedge accounting is adopted where derivatives such as fixed to floating interest rate swaps are held as fair value hedges against fixed interest rate borrowings.
Under fair value hedge accounting, fixed interest rate borrowings are revalued at each Balance Sheet date by the change in fair value attributable to the interest rate being hedged.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
Where the Company expects a provision to be reimbursed the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when reimbursement is virtually certain.
Pensions The Company participates in both the National Express Group Staff Pension Fund a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme.
For the defined benefit scheme, the Balance Sheet position comprises the net of the present value of the relevant defined benefit obligation at the Balance Sheet date and the fair value of plan assets.
The trustees complete a full actuarial valuation triennially but the obligation is updated annually for financial reporting purposes by independent actuaries, using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the obligation is determined by the estimated future cash outflows discounted using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity equivalent to the terms of the related liability.
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are recognised as operating costs.
Past service gains and losses are also recognised within operating costs and in the period in which the related plan amendment or curtailment occurs.
Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset and is recognised within finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the profit and loss reserve in the period in which they arise.
For the defined contribution scheme, the amount charged to the profit and loss is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet.
Share-based payment The Company awards equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, under which the Company receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments options of the Group.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market service and performance vesting conditions for example, profitability, sales growth targets and remaining an employee of the Company over a specified time period.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest.
The total amount expensed is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied.
At each Balance Sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the Income Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end.
Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Any exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 189 National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 Financial Statements 189 1 Accounting policies continued Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full in respect of all material temporary differences at the Balance Sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, apart from where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences reverse based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that future taxable profits will be available against which the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
Their carrying amount is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date on the same basis.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate derivatives, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross currency swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest rate fluctuations and foreign currency.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value for the reported Balance Sheet.
The fair value of the derivatives is calculated by reference to market exchange rates and interest rates at the period end.
The Companys interest rate derivatives are designated as fair value hedges.
The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted through the Income Statement for the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, in this case movements in the risk free interest rate.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Foreign currency derivatives and cross currency swaps are used to hedge the Groups net investment in foreign currency denominated operations.
For the Company, gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
For the Group, to the extent that the derivatives are designated and effective as net investment hedges, they are transferred to equity on consolidation to match against foreign exchange exposure in the related assets and liabilities.
The Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain transactional exposures.
Gains and losses on these derivatives are recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
