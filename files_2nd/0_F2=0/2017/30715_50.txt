182 GSK Annual Report 2017 Notes to the financial statements continued 17.
Property, plant and equipment continued The net book value at 31 December 2017 of the Groups land and buildings comprised freehold properties 3,896 million 2016 3,887 million, properties with leases of 50 years or more 338 million 2016 294 million and properties with leases of less than 50 years 36 million 2016 42 million.
Included in land and buildings at 31 December 2017 were leased assets with a cost of 630 million 2016 590 million, accumulated depreciation of 255 million 2016 253 million, impairment of nil 2016 1 million and a net book value of 375 million 2016 336 million.
Included in plant, equipment and vehicles at 31 December 2017 were leased assets with a cost of 18 million 2016 44 million, accumulated depreciation of 4 million 2016 15 million, impairment of 1 million 2016 nil and a net book value of 13 million 2016 29 million.
Some lease agreements include renewal or purchase options or escalation clauses.
The impairment losses principally arose from decisions to rationalise facilities and are calculated based on either fair value less costs of disposal or value in use.
The fair value less costs of disposal valuation methodology uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data, and therefore this valuation technique is classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
These calculations determine the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, post-tax cash flows of the relevant asset or cash generating unit, applying a discount rate of the Group post-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC of 7%, adjusted where appropriate for relevant specific risks.
For value in use calculations, where an impairment is indicated and a pre-tax cash flow calculation is expected to give a materially different result, the test would be reperformed using pre-tax cash flows and a pre-tax discount rate.
The Group WACC is equivalent to a pre-tax discount rate of approximately 9%.
The net impairment losses have been charged to cost of sales 198 million 2016 45 million, R&D 93 million 2016 15 million and SG&A 36 million 2016 120 million, and included 278 million 2016 151 million arising from the major restructuring programmes.
Reversals of impairment arose from subsequent reviews of the impaired assets where the conditions which gave rise to the original impairments were deemed no longer to apply.
All of the reversals have been credited to cost of sales.
The carrying value at 31 December 2017 of assets for which impairments have been charged or reversed in the year was 33 million 2016 171 million.
During 2017, 38 million 2016 139 million of computer software was reclassified from assets in construction to intangible assets on becoming ready for use.

Goodwill continued The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are assessed using a fair value less costs of disposal model.
Fair value less costs of disposal is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach, with a post-tax discount rate applied to the projected risk-adjusted post-tax cash flows and terminal value.
The discount rate used is based on the Group WACC of 7%, as most cash generating units have integrated operations across large parts of the Group.
The discount rate is adjusted where appropriate for specific country or currency risks.
The valuation methodology uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data, therefore this valuation technique is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
Details relating to the discounted cash flow models used in the impairment tests of the Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare cash generating units are as follows: Valuation basis Fair value less costs of disposal Key assumptions Sales growth rates Profit margins Terminal growth rate Discount rate Taxation rate Determination of assumptions Growth rates are internal forecasts based on both internal and external market information.
Margins reflect past experience, adjusted for expected changes.
Terminal growth rates based on managements estimate of future long-term average growth rates.
Discount rates based on Group WACC, adjusted where appropriate.
Taxation rates based on appropriate rates for each region.
Period of specific projected cash flows Five years Terminal growth rate and discount rate Terminal growth rate Discount rate Pharmaceuticals 1% p. a.
7% The terminal growth rates do not exceed the long-term projected growth rates for the relevant markets, reflect the impact of future generic competition and take account of new product launches.
In each case the valuations indicated sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill.
Goodwill is monitored at the segmental level.
The Pharmaceuticals cash generating unit comprises a collection of smaller cash generating units including assets with indefinite lives with a carrying value of 228 million 2016 211 million.
The Consumer Healthcare cash generating unit also comprises a collection of smaller cash generating units including brands with indefinite lives with a carrying value of 8.51 billion 2016 9.03 billion.
Details of indefinite life brands are given in Note 19, Other intangible assets.
