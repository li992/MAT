Intangible assets Accounting policies Acquired intangible assets are held on the consolidated balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Acquired brands and other intangible assets are initially recognised at fair value when they are controlled through contractual or other legal rights, or are separable from the rest of the business, and the fair value can be reliably measured.
Where these assets are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives, they are not amortised.
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the value of any non-controlling interests and the fair value of any previously held equity interest in the subsidiary acquired over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 July 1998 was eliminated against reserves, and this goodwill has not been reinstated.
Goodwill arising subsequent to 1 July 1998 has been capitalised.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets is based on their useful economic lives and are amortised on a straight-line basis over those lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Goodwill and intangible assets that are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives are not amortised and are reviewed for impairment at least annually or when there is an indication that the assets may be impaired.
Impairment reviews compare the net carrying value with the recoverable amount where recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use.
Amortisation and any impairment write downs are charged to other operating expenses in the income statement.
Computer software is amortised on a straight-line basis to estimated residual value over its expected useful life.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed each year.
Subject to these reviews, the estimated useful lives are up to eight years.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Assessment of the recoverable amount of an intangible asset, the useful economic life of an asset, or that an asset has an indefinite life, requires management estimate and judgement.
Impairment reviews are carried out to ensure that intangible assets, including brands, are not carried at above their recoverable amounts.
The tests are dependent on managements estimates and judgements, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows, the discount rates applied to those cash flows and the expected long term growth rates.
Such estimates and judgements are subject to change as a result of changing economic conditions and actual cash flows may differ from forecasts.
