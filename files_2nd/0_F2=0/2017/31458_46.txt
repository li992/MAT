This reflects the change in management structure following reorganisation within the division in 2016.
Following testing on both bases, no impairment was required.
Impairment charges of 72 million 2016: 38 million have been recorded in the Income Statement as an adjusting and non-trading item within the line impairment charges, see note 11c for further details.
In 2016, a further 2 million impairment charge was recorded following the decision to curtail operations of a business in GKN Driveline, which was recorded as an adjusting and therefore non-trading item within the line gains and losses on changes in group structure, see note 4 d for further details.

138 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION c Impairment testing An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a business or cash generating unit CGU to their recoverable amount.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
For the purposes of carrying out impairment tests, the Groups total goodwill has been allocated to a number of CGUs and each of these CGUs has been separately assessed and tested.
The size of a CGU varies but is never larger than a reportable segment.
In some cases, a CGU is an individual subsidiary or operation.
Consistent with previous years, all goodwill, together with CGUs where there were indicators of impairment, was tested for impairment.
An impairment charge of 131 million 2016: 52 million has been recorded in the Income Statement as an adjusting and therefore non-trading item within the line impairment charges in respect of seven CGUs all within the Aerospace division.

Significant judgements, assumptions and estimates All CGUs recoverable amounts were measured using value in use.
Detailed forecasts for the next five years in Automotive CGUs, and ten years in the majority of Aerospace CGUs have been used which are based on approved annual budgets and strategic projections representing the best estimate of future performance.
During the year, the number of years used in detailed forecasts when projecting operating cash flows in two Aerospace businesses was reduced to five.
The reduction to five years from ten years reflected change in programme mix which reduced the Groups ability to forecast accurately beyond five years.
The impact of not changing this judgement would have reduced the impairment charge by 28 million, due to the removal of cash flows which management is forecasting to be in excess of the long-term growth rate in the period 2023-2027.
Operating cash flow projections covering the next ten years continue to be used in the majority of Aerospace CGUs as they incorporate the anticipated timing of volumes on current programmes.
Management considers forecasting over varying periods more appropriately reflect the length of business cycle of those CGUs programmes.
Key estimates In determining the value in use of CGUs it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate the present value of future cash flows.
In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management reflecting past experience and are consistent with relevant external sources of information.
Operating cash flows The main assumption within forecast operating cash flow is operating profit which comprises the achievement of future sales prices and volumes including reference to specific customer relationships, product lines and the use of industry-relevant external forecasts of global vehicle production within Automotive businesses and consideration of specific volumes on certain military and commercial programmes within Aerospace, raw material input costs, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability to realise benefits from annual productivity improvements, the impact of foreign currency rates upon selling price and cost relationships and maintenance.
com 139 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 continued 11 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued c Impairment testing continued Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates are derived from risk-free rates based on long-term government bonds in the territory, or territories, within which each CGU operates or is exposed.
A relative risk adjustment or beta has been applied to risk-free rates to reflect the risk inherent in each CGU relative to all other sectors on average, determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed companies.
The range of pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates set out below have been used for impairment testing.
The range of rates reflects the mix of geographical territories within CGUs.
In 2017, the rate used in CVJ was 14% and in AWD eDrive 12%.
Long-term growth rates To forecast beyond the detailed cash flows into perpetuity, a long-term average growth rate has been used.
In each case, this is not greater than the published International Monetary Fund average growth rate in gross domestic product for the next five-year period in the territory or territories where the CGU is primarily based or has exposure.
This results in a range of nominal growth rates: Aerospace: UK 3% 2016: 3%, Europe 3% 2016: 3% and North America 3% 2016: 3%.
Driveline: North and South America 3%-5% 2016: 3%-5%, Europe 2%-4% 2016: 2%-4% and Japan and Asia Pacific region countries 2%-9% 2016: 2%-9%.
In 2017, the rate used in CVJ was 4% and in AWD eDrive 3%.
Powder Metallurgy: Europe 3% 2016: 3% and North America 3% 2016: 3%.
Sensitivity of results to changes in estimations The impairment review performed showed significant headroom on CGUs that were not impaired, therefore it is not considered that any reasonably possible changes would have generated an impairment charge.
However, the CGU listed below has the potential to be impacted by reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which, when changed in isolation, would eliminate headroom in the model and when changed in combination could result in a material impairment within the next year.
Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken to determine the movement required on these key assumptions which would lead to an impairment charge.
