Tokens are typically redeemed within five years of issue.
The insurance provisions relate to insurance reserves on incurred accidents up to the year-end in each year where claims have not been settled.
These are based on actuarial reviews and prior claims history.
Claims are typically settled within five years of origination.
The environmental provisions relate to legal or constructive obligations to undertake environmental work, such as an obligation to rectify land which has been contaminated by fuel or to eliminate the presence of asbestos.
The provision is based on the estimated cost of undertaking the work required, and is expected to be utilised over the next five years.
The redundancy provision relates to planned redundancies and is expected to be utilised within one year.
Provisions for onerous contracts relate to contracts where the costs of fulfilling the contract outweigh the economic benefits to be received, which includes contracts that have been acquired through business combinations that have been identified as being on unfavourable terms at the relevant acquisition date.
The onerous contract provision in respect of Virgin Trains East Coast has been calculated based on updated financial forecasts for the franchise.
The forecasts are based on a number of assumptions, most significantly in respect of revenue growth.
There can be no certainty that the actual outcome will be consistent with those currently forecast, however based on our sensitivity analysis, we consider it unlikely that the actual costs will be more than 10m higher or lower than the provision recorded.
The provisions are expected to be fully utilised within three years.
