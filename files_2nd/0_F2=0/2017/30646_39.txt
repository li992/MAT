Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Financial statements and other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements 131 7 Share based remuneration Accounting policy The fair value of share based remuneration is determined at the date of grant and recognised as an expense in the income statement on astraight-line basis over the vesting period, taking account of the estimated number of shares that are expected to vest.
Market based performance criteria are taken into account when determining the fair value at the date of grant.
Non-market based performance criteria are taken into account when estimating the number of shares expected to vest.
The fair value of share based remuneration isdetermined by use of a binomial or Monte Carlo simulation model as appropriate.
All of the Groups share based remuneration is equity settled.
The Group provides a number of share based remuneration schemes to Directors and employees.
The principal share based remuneration schemes are the Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS, the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Retention Share Plan RSP and the Bonus Investment Plan BIP.
Share options granted under ESOS are exercisable after three years and up to ten years from the date of grant at a price equivalent to the market value of the respective shares at the date of grant.
Conditional shares granted under LTIP, RSP and BIP are exercisable after three years for nil consideration if conditions are met.
Other awards principally relate to all employee share based saving schemes in the UK and the Netherlands.
Share based remuneration awards are, other than upon retirement or in exceptional circumstances, subject to the condition that the employee remains in employment at the time of exercise.
Conditional shares granted under LTIP, RSP and BIP between 2014 and 2017 are subject to the achievement of growth targets ofadjusted earnings per share measured at constant exchange rates as well as the achievement of a targeted percentage return on invested capital of the Group.
LTIP grants between 2014 and 2017 and RSP grants in 2014 and 2017 are also variable subject to the achievement ofa total shareholder return performance target.
The weighted average fair value per award is based on full vesting on achievement of non-market-related performance conditions and stochastic models for market-related components.
The conditional shares and option awards are recognised in the income statement over the vesting period, being between three and five years, on the basis of expected performance against the non-market-related conditions, with the fair value related to market-related components unchanging.
