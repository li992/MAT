note32, page 150 Strategic Report, pages 1-77 136 Tritax Big Box REIT plc Annual Report 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION The following descriptions and definitions relating to valuation techniques and key unobservable inputs made in determining fair values are asfollows: Valuation techniques: market comparablemethod Under the market comparable method or market comparable approach, a propertys fair value is estimated based on comparable transactions in themarket.
Unobservable input: passingrent The rent at which space could be let in the market conditions prevailing at the date of valuation range: 893,500-5,675,049 perannum.
Passing rents are dependent upon a number of variables in relation to the Groups property.
These include: size, location, tenant covenant strength and terms of thelease.
Unobservable input: rentalgrowth The estimated average increase in rent based on both market estimations and contractual arrangements.
A reduction of the estimated future rental growth in the valuation model would lead to a decrease in the fair value of the investment property and an inflation of the estimated future rental growth would lead to an increase in the fair value.
No quantitative sensitivity analysis has been provided for estimated rental growth as a reasonable range would not result in a significant movement in fairvalue.
Unobservable input: net initialyield The net initial yield is defined as the initial gross income as a percentage of the market value or purchase price as appropriate plus standard costs of purchase range: 3.91%-6.85%.
Sensitivities of measurement of significant unobservableinputs As set out within significant accounting estimates and judgements above, the Groups property portfolio valuation is open to judgements and is inherently subjective bynature.
