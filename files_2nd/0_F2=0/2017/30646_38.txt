Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Financial statements and other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements 127 6 Pension schemes Accounting policy The expense of dened benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement employee benets is determined using the projected unit credit method and charged in the income statement as an operating expense, based on actuarial assumptions reecting market conditions at the beginning of the financial year.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Past service costs and credits are recognised immediately at the earlier of when plan amendments or curtailments occur and when related restructuring costs or termination benets are recognised.
Settlements are recognised when they occur.
Net pension obligations in respect of dened benefit schemes are included in the statement of financial position at the present value of scheme liabilities, less the fair value of scheme assets.
Where schemes are in surplus, i. e. assets exceed liabilities, the net pension assets are separately included in the statement of financial position.
Any net pension asset is limited to the extent that the asset is recoverable.
The expense of dened contribution pension schemes and other employee benets is charged in the income statement as incurred.
Critical judgement and key source of estimation uncertainty At 31 December 2017, the Group operates dened benefit pension schemes in the UK and the US.
These schemes require management to exercise judgement in estimating the ultimate cost of providing post-employment benets, especially given the length of each schemes liabilities.
Accounting for dened benefit pension schemes involves judgement about uncertain events, including the life expectancy of the members, salary and pension increases, ination, the future operation of each scheme and the rate at which the future pension payments are discounted.
Estimates for these factors are used in determining the pension cost and liabilities reported in the financial statements.
The estimates made around future developments of each of the critical assumptions are made in conjunction with independent actuaries, and each scheme is subject to a periodic review by independent actuaries.
Information regarding some of the assumptions used for valuation is provided below, together with a sensitivity analysis.
A number of pension schemes are operated around the world.
The largest dened benefit schemes as at 31 December 2017 are in the UK and the US.
In November 2015, the Netherlands dened benefit pension scheme, together with all associated assets and liabilities, was transferred into an industry-wide collective dened contribution scheme.
This scheme is now accounted for as a dened contribution pension plan, with no deficit or surplus recognised on the balance sheet.
Prior to this, the scheme was a career average salary scheme and was open to new hires.
Major defined benefit schemes in place at 31 December 2017 The UK scheme is a final salary scheme and is closed to new hires.
Members accrue a portion of their final pensionable earnings based on the number of years of service.
The US scheme is a cash balance scheme and is closed to new hires.
Members earn pay credits dependent on age and years of service up to certain limits which are added to an account balance that accrues interest at specified minimum rates.
In September 2017, it was announced the US scheme would be closed to future accruals effective 1 January 2019.
Each of the major dened benefit schemes is administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Group.
The trustees ofthe pension funds in the UK and plan duciaries of the US scheme are required by law to act in the interest of the funds beneciaries.
In the UK, the trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
The board of trustees consists of an equal number of company-appointed and member nominated Directors.
In the US, the duciary duties for the scheme are allocated between committees which are staffed by senior employees of the Group: the investment committee has the primary responsibility for the investment and management of plan assets.
The funding of the Groups major schemes reects the different rules within each jurisdiction.
In the UK, the level of funding is determined by statutory triennial actuarial valuations in accordance with pensions legislation.
Where the scheme falls below 100% funded status, the Group and the scheme trustees must agree on how the deficit is to be remedied.
The UK Pensions Regulator has significant powers and sets out in codes and guidance the parameters for scheme funding.
The US scheme has an annual statutory valuation which forms the basis for establishing the employer contribution each year subject to ERISA and IRS minimums.
Should the statutory funded status fall to below 100%, the US Pension Protection Act requires the deficit to be rectied with additional contributions over a seven-year period.
Employer cash contributions to dened benefit pension schemes, in respect of 2018, are expected to be approximately 37m including apension deficit funding contribution of 20m relating to the UK scheme recovery plan.
In addition to the contributions set out above, the Group has committed to providing a further 110m of deficit funding contributions to the UK scheme over the period from 2019 to 2022.
The triennial valuation will take place during 2018, as part of which funding requirements in future years will be reassessed.

Service cost, including settlements and past service credits, is presented within operating profit.
The 2017 settlement and past service cost credits primarily relate to changes to the UK scheme.
Settlements and past service credits in 2015 primarily relate to the transfer of the Netherlands scheme to a collective industry-wide scheme.
The significant valuation assumptions, determined for each major scheme in conjunction with the respective independent actuaries, arepresented below.
The net dened benefit pension expense for each year is based on the assumptions and scheme valuations set at 31December of the prior year.
Mortality assumptions make allowance for future improvements in longevity and have been determined by reference to applicable mortality statistics.

As at 31 December 2017, the dened benefit obligations comprised 4,690m 2016: 4,760m in relation to funded schemes and 239m 2016:243m in relation to unfunded schemes.
The weighted average duration of dened benefit scheme liabilities is 20 years in the UK 2016: 20 years and 13 years in the US 2016:13years.
Deferred tax assets of 66m 2016: 145m are recognised in respect of the pension scheme deficits.
A net pension asset has been recognised in relation to the US funded scheme after considering the guidance in IAS 19 Employee Benets and IFRIC 14.
The split between net pension obligations and net pension assets is as follows: 2017 2016 m m Net pension asset 22 Net pension obligation 350 636 Overall net pension obligation 328 636 130 RELX Group Annual reports and financial statements 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 6 Pension schemes continued Amounts recognised in the statement of comprehensive income are set out below: 2017 2016 2015 m m m Gains and losses arising during the year: Experience losses gains on scheme liabilities 38 25 182 Experiencegains losses on scheme assets 287 548 134 Actuarial losses gains on the present value of scheme liabilities due to changes in: discount rates 102 873 96 ination 69 96 64 other actuarial assumptions 17 134 77 233 262 157 Net cumulative losses at start of year 846 584 741 Net cumulative losses at end of year 613 846 584 The major categories and fair values of scheme assets at the end of the reporting period are as follows: FAIR VALUE OF SCHEME ASSETS 2017 2016 UK US Total UK US Total m m m m m m Equities 1,252 143 1,395 1,261 330 1,591 Government bonds 1,395 221 1,616 1,390 104 1,494 Corporate bonds 622 622 527 527 Property funds and ground leases 620 620 487 487 Structured debt and direct lending 253 253 162 162 Cash and cash equivalents 46 18 64 69 15 84 Other 23 8 31 21 1 22 Total 3,589 1,012 4,601 3,390 977 4,367 Assets and obligations associated with the schemes are sensitive to changes in the market values of assets and the market-related assumptions used to value scheme liabilities.
In particular, adverse changes to asset values, discount rates or ination could increase future pension costs and funding requirements.
Typically, the Groups schemes are exposed to: investment risks, whereby actual rates of return on plan assets may be below those rates used to determine the dened benefit obligations, and interest rate risks, whereby scheme deficits may increase if bond yields in the UK and the US decline and are not offset by returns in government and corporate bond portfolios.
The schemes are also exposed to other risks, such as unanticipated future increases in member longevity patterns and ination, all potentially leading to an increase in scheme liabilities.
Investment policies of each scheme are intended to ensure continuous payment of dened benefit pensions in the short-term and long-term.
Efforts are made to limit risks on marketable securities by adopting investment policies that diversify assets across geographies and among equities, government and corporate bonds, property funds and cash.
Asset allocations are dependent on avariety of factors including the duration of scheme liabilities and the funded position of the plan.
All equities, government and corporate bonds have quoted prices in active markets.
Sensitivity analysis The valuation of the Groups pension scheme liabilities involves significant actuarial assumptions, being the life expectancy of the members, ination and the rate at which the future pension payments are discounted.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension charges.
In particular, changes in assumptions for discount rates, ination and life expectancies that are reasonably possible would have the following approximate effects on the dened benefit pension obligations: m Increase decrease of 0.25% in discount rate: 222 Increase decrease of 0.25% in the expected ination rate: 134 Increase decrease of one year in assumed life expectancy: 179 The above analysis has been calculated on the same basis used to determine the dened benefit obligation recognised in the statement of financial position.
There has been no change in the methods used to prepare the analysis compared with prior years.
This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the dened benefit obligation as it is unlikely that changes in the above assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
