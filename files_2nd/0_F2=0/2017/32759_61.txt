Financial risk management and associated risks Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital include the safeguard of the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order toprovide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost ofcapital.
The Group does not have externally-imposed capital requirements.
The Group may incur indebtedness for the purpose of financing share repurchases or redemptions, making investments including as bridge finance for investment obligations, satisfying working capital requirements or to assist in payment of the Charitable Donation, up to a maximum of 20 per cent of the NAV at the time of incurrence.
The Group may utilise gearing if, at the time of incurrence, it considers it prudent and desirable to do so in light of prevailing market conditions.
There is no limitation on indebtedness being incurred at the level of the Partnerships underlying investments.
Financial risk management The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks as a result of its activities.
These risks include market risk including market price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
These risks have existed throughout the year and the Groups policies for managing them are summarised below.
The risks below do not reflect the risks of the underlying investment portfolios of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group has very significant indirect exposure to a number of risks through the underlying portfolios of the investment entities.
This is the intention of the Group in order to achieve capital gains.
There is no sensible mechanism to control these risks without considerably prejudicing return objectives.
Due to the lack of transparency in many of the underlying assets it is not possible to quantify or hedge the impact of these risks on the portfolio as each investment entity may have complex and changing risk dynamics that are not easily observable or predictable.
These risks will include extensive interest, foreign exchange and other market risks which are magnified by significant gearing in many cases, resulting in increased liquidity and return risk.

Financial risk management and associated risks continued Syncona Limited Syncona Limited is exposed to financial risks through its investments in the Partnership and the Holding Company.
The risks and policies for managing them are set out in the sections below.
Partnership Market price risk The overall market price risk management of each of the holdings of the Partnership is primarily driven by their respective investment objectives.
The Investment Manager assesses the risk in the Partnerships portfolio by monitoring exposures, liquidity, and concentrations of the underlying funds investments, in the context of the historic and current volatility of their asset classes, and the Investment Managers risk appetite.
The maximum risk resulting from financial instruments is generally determined by the fair value of underlying funds.
The overall market exposure as at 31 March 2017 is shown in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
The financial instruments are sensitive to market price risk: any increase or decrease in market price will have an equivalent movement in market value of the financial instruments.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk represents the potential loss or gain the Partnership may suffer through holding foreign currency assets in the face of foreign exchange movements.
The Partnerships treatment of currency transactions is set out in note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Translation of foreign currency and Forward currency contracts.
Currency risk exists in the underlying investments, the analysis of which is not feasible.
The investments of the Partnership are denominated in US Dollars, Euros, Swedish Krona and Sterling.
The Partnerships functional and presentation currency is Sterling: hence the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position may be significantly affected by movements in the exchange rates between the foreign currencies previously mentioned.
The Investment Manager may manage exposure to Euro and US Dollar movements by using forward foreign currency contracts to hedge exposure to investments in Euro and US Dollar denominated share classes.
As at 31 March 2017, the Partnership had three open forward foreign currency contracts 31 March 2016: two.

The resulting impact on the NAV of the Partnership is detailed in the table below.
The sensitivity analysis percentage represents the Investment Managers assessment, based on the foreign exchange rate movements over the relevant period and of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The table below includes the effect of the Groups hedging strategy.
2017 2017 2017 2016 2016 2016 USD EUR SEK USD EUR SEK 000 000 000 000 000 000 10% increase 11,337 515 215 10,603 97 357 10% decrease 13,856 628 263 12,958 118 436 Interest rate risk Interest receivable on bank deposits or payable on bank overdrafts are affected by fluctuations in interest rates, however as interest rates are low the effect is not expected to be material.
All cash balances are at variable rates.
Interest rate risk may exist in the Partnerships underlying investments, the analysis of which has not been possible.
Credit risk Credit risk in relation to securities transactions awaiting settlement is managed through the rules and procedures of the relevant stock exchanges.
In particular settlements for transactions in listed securities are effected by the Custodian on a delivery against payment or receipt against payment basis.
Transactions in unlisted securities are effected against binding subscription agreements.
Credit risk may exist in the Partnerships underlying investments, the analysis of which has not been possible.
The principal credit risks for the Partnership are in relation to deposits with banks.
Northern Trust Guernsey Limited NTGL acts as the principal banker to the Partnership, and as custodian of its assets.
The securities held by NTGL as Custodian are held in trust and are registered in the name of Syncona Investments LP Incorporated.
NTGL is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Northern Trust Corporation TNTC.
TNTC is publicly traded and a constituent of the S&P 500.
As at 31March2017, TNTC has a credit rating of A 31 March 2016: A from Standard & Poors and A2 31 March 2016: A2 from Moodys.
The credit risk associated with debtors is limited to any unrealised gains on open forward foreign currency contracts, as detailed above, and other receivables.
Liquidity risk The Partnership is exposed to the possibility that it may be unable to liquidate its assets as it otherwise deems advisable as the Partnerships underlying funds or their managers may require minimum holding periods and restrictions on redemptions.
Further, there may be suspension or delays in payment of redemption proceeds by underlying funds or holdbacks of redemption proceeds otherwise payable to the Partnership until after the applicable underlying funds financial records have been audited.
Therefore, the Partnership may hold receivables that may not be paid to the Partnership for a significant period of time, may not accrue any interest and ultimately may not be paid to the Partnership.
As at 31 March 2017, no suspension from redemptions existed in any of the Partnerships underlying investments 31 March 2016: nil.
Syncona Limited Annual report and accounts 2017 95 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2017 22.
Financial risk management and associated risks continued The table below details the Partnerships liquidity analysis for its financial assets and liabilities.
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash flows on the financial assets and liabilities that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross cash flows on those financial assets and liabilities that require gross settlement.
1 Greater than 2017 Within 1 month 1 to 3 months 3 to 12 months 12 months Total 000 000 000 000 000 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 161,664 137,494 237,344 67,693 604,195 Cash and cash equivalents 86,204 86,204 Trade and other receivables 4,669 4,669 Unrealised loss gains on forward currency contracts 461 898 437 Payables 68 68 Distribution payable 4,755 4,755 Total 252,469 137,033 233,487 67,693 690,682 Percentage 36.6% 19.8% 33.8% 9.8% 100.0% 1 Greater than 2016 Within 1 month 1 to 3 months 3 to 12 months 12 months Total 000 000 000 000 000 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 110,500 36,833 230,209 82,876 460,418 Cash and cash equivalents 12,358 12,358 Trade and other receivables 281 281 Unrealised gains on forward currency contracts 4,049 4,049 Payables 36 36 Distribution payable 4,776 4,776 Total 123,103 40,882 225,433 82,876 472,294 Percentage 26.1% 8.7% 47.7% 17.5% 100.0% 1 The liquidity tables above reflect the anticipated cash flows assuming notice was given to all underlying investments as at 31 March 2017 31 March 2016.
They include a provision for audit hold back which most hedge funds apply to full redemptions and any other known restrictions the managers of the underlying funds may have placed on redemptions.
Where there is currently no firm indication from the underlying manager on the expected timing of the receipt of redemption proceeds, the relevant amount is included in the greater than 12 months category.
The cash flow projections are therefore conservative estimates.
Holding Company Market price risk The Company invests in early stage life science companies that typically have limited products in development: any problems encountered in a product may have a damaging effect on that companys business and the value of the investment.
This is mitigated by the employment of highly experienced personnel and the performance of extensive due diligence prior to investment.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk represents the potential loss or gain on the valuation of life science investments, calculated using a discounted cashflow model, as a result of the impact that a change in foreign currency exchange rates would have on future cash flows of the investee companies.
All investments are made in Sterling and all investments report in Sterling.
The below analysis is calculated from movements in the USD exchange rate affecting the life science investments.
2017 000 10% increase 11,437 10% decrease 13,980 Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is negligible in the Holding Company as no cash or debt is held.
Credit risk The Holding Company has no receivables.
The equity investments in life science companies are highly illiquid and cannot be recovered from the investee.
The investments are held for the long term and will typically be realised through sale or Initial Public Offering of the companies concerned.
