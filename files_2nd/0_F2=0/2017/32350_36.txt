The Company therefore considers that there are two distinct reporting segments, listed investments and direct property, which are used for evaluating performance and allocation of resources.
The Board, which is the principal decision maker, receives information on the two segments on a regular basis.
Whilst revenue streams and direct property costs can be attributed to the reporting segments, general administrative expenses cannot be split to allow a profit for each segment to be determined.
The assets and gross revenues for each segment are shown above.
The property costs included within note 3 are 2,078 2016: 1,533 and deducting these costs from the direct property gross revenue above would result in net income of 3,252 2016: 2,820 for the direct property reporting segment.
These comprise mainly stamp duty and commission.
1 Included within UK listed equities and convertibles is a holding in NewRiver which is listed on the Alternative Investment Market AIM with a fair value of 8,530,000 2016: 12,366,000.
2 Net additions disposals includes 1,177,000 2016: 4,765,000 of capital expenditure.
Net appreciation depreciation includes amounts in respect of rent free periods.
3 Gross revenue for contracts for difference relates to dividends receivable, on an ex dividend basis, on the underlying positions held.
e Substantial share interests The Group held interests in 3% or more of any class of capital in 6 companies we invest in.
None of these investments is considered significant in the context of these financial statements.
See note 21 on page 86 for further details of subsidiary investments.

The Companys fair value hierarchy is identical except for the inclusion of the fair value of the investment in Subsidiaries which at 31 March 2017 was 50,531,000 2016: 53,052,000 these have been categorised as level 3 in both years.
The total financial assets at fair value for the Company at 31 March 2017 was 1,197,453,000 2016: 1,151,941,000.
The movement from 31 March 2016 of 2,521,000 represents a reclassication of 2,100,000 to a subsidiary intercompany account together with depreciation of 421,000 2016: 465,000 depreciation in the period.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset as follows: Level 1 valued using quoted prices in an active market for identical assets.
Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The valuation techniques used by the Group are explained in the accounting policies in notes 1 f and 1 g. TR Property Investment Trust 73
