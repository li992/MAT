Retirement bene t obligations Accounting policy The Group operates pension and other post-retirement bene t plans around the world, which can be categorised into fide ned contribution plans and fide ned bene t plans.
For fide ned contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension plans on a statutory or contractual basis, and such amounts are charged to operating expenses.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
For funded fide ned bene t plans, the liability recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the fide ned bene t obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets.
For unfunded fide ned bene t plans the liability recognised at the balance sheet date is the present value of the fide ned bene t obligation.
The fide ned bene t obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit method.
The present value of the fide ned bene t obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash out ows using an interest rate equal to the yield on high-quality corporate bonds of the same currency and term as the bene t payments.
Actuarial gains and losses that arise are recognised in shareholders equity and presented in the statement of other comprehensive income in the period they arise.
The Group determines the net interest expense on the net fide ned bene t liability for the year by applying the discount rate used to measure the fide ned bene t obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then net fide ned bene t liability, taking into account any changes in the net fide ned bene t liability during the year as a result of contributions and bene t payments.
Net interest expense, the cost of the accrual of new bene ts, bene t enhancements or reductions and administration expenses met directly from plan assets are recognised in the income statement.
Signifi cant accounting estimates and judgements There are many factors that affect the measurement of retirement bene t obligations of the UK Fund and overseas plans.
This measurement requires the use of assumptions, such as in ation, salary increases, pension increases and discount rates which are inherently uncertain: the sensitivity of the liabilities to changes in these assumptions is shown in the note below.
Retirement bene t obligations comprise: 2017 2016 $million $million fide ned bene t plans obligation 443 495 fide ned contribution plans obligation 12 30 Net obligation 455 525 Retirement bene t charge comprises: 2017 2016 $million $million fide ned bene t plans 98 85 fide ned contribution plans 259 231 Charge against pro t note 7 357 316 The Group operates over 50 fide ned bene t plans across its geographies, many of which are closed to new entrants who now join fide ned contribution arrangements.
The aim of all these plans is to give employees the opportunity to save appropriately for retirement in a way that is consistent with local regulations, taxation requirements and market conditions.
The fide ned bene t plans expose the Group to currency risk, interest rate risk, investment risk and actuarial risks such as longevity risk.
The material holdings of government and corporate bonds shown in the asset table below partially hedge movements in the liabilities resulting from interest rate changes.
Setting aside movements from other drivers such as currency uctuation, the falls in discount rates in most geographies over 2017 have led to higher liabilities.
These have been somewhat offset by rises in the value of bonds held, higher stock markets generally and changes to demographic assumptions re ecting an assumed lower future pace of mortality improvements in the UK.
These movements are shown as actuarial losses versus gains respectively in the tables below.
Higher contributions into a number of plans have also helped the net fide cit reduce over the year.
The disclosures required under IAS 19 have been calculated by independent quali ed actuaries based on the most recent full actuarial valuations updated, where necessary, to 31 December 2017.
UK Fund The Standard Chartered Pension Fund the UK Fund is the Groups largest pension plan, representing 60 per cent of total pension liabilities, and provides pensions based on 1 60th of final salary per year of service, normally payable from age 60.
The UK Fund is set up under a trust that is legally separate from the Bank its formal sponsor and, as required by UK legislation, at least one-third of the trustee directors are nominated by members: the remainder are appointed by the Bank.
The trustee directors have a duciary duty to members and are responsible for governing the UK Fund in accordance with its Trust Deed and Rules.
The financial position of the UK Fund is regularly assessed by an independent quali ed actuary.
The funding valuation as at 31 December 2017 is currently underway with results expected to be nalised over the course of 2018, as permitted by UK pension regulations.
The most recent completed funding valuation was performed as at 31 December 2014 by A Zegleman, Fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, of Willis Towers Watson, using the projected unit method and assumptions different from those below.
To repair the $97 million 72 million past service fide cit identi ed as at 31 December 2014, four annual cash payments of $17.0 million 12.6 million were agreed, starting in January 2016.
The agreement allows that if the funding position improves more quickly than expected, the three payments from January 2017 could be reduced or eliminated.
The actuarial assessment that applied to the January 2017 and 2018 payments did not allow for a reduction in either case, so the full 12.6 million payments were paid into the Fund on 16 January 2017 and 11 January 2018.
In addition, an escrow account of $149 million 110 million exists to provide security for future contributions.
Following the 31 December 2014 valuation, regular contributions to the UK Fund were set at 32 per cent of pensionable salary for all members.

Retirement bene t obligations continued UK Fund continued With effect from 1 July 1998, the UK Fund was closed to new entrants and new employees are offered membership of a fide ned contribution plan.
Over 90 per cent of the Funds liabilities now relate to pensioners or ex-employees who have left the Group but have not yet retired.
The discretionary pension increase awarded April 2017 was half what was assumed in the accounting liabilities, and this is re ected in the gain in the pension cost table below.
As at 31 December 2017, the weighted-average duration of the UK Fund was 15 years 2016: 16 years.
The Group is not required to recognise any additional liability under IFRIC 14 or the 2015 exposure draft of proposed amendments to it, as the Bank has control of any pension surplus under the Trust Deed and Rules.
Overseas plans The principal overseas fide ned bene t arrangements operated by the Group are in Germany, Hong Kong, India, Jersey, Korea, Taiwan and the United States of America US.
Key assumptions The principal financial assumptions used at 31 December 2017 were: Funded plans 1 2 UK Fund Overseas Plans 2017 2016 2017 2016 % % % % Price in ation 2.1 2.1 1.05.0 1.05.0 Salary increases 2.1 2.1 2.17.0 2.16.5 Pension increases 2.1 2.1 1.63.2 1.53.2 Discount rate 2.5 2.7 1.07.2 1.36.9 1 The assumptions for life expectancy for the UK Fund are that a male member currently aged 60 will live for 28 years 2016: 28 years and a female member for 29 years 2016: 29 years and a male member currently aged 40 will live for 30 years 2016: 30 years and a female member for 30 years 2016: 31 years after their 60th birthdays 2 The range of assumptions shown is for the main funded fide ned bene t overseas plans in Germany, Hong Kong, India, Jersey, Korea, Taiwan and the US.
These comprise over 85 per cent of the total liabilities of funded overseas plans These assumptions are likely to change in the future and this will affect the value placed on the liabilities.
For example, changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the fide ned bene t obligation by the amounts shown below: If the discount rate increased by 25 basis points the liability would reduce by approximately $65 million for the UK Fund and $30 million for the other plans If the rate of in ation and pension increases increased by 25 basis points the liability would increase by approximately $45 million for the UK Fund and $20 million for the other plans If the rate salaries increase compared with in ation increased by 25 basis points the liability would increase by $2 million for the UK Fund and approximately $15 million for the other plans If longevity expectations increased by one year the liability would increase by approximately $55 million for the UK Fund and $15 million for the other plans Although this analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash ows expected under the UK Fund, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity to the main assumptions.
While changes in other assumptions would also have an impact, the effect would not be as signi cant.

Costs arising in funded overseas schemes arise primarily in India from the expected statutory increase in the gratuity payment ceiling, an early retirement severance plan and a discretionary increase to minimum pensions.
The gain in the post-retirement medical plan arises due to the reduction in eligibility criteria in the US plan 2 The costs arise primarily from the settlement of bene ts in Thailand 3 The actual return on the UK fund assets was $73 million and on overseas plan assets was $106 million 267 Notes to the FINANCIAL STATEMENTS financial statements 30.
