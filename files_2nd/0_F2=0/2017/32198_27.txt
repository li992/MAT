Notes to the Company financial statements 1.
Accounting policies AutoTrader Group plc is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is domiciled and incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The Company was incorporated on 13 February 2015 and adopted FRS 102 from that date.
Statement of compliance and basis of preparation The Company financial statements of AutoTrader Group plc have been prepared in compliance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102, The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland FRS102 and the Companies Act 2006.
The Company financial statements have been prepared under the historic cost convention, as modified for the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities through profit or loss.
The current year financial information presented is for the 369 day period ended 31 March 2017.
The comparative financial information presented is at and for the 364 day 52 week period ended 27 March 2016.
Financial period ends have been referred to as 31 March throughout the consolidated financial statements as per the Companys accounting reference date.
The Directors have used the going concern principle on the basis that the current profitable financial projections and facilities of the consolidated Group will continue in operation for a period not less than 12 months from the date of this report.
The Company financial statements have been prepared in sterling which is the functional and presentational currency of the Company and have been presented in round m. As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, an entity profit and loss account is not included as part of the published consolidated financial statements of AutoTrader Group plc.
The loss for the financial period dealt with in the financial statements of the parent company was 1.9m 2016: loss of 1.1m.
As the Company is included in the consolidated financial statements and is considered to be a qualifying entity under FRS 102 paragraphs 1.8 to 1.12, the following exemptions have been applied: no separate parent company cash flow statement with related notes has been included: and Key Management personnel compensation has not been included a second time.
Amounts paid to the Companys auditors in respect of the statutory audit were 55,000 2016: 50,000.
Estimation techniques The preparation of financial statements in conformity with FRS 102 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise their judgement in the process of applying the Companys accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are share-based payments: and carrying value of investments.
Share-based payment arrangements in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
The accounting policies of such arrangements are disclosed in note 1 of the Group accounts.
The fair value of services received in return for share options is calculated with reference to the fair value of the award on the date of grant.
Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models have been used where appropriate to calculate the fair value and the Directors have therefore made estimates with regards to the inputs to that model and the period over which the share award is expected to vest note 26 of the consolidated Group financial statements.
The Group considers annually whether the carrying value of investments has suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy stated.
The recoverable amounts of investments have been determined based on value-in-use calculations, which require the use of estimates.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost, less any provision for impairment.
Annually, the Directors consider whether any events or circumstances have occurred that could indicate that the carrying amount of fixed asset investments may not be recoverable.
If such circumstances do exist, a full impairment review is undertaken to establish whether the carrying amount exceeds the higher of net realisable value or value in use.
If this is the case, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the related investment.
Where equity-settled share-based payments are granted to the employees of subsidiary companies, the fair value of the award is treated as acapital contribution by the Company and the investments in subsidiaries are adjusted to reflect this capital contribution.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
Where the Group purchases its own equity share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from equity attributable to the Groups shareholders.
Where such shares are subsequently cancelled, the nominal value of the shares repurchased is deducted from share capital and transferred to a capital redemption reserve.
Where the Group purchases its own equity share capital to hold in Treasury, the consideration paid for the shares is shown as own shares held within equity.
Shares held by the Employee Share Option Trust Shares in the Company held by the Employee Share Option Trust ESOT are included in the balance sheet at cost as a deduction from equity.
118 Auto Trader Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Taxation UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred on the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all evidence available, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried-forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis.
Financial instruments The Company has chosen to adopt Sections 11 and 12 of FRS 102 in respect of financial instruments.
a Financial assets Basic financial assets, including trade and other receivables, cash and bank balances and investments in commercial paper, are initially recognised at transaction price unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Financial assets which constitute a financing transaction are measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest.
Such assets are subsequently carried at fair value and the changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss, except that investments in equity instruments that are not publicly traded and whose fair values cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost less impairment.
At the end of each reporting period financial assets measured at amortised cost are assessed for objective evidence of impairment.
If an asset is impaired the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the assets original effective interest rate.
The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
If there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the impairment is reversed.
The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not exceed what the carrying amount would have been had the impairment not previously been recognised.
The impairment reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
Financial assets are derecognised when a the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are settled, or b substantially all the risks and rewards of the ownership of the asset are transferred to another party or c despite having retained some significant risks and rewards of ownership, control of the asset has been transferred to another party who has the practical ability to unilaterally sell the asset to an unrelated third party without imposing additional restrictions.
b Financial liabilities Basic financial liabilities, including trade and other payables, bank loans, loans from fellow Group companies and preference shares that are classified as debt, are initially recognised at transaction price, unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest.
Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down.
In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.
To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers.
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less.
If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Dividend distribution Dividends to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Companys financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders in the case of final dividends.
In respect of interim dividends, these are recognised once paid.
Directors emoluments The Company has no employees other than the Directors.
Full details of the Directors remuneration and interests are set out in the Directors remuneration report on pages 62 to 68.
