RELX Group uses adjusted and underlying gures as additional performance measures.
Adjusted gures primarily exclude the amortisation of acquired intangible assets and other items related to acquisitions and disposals, and the associated deferred tax movements.
In 2017, we have excluded the exceptional tax credit arising as a result of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Reconciliations between the reported and adjusted gures are set out on page 186.
Underlying growth rates are calculated at constant currencies, and exclude the results of acquisitions and disposals made in both the year and prior year and of assets held for sale.
Underlying revenue growth rates also exclude the effects of exhibition cycling.
Constant currency growth rates are based on 2016 full-year average and hedge exchange rates.
