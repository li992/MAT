Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued The amounts shown for finance debt in the table below include future minimum lease payments with respect to finance leases.
The table also shows the timing of cash outflows relating to trade and other payables and accruals.
b Fair value adjustments relating to hedging activity have been excluded from finance debt which therefore is not equal the amounts presented on the balance sheet.
2016 has been amended to conform with this presentation.
c 2016 has been amended to exclude interest payments that do not relate to finance debt.
Interest on liabilities is included in trade and other payables.
The group manages liquidity risk associated with derivative contracts, other than derivative hedging instruments, based on the expected maturities of both derivative assets and liabilities as indicated in Note 28.
Management does not currently anticipate any cash flows that could be of a significantly different amount, or could occur earlier than the expected maturity analysis provided.
The table below shows the timing of cash outflows for derivative financial instruments entered into for the purpose of managing interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk associated with net debt, whether or not hedge accounting is applied, based upon contractual payment dates.
The amounts reflect the gross settlement amount where the pay leg of a derivative will be settled separately from the receive leg, as in the case of cross-currency swaps hedging non-US dollar finance debt.
The swaps are with high investment-grade counterparties and therefore the settlement-day risk exposure is considered to be negligible.
Not shown in the table are the gross settlement amounts inflows for the receive leg of derivatives that are settled separately from the pay leg, which amount to $21,484 million at 31December2017 2016 $18,014 million to be received on the same day as the related cash outflows.

Derivative financial instruments In the normal course of business the group enters into derivative financial instruments derivatives to manage its normal business exposures in relation to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including management of the balance between floating rate and fixed rate debt, consistent with risk management policies and objectives.
An outline of the groups financial risks and the objectives and policies pursued in relation to those risks is set out in Note 27.
Additionally, the group has a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation that is undertaken in conjunction with these activities using a similar range of contracts.
For information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to the valuation of derivatives see Derivative financial instruments within Note 1.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments at 31December are set out below.
Exchange traded derivatives are valued using closing prices provided by the exchange as at the balance sheet date.
These derivatives are categorized within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Over-the-counter OTC financial swaps and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are generally valued using readily available information in the public markets and quotations provided by brokers and price index developers.
These quotes are corroborated with market data and are categorized within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
In certain less liquid markets, or for longer-term contracts, forward prices are not as readily available.
In these circumstances, OTC financial swaps and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are valued using internally developed methodologies that consider historical relationships between various commodities, and that result in managements best estimate of fair value.
These contracts are categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Financial OTC and physical commodity options are valued using industry standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic factors.
The degree to which these inputs are observable in the forward markets determines whether the option is categorized within level 2 or level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The contracts may be entered into for risk management purposes, to satisfy supply requirements or for entrepreneurial trading.
Certain contracts are classified as held for trading, regardless of their original business objective, and are recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.
Trading activities are undertaken by using a range of contract types in combination to create incremental gains by arbitraging prices between markets, locations and time periods.
The net of these exposures is monitored using market value-at-risk techniques as described in Note 27.
The following tables show further information on the fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments held for trading purposes.
Derivative assets held for trading have the following fair values and maturities.
The sale agreement contained an embedded derivative and had been designated at fair value through profit or loss and shown within other derivatives held for trading, within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The valuation was dependent on refinery throughput and future margins and final payment was received in 2017.

Derivative gains and losses The group enters into derivative contracts including futures, options, swaps and certain forward sales and forward purchases contracts, relating to both currency and commodity trading activities.
Gains or losses arise on contracts entered into for risk management purposes, optimization activity and entrepreneurial trading.
They also arise on certain contracts that are for normal procurement or sales activity for the group but that are required to be fair valued under accounting standards.
These gains and losses are included within sales and other operating revenues in the income statement.
Also included within this line item are gains and losses on inventory held for trading purposes.
The total amount relating to all these items excluding gains and losses on realized physical derivative contracts that have been reflected gross in the income statement within sales and purchases was a net gain of $1,983 million 2016 $1,435 million net gain and 2015 $5,508 million net gain.
This number does not include gains and losses on realized physical derivative contracts that have been reflected gross in the income statement within sales and purchases or the change in value of transportation and storage contracts which are not recognized under IFRS, but does include the associated financially settled contracts.
The net amounts for actual gains and losses relating to these derivative contracts and all related items therefore differ significantly from the amounts disclosed above.
The group also enters into derivative contracts including futures, options, swaps and certain forward sales and forward purchase contracts primarily relating to foreign currency risk management activities.
Gains and losses on these contracts are included within production and manufacturing expenses in the income statement.
The change in the unrealized value of these contracts was a net gain of $1,420 million 2016 $154 million net loss and 2015 $833 million net loss, however the gains and losses in each year are largely offset by opposing net foreign exchange differences on retranslation of the associated non-US dollar debt.
Cash flow hedges At 31December2017, the group held currency forwards used to hedge the foreign currency risk of highly probable forecast transactions.
Note 27 outlines the groups approach to foreign currency exchange risk management.
For cash flow hedges the group only claims hedge accounting for the spot value on the currency with any fair value attributable to forward points taken immediately to the income statement.
The amounts remaining in equity at 31December2017 in relation to these cash flow hedges consist of deferred losses of $21 million maturing in 2018, deferred gains of $8 million maturing in 2019 and deferred gains of $2 million maturing in 2020 and beyond.
Fair value hedges At 31December2017, the group held interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate risk and foreign currency risk on fixed rate debt issued by the group.
The gain on the hedging derivative instruments recognized in the income statement in 2017 was $364 million 2016 $316-million loss and 2015 $788-million loss offset by a loss on the fair value of the finance debt of $394 million 2016 $270-million gain and 2015 $833-million gain.
The interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps mature within one to twelve years, and have the same maturity terms as the debt that they are hedging.
They are used to convert sterling, euro, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Norwegian krone and Hong Kong dollar denominated fixed rate borrowings into floating rate debt.
Note 27 outlines the groups approach to interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk management.
