All shares rank equally with regard to residual assets.
Retained earnings The retained earnings reserve includes profit after tax for the year of 40,796,000 2016: 39,165,000 which includes dividends of 41,398,000 from subsidiaries in 2017 2016: 41,440,000.
Dividends Details of dividends paid and proposed are set out in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
Distributable reserves The distributable reserves of Fidessa Group plc approximate to the balance of the retained earnings reserve of 74,270,000 as at 31st December 2017.
Merger reserve The merger reserve arises from the acquisition of LatentZero Limited in 2007.
The merger reserve represents the excess of the fair value over the nominal value of shares issued to acquire at least 90% equity interest in an acquiree company.
A purchaser company acquiring at least 90% equity interest in an acquiree company under an arrangement which provides for the allotment of equity shares by the purchaser in return for the equity interest in the acquiree must apply Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.
When applicable, the section requires that the premium on the issue of equity shares by the purchaser company be disregarded.
Accordingly, a premium was not recorded on the shares issued but a merger reserve was recognised in the consolidated balance sheet.

Fidessa group plc 110 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Company financial statements continued 11 Financial risk management The use of financial instruments is managed under policies and procedures approved by the Board.
These are designed to reduce the financial risks being faced, which primarily relate to credit, interest and liquidity, which arise in the normal course of business.
Credit risk Financial instruments which potentially expose Fidessa to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
Cash equivalents are deposited only with major financial institutions that satisfy certain credit criteria as specified in Fidessas treasury policy.
The policy limits the maximum deposit with a counterparty.
Liquidity risk The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities.
Trade payables Accrued expenses 2017 2016 2017 2016 000 000 000 000 3 months or less 136 45 1,083 1,056 Carrying value 136 45 1,083 1,056 It is expected that the cash flows included in the maturity analysis will not arise materially earlier or at significantly different values.
Interest receivable and payable Fidessa holds net funds and hence its interest risks are associated with short-term cash deposits.
The overall objective with respect to these deposits is to maintain a balance between security of the funds, accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return.
In practice, this means that deposits are unlikely to be made with a maturity date greater than three months.
All deposits are at current market rates.
There are no borrowings due to the cash reserves and strong cash generation of the Fidessa group.
Capital management The Board monitors the total equity, distributable reserves and the cash and cash equivalents balance in considering its retained capital along with when and how a return of capital to shareholders is appropriate.
A strong capital base is maintained so as to provide employee, customer, market, investor and creditor confidence in its subsidiaries businesses and to ensure that it continues to operate as a going concern.
Fidessa has strong cash generation due to being consistently profitable and non-acquisitive in nature.
The annual dividend has a pay-out ratio of approximately 45% which provides a reasonable return to shareholders whilst also providing funds for potential acquisitions and replenishing the cash balance.
However, in the absence of acquisitions, Fidessa has a track record of returning the additional cash to shareholders in the form of special dividends.
Fidessa group plc 111 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 11 Financial risk management continued Fair values Unless otherwise disclosed, there is no significant difference between the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet and the fair values of the financial instruments.
For receivables and payables the directors consider that the carrying amount approximates their fair value.
