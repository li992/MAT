Investment and development property is measured at fair value in the Groups balance sheet and categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy see note 28 for definition as one or more significant inputs to the valuation are partly based on unobservable market data.

There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 for investment properties during the year.
The Group has only one class of investment and development property asset.
All the Groups significant investment and development property relates to prime shopping centres which are of a similar nature and share characteristics and risks.
Valuation process It is the Groups policy to engage independent external valuers to determine the market value of its investment and development property at both 30 June and 31 December.
The Group provides information to the valuers, including current lease and tenant data along with asset-specific business plans.
The valuers use this and other inputs including market transactions for similar properties to produce valuations see valuation methodology below.
These valuations and the assumptions they have made are then discussed and reviewed with the Groups asset management team and Directors.
The Group engages independent valuation experts to undertake the Groups property valuations.
A summary of the valuers and the value of property assets they have been engaged to value is presented below: 2017 2016 m m Cushman & Wakefield 4,609.6 4,564.4 CBRE 2,420.8 2,352.9 Knight Frank 1,964.0 2,243.9 Jones Lang LaSalle 197.7 Assets not valued externally held at cost 16.3 80.6 9,208.4 9,241.8 In addition to the above, investment properties in the Groups joint ventures were valued by CBRE, Cushman & Wakefield, Knight Frank and Jones Lang LaSalle.
Assets not valued externally held at cost relate to certain development land.
These amounts have been reviewed internally and it has been concluded that the cost is the appropriate carrying value and so no valuation adjustment is needed.
As the developments advance these will be valued by independent external valuers.
In respect of the intu Costa del Sol development site near Mlaga, Spain, as the General Plan of Torremolinos was approved in the year, with the remaining consents expected in the coming months, the Group obtained an independent external valuation at 31 December 2017 as cost is no longer an appropriate approximation of fair value.
The valuation is based on the assumption that planning approval is in place at the valuation date.
Valuation fees are a fixed amount agreed between the Group and the valuers in advance of the valuation and are not linked to the valuation output.
Valuation methodology The fair value of the Groups investment and development property at 31 December 2017 was determined by independent external valuers at that date other than certain development land as detailed above.
The valuations are in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Global Standards 2017 and were arrived at by reference to market transactions for similar properties and rent profiles.
Fair values for investment properties are calculated using the present value income approach.
The main assumptions underlying the valuations are in relation to rent profile and yields as discussed below.
The key driver of the property valuations is the terms of the leases in place at the valuation date.
These determine the majority of the cash flow profile of the property for a number of years and therefore form the base of the valuation.
The valuation assumes adjustments from these rental values in place at the valuation date to current market rent at the time of the next rent review where a typical lease allows only for upward adjustment and as leases expire and are replaced by new leases.
The current market level of rent is assessed based on evidence provided by the most recent relevant leasing transactions and negotiations.
This is based on evidence available at the date of valuation and does not assume future increases in market rent.
The nominal equivalent yield is applied as a discount rate to the rental cash flows which, after taking into account other input assumptions such as vacancies and costs, generates the market value of the property.
The nominal equivalent yield applied is assessed by reference to market transactions for similar properties and takes into account, amongst other things, any risks associated with the rent uplift assumptions.
Financial statemen Financial statement ts s 125 125 14 Investment and development property continued In respect of development valuations, deductions are then made for anticipated costs, including an allowance for developers profit and any other assumptions before arriving at a valuation.
Annual property income as disclosed in the following table reflects current annualised gross income.
The net initial yield is calculated as the current net income over the gross market value of the asset and is used as a sense check and to compare against market transactions for similar properties.
Full definitions of nominal equivalent yield, annual property income and net initial yield are provided in the glossary.
The valuation output, inputs and assumptions are reviewed to ensure that they are in line with those of market participants.
A significant change in the nominal equivalent yield of investment property in isolation would result in a significant change in the value of investment and development property.
A decrease in nominal equivalent yield of 50 basis points would result in an increase in the total market value of 1,055.5 million 31 December 2016: 1,062.9 million, while a 50 basis point increase would result in a decrease in the total market value of 806.5 million 31 December 2016: 834.9 million.
Additionally, development property is sensitive to income, cost and developers profit assumptions included in the valuations.
The valuation of investment and development property is a significant estimate as referenced in note 1.
Impairment is assessed by comparing the carrying value against the underlying assets and liabilities of the respective subsidiaries.
Details of related undertakings are provided in note 38.

The Group holds 50 per cent beneficial interests in the relevant freehold or leasehold of these properties.
Each joint arrangement is governed by a Trust Deed giving each party rights to income and obligations for expenses in respect of their beneficial interest in the property.
The management of the property is established under the Trust Deed as being undertaken by an entity jointly controlled by the beneficial owners of the property.
This entity does not have the right to a share of the income or expenditure from the property, other than the receipt of a management fee.
Therefore these interests are accounted for as joint operations.
The principal place of business of both joint operations is England.

Both companies are incorporated in India.
As required by IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, the equity method of accounting is applied in accounting for the Groups investments in Prozone and Empire.
The results for the year to 30 September have been used as 31 December information is not available in time for these financial statements.
Those results are adjusted to be in line with the Groups accounting policies and include the most recent property valuations, determined at 30 September 2017, by independent professionally qualified external valuers in line with the valuation methodology described in note 14.
The market price per share of Prozone at 31 December 2017 was INR72 31 December 2016: INR35, valuing the Groups interest at 41.1 million 31 December 2016: 20.3 million compared to the carrying value of 45.1 million 31 December 2016: 45.5 million.
As the share price of Prozone is lower than its carrying value, a review of the carrying value has been undertaken.
The net assets of Prozone principally comprise investment property which is held at fair value within the investment in associates line.
As with other Group investment property, it is subject to independent valuation to fair value and that valuation reflects the future cash flows expected to be generated from those assets.
As such the net asset carrying value recorded in the Groups financial statements is deemed to be a reasonable approximation of the value in use of the business and so no adjustment to that carrying value is considered necessary.

The Group substantially eliminates its interest rate exposure to floating rate debt through interest rate swaps as described in note 28.
The market value of investment property secured, either directly or indirectly, as collateral against borrowings at 31 December 2017 is 9,802.2 million including 1,001.0 million of investment property held within joint ventures 2016: 9,763.6 million including 731.9 million held within joint ventures.
In most circumstances the Group can realise up to 50 per cent without restriction providing the Group continues to manage the asset.
Realising an amount in excess of this would trigger a change of control and mandatory repayment of the facility.
The fair values of fixed rate borrowings and CMBS are assessed based on quoted market prices, and as such are categorised as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy see note 28 for definition.
The fair values of unlisted floating rate borrowings are equal to their carrying values.
During the year there were no breaches of these conditions see financial covenants in the other information section.

27 Operating leases The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment properties to tenants under operating leases.
In the UK the standard shopping centre lease is for a term of 10 to 15 years.
Standard lease provisions include service charge payments, recovery of other direct costs and review every five years to market rent.
Standard turnover based leases have a turnover percentage agreed with each lessee which is applied to a retail units annual sales and any excess between the resulting turnover rent and the minimum rent is receivable by the Group.

28 Financial risk management The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks arising from the Groups operations being principally market risk including interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The majority of the Groups financial risk management is carried out by the Groups treasury department.
The policies for managing each of these risks and their impact on the results for the year are summarised below.
Market risk a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises both cash flow and fair value risks.
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.
138 intu properties plc Annual report 2017 138 intu properties plc Annual report 2017 Notes to the financial statements continued 28 Financial risk management continued The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Bank debt is typically issued at floating rates linked to LIBOR.
Bond debt and other capital market debt is generally issued at fixed rates.
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of the Groups lenders, to eliminate substantially all exposure to interest rate fluctuations by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps in order to establish certainty over cash flows.
Such swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates.
As a consequence, the Group is exposed to market price risk in respect of the fair value of its fixed rate interest rate swaps, as discussed in the financial review on pages 48 to 53.
The table below shows the effects of interest rate swaps on the borrowings profile of the Group: Fixed Floating Fixed Floating 2017 2017 2016 2016 m m m m 1 Borrowings 2,998.2 1,607.0 3,086.5 1,380.2 Derivative impact nominal value of interest rate swaps 1,371.6 1,371.6 829.7 829.7 Net borrowings profile 4,369.8 235.4 3,916.2 550.5 Interest rate protection 94.9% 87.7% 1 Borrowings are stated at nominal value and exclude the Metrocentre compound financial instrument and finance leases.
At 31 December 2017 they include the 233.8 million 2016: 10.0 million drawn under the revolving credit facility RCF which incurs interest at a variable rate.
Excluding the revolving credit facility, interest rate protection is 100 per cent 2016: 87.9 per cent.
Group policy is to target interest rate protection within the range of 75 per cent to 100 per cent.
The weighted average rate for interest rate swaps currently effective is 1.71 per cent 2016: 2.35 per cent.
Unallocated interest rate swaps are excluded from the above calculation.
The nominal value of these swaps is 566.7 million 2016: 566.7 million.
Their fair value of 235.4 million 2016: 253.2 million is included as a liability in the balance sheet.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point increase in the level of interest rates would reduce the liability by 87.6 million 2016: 78.5 million in the fair value of derivatives.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point reduction in the level of interest rates would increase the liability by 87.6 million 2016: 78.5 million in the fair value of derivatives.
In practice, a parallel shift in the yield curve is highly unlikely.
However, the above sensitivity analysis is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may occur.
Where the fixed rate derivative financial instruments are matched by floating rate debt, the overall effect on Group cash flow of such a movement would be very small.
b Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a functional currency other than pounds sterling.
At 31 December 2017 the exposure is 10.6 per cent of net assets attributable to shareholders of the Group 31 December 2016: 7.2 per cent.
Once the Eurofund future interest in the share capital of the intu Costa del Sol development company concludes, we expect this to reduce to 9.7 per cent, below the Groups policy of a maximum of 10 per cent.
The table summarises the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk: 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m INRm INRm US$m US$m Net exposure 524.2 341.6 6,067.3 5,526.6 0.1 0.1 The following foreign exchange rates, at 31 December 2017, apply to the Groups foreign exchange risk: 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m INRm INRm US$m US$m Foreign exchange rate 1.1266 1.1715 86.0441 83.8636 1.3513 1.2357 The approximate impact of a 10 per cent appreciation in foreign exchange rates would be positive movement of 59.6 million 2016: 39.8 million to equity attributable to owners of the Group.
The approximate impact of a 10 per cent depreciation in foreign exchange rates would be a negative movement of 48.8 million 2016: 32.5 million to equity attributable to owners of the Group.
Financial statemen Financial statement ts s 139 139 28 Financial risk management continued As part of the strategy to comply with the Groups policy, the Group is able to borrow part of its RCF in euros, up to 100 million.
The RCF borrowings denominated in euros have been designated as a hedging instrument net investment hedge against the Groups net investment in Spain with the hedged risk being the changes in the euro pounds sterling spot rate that will result in changes in the value of the Groups net investments in Spain.
At 31 December 2017, 100 million 2016: nil was drawn in euros.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.
Liquidity analysis is conducted to ensure that sufficient headroom is available to meet the Groups operational requirements and committed investments.
The Group treasury policy aims to meet this objective by maintaining adequate cash, marketable securities and committed facilities.
Undrawn borrowing facilities are detailed in note 24.
The Groups policy is to seek to optimise its exposure to liquidity risk by balancing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk.
In effect the Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest acceptable cost.
Group policy is to maintain a weighted-average debt maturity of over five years.
At 31 December 2017, the maturity profile of Group debt showed an average maturity of seven years 2016: seven years.
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its borrowings and seeks to avoid bunching of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by arranging a selection of maturity dates.
Refinancing risk may be reduced by doing so prior to the contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk.
The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Groups financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to make payments of interest and to repay principal.
Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate, the rates used are those implied by the par yield curve for the relevant currency.
Where payment obligations are in foreign currencies, the spot exchange rate at the balance sheet date is used.

Credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables but also from the Groups holdings of assets with counterparties such as cash deposits and derivative financial instruments.
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed: tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously monitor and work with tenants, aiming wherever possible to identify and address risks prior to default.
Prospective tenants are assessed via a review process, including obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information, which is conducted internally.
As a result deposits or guarantees may be obtained.
The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2017 is 4.1 million 2016: 4.5 million.
It is Group policy to calculate any impairment of receivables specifically on each contract.
The ageing analysis of trade receivables is as follows: Group Group 2017 2016 m m Up to three months 23.1 20.8 Three to six months 3.3 1.3 Trade receivables 26.4 22.1 At 31 December 2017 trade receivables are shown net of provisions totalling 4.5 million 2016: 4.2 million.
The credit risk relating to cash deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by the Groups treasury department.
Relationships are maintained with a number of tier one institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group policy relating to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties between BBB and AAA.
Excessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.

Level 2: Valuation techniques are used, maximising the use of observable market data, either directly from market prices or derived from market prices.
Level 3: Where one or more significant inputs to valuation are unobservable.
Valuations at this level are more subjective and therefore more closely managed, including sensitivity analysis of inputs to valuation models.
Such testing has not indicated that any material difference would arise due to a change in input variables.
Transfers into and transfers out of the fair value hierarchy levels are recognised on the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 during the year.

Financial statemen Financial statement ts s 143 143 28 Financial risk management continued Capital structure The Group seeks to enhance shareholder value both by investing in the business so as to improve the return on investment and by managing the capital structure.
The capital of the Group consists of equity, debt and compound financial instruments.
The Group aims to access both debt and equity capital markets with maximum efficiency and flexibility.
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the debt to assets ratio and interest cover.
The Groups stated medium to long-term preference is for the debt to assets ratio to be within the 4050 per cent range and interest cover to be greater than 1.60x.
At 31 December 2017 the debt to assets ratio remains within the preferred range and the interest cover ratio continues to be above the preferred level.
As the Groups debt is sometimes secured on its interests in joint ventures, these ratios are monitored for the Group including share of joint ventures.
A reconciliation from the relevant amounts as presented to those including the Groups share of joint ventures is included in the other information section.

For those UK assets and liabilities benefitting from REIT exemption the relevant tax rate will be 0 per cent 2016: 0 per cent, and for other UK assets and liabilities the relevant rate will be 19 per cent if the temporary difference is expected to be realised before 1 April 2020 and 17 per cent if it is expected to be realised on or after 1 April 2020 2016: 20 per cent before 1 April 2017, 19 per cent before 1 April 2020 and 17 per cent thereafter.

At 31 December 2017, the Group had unrecognised deferred tax assets calculated at a tax rate of 17 per cent 2016: 17 per cent of 43.1 million 2016: 39.7 million for surplus UK revenue tax losses carried forward, 45.6 million 2016: 45.5 million for temporary differences on derivative financial instruments, 0.5 million 2016: 0.6 million for temporary differences on capital allowances and 5.8 million 2016: 3.4 million for capital losses.
On its sale in 2016, the deferred tax provision in respect of the Groups investment in Equity One was reduced to nil.
The revaluation of this investment was recognised in reserves and so the deferred tax movements related to it were also recognised in other comprehensive income.
With the provision reduced to nil, the deferred tax asset on derivative financial instruments and other temporary differences could no longer be recognised, and 18.9 million was therefore released to the income statement.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 12 Income Taxes, the deferred tax asset has not been recognised on the Groups balance sheet due to uncertainty over the level of profits that will be available in the non-REIT elements of the Group in future periods.
The Company recognises no deferred tax asset or liability 2016: nil.

146 intu properties plc Annual report 2017 146 intu properties plc Annual report 2017 Notes to the financial statements continued 33 Business combinations Accounting for acquisitions is a significant judgement as referenced in note 1.
The Group individually assesses each acquisition to determine if it should be accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
In respect of the below acquisitions, the Group has concluded the assets and liabilities acquired constitute a business.
They include the shopping centre asset itself along with the employees and processes that operate the centre on a day-to-day basis.
These inputs and processes in turn drive the operation of the centre and the related output for its beneficial owner.
As a result, this acquisition is to be accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3.
Acquisition during 2017 On 10 March 2017 the Group acquired 100 per cent interests in three entities, which together own and manage Madrid Xanad shopping centre, for total cash consideration of 517.3 million 453.9 million.
The cash flow statement outflow of 446.7 million reflects the 453.9 million less the unrestricted cash acquired of 7.2 million.
Acquisition related costs of 1.3 million were incurred and recognised in the income statement in exceptional administration expenses during the year.
The fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, at 100 per cent, are set out in the table below: Fair value m Assets Investment and development property 461.4 Cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash of 3.1 million 10.3 Trade and other receivables 0.1 Total assets 471.8 Liabilities Trade and other payables 21.3 Deferred tax 77.7 Total liabilities 99.0 Net assets 372.8 Fair value of consideration paid 453.9 Goodwill on acquisition of business 81.1 The fair value of the consideration is greater than the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired, resulting in goodwill of 81.1 million being recognised on acquisition.
The goodwill balance is primarily attributable to the recognition of a deferred tax balance which is required to be recorded in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes but has not been taken into account as part of the purchase price as it is not expected to be realised.
From the date of acquisition to the end of the year, the acquired subsidiaries and subsequent joint venture interest see note 34 contributed 13.2 million of revenue and 3.1 million of profit to the Group.
Had the entities been acquired on 1 January 2017, the Group would have reported revenue of 622.9 million and profit of 206.0 million for the year.
Financial statemen Financial statement ts s 147 147 33 Business combinations continued Acquisition during 2016 On 22 June 2016 the Group acquired the remaining 50 per cent of intu Merry Hill for total consideration of 409.7 million.
Following this transaction intu Merry Hill has ceased to be accounted for as a joint venture and is now a subsidiary of the Group.
The cash flow statement outflow of 405.5 million reflects the 409.7 million less the unrestricted cash acquired of 4.2 million.
Acquisition related costs of 1.0 million were incurred and recognised in the income statement in exceptional administration expenses during the year.
The fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, at 100 per cent, are set out in the table below: Fair value m Assets Investment and development property 889.3 Cash and cash equivalents 4.2 Trade and other receivables 3.9 Total assets 897.4 Liabilities Trade and other payables 8.1 Total liabilities 8.1 Net assets 889.3 Fair value of consideration paid 854.7 Gain on acquisition of business 34.6 The fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired exceeded the fair value of the consideration and as a result a gain of 34.6 million was recognised in the income statement on acquisition.
With a motivated seller, we were able as manager and owner of the other 50 per cent interest to conclude the transaction at a value lower than the independent market value.
The fair value of consideration paid included the cash consideration for the acquired 50 per cent interest of 409.7 million and the fair value of intus existing interest of 445.0 million.
There were no material differences between the carrying value and fair value of intus existing joint venture interest at acquisition.
From 22 June 2016, the date on which the acquired entities joined the Group as subsidiaries, they contributed 28.5 million to the revenue of the Group acquired 50 per cent contribution: 14.2 million and contributed 13.5 million of profit in the period.
Had the entities been acquired on 1 January 2016, the Group would have reported revenue of 650.0 million and profit of 170.9 million for the year.
148 intu properties plc Annual report 2017 148 intu properties plc Annual report 2017 Notes to the financial statements continued 34 Disposal of subsidiaries Disposals during 2017 On 31 July 2017 the Group sold 50 per cent of its interest in Xanad Retail and Leisure S. L. U. a wholly owned subsidiary, to TH Real Estate for total consideration of 131.7 million 117.9 million before expenses of 1.0 million.
Xanad Retail and Leisure S. L. U. owns, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Madrid Xanad.
Following this transaction Madrid Xanad has ceased to be accounted for as a subsidiary and is now a joint venture.
Therefore the assets and liabilities of Madrid Xanad are no longer recorded at 100 per cent in the Groups balance sheet but the remaining 50 per cent interest is included in investment in joint ventures at an initial value of 117.1 million.
As a result of this transaction the Group has recorded a loss on disposal of 1.0 million in the income statement.
The cash flow statement inflow of 104.1 million represents the net consideration received of 116.9 million net of unrestricted cash in the business of 12.8 million.
Assessing control over joint arrangements is a significant judgement as referenced in note 1.
Based on the terms set out in the partnership agreement, the Group has classified its retained 50 per cent interest as a joint venture as key decisions require the consent of both partners.
The assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries disposed of, at 100 per cent, are set out below: m Assets Investment and development property 472.3 Goodwill 81.1 Cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash of 3.2 million 16.0 Trade and other receivables 7.3 Total assets 576.7 Liabilities Trade and other payables 28.4 Deferred tax 79.6 Derivative financial instruments 1.6 Borrowings 231.4 Total liabilities 341.0 Net assets 235.7 Net assets at 50 per cent 117.9 Fair value of consideration received 116.9 Loss on disposal of subsidiaries 1.0 Financial statemen Financial statement ts s 149 149 34 Disposal of subsidiaries continued Disposals during 2016 On 15 December 2016 the Group sold 100 per cent of its interest in Intu Bromley Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary, to Alaska Permanent Fund for initial consideration of 81.5 million before expenses of 1.3 million.
Intu Bromley Limited holds a 64 per cent interest in intu Bromley.
It was anticipated the Group would receive a cash payment of 0.8 million following final agreement of the completion balance sheet.
As a result of this transaction the Group recorded a loss on disposal of 0.3 million in the income statement.
The cash flow statement inflow of 80.5 million reflects the net consideration of 81.0 million net of cash in the business of 0.5 million.
The assets and liabilities of the subsidiary disposed of, at 100 per cent, are set out below: m Assets Investment and development property 179.4 Cash and cash equivalents 0.5 Trade and other receivables 12.7 Total assets 192.6 Liabilities Trade and other payables 7.3 Borrowings 104.0 Total liabilities 111.3 Net assets 81.3 Fair value of consideration received 81.0 Loss on disposal of subsidiaries 0.3 35 Assets classified as held for sale In November the Group announced the formation of a joint venture with LaSalle Investment Management acting on behalf of Greater Manchester Pension Fund and West Yorkshire Pension Fund for them to take ownership of 50 per cent of intu Chapelfield for initial net proceeds of 148.0 million.
This transaction completed on 31 January 2018 following the receipt of EU merger approval.
As a result, at 31 December 2017 in accordance with IFRS the Group has classified 100 per cent of intu Chapelfield which is part of the UK operating segment and all its related assets and liabilities as held for sale.
Assessing non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale is a significant judgement as referenced in note 1.
The assets and liabilities below are presented at their carrying amount.
There are no material differences between their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
