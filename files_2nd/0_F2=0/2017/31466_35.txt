146 Notes to the Company Balance Sheet 1.
Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting Melrose Industries PLC the Company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The address of the registered office is given on the back cover.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 57.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 FRS 102 issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
The functional currency of Melrose Industries PLC is considered to be pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.
Melrose Industries PLC meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 102 and has therefore taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available to it in respect of its separate financial statements.
Melrose Industries PLC is consolidated in its Group financial statements.
Exemptions have been taken in these separate Company financial statements in relation to share-based payments, presentation of a cash flow statement, the remuneration of key management personnel and financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies are consistent with the prior period and are summarised below.
Going concern The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Further detail is contained in the Directors statement of going concern on page 40 of the Finance Directors review.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost less impairment.
For investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is measured by reference to the nominal value of the shares issued plus fair value of other consideration.
Impairment of assets Assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
If there is objective evidence of impairment, an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss as described below.
Non-financial assets An asset is impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after initial recognition, the estimated recoverable value of the asset has been reduced.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Where indicators exist for a decrease in impairment loss, the prior impairment loss is tested to determine reversal.
An impairment loss is reversed on an individual impaired asset to the extent that the revised recoverable value does not lead to a revised carrying amount higher than the carrying value had no impairment been recognised.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Financial assets and liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at transaction price including transaction costs.
Financial assets and liabilities are only offset in the Balance Sheet when, and only when there exists a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and the Company intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Financial assets are derecognised when and only when a the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or are settled, b the Company transfers to another party substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, or c the Company, despite having retained some, but not all, significant risks and rewards of ownership, has transferred control of the asset to another party.
Financial liabilities are derecognised only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Melrose Industries PLC Annual Report 2017 Financials 147 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Share-based payments The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The required disclosures are included in the Group consolidated financial statements.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the Directors best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Where equity-settled share-based payments are made available to employees of the Companys subsidiaries, these are treated as increases in equity over the vesting period of the award with a corresponding increase in the Companys investment in subsidiaries.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the Balance Sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty There were no critical accounting judgements that would have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the parent Company financial statements or key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Balance Sheet date that would have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Loss for the year As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own Profit and Loss Account for the year.
Melrose Industries PLC reported a loss for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 of 21.3 million 2016: profit of 224.0 million.
