The Dividend Shares are also held in the trust from the date of acquisition for a minimum period of three years.
During the three-year holding periods, the SIP participant may not remove the Free Shares or the Dividend Shares from the trust, but may direct the trust to exercise its voting rights in accordance with his or her instructions.
In addition to the Free Shares and Dividend Shares, participants in the SIP are also eligible to purchase additional ordinary shares from their pre-tax salary up to an annual statutory limit, referred to as Partnership Shares.
The SIP also provides that BAT has the right to offer additional ordinary shares to a participant at no cost for each Partnership Share the participant purchases, at a ratio of two such ordinary shares for each Partnership Share purchased, referred to as Matching Shares.
BAT does not currently provide any Matching Shares.
