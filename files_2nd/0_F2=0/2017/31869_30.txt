Deferred taxation No provision for deferred taxation has been made in the current or prior accounting year.
The Company has not provided for deferred tax on capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation and disposal of investments as it is exempt from tax on these items because of its investment trust status.

These expenses will only be utilised, to any material extent, if changes are made either to the tax treatment of the capital gains made by investment trusts or to the Companys investment profile which require them to be used.
