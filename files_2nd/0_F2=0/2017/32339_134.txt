Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 14. Business combinations continued increase in provisions related to unfavourable contracts in the amount of 20m.
The net impact of the adjustment including the deferred tax effect resulted in an increase of 29m in goodwill with no material impact on the income statement for the period ended 31 March 2016.
In the prior year, we provisionally paid 3,464m of cash and issued 1,595m of new shares valued at 7,507m using the opening share price of 470.7p per share on 29 January 2016, being the date of acquisition of EE and the date when the shares were admitted to trading.
The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
For the acquisition of EE this amounted to 6,430m.
The fair values ascribed and the resulting goodwill were recognised on a provisional basis which the group had one year from the acquisition date to re-measure.
As discussed above we completed this in 2016 17 resulting in an increase of 29m in goodwill.

a We have revised prior year information to be on a consistent basis.
Trade and other receivables Weve made various judgements in accounting for trade and other receivables.
These include long-term contracts and bad debt provisions.
Long-term customer contracts Long-term customer contracts can extend over a number of financial years.
During the contractual period recognition of costs and profits may be impacted by judgements and estimates made.
What critical judgements have we made?
Weve exercised judgement in assessing when the transition or transformation phase of a contract ends.
This influences the timing of recognition of revenue and costs which are deferred until the transition or transformation phase ends unless these elements of a contract have standalone value.
Judgements are also required in assessing the lifetime profitability of a contract when determining whether we have an onerous contract liability.
Where we have an onerous contract liability this would be classified in provisions.
