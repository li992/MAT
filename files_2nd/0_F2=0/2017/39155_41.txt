These costs mainly consist of restructuring, advisory and IT related costs.
Partial recovery of trade receivable in Europe provided for in prior year A credit of 3.1m has been recognised relating to the partial recovery of a trade receivable in Europe, which was fully provided forin the prior year.
This position has now been finalised.
Foreign currency devaluation in Nigeria During the first half of the year, transactional foreign exchange losses were recognised in Nigeria relating to long outstanding brought forward trade payables denominated in US Dollars that have been settled at higher exchange rates than originally recognised due to the introduction of the flexible exchange rate regime on 20 June 2016 which has resulted in a devaluation of the Naira of greater than 50%.
The Directors have deemed this charge to be exceptional due to the nature and magnitude of this effective currency devaluation.
Deferred tax benefit of reduction in UK corporation tax rate principally relating to acquired brands The UK corporation tax rate reduces to 17% from 1 April 2020.
As a result of this change, the deferred tax balances relating to UKassets and liabilities have been reduced to take account of the substantively enacted rate change.
The largest single effect of the rate change was in relation to the deferred tax liabilities recognised when the Sanctuary, St. Tropez and Charles Worthington brands were acquired.

Finalisation of a tax position relating to a prior period disposal During the year to 31 May 2016, the Group recognised a tax credit of 3.3m following the finalisation of a position relating to a disposal made in a prior period.
