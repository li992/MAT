When the Company pays a dividend to shareholders, there may be income tax consequences.
The impact will depend upon the individual circumstances of the shareholder.
Earnings per Ordinary share The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: 2017 2016 000 000 Earnings Earnings for basic and diluted earnings per share 000 83,080 72,096 Number of shares number number Weighted average number of shares used for basic earnings per share 000 313,491 311,534 Dilutive effect of share plans 000 1,287 802 Diluted weighted average number of shares used for diluted earnings per share 000 314,778 312,336 pence pence Basic earnings per share 26.5 23.1 Diluted earnings per share 26.4 23.1 The above results relate to continuing operations.
Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding Ordinary shares purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust and held in the reserve.
Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary shares.
This calculation determines the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average market price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated in the basic earnings per share is then adjusted to reflect the number of shares deemed to be issued for nil consideration as a result of the potential exercise of existing share options.
The remaining share options that are currently not dilutive and hence excluded from the dilutive earnings per share calculation remain potentially dilutive until they are either exercised or they lapse.

A summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below: 2017 2016 000 000 UK 1,274 1,274 USA 214 214 Singapore 51 51 1,539 1,539 In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are calculated by preparing cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budget, management projections for five years, followed by an assumed growth rate of 0%, which does not exceed the longterm average growth rate of the relevant markets and reflects long-term wage inflation fee growth.
Management applied a discount rate of 8%, representing the weighted average cost of capital for the Group, to the estimated future cash flows to calculate the terminal value of those cash flows.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense.
Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of goodwill allocated to any CGU to materially exceed its recoverable amount.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
It is the opinion of the Directors that at 31 December 2017 there was no impairment of goodwill.

Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax assets liabilities recognised by the Group, and the movements thereon, during the current and prior reporting periods.
Share-based payments Tax losses Other Total 000 000 000 000 At 1 January 2017 1,416 5,061 9,640 16,117 Recognised in equity for the year 540 540 Recognised in profit or loss for the year 2,298 1,824 128 602 Exchange differences 196 566 370 At 31 December 2017 1,828 2,567 9,872 14,267 At 1 January 2016 2,570 4,990 5,328 12,888 Recognised in equity for the year 392 392 Recognised in profit or loss for the year 762 949 4,124 2,413 Exchange differences 1,020 188 1,208 At 31 December 2016 1,416 5,061 9,640 16,117 Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for balance sheet purposes: 2017 2016 000 000 Deferred tax assets 14,637 16,547 Deferred tax liabilities 370 430 14,267 16,117 No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of 108.3m 2016: 110.3m of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is not probable that such differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
The net reduction of the deferred tax asset balance by 1.9m in the year includes 0.3m for the effects of recognition and derecognition of tax losses across a number of territories plus the utilisation of losses in other territories.
The movement in Other is comprised of temporary differences between the recognition of income and expenditure for accounting and tax purposes.
This can vary from year to year and in 2017 resulted in an increase in the deferred tax asset of 0.2m 2016: 4.3m increase.
The amount recognised in profit or loss for the year of 2.3m in relation to losses is a combination of the elements disclosed in Note 6 including the charge for tax losses recognised of 2.6m.
In December 2017 the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted.
This Act made significant changes to US tax rules, the most relevant to the Group being the reduction in the federal rate of tax to 21%, from 35%.
Other measures included a reduction in the amount of interest that can be deducted for tax purposes and the introduction of other measures designed to combat base erosion.
The impact to the financial statements is a write down of deferred tax assets representing the future value for accumulated losses and other deductions of 1.1m.
The realisation of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon generating future taxable profits in the overseas territories in which the deferred tax has arisen.
There are carried forward losses of 16.7m 2016: 14.0m arising in overseas territories for which no deferred tax is recognised given the future utilisation of the tax losses is uncertain: there were no other tax attributes recognised in those territories.
These tax losses and other tax attributes remain available to offset future taxable profits in the respective territories where they have arisen.
The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of any losses that we would expect to be impacted by expiry.
Called-up share capital 2017 2016 Number of Number of 000 shares 000 shares Allotted, called-up and fully paid Ordinary shares of 1p each At 1 January 3,259 325,975,455 3,258 325,919,705 Shares issued 9 833,246 1 55,750 At 31 December 3,268 326,808,701 3,259 325,975,455 Shares issued in the year related to the Executive Share Option Scheme.
Share option plans The Group has share option awards currently outstanding under an Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and a Share Option Scheme SOS.
These plans are described below.
At 31 December 2017 the following options had been granted and remained outstanding in respect of the Companys Ordinary shares of 1p under both the Michael Page Executive Share Option Scheme and the Share Option Scheme.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
8,605,964 options were exercisable at the end of 2017 at a weighted average exercise price of 4.39 2016: 4.05.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 4.86.
Note 1 Executive Share Option Scheme Using the ESOS, awards of share options can be made to key management personnel and senior employees to receive shares in the Company.
No awards have been made under the ESOS since 2010 and this award has fully vested.
For grants under the ESOS, the performance condition is tested on the third anniversary and no retesting will occur thereafter.
These options were granted subject to a performance condition requiring that an option may only be exercised, in normal circumstances, if there has been an increase in base earnings per share of at least 3% per annum above the growth in the UK Retail Price Index.
The respective base earnings per share for each grant are shown in the table above.
115 | Financial Statements CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Note 2 Share Option Scheme Executive Directors of the Company are not eligible to participate in this plan.
Any exercises of awards made under this plan are settled by shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust.
This share option scheme was created in 2009 to provide an effective plan under which to grant awards from 2009 onwards.
It was the Boards view that grants made under the existing ESOS, which would have required an increase over the 2008 base earnings per share of at least 3% per annum above the growth in the UK Retail Price Index by 2011, would not be achievable due to the impact of the global downturn on the Groups EPS and thus would not provide the required retention incentive.
The 2009 grant made under the SOS is subject to a performance condition that was tested, initially, three years after the date of grant and since then has been and will be tested annually until either the entire grant vests, or ten years from the date of grant of the award have elapsed, in which case any awards outstanding under the grant will lapse.
The performance condition is directly linked to the Groups Operating Profit.
If Operating Profit is 30m then 30% of the award would vest.
For every 1m of Operating Profit over 30m, a further 1% would vest.
100% of the award would vest if Operating Profit was 100m.
As the Groups 2011 Operating Profit was 86.0m, 86% of this award vested on 10 March 2012, with a further 4% vesting on 10 March 2016 following the 2015 result.
Following 2016s Operating Profit of 101.0m, the final portion of the award vested on 10 March 2017.
Further grants under the SOS have been made in each year from 2011.
The performance conditions for these grants are also directly linked to the Groups Operating Profit.
For the 2011 grant, if Operating Profit is in excess of 100m, 1% of the award will vest for every additional 1m of Operating Profit achieved, up to a maximum of 100% at Operating Profit of 200m or more.
Following 2017s operating profit, 18% of this award will vest.
For grants between 2012 and 2015, if Operating Profit is in excess of 50m, a proportion of the award equivalent to the amount of Operating Profit achieved will vest up to a maximum of 100% if the Operating Profit is 100m or more.
As Operating Profit of 118.3m was achieved this year, the performance criteria have been fully achieved and these awards will vest in full when their three year time periods have elapsed.
For the 2016 grant, if Operating Profit is in excess of 75m, 2% of the award will vest for every additional 1m of Operating Profit achieved, up to a maximum of 100% at Operating Profit of 125m or more.
For the 2017 grant, if Operating Profit is in excess of 50m, 1% of the award will vest for every additional 1m of Operating Profit achieved, up to a maximum of 100% at Operating Profit of 125m or more.
Other share-based payment plans The Company also operates a Management Incentive Plan for the Executive Directors and senior employees and a Long-Term Incentive Plan for the Senior Executives.
Details of these plans are disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report and are settled by cash or the physical delivery of shares, currently satisfied by shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust, to the extent that service and performance conditions are met.
Movements on these plans are shown below: LTIP MIP As at 1 January 2017 1,011,288 2,058,710 Granted 417,049 822,147 Lapsed 119,009 - Exercised 178,512 697,601 As at 31 December 2017 1,130,816 2,183,256 Share option valuation and measurement In 2017, options were granted on 16 March with the estimated fair value of the options granted on that day of 1.11.
In 2016, options were granted on 18 March with the estimated fair value of the options granted on that day of 0.68.
Share options are granted under service and non-market performance conditions.
These conditions are not taken into account in the fair value measurement at grant date.
There are no market conditions associated with the share option grants.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2017 have an exercise price in the range of 187.5p to 534.0p and a weighted average contractual life of 5.6 years.
The fair values of options and other share awards granted during the year were calculated using the BlackScholes option pricing model.
The inputs into the model were as follows: Share Option Plans Long-Term Incentive Plan Management Incentive Plan 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 Share price 4.35 4.06 4.35 4.04 4.35 4.04 Average exercise price 4.35 4.06 Nil Nil Nil Nil Weighted average fair value 1.11 0.68 3.99 3.72 4.35 3.72-4.04 Expected volatility 38.19% 25.7% 38.19% 25.7% 38.19% 25.7% Expected life 5 years 5 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 0.72% 0.89% 0.72% 0.89% 0.72% 0.89% Risk free rate Expected dividend yield 2.87% 2.75% Nil Nil 2.87% 2.75% Financial Statements | 116 Expected volatility was determined by reference to historical volatility of the Companys share price in the last 12 months.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Expectations of early exercise are incorporated into the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The Group recognised total expenses of 7.7m, including social security, 2016: 4.2m related to share-based payment transactions during the year.
Reserves Share premium The share premium account has been established to represent the excess of proceeds over the nominal value for all share issues, including the excess of the exercise share price over the nominal value of the shares on the exercise of share options.
Capital redemption reserve The capital redemption reserve relates to the cancellation of the Companys own shares.

The main Eurozone subsidiaries and the UK-based Group Treasury subsidiary participated in this cash pool.
It is the Groups intention to extend the scope of the participation to other Group companies going forward.
The structure facilitates interest and balance compensation of cash and bank overdrafts.
Financial risk management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: i credit risk ii liquidity risk iii market risk This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
117 | Financial Statements CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from clients.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.
Trade and other receivables Total trade receivables net of allowances held by the Group at 31 December 2017 amounted to 245.4m 2016: 205.1m.
An initial credit period is made available on invoices.
No interest is charged on trade receivables from the date of the invoice during this credit period.
Thereafter, interest is charged on the outstanding balance.
Trade receivables are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the provision of our services, determined by reference to past default experience.
Included in the Groups trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 116.7m 2016: 92.9m that are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The days sales of these receivables at the year end is 53 days in excess of the initial credit period 2016: 50 days.
The demographics of the Groups client base, including the country in which clients operate, also has an influence on credit risk.
Less than 3% of the Groups revenue is attributable to sales transactions with a single client.
The geographic diversification of the Groups revenue also reduces the concentration of credit risk.
The majority of the Groups clients have been transacting with the Group for several years, with losses rarely occurring.
In monitoring client credit risk, clients are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including geographic location, industry, ageing profile, maturity and existence of previous financial difficulties.
Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts: 2017 2016 000 000 Balance at beginning of the year 5,070 5,635 Impairment losses recognised on receivables 18,426 12,264 Amounts written off as uncollectable 669 1,259 Amounts recovered during the year 7,566 8,026 Impairment losses reversed 7,100 3,544 Balance at end of the year 8,161 5,070 Most of the allowance for doubtful debts represents a provision for debts which the Group estimate may be irrecoverable, as well as individually impaired trade receivables with a balance of 3.5m 2016: 2.4m which have been placed in litigation.
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the expected liquidation proceeds.
Financial Statements | 118 Exposure to credit risk The maximum exposure to credit risk for net trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: Carrying amount 2017 2016 000 000 EMEA 148,292 122,858 United Kingdom 45,248 37,028 Asia Pacific 30,460 27,290 Americas 21,394 17,899 245,394 205,075 The maximum exposure to credit risk for net accrued income at the reporting date by geographic region was: Carrying amount 2017 2016 000 000 EMEA 956 1,917 United Kingdom 8,638 15,617 Asia Pacific 15,749 12,620 Americas 6,595 7,469 31,938 37,623 The entire accrued income balance is not past due.
The fair values of trade and other receivables are not materially different to those disclosed above and in note 13.
There is no material effect on pre-tax profit if the instruments are accounted for at fair value or amortised cost.
ii Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework that aims to ensure that the Group has sufficient cash or credit facilities at all times to meet all current and forecast liabilities as they fall due.
It is the Directors intention to continue to finance the activities and development of the Group from retained earnings.
Cash surpluses were invested in short-term deposits, with any working capital requirements being provided from Group cash resources, Group facilities, or by local overdraft facilities.
The Group also operates a multi-currency notional cash pool to facilitate interest and balance compensation of cash and bank overdrafts.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities: Less than More than 1 month 1-3 months 3-12 months 12 months 2017 000 000 000 000 Trade payables 5,178 216 846 Accruals and other payables 92,918 17,001 15,860 Less than More than 1 month 1-3 months 3-12 months 12 months 2016 000 000 000 000 Trade payables 5,330 787 971 427 Accruals and other payables 58,796 16,236 44,459 119 | Financial Statements CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Capital is equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders through share repurchases with subsequent cancellation, or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016. iii Market risk and sensitivity analysis The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but these risks are not deemed to be material.
However, a sensitivity analysis showing hypothetical fluctuations in Pounds Sterling against the Groups main exposure currencies is shown on the next page.
There has been no material change in the Groups exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.
Interest rate risk management Borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group does not consider this risk as significant.
The benchmark rates for determining floating rate liabilities are based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents.
The Groups only interest bearing assets and liabilities at 31 December 2017 relate to cash and bank overdrafts.
The average interest rate payable on bank overdrafts was 1.52% 2016: 2.50%.
Currency rate risk The Group publishes its results in Pounds Sterling and conducts its business in many foreign currencies.
As a result, the Group is subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of some of its subsidiaries and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries.
The main functional currencies of the Group are Sterling, Euro, Chinese Renminbi, Swiss Franc, Singapore Dollar and Australian Dollar.
The Group does not have material transactional currency exposures.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency translation differences in accounting for its overseas operations.
The Group policy is not to hedge translation exposure.
The Group has entered into hedges to cover its investments in foreign entities in the US and Canada designating them as net investment hedges.
The portion of gains or losses on the hedging instruments determined to be an effective hedge is transferred to other comprehensive income.
The pre-tax profit on effective hedging instruments deferred within other comprehensive income as at 31 December 2017 is 1.3m 2016: 2.5m loss.
In certain cases, where the Company gives or receives short-term loans to and from other Group companies with different reporting currencies, it may use foreign exchange rate derivatives to manage the currency exposure that arises on these loans.
It is the Groups policy not to seek to designate these derivatives as hedges.
All derivative financial instruments not in a hedge relationship are classified as derivatives at fair value through the income statement.
The Group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
Information on the fair value of derivative financial instruments held at the balance sheet date is shown in the table below.
Fair values are not adjusted for credit risk, as required by IFRS 13, because credit impact is not material given the low fair value levels.
All derivative instruments are classified as level 2 instruments.
Derivative financial instruments Derivatives at fair value 2017 2016 m m Derivative assets 0.7 1.5 Derivative liabilities 0.9 1.0 Net derivative liabilities assets 0.2 0.5 Sensitivity analysis currency risk A 10% strengthening of Sterling against the following currencies at 31 December 2017 would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown over the page.
This analysis is applied currency by currency in isolation, i. e. ignoring the impact of currency correlation, and assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2016.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected, due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table over the page, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
