Launched in 2001, partypoker grew to become the biggest online poker room in the world and maybe the best known overall online gaming brand.
However, when the US enacted new legislation in 2006, effectively making online gaming unlawful, partypoker amongst other responsible operators, withdrew from the market.
The loss of US revenues was a massive blow to the business and this was exacerbated by the fact that some private operators remained in the US market and used this liquidity to grow market share in the rest of the world.
By the time of its acquisition by GVC, partypoker was a shadow of its former self and was on the brink of terminal decline.
The decision was taken to restructure all aspects of the partypoker business and customer proposition.
Driven by a new management team, the philosophy is very much to bring poker back to the real poker players.
A core component of the brand reinvigoration is the creation of a live global tour, partypoker LIVE.
In 2017, the live tour had guaranteed prize pools of $68m, with over 26,000 unique players participating.
Meanwhile, the online customer proposition has seen significant change including updates to the lobby, tables and mobile apps.
There is more to come, with customer service a major focus.
The partypoker brand has received significant investment and the initial response from players is positive, revenues rose 42% in 2017, whilst first time depositors grew 25%.
Our ambitions with partypoker are high and 2018 will see continued investment, with further product enhancements and over $150m live tournament guarantees.
