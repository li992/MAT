,   Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured using inputs in one of the following three categories: Level 1 measurements are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.
Valuation of these items does not entail a significant amount of judgment.
Level 2 measurements are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or market data other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 measurements are based on unobservable data that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value.
Accordingly, certain estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange.
The fair values of our Level 2 notes receivables were based on estimated future cash flows discounted at appropriate market interest rates.
The fair values of our Level 3 notes receivable were estimated using risk-adjusted discount rates.
b The debt amounts above do not include the impact of interest rate swaps or debt issuance costs.
The fair values of our publicly-traded notes were based on their unadjusted quoted market prices in markets that are not sufficiently active to be Level 1 and, accordingly, are considered Level 2.
The fair values of our other debt were estimated based on current market interest rates being applied to this debt.
