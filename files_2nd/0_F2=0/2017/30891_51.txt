See also Note 10, Note 13 and Note 19 for further information on impairments by asset category.
Upstream Impairment losses and reversals related primarily to producing and midstream assets.
The 2017 impairment losses of $1,138 million related to a number of different assets, with the most significant charges arising in Lower 48 and the North Sea.
Impairment losses within Upstream arose primarily as a result of changes in reserves estimates and the decision to dispose of certain assets, including the Forties Pipeline System business.
The 2017 impairment reversals of $176 million related to a number of different assets, with the most significant reversals arising in the North Sea.
The 2016 impairment losses of $1,022 million related to a number of different assets, with the most significant charges arising in the North Sea.
Impairment losses within Upstream arose primarily as a result of revised cost estimates and decisions to dispose of certain assets.
The 2016 impairment reversals of $3,025 million primarily related to the North Sea and Angola.
The largest impairment reversals related to the Andrew area cash-generating unit CGU in the North Sea and the PSVM and Greater Plutonio CGUs in Angola but none of these were individually significant.
In addition an impairment reversal was recorded in relation to the Block KG D6 CGU in India: and exploration costs were also written back during the period see Note 6.
The impairment reversals arose following a reduction in the discount rate applied, changes to future price assumptions, and also increased confidence in the progress of the KG D6 projects in India.
The 2015 impairment losses of $2,484 million included $761 million in Angola, of which $371 million related to the Greater Plutonio CGU.
Impairment losses also included $830 million in relation to CGUs in the North Sea, of which $328 million related to the Andrew area CGU.
The impairment losses primarily arose as a result of a lower price environment in the near term, and were also affected to a lesser extent by certain technical reserves revisions and increases in decommissioning cost estimates.
The 2015 impairment reversals of $1,080 million included $945 million in the North Sea business, of which $473 million related to the Eastern Trough Area Project ETAP CGU.
The impairment reversals mainly arose as a result of decreases in cost estimates and a reduction in the discount rate applied, offsetting the impact of lower prices in the near term.
Downstream Impairment losses totalling $69 million, $84 million, and $265 million were recognized in 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively.
The amount for 2015 was principally in relation to certain manufacturing assets in our petrochemicals business and certain US midstream assets, where the expected disposal proceeds were lower than the book values.
