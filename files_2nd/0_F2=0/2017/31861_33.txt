The UK Government announced in July 2015 that the corporation tax rate is set to be cut to 19% in 2017 and 18% in 2020.
In March 2016 a further cut to 17% in 2020 was announced.
These reductions in the standard rate of corporation tax were substantively enacted on 15th September 2016 and became effective from 1st January 2017.
The deferred tax asset has arisen due to the cumulative excess of deductible expenses over taxable income.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future and therefore no asset has been recognised in the financial statements.
Given the Companys status as an investment trust company and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
