During the year, we also reviewed the carrying value of the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet of our Italian business including reassessing the recoverability of trade and other receivables and reconsidering other exposures, principally sales taxes.
We took into account any changes in facts or circumstances since 31 March 2016 in determining whether there was a need to change an estimate and whether additional exposures had arisen in the current year.
This exercise required a level of judgement, in many cases taking a more cautious view based on our current understanding of circumstances in the business.
We have set out in note 17 details of estimates we make in accounting for the recoverability of trade and other receivables.
We have made estimates for the potential other exposures, principally sales taxes, which represent the groups best estimate of the amount that may be required to settle the obligation and are included within other payables as set out in note 18.
The total impact of 245m is presented within specific items given the size and one-off nature.
We have also incurred fees in relation to the investigation of 15m which have been included in specific items.
Regulatory matters Weve recognised 479m 2015 16: nil, 2014 15: revenue of 53m of net costs in relation to regulatory matters.
These are made up of the following: Deemed Consent A charge of 342m was recognised 2015 16: nil, 2014 15: nil in relation to Ofcoms March 2017 findings of its investigation into our historical practices on Deemed Consent by Openreach.
A fine of 42m has been imposed and weve also agreed to compensate Communication Providers.
The precise amount of these compensation payments will be determined from discussion with the affected parties and is currently estimated at 300m.
188 BT Group plc Annual Report 2017 Annual Report 2017 BT Group plc 189 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 8.
Specific items continued Ladder pricing agreements In 2016 17 we recognised revenue and costs of 8m 2015 16: 203m and in 2014 15: 128m revenue being the prior year impacts of ladder pricing agreements with the other UK mobile operators.
This was following a Supreme Court judgment in July 2014 which overturned a Court of Appeal judgment made in July 2012.
The Court of Appeals ruling had disallowed our ladder pricing policy relating to 0800, 0845 and 0870 calls from mobile phones terminating on our network.
Other regulatory matters Weve also re-assessed our regulatory risk provision in light of recent regulatory decisions by Ofcom and by the Competition Appeal Tribunal CAT.
As a result weve increased our net provision by 137m 2015 16: nil for the year.
In 2014 15 the CAT handed down judgment on various appeals brought against a December 2012 Ofcom determination on the pricing of certain Ethernet products.
Ofcom had determined that BT had overcharged for certain services between 1 April 2006 and 31 March 2011 and required BT to make repayments.
The CAT judged that BT should also pay interest on these amounts.
Together with a review of our regulatory risk position in relation to other historical matters, we recognised a specific item charge of 75m in 2014 15.
EE fair value adjustment In 2015 16 we recognised a fair value adjustment on the acquisition of EE which reduced the amount of deferred income in relation to its prepaid subscriber base by 70m with no cash impact.
The step down reflects the difference between the amount recorded by EE on acquisition and the fair value calculated based on the incremental cost that a market participant would incur to take on the liability plus a reasonable profit margin.
This amount was released as a reduction to revenue in the period between acquisition and 31 March 2016, reflecting the period over which EE provided the related service.
EE acquisition and integration costs We incurred 215m 2015 16: 116m, 2014 15: 19m of acquisition and integration related costs for EE.
This includes a 62m 2015 16: nil, 2014 15: nil amortisation charge relating to the write-off of IT assets as we integrate the EE and BT IT infrastructure.
Integration costs include EE related restructuring and leaver costs in year.
Out of period irrecoverable VAT We recognised a 30m charge 2015 16: nil, 2014 15: nil for out of period irrecoverable VAT and a further 1m 2015 16: nil, 2014 15: nil related interest charge.
Profit on disposal of businesses During the year we disposed of non-core businesses with a gain on disposal of 16m 2015 16: nil, 2014 15: 6m.
Property rationalisation costs In 2015 16 we recognised a 29m charge 2014 15: 45m relating to the rationalisation of the groups property portfolio.
Restructuring charges There were no restructuring charges for the current year or in 2015 16.
The components of the restructuring charges recognised in 2014 15 were: people and property charges of 294m, principally comprising leaver costs of 237m, and property exit costs and networks, products and procurement channels rationalisation charges of 21m.
Profit on disposal of property In 2014 15 we disposed of a surplus building in London, Keybridge House, for a consideration of 93m resulting in a profit of 67m.
Interest expense on retirement benefit obligation See note 20 for more details.
Profit on disposal of interest in associates and joint ventures In 2014 15 we recognised a 25m profit on the disposal of an associate, which was held at nil cost.
Tax credit on re-measurement of deferred tax See note 9 for more details.
