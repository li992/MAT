The effective tax rate for the Group including joint ventures and associates is a charge of 10.3% 2016: 11.8%.
Legislation substantively enacted at 30 November 2017 included provisions which reduced the main rate of corporation tax from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 2020.
Current tax has therefore been provided 19.33% and deferred tax at rates from 17% to 19%.
The 2.4m credit due to the change in rate used for the provision of deferred tax is predominantly due to reflecting the deferred tax arising on the majority of the investment property portfolio at the long-term rate of 17% rather than the previously used rate of 19%.

A deferred tax asset of 0.5m 2016: 0.8m has not been recognised in respect of current and prior year tax losses as it is not considered sufficiently certain that there will be taxable profits available in the short term against which these can be offset.
These unrecognised losses arise predominantly from pre-acquisition activity or within connected parties, for which group relief is not available.
