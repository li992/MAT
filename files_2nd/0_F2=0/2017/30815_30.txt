Essentra calculates its average expected tax rate as a weighted average of the applicable corporate income tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which it operates.
2017 2016 m m Profit loss before income tax including discontinued operations 130.3 47.2 1 Tax at weighted average tax rate 2017: 17.6%: 2016: 39.8% 22.9 18.8 Effects of: 2 Permanent disallowable items including exceptional costs 2.4 1.7 3 Non-deductible impairment of goodwill 8.5 4 Disposal of Porous Technologies entities 2.5 5 Non-taxable exceptional items 0.3 6 US tax reform 11.4 Overseas state and local tax 0.9 1.4 7 Unrecognised tax attributes arising utilised 2.1 0.5 Adjustments in respect of prior periods 1.8 1.6 8 Withholding tax including on unremitted earnings 0.6 1.7 9 Change in tax rates 0.2 10 Other items 1.5 2.9 Income tax expense credit including discontinued operations 14.5 7.6 Income tax credit in the UK is 3.6m 2016: 9.0m expense.
This is primarily due to the trading performance and exceptional costs of the UK businesses.
1 The change in the weighted average applicable tax rate is caused by a change in the geographical balance of the Groups profits and changes in corporate tax rates in these geographies.
The prior year weighted average tax rate was distorted due to the impairment loss in relation to the Health & Personal Care Packaging Strategic Business Unit.
2 T his includes primarily depreciation on assets not qualifying for capital allowances, costs incurred in relation to the disposal of the Porous Technologies businesses and closure of the cartons site in Newport, UK.
Permanent disallowable items may vary in future years dependent on the nature of future expenditure.
3 The 2016 impairment to the Health & Personal Care Packaging goodwill was disallowable for tax purposes.
4 The disposal of the Porous Technologies businesses gives rise to taxable gains, the basis of which is different to the accounting gains.
5 In 2016 gains from the adjustment to contingent deferred consideration in relation to prior acquisitions were non-taxable.
6 The US Tax Reform enacted during 2017 generates a tax credit as deferred tax liabilities are rebased to reflect the reduction to the US Federal tax rate from 1 January 2018.
Given the material nature of this impact, it is presented as an exceptional tax credit.

Furthermore, there has been significant scaling back of high margin security feature business in the tear tape operations.
Issues were also experienced in the integration of the European speciality tapes activities into the European tear tapes business.
As a result, impairment losses were recognised in 2016 for 32.5m of goodwill, 88.0m of customer relationship intangible asset and 3.4m of property, plant and equipment primarily plant and machinery.
At 31 December 2017, management has performed impairment assessments of the assets in each division based on the new organisational structure which became effective from 1 January 2018.
In managements view, as the annual impairment test of goodwill is performed on 31 December, it is more appropriate to apply the new organisational structure for the test as at 31 December 2017.
Following this impairment assessment, no impairment loss was recognised in 2017.
The impairment assessment for intangible assets excluding goodwill and property, plant and equipment is performed on the cash generating units within the divisions.
The cash generating units are primarily the manufacturing sites.
Goodwill is tested at the divisional level, which is the level that management monitor goodwill at.
The recoverable amount is estimated on the basis of value in use, ie, discounted cash flow projection expected to be generated by the group of cash generating units.
For assets in the cash generating units assessed to be impaired, their fair value less costs to sell is also considered in determining the impairment loss to be recognised, if any.
In these cases the fair value less costs to sell is based on estimated market prices reflecting the age and condition of the asset.

This arises as tax deductions are determined by the applicable tax laws in each country the Group operates in whereas accounting depreciation is calculated in line with the Groups accounting policy.
The decrease during the year is due to the disposal of the Porous Technologies business and the impact from the US Tax Reform.
2 A d eferred tax liability is provided on temporary differences arising on the Groups intangible assets as in the majority of cases the local tax authorities do not allow deduction for amortisation of these intangible assets.
The decrease during the year is due to the disposal of the Porous Technologies business and the impact from US Tax Reform.
3 This represents deferred tax on the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and share-based incentives.

At the year end it is expected that earnings from certain overseas Group companies will be remitted and a deferred tax liability of 4.5m 2016: 4.2m has been recognised accordingly.
This represents withholding taxes payable on the remittance of these earnings under local tax laws.
The amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 107.8m as at 31 December 2017 2016: 113.7m, and the associated amount of unrecognised deferred tax is 11.5m 2016: 11.7m.
Deferred tax continued Based on available information, management determined whether it is probable for some or all of the deferred tax assets to be realised.
In determining this management considered the cumulative losses in prior years, the history of tax losses, the manner in which assets can be used including time limitations under local laws, future earnings potential and expectation of future reversal of taxable temporary differences.
Following management assessment, gross deferred tax assets of 0.2m 2016: 0.2m in respect of capital losses and unutilised tax losses of 31.9m 2016: 46.1m have not been recognised as their realisation is not probable.
The capital losses have an unlimited expiry date.
The tax losses expire as follows: 0.1m within five years, 4.5m in five to ten years, 0.1 in over 10 years and 27.2m with no expiry.
If future conditions change the amount of unrecognised deferred tax assets will be reassessed.
This may impact the income tax expense credit in the year of remeasurement.

Following the closure of the Groups principal defined benefit pension schemes to future accruals, the schemes are funded by the Groups subsidiaries and employees are not required to make any further contribution.
The funding of these schemes is based on separate actuarial valuations for funding purposes for which the assumptions may differ from those used in the valuation for IAS 19 purposes.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries for the purposes of IAS 19 are as follows: 2017 2016 Europe US Europe US 1 Increase in salaries pre-2010 n a n a n a n a 1 Increase in salaries post-2010 n a n a n a n a 1 Increase in pensions at RPI capped at 5% 3.10% n a 3.30% n a at CPI capped at 5% 2.20% n a 2.40% n a at CPI minimum 3%, capped at 5% 3.10% n a 3.20% n a at CPI capped at 2.5% 1.90% n a 2.00% n a Discount rate 2.50% 3.60% 2.70% 4.15% Inflation rate RPI 3.20% n a 3.40% n a Inflation rate CPI 2.20% n a 2.40% n a 1 For service prior to April 2010, pension at retirement is linked to salary at retirement.

The allocation of assets is arrived at taking into consideration current market conditions and trends, the size of potential returns relative to investment risk and the extent to which asset realisation needs to match liability maturity.
There are risks underlying these considerations.
If asset returns fall below the returns required for scheme assets to match the present value of scheme liabilities, a scheme deficit results.
Persistent deficits represent an obligation the Group has to settle through increased cash contributions.
If asset maturities are not properly matched with liability maturities, there is also the risk that the Group could be required to make unplanned short-term cash contributions to resolve resulting liquidity issues.
Scheme assets are invested by the trustees in asset classes and markets that are considered to be reasonably liquid, so this matching and liquidity risk is considered to be sufficiently mitigated.
The fair value of scheme assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short-term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the pension scheme liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are therefore inherently uncertain, are: 2017 Europe US Total m m m Equities 33% 73.7 62% 34.4 108.1 Corporate bonds 18% 40.5 38% 20.9 61.4 Government bonds 49% 109.8 109.8 Other 1.1 0.2 1.3 Fair value of scheme assets 225.1 55.5 280.6 Present value of scheme liabilities 208.0 83.3 291.3 Net retirement benefit assets obligations 17.1 27.8 10.7 2016 Europe US Total m m m Equities 32% 69.9 61% 34.5 104.4 Corporate bonds 18% 39.0 38% 21.6 60.6 Government bonds 50% 111.1 111.1 Other 0.9 1% 0.8 1.7 Fair value of scheme assets 220.9 56.9 277.8 Present value of scheme liabilities 212.3 86.6 298.9 Net retirement benefit assets obligations 8.6 29.7 21.1 151 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.

No direct investment in property is held.
No plan assets are invested directly in the shares of Essentra plc.
The pension surplus in Europe is not restricted as the asset is considered realisable on the basis of the Groups unconditional right to a refund.

The Groups contributions to its defined benefit pension schemes are determined in consultation with trustees, taking into consideration actuarial advice, investment conditions and other local conditions and practices.
In 2018, the Group expects to make defined benefit contributions of $3.5m to its US schemes.

Financial risk management Essentras activities expose the business to a number of key financial risks which have the potential to affect its ability to achieve its business objectives.
The Board has overall responsibility for Essentras system of internal control and financial risk management and for reviewing the effectiveness of this system.
Such a system can only be designed to mitigate, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can therefore only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Essentra has a centralised treasury function to manage funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
Treasury policies are approved by the Board and cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of derivatives that may be employed and the criteria for investing and borrowing cash.
Essentra uses derivatives only to manage currency and interest rate risk arising from underlying business activities.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
The treasury function is subject to periodic independent reviews by the Group Assurance department.
Underlying policy assumptions and activities are reviewed by the Treasury Committee.
Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity are in place and dealings are restricted to those banks with the relevant combination of geographical presence, expertise and suitable credit rating.
Financial risk management continued The following describes Essentras financial risk exposure and management from a quantitative and qualitative perspective.
i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial asset or liability fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Essentra has no significant individual concentrations of credit risk.
The following is an overview of how Essentra manages its credit risk exposures.
Trade and other receivables Essentras exposure to credit risk is driven by the profile of its customers.
This is influenced by the demographics of the customer base, including the industry and country in which customers operate.
Essentra monitors significant customers credit limits and there is an allowance for impairment that represents the estimate of potential losses in respect of trade and other receivables.
The components of this allowance are a specific allowance for individual losses and a collective allowance for losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The collective allowance takes account of historical experience and the profile of customers.
As at 31 December 2017, gross trade receivables including amounts relating to disposal group held for sale were 173.3m 2016: 220.1m of which 39.3m 2016: 45.0m were past due but not impaired.
The ageing analysis of trade receivables past due but not impaired is as follows: 2017 2016 m m Up to 3 months 36.7 42.8 Over 3 months 2.6 2.2 39.3 45.0 As at 31 December 2017, trade receivables including amounts relating to disposal group held for sale of 4.5m 2016: 4.7m were provided for as they were considered to be impaired.

Financial risk management continued Derivative assets Credit risk with respect to derivatives is controlled by limiting transactions to major banking counterparties where internationally agreed standard form documentation exists.
The credit ratings of these counterparties are monitored.
Cash and cash equivalents Credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents is monitored daily, on a counterparty by counterparty basis.
The credit limits imposed specify the maximum amount of cash which can be invested in, or with, any single counterparty.
These limits are determined by geographic presence, expertise and credit rating.
Essentra monitors the credit ratings of counterparties.
The following credit risk table provides information regarding the credit risk exposure of Essentra by classifying derivative assets and cash and cash equivalents including amounts relating to disposal group held for sale according to credit ratings of the counterparties.
AAA is the highest possible rating and all of the assets are neither impaired nor past due.
ii Market price risk Market price risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect income or the value of financial assets and liabilities.
Essentra has produced a sensitivity analysis that shows the estimated change to the income statement and equity of a 1%, 5% or 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all other currencies or an increase or decrease of 50 basis points bps, 100bps and 200bps in market interest rates.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates and actual results in the future may materially differ.
Essentra is exposed to two types of market price risk: currency risk and interest rate risk.
a Currency risk Essentra publishes its consolidated Financial Statements in sterling but conducts business in several foreign currencies.
Therefore it is subject to currency risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the translation of results and underlying net assets of its operations and their transaction costs.
Financial risk management continued Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The majority of Essentras net assets are in currencies other than sterling.
The Companys normal policy is to limit the translation exposure and the resulting impact on shareholders funds through measures such as borrowing in those currencies in which the Group has significant net assets.
Essentras US dollar-denominated assets were approximately 36% 2016: 32% hedged by the US dollardenominated borrowings.
Essentras euro-denominated assets were approximately 65% hedged by the euro-denominated borrowings 2016: 73%.
Transaction exposure hedging The majority of Essentras transactions are carried out in the functional currencies of its operations and therefore transaction exposure is limited.
However, where such exposure does occur, Essentra uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its highly probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases over a period of up to 18 months.
Essentra does not formally define the proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate percentage on an individual basis with each business by reference to the Groups risk management policies and prevailing market conditions.
The Group documents currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash flow hedges.
To the extent that cash flow hedges are effective, gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and losses are transferred either to the income statement or to the non-financial asset acquired.
The following table shows Essentras sensitivity to a 1%, 5% and 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all currencies.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year all currencies average rates have been increased or decreased by 1%, 5% or 10%.
The translational effect on equity is limited as a proportion of US dollar and euro exposure is hedged.
Accordingly the effect on equity is calculated by increasing or decreasing the closing rate of all currencies with an adjustment for the movement in currency hedges.
It is assumed that all net investment and cash flow hedges will continue to be 100% effective.

Financial risk management continued The following table shows Essentras sensitivity to a 50bps, 100bps and 200bps decrease or increase in sterling, US dollar and euro interest rates.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year, the interest rates on all external floating rate interest bearing loans and borrowings have been increased or decreased by 50bps, 100bps or 200bps and the resulting increase or decrease in the net interest charge has been adjusted for the effect of Essentras interest rate derivatives.

iii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that Essentra, although solvent, will encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
Essentras objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility.
Essentra is primarily funded by a series of US Private Placement Loan notes from various financial institutions totalling US$155m and syndicated multi-currency five-year revolving credit facilities of 285.0m and 100.8m from its banks.
The $80m Loan note repaid on its due date in April 2017 was replaced with three new Loan notes totalling $75m in November 2017.
A Revolving Credit Facility of 375m was made available upon completion of the November 2017 Loan note issuance.
The new series of Loan notes have original maturities ranging from seven and 12 years and the revolving credit facilities mature in November 2022.
The refinancing exercise undertaken in November 2017 also included the new Revolving Credit Facility of 375.0m.
At 31 December 2017, the available bank facilities totalled 374.2m 2016: 414.2m of which 155.9m 2016: 311.0m was drawn down.
In addition, uncommitted and overdraft facilities are maintained to provide short-term flexibility.
Amounts drawn by Essentra on its committed facilities are subject to standard banking covenants.
The financial covenants require the net debt to EBITDA ratio to be less than 3.0x and interest cover to be greater than 3.5x.
There has been no covenant breach during the period.
Essentras available undrawn committed facilities at 31 December were: 2017 2016 m m Expiring after two years 218.3 103.2 Any loans drawn on these facilities would bear interest at floating rates with reference to LIBOR for the currency and period of the loan.
Financial risk management continued The maturity of Essentras financial liabilities including amounts relating to disposal group held for sale, including estimated interest payments, is analysed below.

All trade and other payables are due to be settled in less than six months.

Financial risk management continued Total financial assets and liabilities The table below sets out Essentras accounting categories and fair value for each class of financial asset and liability including amounts relating to disposal group held for sale.

Fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps have been calculated at year-end forward exchange rates compared to contracted rates.
These are determined to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The only financial instrument with fair value determined by reference to significant unobservable inputs, which is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, is the deferred contingent consideration of 4.5m relating to the acquisitions of Micro Plastics and a previous acquisition 2016: 1.3m relating to previous acquisitions.
The fair value of the deferred contingent consideration is estimated based on an assessment of the likely outcome of the acquired business financial performance.
There have been no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements.
During the year, a fair value gain of 0.1m 2016: fair value gain of 1.1m in respect of financial instruments at level 3 fair value hierarchy was recognised within exceptional items see note 2, and nil 2016: nil was settled in cash.
No other fair value gains or losses were recorded in profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
Included within interest bearing loans and borrowings are $155m 2016: $160m US Private Placement Loan notes.
The Loan notes are held at amortised cost with a carrying value of 114.8m 2016: 128.7m.
The Group estimates that the total fair value of the Loan notes at 31 December 2017 is 117.8m 2016: 136.5m.
All other financial assets, classified as loans and receivables, and trade and other payables, classified as amortised cost, are held at amortised cost and mostly have short terms to maturity.
For this reason, their carrying amounts at the reporting date approximate the fair values.
Unsecured bank loans, included within interest bearing loans and borrowings, incur interest at floating rates and as a result their carrying amounts also approximate their fair values at the reporting date.
Financial risk management continued The table below shows the amount of bank overdrafts offset against the bank balances under enforceable master netting agreements with banks including amounts relating to disposal group held for sale : Gross amount of Net amount of Gross amount of recognised financial financial assets recognised financial liabilities set off in presented in the assets the balance sheet balance sheet m m m Cash and cash equivalents: At 31 December 2017 53.6 1.6 52.0 At 31 December 2016 61.2 0.5 60.7 iv Capital structure Essentra defines its capital structure as its equity and non-current interest bearing loans and borrowings, and aims to manage this to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
Essentra sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
Essentra manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, Essentra may return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Essentra monitors its capital structure on the basis of the medium-term net debt to EBITDA ratio.
EBITDA is defined as operating profit before depreciation and other amounts written off property, plant and equipment, share option expense, intangible amortisation and exceptional operating items.
During 2017, Essentras strategy was to maintain the medium-term net debt to EBITDA ratio in the range 1.0 to 2.0.
This represents a change from 2016, where the strategy was to maintain a ratio in the range 1.0 to 2.5.
The net debt to EBITDA ratios at 31 December were as follows: 2017 2016 note m m Net debt 210.6 379.3 Operating profit before intangible amortisation and exceptional operating items 87.4 131.9 Plus depreciation and other amounts written off property, plant and equipment, and amortisation of non-acquired intangible assets 36.3 34.8 Plus share option expense 17 0.7 2.0 EBITDA 124.4 168.7 Net debt to EBITDA ratio 1.7 2.3 162 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.

Acquisitions and disposals 2017 acquisition: Micro Plastics On 12 December 2017, Essentra acquired 100% of the share capital of Micro Plastics Inc Micro Plastics.
Micro Plastics is a leading manufacturer and distributor of nylon fasteners and other plastic components for a wide range of industrial end-markets including general industrial, automotives and white goods and is reported under the Companys Component Solutions division Components under the new organisational structure see note 28.
The acquisition of Micro Plastics expands the divisions product range, adds manufacturing capacity in the US and extends the divisions geographical presence primarily in Mexico.
On acquisition the assets and liabilities of the business acquired were adjusted to reflect their fair values to Essentra.
Due to the timing of the transaction, the purchase price allocations including the split between goodwill and intangible assets and fair value adjustments are provisional and subject to finalisation for up to one year from the date of acquisition.
Had the acquisition been completed on 1 January 2017, the contribution to the Groups revenue and operating profit would have been 20.1m and 1.4m higher respectively.
Related transaction costs of 0.5m were recognised in the income statement in exceptional operating items.
