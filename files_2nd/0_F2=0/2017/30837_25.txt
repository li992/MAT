NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires the directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts recognised in the financial statements and disclosure of contingent liabilities.
However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.
There have been no judgements, estimates or assumptions which have had a signi cant impact on the financial statements for the current or preceding financial year.
3 ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards, w hich have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but were not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the European Union : IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective from 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective from 1 January 2018 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 2014 replaces IAS 39 and deals with a package of improvements including principally a revised model for classi cation and measurement of financial instruments, a forward looking expected loss impairment model and a revised framework for hedge accounting.
In terms of classi cation and measurement the revised standard is principles based depending on the business model and nature of cash ows.
Under this approach instruments are measured at either amortised cost or fair value.
Under IFRS 9 equity and derivative investments will be held at fair value because they fail the solely payments of principal and interest test and debt investments will be held at fair value because the business model is to manage them on a fair value basis.
The scope of the fair value option is reduced within IFRS 9.
The standard is effective from 1 January 2018 with earlier application permitted.
The Company does not plan to early adopt this standard.
The Standard is not expected to have any impact on the Company as all its investments are held at fair value through pro t or loss.
