Content Section at start: Page Title at start: Notes to the consolidated accounts Accounts NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS Significant accounting policies Greggs plc the Company is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The Group accounts consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The results of the associate are not consolidated on the grounds of materiality.
The Parent Company accounts present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The accounts were authorised for issue by the Directors on 27 February 2018. a Statement of compliance Both the Parent Company accounts and the Group accounts have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRSs, IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
On publishing the Parent Company accounts here together with the Group accounts, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these approved accounts.
b Basis of preparation The accounts are presented in pounds sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand, and are prepared on the historical cost basis except the defined benefit pension asset liability, which is recognised as plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Directors report and strategic report on pages 03 to 70.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are described in the financial review on pages 24 to 27.
In addition, Note 2 to the accounts includes: the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group chose not to restate business combinations prior to the IFRS transition date 1 January 2004, as no significant acquisitions had taken place during the previous ten years.
The Groups policy up to and including 1997 was to eliminate goodwill arising upon acquisitions against reserves.
Under IFRS 1 and IFRS 3, such goodwill remains eliminated against reserves.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently throughout the Group and to all years presented in these consolidated accounts and are unchanged from previous years.
There are no accounting standards, amendments or interpretations that have been adopted by the Group since 1 January 2017.
Going concern Directors have reviewed the Companys operational and investment plans for the next 12 months along with the principal risks and uncertainties that could affect these plans or threaten its liquidity.
The key factors likely to affect future performance and the Companys exposure to risks are set out on pages 33 to 37 of the strategic report.
In addition the financial review on pages 24 to 27 sets out the Companys net cash position and continued strong cash generation.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the next 12 months.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
Key estimates and judgements The preparation of financial information in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.
Treatment of items as exceptional The accounts for both the current and the prior year include items which are material and unusual in nature and which are considered to be of such significance that they require separate disclosure on the face of the income statement.
These items relate to the decision to invest in and reshape the Companys supply chain in order to support future growth.
Judgement is required in ensuring that only items that relate directly to this activity are separately presented.
Dilapidation provisions Dilapidation provisions have been included in the accounts based on a judgement of the future expected repair costs, required under the terms of the lease, to restore the Groups leased buildings to their fair condition at the end of their respective lease terms, where it is considered a reliable estimate can be made.
These provisions represent the best estimate of the liability at the balance sheet date.
Expectations will be revised each period until the actual liability arises, with any difference accounted for in the period in which the revision is made.
Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 81 Content Section at start: Page Title at start: NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Significant accounting policies continued b Basis of preparation continued Key estimates and judgements continued Realisable value of property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
For example, bakery equipment may be impaired if it is no longer in use and or shop fittings may be impaired if sales in that shop fall.
When a review for impairment is conducted the recoverable amount is estimated based on either value-in-use calculations or fair value less costs of disposal.
Value-in-use calculations are based on managements estimates of future cash flows generated by the assets and an appropriate discount rate.
Consideration is also given to whether the impairment assessments made in prior years remain appropriate based on the latest expectations in respect of recoverable amount.
Where it is concluded that the impairment has reduced, a reversal of the impairment is recorded.
The restructuring of supply chain operations in 2017, including the consolidation of production processes, gave rise to the need to evaluate the useful lives and realisable values of the assets used in the supply chain.
The key judgements in assessing the recoverable amount for assets used in the supply chain, which are included in either land and buildings or plant and equipment within property, plant and equipment, are determining remaining useful economic lives or how assets would be priced by market participants.
The sensitivities for growth rate, discount rate and lease term used in testing shop assets, which are included in fixtures and fittings within property, plant and equipment, for impairment have been considered and are deemed not significant.
For instance, a two per cent change in the growth rate would result in no change in the impairment charge.
The useful economic lives of items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets are likely to become obsolete before the end of their current estimated life.
If the asset is expected to become obsolete then consideration is given as to the likely remaining life of the asset, whether the asset can be reused in some other capacity and whether it has any residual recoverable value.
Depreciation of the asset may be accelerated to take account of all of these judgements.
During the year, the consolidation of production processes triggered a reassessment of the remaining useful economic lives of certain assets used in the supply chain.
These assets, which previously had useful economic lives of up to ten years, are now depreciated on an accelerated basis over a ten to 28-month period.
Post-retirement benefits The determination of the defined benefit obligation of the Groups defined benefit pension scheme depends on the selection of certain assumptions including the discount rate, inflation rate, mortality rates and commutation.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in future years.
The key assumptions made for 2017 are given in Note 20. c Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the results of Greggs plc and its subsidiary undertakings for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017.
The comparative period is the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2016. i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
The Company controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The accounts of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.
ii Associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20 and 50 per cent of the voting power of another entity.
At the year end the Group has one associate which has not been consolidated on the grounds of materiality see Note 12. iii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated accounts.
d Exceptional items Exceptional items are defined as items of income and expenditure which are material and unusual in nature and which are considered to be of such significance that they require separate disclosure on the face of the income statement.
Any future movements on items previously classified as exceptional will also be classified as exceptional.
e Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 82 Content Section at start: Page Title at start: Accounts f Intangible assets The Groups only intangible assets relate to software and the costs of its implementation which are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Amortisation is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date that they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are five years.
Assets in the course of development are re-categorised and amortisation commences when the assets are available for use.
g Property, plant and equipment i Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy k. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour.
ii Subsequent costs The cost of replacing a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Group, and its costs can be measured reliably.
The carrying value of the replaced component is derecognised.
The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
iii Depreciation Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost less residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment during its expected useful life using the straight-line method over the following periods: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 40 years Short leasehold properties 10 years or length of lease if shorter Plant, machinery, equipment, vehicles, fixtures and fittings 3 to 10 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values if not insignificant are reassessed annually.
iv Assets in the course of construction These assets are re-categorised and depreciation commences when the assets are available for use.
h Investments Non-current investments comprise investments in subsidiaries and associates which are carried at cost less impairment.
Current investments comprise fixed-term fixed-rate bank deposits where the term is greater than three months.
i Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and direct production labour costs.
j Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
k Impairment The carrying amounts of the Group and Companys assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
Impairment reviews are carried out on an individual shop basis unless there are a number of shops in the same location, in which case the impairment review is based on the location.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in prior years are assessed at each reporting date and reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 83 Content Section at start: Page Title at start: NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Significant accounting policies continued l Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use are classified as held for sale.
Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets are re-measured in accordance with the Group and Companys accounting policies.
Thereafter generally the assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.
Once classified as held for sale assets are no longer depreciated or amortised.
m Share capital and reserves i Re-purchase of share capital When share capital recognised as equity is re-purchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Re-purchased shares that are held in the employee share ownership plan are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity.
ii Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability when the Company has an obligation to pay and the dividend is no longer at the Companys discretion.
iii Distributable reserves All retained earnings are distributable and are the only such reserves.
n Employee share ownership plan The Group and Parent Company accounts include the assets and related liabilities of the Greggs Employee Benefit Trust EBT.
In both the Group and Parent Company accounts the shares held by the EBT are stated at cost and deducted from total equity.
o Employee benefits i Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be measured reliably.
ii Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement when they are due.
iii Defined benefit plans The Companys net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets at bid price is deducted.
The Company determines the net interest on the net defined benefit asset liability for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit asset liability.
The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on bonds that have a credit rating of at least AA, that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Companys obligations and that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.
Re-measurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets excluding interest.
The Company recognises them immediately in other comprehensive income and all other expenses related to defined benefit plans in employee benefit expenses in the income statement.
When the benefits of a plan are changed, or when a plan is curtailed, the portion of the changed benefit related to past service by employees, or the gain or loss on curtailment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs.
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in a benefit to the Company, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions and takes into account the adverse effect of any minimum funding requirements.
iv Share-based payment transactions The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of share options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date, using an appropriate model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the share options were granted, and is spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 84 Content Section at start: Page Title at start: Accounts v Termination benefits Termination benefits are expensed at the earlier of the date at which the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of these benefits and the date at which the Group recognises costs for a restructuring.
If benefits are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the reporting date they are discounted.
p Provisions A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
i Restructuring A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
ii Onerous leases Provisions for onerous leases are recognised when the Group believes that the unavoidable costs of meeting the lease obligations exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under the lease.
Before a provision is established the Group recognises any impairment loss on the associated assets.
iii Dilapidations The Group provides for property dilapidations, where appropriate, based on the future expected repair costs required to restore the Groups leased buildings to their fair condition at the end of their respective lease terms, where it is considered a reliable estimate can be made.
q Revenue i Retail sales Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised as income on receipt of cash or card payment.
Revenue is measured net of discounts, promotions and value added taxation.
ii Franchise sales Franchise sales are recognised when goods are dispatched to franchisees.
Additional franchise royalty fee income, generally calculated as a percentage of gross sales income, is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the relevant agreement.
Pre-opening capital fit-out costs are recharged to the franchisee and represent a key performance obligation of the overall franchise sales agreement.
These recharges are recognised as income on completion of the related fit-out.
iii Wholesale sales Wholesale sales are recognised when goods are dispatched to customers.
iv Loyalty programme gift cards Amounts received for gift cards or as part of the loyalty programme are deferred.
They are recognised as revenue when the Group has fulfilled its obligation to supply products under the terms of the programme or when it is no longer probable that these amounts will be redeemed.
No adjustment is made to revenue to reflect the fair value of the free items provided under the loyalty scheme as these would be immaterial to the accounts.
The costs of these free items are expensed as the products are provided to the customer.
r Government grants Government grants are recognised in the balance sheet initially as deferred income when there is a reasonable assurance that they will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them.
Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the income statement on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are incurred.
Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of an asset are recognised in the income statement over the useful life of the asset.
s Operating lease payments Payments under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense over the term of the lease.
t Finance income and expense Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective interest method.
Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 85 Content Section at start: Page Title at start: NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Significant accounting policies continued u Income tax Income tax comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable profit for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never be taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used in the calculation of taxable profit.
It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
The amount of deferred tax recognised is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that are expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse, based on rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related deferred tax benefit will be realised.
v Research and development The Company continuously strives to improve its products and processes through technical and other innovation.
Such expenditure is typically expensed to the income statement as the related intellectual property is not capable of being formalised and does not always have distinguishable research and development phases.
w IFRSs available for early adoption not yet applied The following standards and amendments to standards which will be relevant to the Group were available for early adoption but have not been applied in these accounts: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective date 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective date 1 January 2018 None of these standards and amendments is expected to have a significant impact on the accounts when they are adopted.
With regard to IFRS 9 the only area of relevance relates to provisions in respect of trade receivables.
Given the immateriality of the Groups provision for bad debts no further analysis will be required.
With regard to IFRS 15 the Group has considered all current revenue streams and concluded that none of them will require any change of treatment under the new standard.
IFRS 16 Leases was adopted by the EU on 31 October 2017.
The effective date for implementation is 1 January 2019.
The Group continues to work on a project to effect this implementation and be in a position to give a quantification of the impact by the end of 2018.
The preferred software solution for the project has been selected and the Group plans to start work on the implementation of this in March 2018.
Segmental analysis The Board is considered to be the chief operating decision-maker of the Group in the context of the IFRS 8 definition.
In addition to its retail activities, the Group generates revenues from franchise and wholesale.
However, these elements of the business are not sufficiently significant to be Reportable Segments in the context of IFRS 8.
Products and services the Group sells a consistent range of fresh bakery goods, sandwiches and drinks in its shops.
The Group also provides frozen bakery products to its wholesale customers.
Major customers the majority of sales are made to the general public on a cash basis.
A small proportion of sales are made on credit to certain organisations, including wholesale customers, but these are immaterial in a Group context.
Geographical areas all results arise in the UK.
The Board regularly reviews the revenues of each segment separately but receives information on profits, assets and liabilities on an aggregated basis consistent with the Group accounts.
Of the Groups revenue, 891,778,000 2016: 835,786,000 was attributable to the retail segment.
Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 86 Content Section at start: Page Title at start: Accounts 2.
Financial risk management Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Retail sales represent a large proportion of the Groups sales and present no credit risk as they are made for cash or card payments.
The Group does offer credit terms on sales to its wholesale and franchise customers.
In such cases the Group operates effective credit control procedures in order to minimise exposure to overdue debts.
Counterparty risk is also considered low.
All of the Groups surplus cash is held with highly-rated banks, in line with Group policy.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group operates with net current liabilities and is therefore reliant on the continued strong performance of the retail portfolio to meet its short-term liabilities.
This is a well-established and proven business model.
Any increase in short-term liquidity risk can be mitigated by reducing capital expenditure.
The model has been tested in various scenarios for the Groups viability statement which is included in the strategic report on page 81.
The Group had significant cash resources at the year end.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
Market risk is not significant and therefore sensitivity analysis would not be meaningful.
Currency risk The Group has no regular transactions in foreign currency although there are occasional purchases, mainly of capital items, denominated in foreign currency.
Whilst certain costs such as electricity and wheat can be influenced by movements in the US dollar, actual contracts are priced in sterling.
In respect of those key costs which are volatile, such as electricity and flour, the price may be fixed for a period of time in line with Group policy.
All such contracts are for the Groups own expected usage.
Interest rate risk The Group has low exposure to interest rate risk.
Interest only arises on its bank deposits and overdrafts and the defined benefit pension scheme liability.
Net financial expense in the year was 368,000 2016: 26,000.
Equity price risk The Group has no equity investments other than its subsidiaries and associate.
As disclosed in Note 20 the Groups defined benefit pension scheme has investments in equity-related funds.
Capital management The Board defines capital as the equity of the Group.
The Group has remained net cash positive with funding requirements met by cash generated from retail operations.
The Board considers that it is not currently appropriate to take on structural debt given the inherent leverage of the leasehold shop estate and working capital requirements.
The Boards policy on dividend levels is to pursue a progressive dividend policy that pays due regard to the growth of earnings per share over the medium term, the cash-generative nature of the business and the continuing determination to deliver value to shareholders.
The Board would expect to return any material level of surplus capital to shareholders, likely by way of a special dividend.
The Board reserves the option to purchase its own shares in the market dependent on market prices and surplus cash levels.
The trustees of the Greggs Employment Benefit Trust also purchase shares for future satisfaction of employee share options.
Financial instruments Group and Parent Company All of the Groups surplus cash is invested as cash placed on deposit or fixed-term deposits.
The Groups treasury policy has as its principal objective the achievement of the maximum rate of return on cash balances whilst maintaining an acceptable level of risk.
Other than mentioned below there are no financial instruments, derivatives or commodity contracts used.
Financial assets and liabilities The Groups main financial assets comprise cash and cash equivalents and fixed-term deposits.
Other financial assets include trade receivables arising from the Groups activities.
Other than trade and other payables, the Group had no financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 as at 30 December 2017 2016: nil.
Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 87 Content Section at start: Page Title at start: NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 2.
Financial risk management continued Financial instruments continued Fair values The fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from their carrying values.
Financial assets and liabilities comprise principally of trade receivables and trade payables and the only interest bearing balances are the bank deposits and borrowings which attract interest at variable rates.
Interest rate, credit and foreign currency risk The Group has not entered into any hedging transactions during the year and considers interest rate, credit and foreign currency risks not to be significant.

For shop assets a discounted cashflow is calculated for each shop using historic cashflows including attributable overheads, a zero per cent growth rate, the Groups cost of capital of ten per cent, as an approximation to that for each individual unit, and an appropriate assumption regarding the remaining lease term.
The net book value of the relevant assets attributable to the shop is impaired to the extent that the net present value of the cashflows is lower than the net book value.
Supply chain assets are impaired to their estimated recoverable amount which is generally deemed to be nil.

The grants, which have all been recognised as deferred income, are being amortised over the weighted average of the useful lives of the assets they have been used to acquire.
Employee benefits Defined benefit plan Scheme background The Company sponsors a funded final salary defined benefit pension plan the scheme for qualifying employees.
The scheme was closed to future accrual in 2008 and all remaining employees who are still members of the scheme are now members of the Companys defined contribution scheme.
The scheme is administered by a separate Board of Trustees which is legally separate from the Company.
The Trustees are composed of representatives of both the employer and employees.
The Trustees are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets plus the day-to-day administration of the benefits.
UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently.
The last funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 6 April 2017 and showed a surplus.
The Company is currently not required to pay contributions into the scheme.
Profile of the scheme The defined benefit obligation includes benefits for former employees and current pensioners.
Broadly, two-thirds of the liabilities are attributable to deferred members and one-third to current pensioners.
The scheme duration is an indicator of the weighted average time until benefit payments are made.
For the scheme as a whole, the duration is approximately 20 years.
Investment strategy The Company and Trustees have agreed a long-term strategy for reducing investment risk as and when appropriate.
This includes a policy to hold sufficient cash and bond assets to cover the anticipated benefit payments for at least the next five years so as to improve the cashflow matching of the schemes assets and liabilities.

Under these assumptions, pensioners aged 65 now are expected to live for a further 22.1 years 2016: 22.5 years if they are male and 24.0 years 2016: 24.5 years if they are female.
Members currently aged 45 are expected to live for a further 23.9 years 2016: 24.4 years from age 65 if they are male and for a further 25.5 years 2016: 26.5 years from age 65 if they are female.
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below: Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate 0.1% increase 2.6m decrease Inflation 0.1% decrease 1.6m decrease Mortality rates 1 year decrease 5.2m decrease Commutation assumption The assumptions have been reviewed during the year.
In order to reflect the levels of commutation being experienced by the scheme, an allowance has now been included in the valuation for commutation.
The assumption adopted is that 90% of deferred members will opt to commute 25% of their pension at retirement.
The commutation factors used for members aged 65 are 14.00 for males and 15.11 for females.
The adoption of this assumption in respect of commutation has resulted in a decrease in the defined benefit obligation of 7,010,000.
The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to latest trends in the scheme.
The triennial valuation of the scheme took place in April 2017.
The outcome of that valuation was considered by the Trustees and the Company and no requirement for future contributions was identified.
Defined contribution plan The Company also operates defined contribution schemes for other eligible employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
The pension cost represents contributions payable by the Group and amounted to 11,258,000 2016: 11,886,000 in the year.

The leases typically run for a period of ten years, with an option to renew the lease after that date.
Lease payments are generally increased every five years to reflect market rentals.
For a small number of the leases the rental is contingent on the level of turnover achieved in the relevant unit: these amounts are immaterial.
The inception of the shop leases has taken place over a long period of time and many date back a significant number of years.
They are combined leases of land and buildings.
It is not possible to obtain a reliable estimate of the split of the fair values of the lease interest between land and buildings at inception.
Therefore, in determining lease classification the Group evaluated whether both parts are clearly an operating lease or a finance lease.
Firstly, title does not pass for the land or buildings.
Secondly, because the rent paid to the landlord for the buildings is increased to market rent at regular intervals, and the Group does not participate in the residual value of the land or buildings it is judged that substantially all the risks and rewards of the land and buildings are with the landlord.
Based on these qualitative factors it is concluded that the leases are operating leases.
Capital commitments During the year ended 30 December 2017, the Group entered into contracts to purchase property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for 10,098,000 2016: 1,268,000.
These commitments are expected to be settled in the following financial year.

Events after the reporting period As noted in the financial review on page 25 the Company has, subsequent to the year end, exchanged contracts for the disposal of the vacant Twickenham site.
The disposal is conditional on a number of factors, including the application for and successful grant of planning permission, none of which are expected to be resolved in the 2018 financial year, and therefore this asset continues to be classified as non-current.
At this stage the total proceeds arising from supply chain site disposals are still expected to be in line with those anticipated in the investment plan.
