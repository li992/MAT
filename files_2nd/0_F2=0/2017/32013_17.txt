Earnings per share before exceptional items for the year ended 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2016 are set out in the table below.
2017 2016 million million Profit attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company continuing operations 2,717 2,244 Exceptional operating items attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company 28 171 Non-operating items attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company 20 115 Tax in respect of exceptional operating and non-operating items attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company 1 58 2,726 2,242 Weighted average number of shares million million Shares in issue excluding own shares 2,512 2,508 Dilutive potential ordinary shares 11 10 2,523 2,518 pence pence Basic earnings per share before exceptional items 108.5 89.4 Diluted earnings per share before exceptional items 108.0 89.0 Free cash flow Free cash flow comprises the net cash flow from operating activities aggregated with the net cash received paid for loans receivable and other investments and the net cash cost paid for property, plant and equipment and computer software that are included in net cash flow from investing activities.
The remaining components of net cash flow from investing activities that do not form part of free cash flow, as defined by the groups management, are in respect of the acquisition and sale of businesses.
The groups management regards the purchase and disposal of property, plant and equipment and computer software as ultimately non-discretionary since ongoing investment in plant, machinery and technology is required to support the day-to-day operations, whereas acquisitions and sales of businesses are discretionary.
Where appropriate, separate explanations are given for the impacts of acquisitions and sale of businesses, dividends paid and the purchase of own shares, each of which arises from decisions that are independent from the running of the ongoing underlying business.

Return on average total invested capital Return on average total invested capital is used by management to assess the return obtained from the groups asset base and is calculated to aid evaluation of the performance of the business.
The profit used in assessing the return on average total invested capital reflects operating profit before exceptional items attributable to the equity shareholders of the parent company plus share of after tax results of associates and joint ventures after applying the tax rate before exceptional items for the year.
Average total invested capital is calculated using the average derived from the consolidated balance sheets at the beginning, middle and end of the year.
Average capital employed comprises average net assets attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company for the year, excluding post employment benefit net liabilities net of deferred tax and average net borrowings.
This average capital employed is then aggregated with the average restructuring and integration costs net of tax, and goodwill written off to reserves at 1 July 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, to calculate average total invested capital.
Calculations for the return on average total invested capital for the years ended 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2016 are set out in the table below.
