As such, we do not report on a segmental basis.
Like-for-like calculations of growth in values and rents are therefore stated on an aggregated basis.
EPRA COST RATIO 2017 2016 NOTE M M Gross rental income Revenue 2 111.5 106.2 Less: recoverable property expenses 2 8.1 7.8 Share of joint venture rents receivable 11 8.9 7.5 112.3 105.9 Cost Property charges 3 23.2 22.1 Less: recoverable property expenses 3 8.1 7.8 Share of joint venture property expenses 11 0.9 0.8 Administrative expenses 14.1 14.1 Share of joint venture administrative expenses 11 0.1 0.2 Total costs 30.2 29.4 1.4 1.9 Less: charge for share-based remuneration 5 Total costs excluding share-based payments 28.8 27.5 EPRA cost ratio 26.9% 27.8% Cost ratio excluding share-based payments 25.6% 26.0% Note: We do not capitalise property nor administrative expenses.
The figures above include vacancy costs.
Given the nature of our portfolio, it is impractical to separate these out.
Investment properties Whilst our portfolio is geographically concentrated in Londons West End, it is granular in nature, with almost 600, generally small, buildings, often clustered in contiguous blocks.
It is not practical to provide detailed property-by-property information recommended by EPRAs BPR.
However, an analysis of our portfolio, split by destination and occupier use, is set out on pages 142 to 143.
We own 100% of our properties, except for property held by our Longmartin joint venture, in which we have a 50% interest.
The breakdown of our wholly-owned portfolio between freehold and long leasehold ownership is set out on page 123.
At 30 September 2017, we had 772 commercial and 516 residential tenants, with no individual tenant representing a material amount of our current annualised income.
The ten largest commercial tenants represented just 10.5% of current annualised income.
As our tenant base is so granular, we do not believe listing the top ten tenants, nor a detailed analysis of tenant business sector is useful.
However, the analysis on pages 142 to 143 sets out details of income and rental values by destination and occupier use.
EPRA vacancy by occupier use is set out on pages 40 to 41.
Development disclosures Our wholly-owned portfolio is all within Conservation Areas and around 20% of our buildings are listed.
We do not carry out material speculative developments.
Our capital expenditure commitments are low, representing an average of 1.1% of portfolio value over the past five years.
Included in this are numerous small schemes, and no one scheme is material.
At 30 September 2017, we had one larger scheme underway, details of which are set out on page 49.
An overview of assets held for, or undergoing, refurbishment is set out on pages 48 to 49.
