SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A BASIS OF PREPARATION AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Company for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale financial instruments which have been measured at fair value.
The financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America US dollars or US$ and all monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand US$000 except when otherwise indicated.
The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements are set out below.
These accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.
B CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the separate financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016.
NEW STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTS NEW STANDARDS ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY The Company has adopted from 1 January 2017 Amendments to IAS 7.
The amendments require an entity to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities.
The Company also has adopted Amendments to IAS 12.
The amendments clarify the accounting for deferred tax where an asset is measured at fair value and that fair value is below the assets tax base.
They also clarify certain other aspects of accounting for deferred tax assets.
This amendment had no impact in the financial information of the Company.
Other than the above mentioned amendment there were no significant new standards that the Company was required to adopt effective from 1 January 2017.
STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Companys financial statements are disclosed below.
The Company intends to adopt these standards, as applicable to the Companys financial statements, when they become effective, except where indicated.
IFRS 9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IFRS 9 Financial Instruments addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets.
The Company has decided not to adopt IFRS 9 until it becomes mandatory on 1 January 2018.
The Company does not expect the new guidance to have a significant impact on the classification and measurement of its financial assets for the following reasons: CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT The equity instruments that are currently classified as available-for-sale financial assets satisfy the conditions for classification as at fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI.
Under IFRS 9, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are not recycled to the income statement.
There are no other significant changes to the accounting for these assets.
There will be no impact on the Companys accounting for financial liabilities, as the new requirements only affect the accounting for financial liabilities that are designated at fair value through profit or loss and the Group does not have any such liabilities.
DERECOGNITION The derecognition rules have been transferred from IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and have not been changed.
FRESNILLO STRATEGIC CORPORATE FINANCIAL TODAY REPORT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS 249 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 IMPAIRMENT IFRS 9 requires the Company to now use an expected credit loss model for its trade receivables measured at amortised cost, either on a 12-month or lifetime basis.
Given the short-term nature of these receivables, the Company does not expect these changes will have a significant impact.
Regarding loans receivables the Company has evaluated the expect credit loss on a 12-month basis.
No material loss has been determined.
PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation.
These are expected to change the nature and extent of the Companys disclosures about its financial instruments particularly in the year of the adoption of the new standard.
IFRS 15 REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS The IASB has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue arising from contracts with customers.
The new revenue standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS.
The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer.
In the case of royalties the revenue is recognised based on the sales-or usage-based royalties criteria.
The Company has evaluated recognition and measurement of revenue based on the five-step model in IFRS 15 and has not identified any financial impacts, hence no adjustments are expected to result from the adoption of IFRS 15.
The Company has elected to adopt the new standard from 1 January 2018 applying the modified retrospective adoption method.
IFRS 16 LEASES IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value.
A lessee is required to recognise a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.
IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17.
Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases, and to account for those two types of leases differently.
These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier application is permitted.
However, as there are several interactions between IFRS 16 and IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers, early application is restricted to entities that also early adopt IFRS 15.
The Company has decided to adopt the standard when it became effective.
IFRIC 22 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND ADVANCE CONSIDERATION IFRIC 22 clarifies which exchange rate to use in reporting foreign currency transactions when payment is made or received in advance.
The interpretation requires the Company to determine a date of transaction for the purposes of selecting an exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income.
In case there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, the entity should determine a date of the transaction for each flow of advance consideration.
IFRIC 22 is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier adoption is permitted.
The interpretation is not expected to have any impact in the financial information of the Company.
IFRIC 23 UNCERTAINTY OVER INCOME TAX TREATMENTS This Interpretation clarifies how to apply the recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12 when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments.
The interpretation is to be applied to the determination of taxable profit tax loss, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments.
Application of tax law can be complex and requires judgement to assess risk and estimate outcomes where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain.
The Company is working to identify potential uncertainties based on previous resolutions of tax authorities.
IFRIC 23 is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier adoption is permitted.
The IASB has issued other amendments to standards, including those resulting from improvements to IFRSs that management considers do not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Company.
The Company has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective.
C SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of the Companys financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
These judgements and estimates are based on managements knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements.
Information about such judgements and estimates is in the accounting policies and the notes to the financial statements.
250 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED C SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS CONTINUED JUDGEMENTS Areas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are: Determination of functional currency note 2 d : The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be more than one currency in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates.
Contingencies note 13 : By their nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur.
The assessment of the existence and potential quantum of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events.
ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Significant areas of estimation uncertainty made by management in preparing the financial information statements include: Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets notes 2 g and 6 : The Company classifies certain financial asset as available-for-sale and recognises movements in their fair value in equity.
When the fair value declines, management makes an assessment of the decline in value to determine whether it is an impairment that should be recognised in profit or loss.
Impairment and subsequent reversal of impairment of investments in subsidiaries notes 2 e and 5 : The Company assesses investments in subsidiaries annually to determine whether any indication of impairment exists.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal FVLCD and the value in use.
Due to the nature of the subsidiaries, the assessment of the recoverable amount is generally determined based on the net present value of future cash flows related to the subsidiaries requiring the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, reserves and resources and the associate production profiles, discount rates, future capital requirements, exploration potential and operating performance.
These cash flows are discounted using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
The determination of that rate requires certain judgements.
Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, the Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of that investment, requiring similar estimates and assumptions as those for determining an impairment charge.
At 31 December 2017 the Company reversed impairment losses of US$102.8 million 2016: US$997.9 million to recognised a cumulative impairment relating to subsidiaries of US$436.4 million 2016: US$539.2 million.
D FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The Companys financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company.
The functional currency for the Company is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair valued is determined.
E INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES Subsidiaries are entities which the Company controls due to it being exposed to, or has the right to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment.
Impairment charges and reversals, up to the value of the merger reserve, are reclassified from retained earnings to the merger reserve.
When the Company increases its capital investment in or where there is a return of share capital from its subsidiaries, such movements are recognised as an addition to, or return of the original cost recognised in investment in subsidiaries.
FRESNILLO STRATEGIC CORPORATE FINANCIAL TODAY REPORT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS 251 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use.
The Company usually determines fair value based on the net present value of the future cash flows related to its subsidiaries.
If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded in the income statement to reflect the investment at the recoverable amount.
Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is made.
An impairment loss is reversed to profit or loss to the extent that the increased carrying value of the investment in subsidiary does not exceed that that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
F FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes party to contracts that give rise to them and are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: loans and receivables: held to maturity investments: or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate.
The Company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
The Company recognises financial liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities are classified at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, including any transaction costs incurred.
Financial assets are offset with liabilities and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS Financial assets and liabilities classified as held-for-trading and other assets or liabilities designated as fair value transactions through profit and loss at inception are included in this category.
Financial assets or liabilities are classified as held-for-trading if they are acquired or incurred for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Derivatives are also classified as held-for-trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments, as defined by IAS 39.
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or availablefor-sale.
After initial measurement such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables.
Non-current receivables are stated at amortised cost.
LOANS AND BORROWINGS After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate EIR method.
The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the income statement.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.
The Company adjusts the carrying amount of the financial liability to reflect actual and revised estimated cash flows.
The carrying amount is recalculated by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows at the financial instruments original effective interest rate or, when applicable, the revised effective interest rate.
Any adjustment is recognised in profit or loss as income or expense.
This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans.
For more information refer note 11.
252 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED F FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CONTINUED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the preceding categories and are not held-to-maturity investments.
Available-for-sale financial assets represent equity investments that have a quoted market price in an active market: therefore a fair value can be reliably measured.
After initial measurement, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value with mark-to-market unrealised gains or losses being recognised as other comprehensive income in the available-for-sale reserve until the financial asset is derecognised.
Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are fide-recognised when they are sold, and all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
When financial assets are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are included in the income statement within other operating income or expense.
fide-RECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES A financial asset or liability is generally fide-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a fide-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability or part of a financial liability extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the income statement.
G IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
ASSETS CARRIED AT AMORTISED COST If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate i. e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account.
The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss.
The Company first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant.
If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment.
Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed.
Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor that the Company will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice.
The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account.
Impaired receivables are derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectible.
AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS If an available-for-sale financial asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost net of any principal payment and amortisation and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred from equity to the income statement.
In assessing whether there is an impairment, the Company considers whether a decline in fair value is either significant or prolonged by considering the size of the decline in this value, the historic volatility in changes in fair value and the duration of the sustained decline.
Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement.
FRESNILLO STRATEGIC CORPORATE FINANCIAL TODAY REPORT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS 253 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 H CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and four months.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
I SHARE CAPITAL Ordinary shares issued by the Company are recorded at the net proceeds received, which is the fair value of the consideration received less costs that are incurred in connection with the share issue.
The nominal par value of the shares issued is taken to the share capital account and any excess is recorded in the share premium account, including the costs that were incurred with the share issue.
J REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes.
TRADEMARK ROYALTIES Trademark royalty income is recognised only at the time when it is probable that the amounts related to certain rights will be received INTEREST INCOME Interest income is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method: i. e. the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
DIVIDEND INCOME Dividend income is recognised when the Companys right to receive the payment is established.
K INCOME TAX CURRENT INCOME TAX Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
DEFERRED INCOME TAX Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: Where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss: and In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except: Where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
254 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED K INCOME TAX CONTINUED Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
L DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING The Company enters into derivative contracts in order to manage certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange and commodity prices which impact the financial and business transactions of its subsidiaries.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
In the Groups consolidated financial statements certain of these derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges but for the purposes of the Companys stand-alone financial statements the related hedged items are not held by the Company, so do not qualify as cash flow hedges.
Any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement.
Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Company first becomes party to the contract, with reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows.
Embedded derivatives which are not clearly and closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as stand-alone derivatives.
M FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT The Company measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 17 and 18.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: In the principal market for the asset or liability: or In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Company.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participants ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
FRESNILLO STRATEGIC CORPORATE FINANCIAL TODAY REPORT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS 255 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 Quoted unadjusted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 V aluation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
Further information on fair values is described in note 17.
N DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Mexican Income Tax Law establishes a 10% withholding on earnings from 2014 and thereafter, for dividends paid to foreign residents and Mexican individuals.
Dividends paid are not subject to income tax if paid from the Net Tax Profit Account CUFIN.
Dividends paid that exceed CUFIN are subject to an income tax payable at a rate of 30%.
The tax is payable by the Company and may be credited against the normal income tax payable by the Company in the year in which the dividends are paid or in the following two years.
Dividends paid from earnings previously taxed are not subject to any withholding or additional tax payment.
SEGMENT REPORTING Segmental information is not presented in the Companys stand-alone financial statements as this is presented in the Groups consolidated financial statements.

The Company has calculated the recoverable amount of its investments in subsidiaries as at 31 December 2017 and as a result has recognised a reversal of previously recognised impairment loss amounting to US$102.8 million 2016: US$997.9 million.
The recoverable amount was estimated based on the Fair Value Less Cost of Disposal FVLCD model 2016: FVLCD.
The following tables provide relevant information in respect of each impaired subsidiary: Year ended 31 December 2017 Current year Cumulative Impairment reversal Impairment Recoverable amount US$ thousand US$ thousand US$ thousands Discount rate Minera Fresnillo, S.

Accordingly, the fair value is categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
The price assumptions used to calculate FVLCD are determined with reference analysts consensus of long-term prices.

Management has considered a decrease in silver and gold of 10% 2016: 20% and 15%, respectively.
The sensitivity resulted in an additional impairment on Minera Fresnillo, S. A. fide C. V. of US$448.2 million 2016: US$622.3 million, Minera Mexicana la Cinega, S. A. fide C. V. US$110.6 million 2016: US$85.7 million and Minera Saucito, S. A. fide C. V. US$49.5 million 2016: US$nil.

FRESNILLO STRATEGIC CORPORATE FINANCIAL TODAY REPORT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS 261 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 13.
CONTINGENCIES As of 31 December 2017 the Company has the following contingencies: The Company is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties.
Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of the corporate income tax return, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest.
Under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods.
As such, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions, that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future.
There are currently a number of ongoing tax inspections that have been initiated by the SAT in respect of certain subsidiaries of the Company.
No findings or claims have been communicated to the Company in respect of these, other than relating to Penmont as discussed below.
It is not practical to determine the amount of any potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome arising from these or any future inspections that may be initiated.
However, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Group has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable.
With regards to Penmont tax audits, which commenced during 2015, the Company considers it completed the provision of all documentation required in order to demonstrate that all the 2012-2013 non-taxable income and tax deductions which are being challenged, are appropriate.
Penmont formally filed a writ before the Mexican Taxpayers Ombudsman PRODECON per its Spanish acronym requesting a conclusive agreement in the matter.
SATs first, second and third response to the request detailed that, while the documentation provided was sufficient to demonstrate that all of non-taxable income and the majority of the tax deductions are correct, there are still two tax deductions to be approved.
In this sense, discussion with the SAT continue, and as long as the conclusive agreement is still in progress, the current auditing process is suspended and the tax authorities cannot determine a tax deficiency until PRODECON issues the final agreement under the terms agreed between Penmont and the SAT.
On 8 May 2008, the Company and Peoles entered into the Separation Agreement the Separation Agreement.
This agreement relates to the separation of the Fresnillo Group the Group and the Peoles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Peoles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 Admission.
The Separation Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Peoles so that, in the case of Peoles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities including tax liabilities properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and, in the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Peoles against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business.
Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate.
Peoles has agreed to indemnify the Fresnillo Group in relation to: i any tax charge, subject to certain exceptions, the Company may incur as a result of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation including as a result of a transaction following Admission of a member of the Fresnillo Group, provided that Peoles has confirmed that the proposed transaction will not give rise to a tax charge, or as a result of a transaction of a member of the Peoles Group on or after Admission, the Global Offer or Admission: and ii certain tax aspects of certain other pre-Admission transactions.
Peoles liability under these indemnities and in respect of general tax liabilities arising pre-Admission which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Fresnillo Group shall not exceed US$500 million.
If a member of the Fresnillo Group forming part of Peoles tax consolidation pays an intra-Group dividend in excess of its net income tax account Cuenta fide Utilidad Fiscal Neta or CUFIN account after Admission and is relieved of tax as a result of the consolidation, it is required to pay Peoles an amount in respect of that tax.
New income tax and VAT legislation in respect of contractors came into effect on 1 January 2017, requiring management to ensure that contractors are compliant with their own tax obligations, including employment tax.
This has created a new obligation for Fresnillo to obtain and retain sufficient evidence of contractors fiscal compliance in order to deduct costs related to the contractors for income tax purposes and to recover input VAT.
In late 2017, the 2018 Federal Revenue Law clarified that if the online portal established by the tax authorities to facilitate compliance is used in 2018, it would be sufficient to discharge any 2017 compliance obligations.
Management considers that it is well progressed in meeting its obligations for 2017 and does not consider that any significant economic exposure will arise as a result of this new legislation with respect to the current year.
In regard to the ejido El Bajo matter previously reported by the Company: In 2009 five members of the El Bajo agrarian community in the state of Sonora, who claimed rights over certain surface land in the proximity of the operations of Minera Penmont Penmont, submitted a legal claim before the Unitarian Agrarian Court Tribunal Unitario Agrario of Hermosillo, Sonora, to have Penmont vacate an area of this surface land.
The land in dispute encompassed a portion of surface area where part of the operations of the Soledad-Dipolos mine are located.
The litigation resulted in a definitive court order, pursuant to which Penmont was ordered to vacate 1,824 hectares of land.
The disputed land was returned in July 2013, resulting in the suspension of operations at Soledad-Dipolos.
262 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 13.
CONTINGENCIES CONTINUED The Agrarian Court noted in that same year that certain remediation activities were necessary to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements and requested the guidance of the Federal Environmental Agency SEMARNAT in this respect.
The Agrarian Court further issued a procedural order in execution of his ruling determining, amongst other aspects, that Penmont must remediate the lands to the state they were in before Penmonts occupation.
In the opinion of the Company, this procedural order was excessive since this level of remediation was not part of the original agrarian ruling and also because the procedural order appeared not to consider the fact that Penmont conducted its activities pursuant to valid mining concessions and environmental impact permits.
In December 2016, the Agrarian Court issued a subsequent procedural order in which the Court recognised that Penmont complied with the agrarian ruling by having returned the land in dispute and, furthermore, that remediation activities are to be conducted in accordance with Federal environmental guidelines and regulations, as supervised by the competent Federal authorities.
Remediation activities in this respect are pending as the agrarian members have not yet permitted Penmont physical access to the lands.
Penmont has already presented a conceptual mine closure and remediation plan before the Agrarian Court in respect of the approximately 300 hectares where Penmont conducted mining activities.
The agrarian community Ejido El Bajo appealed this procedural order from the Agrarian Court and a Federal District Court denied this appeal.
The agrarian community has presented in the month of August 2017 a further and last recourse against this ruling by the Federal District Court and the final result is pending.
In addition, and as also previously reported by the Company, claimants in the El Bajo matter presented other claims against occupation agreements they entered into with Penmont, covering land parcels separate from the land described above.
Penmont has no significant mining operations or specific geological interest in the affected parcels and these lands are therefore not considered strategic for Penmont.
As previously reported, the Agrarian Court issued rulings declaring such occupation agreements over those land parcels to be null and void and that Penmont must remediate such lands to the state that they were in before Penmonts occupation as well as returning any minerals extracted from this area.
Given that Penmont has not conducted significant mining operations or has specific geological interest in these land parcels, any contingency relating to such land parcels is not considered material by the Company.
The case relating to the claims over these land parcels remains subject to finalisation.
Various claims and counterclaims have been made between the relevant parties in the El Bajo matter.
There remains significant uncertainty as to the finalisation and ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW The Companys principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, are comprised of trade receivables, cash, available-for-sale financial assets, loans to and from related parties, interest-bearing loans and trade payables.
The Company enters into certain derivative transactions with the purpose of managing foreign exchange risk arising on the activity and transactions of its subsidiaries.
The Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Market risk, including foreign currency, interest rate and equity price risks: Credit risk: and Liquidity risk.
This note presents information about the Companys exposure to each of the above risks and the Companys objectives, policies and processes for assessing and managing risk.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company risk management framework.
The Companys risk management policies have been established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company activities.
The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Company risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company.
The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
A MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, or interest rates will affect the Company income or the value of its financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions and balances that are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar.
Transactions in foreign currencies include the purchase of services, payment or receipt of dividends and other items.
As a result, the Company has financial liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency, and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso, reflecting the impact on the Companys profit before tax with all other variables held constant.
It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods.
There is no impact on the Companys equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED INTEREST RATE RISK The Company is exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments.
The Companys earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on any floating element of the loans with related parties and interest earned on cash balances.
Interest-bearing loans are at a fixed rate, therefore the possibility of a change in interest rate only impacts its fair value but not its carrying amount.
Therefore, interestbearing loans and loans from related parties are excluded from the table below.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of all financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in interest rate applied to a full year from the balance sheet date.

The financial assets are trade and other receivables, intercompany loans, cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale financial assets.
The Companys policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties failure to honour their obligations.
Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Companys exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The Companys exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty.
The Companys financial assets are with counterparties that the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating.
As disclosed in note 14, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties.
At each balance sheet date, the Companys financial assets were neither impaired nor past due.
The Companys policies are aimed at minimising losses from the foreign currency and commodity hedging contracts.
The Companys foreign currency and commodity derivative contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings.
The Companys surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S. A. fide C. V. which manages cash and cash equivalents investing in a number of financial institutions.
In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Company only deposits cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with a credit rating of M-1 Moodys and mxA-1 Standard and Poors and above, and only for periods of less than four months.
The maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes.
See note 6 for the maximum credit exposure for available-for-sale investments, note 8 for cash and cash equivalents and note 14 for related party balances.
FRESNILLO STRATEGIC CORPORATE FINANCIAL TODAY REPORT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS 271 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 C LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Company monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Company financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

Management considers that the Company has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from current liabilities and non-current liabilities.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The primary objective of the Companys capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios that support its business and maximise shareholder value.
Management considers capital to consist of equity and certain interest-bearing loans, as disclosed in the balance sheet, excluding net unrealised gains and losses on revaluation of cash flow hedges and available-for-sale financial assets.
In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholders capital invested in the Company, management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable.
The Companys dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business and underlying growth in earnings of the Group, as well as its capital requirements and cash flows.
