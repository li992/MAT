Croda operates in many tax jurisdictions other than the UK, both as a manufacturer and distributor, with the majority of those jurisdictions having rates higher than the UK: considerably so in some cases.
It is the exposure to these different tax rates that increases the effective tax rate above the UK standard rate and also makes it difficult to forecast the Groups future tax rate with any certainty given the unpredictable nature of exchange rates, individual economies and tax legislators.
Other than the exposure to higher overseas tax rates, there are no significant adjustments between the Groups expected and reported tax charge based on its accounting profit.
Given the global nature of the Group, and the number of associated cross-border transactions between connected parties, we are exposed to potential adjustments to the price charged for those transactions by tax authorities.
However, we would not expect such adjustments, if any, to have a material impact on the Groups tax charge in future years.
Details of the Groups tax strategy can be found on our website at www.
The main rate of UK corporation tax reduced from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017.
Further reductions to the UK tax rate have been announced that will reduce the rate to 17% by 1 April 2020, although for 2017 the rate as currently enacted will be 19%.
The future changes to rates were substantively enacted on 6 September 2016.
Overseas tax is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
