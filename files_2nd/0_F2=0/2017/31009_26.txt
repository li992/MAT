com Stock code: SHI 25690-AR2017 15-03-18 Proof Six FINANCIALS Notes to the Financial Statements As the Groups profits and losses are earned across a number of tax jurisdictions an aggregated income tax reconciliation is disclosed, reflecting the applicable rates for the countries in which the Group operates.
The total tax charge for the year differs from the expected tax using a weighted average tax rate which reflects the applicable statutory corporate tax rates on the accounting profits losses in the countries in which the Group operates.
The differences are explained in the following aggregated reconciliation of the income tax expense: 2016 2017 Restated m % m % Loss on ordinary activities before tax 51.2 110.0 Expected tax credit 2.5 4.9 31.1 28.3 Factors affecting the income tax expense for the year: expenses not deductible for tax purposes 3.9 7.6 9.0 8.1 non-taxable income 1.8 3.5 5.5 5.0 impairment and disposal charges not deductible for tax purposes 9.1 17.9 38.9 35.4 losses arising in the year not recognised for deferred tax purposes 3.3 6.4 1.4 1.3 other adjustments in respect of previous years 6.2 12.1 1.1 1.0 tax on branch profits 0.6 1.2 0.2 0.2 effect of change in rate on deferred tax 1.0 1.9 0.2 0.2 Total income tax expense 7.4 14.5 11.6 10.5 The majority of the Groups expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes are primarily in relation to the divestments of businesses and contingent consideration adjustments.
The majority of the Groups non-taxable income relates to French employment tax credits and to contingent consideration adjustments.
During the year the Group incurred impairment charges of 6.0m and disposal costs of 39.5m in relation to goodwill 2016: 127.9m as set out in Note 12.
These impairment and disposal charges are not deductible for tax purposes.
In the prior year the Group was in the process of disposing of a number of businesses and the tax deductibility and utilisation of the write downs was uncertain.
Following an investigation of these matters with the Groups tax advisors it was determined that these expenses were tax deductible.
The effective tax rate for the Group on the total loss before tax of 51.2m is negative 14.5% 2016: negative 10.5%.
The effective tax charge for the Group on profit before tax before Other items of 79.2m is 25.9% 2016: 23.8%, which comprises a tax charge of 27.9% 2016: 24.5% in respect of current year profits and a tax credit of 2.0% 2016: 0.7% in respect of prior years.
The factors that will affect the Groups future total tax charge as a percentage of underlying profits are: the mix of profits and losses between the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates: in particular the tax rates in France, Germany and Belgium are relatively high when compared to the Groups underlying effective rate and so if the proportion of profits from these jurisdictions changes, this could result in a higher or lower Group tax charge: the impact of non-deductible expenditure and non-taxable income: agreement of open tax computations with the respective tax authorities: and the recognition or utilisation with corresponding reduction in cash tax payments of unrecognised deferred tax assets see Note 23.
On 26 October 2017, the European Commission EC announced an investigation into the UKs controlled foreign company CFC rules.
The UKs CFC rules provide an exemption for 75% of the CFC charge where the CFC is carrying out financing activities.
The EC is investigating whether the UKs exemption is in breach of EU State Aid rules.
This exemption has been claimed by SIG and the Group is monitoring developments in relation to the ECs investigation.
The Group does not currently consider that a provision against the potential liability is required.
In addition to the amounts charged to the Consolidated Income Statement, the following amounts in relation to taxes have been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income with the exception of deferred tax on share options which has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
2016 2017 Restated m m Deferred tax movement associated with remeasurement of defined benefit pension liabilities 0.9 2.3 Deferred tax on share options 0.2 0.6 Tax charge credit on exchange and fair value movements arising on borrowings and derivative financial instruments 1.8 6.3 Effect of change in rate on deferred tax 0.2 0.5 Total 2.7 7.5 These items will not subsequently be reclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement.

DIVIDENDS An interim dividend of 1.25p per ordinary share was paid on 3 November 2017 2016: 1.83p.
The Directors have proposed a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2017 of 2.5p per ordinary share 2016: 1.83p.
The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these Financial Statements.
Total dividends paid during the year, including the final dividend for 2016, were 18.2m 2016: 28.0m.
No dividends have been paid between 31 December 2017 and the date of signing the Financial Statements.
At 31 December 2017 the Company has c. 53m of distributable reserves, as set out in Note 12 to the Company Financial Statements, and when required the Company can further increase these distributable reserves from appropriate repatriation of funds from subsidiary undertakings.
Whilst the level of distributable reserves is sufficient to support the Groups dividend policy over the short term, the Directors intend to carry out a review during the coming year in order to optimise existing reserves.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group had two share-based payment schemes in existence during the year ended 31 December 2017 2016: two.
The Group recognised a total charge of 0.2m 2016: credit of 0.3m in the year relating to share-based payment transactions issued after 7 November 2002 with a corresponding entry to the share option reserve.
The weighted average fair value of each option granted in the year was 106p 2016: n a.
Details of each of the schemes are provided below.
A LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN LTIP Under the existing LTIP policy, Executive Directors can be awarded an annual grant of nil paid share options up to a maximum value of 200% of base salary.
There were 1,413,968 LTIP awards in 2017 and no options awarded in 2016.
The criteria and vesting conditions of the LTIP options are as follows: 2017 Awards 2015 Award EPS ROCE EPS ROCE Weighting of criteria 33% 67% 33% 67% Vesting conditions: Does not vest 31p 10.0% 38p 11.0% Vests proportionately 31p - 38p 10.0% - 13.5% 38p - 48p 11.0% - 14.0% Vests in full 38p 13.5% 48p 14.0% Proportion that vests at entry level 0% 0% 25% 0% Exercise period 310 years 310 years The 2017 awards vest after three years and are then subject to a further two year holding period.
The right to exercise options terminates upon the employee ceasing to hold office with the Group, subject to certain exceptions and the discretion of the Board.
Previously awards were made annually since 2011 through a shadow Cash LTIP scheme that requires the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the share appreciation rights to the employee at the date of exercise.
There have been no awards made in 2017 or 2016.
This scheme has exactly the same conditions and vesting criteria as the LTIP, the difference being that the award is settled at the cash value of the equity in the event of the options being exercised, rather than through the issue of shares.
This scheme has been accounted for in the same way as the equity-settled scheme, with the exception that the liability is recognised within accruals as opposed to equity.

B SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN SIP The SIP is offered to UK employees.
The SIP is an HM Revenue & Customs approved scheme and operates by inviting participants, including Executive Directors, to purchase shares in the Company in a tax efficient manner on a monthly basis.
The Company gives one matching share for each share purchased by the employee up to a maximum of 20 each month.
No performance criteria are attached to these matching shares, other than to avoid forfeiture the participants must remain within the plan for a minimum of two years.
In 2017, 138,366 2016: 167,546 matching shares were granted during the year.
Given the nature of the scheme, the fair value of the matching shares equates to the cost of the Company acquiring these shares.

The Group currently has 15 CGUs 2016: 17.
SUMMARY ANALYSIS The recoverable amounts of goodwill in respect of all CGUs are fully supported by the value in use calculations in the year and are as follows: 2017 2016 m m UK Distribution 97.5 102.5 UK Exteriors 68.2 106.9 Building Solutions 12.7 12.7 Larivire 71.5 68.7 France 10.6 10.2 Germany 3.3 3.0 Poland 1.2 1.2 Air Handling 22.1 22.0 Benelux 14.1 13.5 Other CGUs 11.0 12.0 Total goodwill 312.2 352.7 132 SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 25690-AR2017 15-03-18 Proof Six IMPAIRMENT REVIEW PROCESS The Group tests goodwill and the associated intangible assets and property, plant and equipment of CGUs annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that an impairment may be required.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these calculations are those regarding discount rates, sales and operating profit growth rates.
These assumptions have been revised in the year in light of the current economic environment.
The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money for the Group.
In respect of the other assumptions, external data and managements best estimates are applied.
For all the CGUs, the Group performs goodwill impairment reviews by forecasting cash flows based upon the following years budget, which anticipates sales growth, and a projection of sales and cash flows based upon industry growth expectations 0%-3.4% over a further period of four years.
Where detailed five-year forecasts for a CGU have been prepared and approved by the Board, which can include higher growth rates or varied results reflecting specific economic factors, these are used in preparing cash flow forecasts for impairment review purposes.
The forecasts used in the annual impairment reviews have been prepared taking into account current economic conditions.
After this period, the sales growth rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are no more than 1% and operating profit growth no more than 3.4% in perpetuity.
The discount rates applied to all impairment reviews represent pre-tax rates.
Long term operating profit Pre-tax growth rate discount rate % % UK 1.8 11.1 France 1.4 11.6 Germany 1.4 11.6 Poland 3.4 13.2 Air Handling 1.6 10.6 Benelux 1.6 10.6 2017 IMPAIRMENT REVIEW RESULTS During the year the Group commenced the wind down of the Metechno business and thus the associated goodwill of 1.0m has been impaired.
Subsequent to the year end the Group has completed the disposal of the GRM and IBSL businesses and as a result the goodwill of 5.0m associated with these CGUs has been impaired in full based on the agreed sale proceeds.
These impairments have been charged to the UK Distribution segment.
In the prior year, a goodwill impairment charge of 100.4m was recognised in relation to the Larivire CGU and 10.2m in relation to the Poland CGU.
These were charged to the France and Other Europe segments respectively.
The results of the 2017 impairment review indicate that the carrying values of all ongoing CGUs remain supportable.

Gross margin is the key assumption in the forecasts used in the goodwill impairment reviews, and therefore a 50bps reduction in gross margin has been determined as a reasonably possible change for the purposes of the disclosure requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
If a 50bps reduction in gross margin were to arise from that forecast in the goodwill impairment reviews, an impairment would arise in four CGUs, UK Distribution 21.2m, Larivire 13.3m or 11.8m, Germany 4.2m or 3.8m and Poland PLN 14.1m or 3.0m.
The Board has actively reviewed the forecasts associated with UK Distribution, Larivire, Germany and Poland noting the conservative assumptions used, the continued pattern of strong results in challenging economic environments in which they operate, and is satisfied that no impairments are necessary.

An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods of 41.1m at 31 December 2017 2016: 33.9m.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
Included within the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 123.6m 2016: 114.3m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided, as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable.

In addition, certain balances fully provided for were shown on a net basis.
In the current year these balances have been shown on a gross basis to show a fairer presentation of the total provision.
As a result, movements in the provision have been presented gross to show separately amounts released and amounts charged to the Consolidated Income Statement during the year and the net amount charged to the Consolidated Income Statement of 5.0m presented in the prior year has been represented accordingly.
The prior year provision at 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2016 has been increased by 12.8m.
There is no impact on the net trade receivables balance disclosed at 31 December 2016.
In determining the recoverability of trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date and makes a provision for impairment accordingly.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The Directors therefore believe that no further credit provision is required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are trade receivables with a gross balance of 51.1m 2016: 45.4m and a provision for impairment of 41.1m 2016: 33.9m.
The provision for impairment represents the difference between the carrying amount of the specific trade receivable and the present value of the expected recoverable amount.
The large increase during the year is mainly attributable to the closure of business in the Middle East and has been included within losses on agreed sale or closure of non-core businesses and associated impairment charges Note 11.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
TRANSFER OF TRADE RECEIVABLES The Group sold without recourse trade receivables to banks and other financial institutions for cash proceeds.
These trade receivables of 48.7m 2016: nil have been derecognised from the Consolidated Balance Sheet, because the Group has transferred the risks and rewards.

Trade receivable credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are set, reviewed and approved by operational management on a regular basis.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of typically small to medium sized customers, spread across a number of different market sectors and geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.

The capital structure of the Group is outlined in the Financial Review on page 35.
The Groups financial assets consist of trade and other receivables, cash at bank and derivative financial instruments.

These amount to an asset of 20.9m and a liability of 26.6m.
The fair value of these derivatives was a liability of 2.7m which is included in the Sterling value of other borrowings in the table above.
The Groups net debt at 31 December 2017 was 223.8m and, after taking into account the cross-currency derivatives, the Group has net Euro financial liabilities of 145.6m.
All of the above finance lease contracts, 9.9m 2016: 11.2m, are secured on the underlying assets.
The Directors consider the fair value of the Groups floating rate financial liabilities to materially approximate to the book value shown in the table above.
The fair value of the Groups private placement notes at 31 December 2017 is estimated to be c. 240m 2016: c. 241m and is classified as a Level 2 fair value measurement for disclosure purposes.
The remaining fixed rate debt amounts to 76.1m 2016: 67.0m and relates to finance lease contracts, fixed rate loans after applying derivative financial instruments and deferred consideration.

These amounted to an asset of 20.9m and a liability of 26.6m.
The fair value of these derivatives was a liability of 2.1m which is included in the Sterling value of other borrowings in the table above.
The Groups net debt at 31 December 2016 was 279.7m restated and, after taking into account the cross-currency derivatives, the Group has net Euro financial liabilities of 152.7m restated.
In both 2017 and 2016, the interest rate on floating rate financial liabilities is based upon appropriate local market rates.
HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Included within financial assets are derivative financial instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships amounting to 1.3m 2016: 4.5m and loans and receivables including cash and cash equivalents of 586.1m 2016: restated 641.0m.
Included within financial liabilities are derivative financial instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships amounting to 3.5m 2016: 3.6m and liabilities including trade payables at amortised cost of 732.2m 2016: restated 792.8m.
The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Where the Group can demonstrate a hedge relationship under the rules of IAS 32 and 39, movements in the fair values of these derivative financial instruments for cash flow and net investment hedges will be recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Where the Group does not meet these rules, movements in the fair value will be recognised as gains and losses on derivative financial instruments in the Consolidated Income Statement in the column entitled Other items.
In order to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate and exchange rate changes, the Group utilises both currency and interest rate derivative financial instruments.
The fair values of these derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting the associated future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
The Group is required to analyse financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of the financial instruments below are categorised as Level 2.

These derivative financial instruments were designated as the hedging instruments in the net investment hedge of the Groups Euro-denominated net assets.
The hedge relationships were fully effective and the fair value changes on those derivatives were recognised in equity hedging and translation reserve.
As at 31 December 2016 the Group held one cross-currency forward contract that was designated as a net investment hedge.

This is designated and effective as a net investment hedge of the Groups Eurodenominated assets.
B CASH FLOW HEDGES With regard to cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in equity and is subsequently removed and included in the Consolidated Income Statement within finance costs in the same period that the hedged item affects the Consolidated Income Statement.
The cash flow hedges described below are expected to impact upon both profit and loss and cash flow annually over the life of the hedging instrument and the related debt as interest falls due, and upon maturity of the debt and related hedging instrument.

These derivative financial instruments form a cash flow hedge as they fix the functional currency cash flows of the Group.
All of these derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
At 31 December 2017, the weighted average maturity date of these swaps is 8.6 years 2016: 9.6 years.

As at 31 December 2017, the Group held two 31 December 2016: two interest rate derivative financial instruments which swap variable rate debt into fixed rate debt thereby fixing the functional currency cash flows of the Group.
Both of these interest rate derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
At 31 December 2017, the weighted average maturity date of these swaps is 2.1 years 2016: 3.1 years.

The Group had no fuel price derivative financial instruments at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016.
During 2016, two fuel price derivative instruments matured, one of which was designated and effective as a cash flow hedge and the fair value movement deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The remaining fuel price derivative financial instrument was not designated as a cash flow hedge and the fair value credit of 0.4m in 2016 was credited through Other items in the Consolidated Income Statement Note 2.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IFRS 7 requires the disclosure of a sensitivity analysis that details the effects on the Groups profit or loss and other equity of reasonably possible fluctuations in market rates.
This sensitivity analysis has been prepared to illustrate the effect of the following hypothetical variations in market rates on the fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities: i a 1% 100 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates: and ii a 10% strengthening or weakening of Sterling against all other currencies to which the Group is exposed.
A INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY The Group is currently exposed to Sterling, Euro and US Dollar interest rates.
The Group also has a minimal exposure to Polish Zloty interest rates.
In order to illustrate the Groups sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, the following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 100 basis point change in each respective interest rate.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to interest rate risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit or loss and other equity.

The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% change in Sterling against each respective foreign currency to which the Group is exposed, indicating the likely impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the Groups financial position.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.
Therefore, in order to present a complete analysis of the Groups exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, the exposure on the Groups total assets and liabilities has been disclosed.

The provision has been calculated after taking into account both the periods over which the properties are likely to remain vacant and the likely income from existing and future sub-lease agreements on a contract-by-contract basis.
The provision covers potential transfer of economic benefit over the full range of current lease commitments disclosed in Note 29b.
LEASEHOLD DILAPIDATIONS This provision relates to contractual obligations to reinstate leasehold properties to their original state of repair.
The provision is calculated with reference to the expired portion of individual lease agreements where such a clause exists in the lease contract.
The transfer of economic benefits will be made at the end of the leases as set out in Note 29b.
CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION Contingent consideration relates to the amounts due to vendors of completed acquisitions providing certain future profit targets are met.
The provision is remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.
The fair value is measured using level 3 inputs and is sensitive to changes in one or more unobservable inputs.
There are no remaining contingent amounts at 31 December 2017.
OTHER AMOUNTS Other amounts relate principally to claims and warranty provisions.
The transfer of economic benefit is expected to be made between one and four years time.

Of the deferred tax asset of 9.2m, 1.6m relates to unused tax losses carried forward which have been recognised on the basis that realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
The Directors have considered whether it is appropriate to recognise deferred tax assets given the losses incurred in the current and prior year.
Given current and forecast trading the Directors consider the recognition of deferred tax assets to be appropriate.
The majority of the deferred tax asset associated with the retirement benefit obligations is in respect of the UK defined benefit scheme.
Payments against the deficit will be deductible for tax purposes on a paid basis and the Group expects to receive the tax benefit, therefore the associated deferred tax asset has been recognised.
There is an unprovided deferred tax asset of 2.8m to reflect uncertainty associated with the usage of tax attributes in the current period.
Additionally, deferred tax has not been recognised on 7m of tax losses being carried forward on the basis that the realisation of their future economic benefit is uncertain.
The unrecognised potential deferred tax asset in relation to these tax losses is 1.7m 2016: 2.8m.
At the balance sheet date, no deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences relating to undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The rentals payable are subject to renegotiation at various dates.
The total future minimum lease rentals under the foregoing leases are as follows: 2017 2016 Minimum lease rentals due: m m within one year 50.8 53.0 after one year and within five years 127.9 146.8 after five years 75.7 88.6 254.4 288.4 The Group also leases certain items of plant and machinery whose total future minimum lease rentals under the foregoing leases are as follows: 2017 2016 Minimum lease rentals due: m m within one year 19.9 16.2 after one year and within five years 45.5 31.6 after five years 1.6 1.8 67.0 49.6 C PENSION SCHEMES The Group operates a number of pension schemes, six 2016: six of which provide defined benefits based on final pensionable salary.
Of these schemes, one 2016: one has assets held in a separate Trustee administered fund and five 2016: five are overseas book reserve schemes.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes, all of which are independently managed.
The Trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme.
The Trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
In The Netherlands, the Company participates in the industry-wide pension plan for the construction materials industry BPF HiBiN.
The pension plan classifies as a multi-employer defined benefit scheme under IAS 19, but is recognised in the Financial Statements as a defined contribution scheme since the pension fund is not able to provide sufficient information to allow SIGs share of the assets and liabilities to be separately identified.
Therefore, the Groups annual pension expense for this scheme is equal to the required contribution each year.
The coverage ratio of the multi-employer union plan increased to 103.4% as at 31 December 2017 2016: 97.6%.
No change was made to the pension premium percentage of 22.2% 2016: 22.2%.
The coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the funds assets by the total sum of pension liabilities and is based upon market interest rates.
In Belgium, the Company provides pensions for employees through a defined contribution scheme which, following a change in Belgian legislation, has a minimum guaranteed rate of return and is accounted for as a defined benefit scheme under IAS 19.
The Company has insured its liabilities.
At 31 December 2017 the scheme has gross assets and liabilities of approximately 0.4m 2016: 0.4m.
The Groups total pension charge for the year, including amounts charged to interest, was 8.9m 2016: 8.8m, of which a charge of 1.1m 2016: 2.5m related to defined benefit pension schemes and 7.8m 2016: 6.3m related to defined contribution schemes.
DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION SCHEME VALUATIONS In accordance with IAS 19 the Group recognises all actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they arise in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The actuarial valuations of the defined benefit pension schemes are assessed by an independent actuary every three years who recommends the rate of contribution payable each year.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the SIG plc Retirement Benefits Plan, the UK scheme, was conducted at 31 December 2013 and showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 131.4m and their actuarial value covered 90% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The next triennial actuarial valuation is effective as at 31 December 2016.
The Trustees are aiming to conclude the valuation by the end of March 2018.
The Board has considered the ongoing discussions in relation to the valuation and recovery plan in determining the final dividend for the year.
The other five schemes are book reserve schemes whereby the sponsoring company does not hold any separate assets to fund the pension scheme but makes a reserve in its accounts.
Therefore, these schemes do not hold separate scheme assets.
The liabilities of the schemes are met by the sponsoring companies.
com Stock code: SHI 25690-AR2017 15-03-18 Proof Six FINANCIALS Notes to the Financial Statements The schemes typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk.
The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependants of scheme members on death in service is reinsured by an external insurance company.
Investment risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields: if the return on plan assets falls below this rate, it will create a plan deficit.
Currently the plan has relatively balanced investments in line with the Trustees' Statement of Investment Principles between equity securities and debt instruments.
Due to the long term nature of the plan liabilities, the Trustees of the pension fund consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the plan assets should be invested in growth assets to leverage the return generated by the fund.
Interest rate risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability but this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the plans bond holdings.
Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plans liability.
Salary risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants.
As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plans liability.
However, a pensionable salary cap was introduced from 1 July 2012 of 2.5% per annum.
CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES The pension charge for the year, including amounts charged to interest of 0.7m 2016: 0.5m relating to the defined benefit pension schemes, was 1.1m 2016: 2.5m, including a curtailment loss of 0.9m.
On 30 June 2016 the UK defined benefit pension scheme was closed to future benefit accrual.
The change in assumptions associated with the closure resulted in a curtailment loss of 0.9m which was charged within Other items in the Consolidated Income Statement within 2016.
In accordance with IAS 19, the charge for the defined benefit schemes has been calculated as the sum of the cost of benefits accruing in the year, the increase in the value of benefits already accrued and the expected return on assets.
The actuarial valuations described previously have been updated at 31 December 2017 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS 19.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
The UK defined benefit scheme is closed to new members and has an age profile that is rising.
The four overseas book reserve schemes remain open to new members.
CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET LIABILITY The balance sheet position in respect of the six defined benefit schemes can be summarised as follows: 2017 2016 m m Pension liability before taxation 30.4 37.1 Related deferred tax asset 5.9 7.2 Pension liability after taxation 24.5 29.9 The actuarial gain of 5.5m 2016: loss of 12.5m for the year, together with the associated deferred tax charge of 0.9m 2016: credit of 2.3m and deferred tax charge of 0.2m 2016: 0.5m in respect of the change in the France standard rate of corporation tax from 33.33% to 25.00% from 1 January 2022 2016: change in the UK standard rate of corporation tax to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 2020 has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In addition a deferred tax charge of 0.3m 2016: 0.2m has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Of the above pension liability before taxation, 19.1m 2016: 26.8m relates to wholly or partly funded schemes and 11.3m 2016: 10.3m relates to the overseas unfunded schemes.
The movement in the pension liability before taxation in the year can be summarised as follows: 2017 2016 m m Pension liability at 1 January 37.1 23.8 Current service cost 0.4 1.1 Payment of unfunded benefits 0.3 Contributions 2.5 3.1 Net finance cost 0.7 0.5 Curtailment loss 0.9 Actuarial gain loss 5.5 12.5 Effect of changes in exchange rates 0.5 1.4 Pension liability at 31 December 30.4 37.1 154 SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 25690-AR2017 15-03-18 Proof Six On 30 June 2016 the UK defined benefit pension scheme was closed to future benefit accrual.
However, the Group is contracted to pay contributions of 2.5m per annum to January 2019.
The principal assumptions used for the IAS 19 actuarial valuation of the schemes were: 2017 2016 % % Rate of increase in salaries n a n a Rate of fixed increase of pensions in payment 1.7 1.7 Rate of increase of LPI pensions in payment 3.0 3.1 Discount rate 2.6 2.8 Inflation assumption 3.2 3.2 Upon closure of the UK defined benefit scheme to future benefit accrual the accrued benefits of active members ceased to be linked to their final salary and will instead revalue in deferment broadly in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index.
Deferred pensions are revalued to retirement in line with the schemes rules and statutory requirements, with the inflation assumption used for LPI revaluation in deferment.
Within the principal plan the life expectancy for a male employee beyond the normal retirement age of 65 is 22.1 years 2016: 22.2 years.
The life expectancy on retirement at age 65 of a male employee currently aged 45 years is 23.5 years 2016: 23.5 years.
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.
If the discount rate were to be increased decreased by 0.1%, this would decrease increase the Groups gross pension scheme deficit by 3.4m.
If the rate of inflation increased decreased by 0.1% this would increase decrease the Groups gross pension scheme deficit by 1.0m.
If the life expectancy for employees increased by one year the Groups gross pension scheme deficit would increase by 8.7m.
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
The average duration of the defined benefit scheme obligation at 31 December 2017 is 19 years 2016: 20 years.
The only assets held are within the SIG plc Retirement Benefits Plan.

NON-STATUTORY INFORMATION The Group uses a variety of alternative performance measures, which are non-IFRS, to assess the performance of its operations.
The Group considers these performance measures to provide useful historical financial information to help investors evaluate the underlying performance of the business.
These measures, as shown below, are used to improve the comparability of information between reporting periods and geographical units, to adjust for Other items as explained in further detail within the Statement of Significant Accounting Policies or to adjust for businesses identified as non-core to provide information on the ongoing activities of the Group.
This also reflects how the business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis.
Non-core businesses are those businesses that have been closed or disposed of or where the Board has resolved to close or dispose of the businesses prior to signing the Annual Report and Accounts.
These measures are used by management for performance analysis, planning, reporting and incentive setting purposes and remain consistent year-on-year.

PRIOR YEAR RESTATEMENTS During 2017, the Group discovered that profit had been overstated in relation to rebates receivable from suppliers and cash had been overstated in relation to cash cut-off procedures.
As a consequence, cost of sales and the related assets and liabilities have been overstated.
The errors have been corrected by restating each of the affected financial statement line items for prior periods.
The following tables summarise the impacts on the Groups Financial Statements.
