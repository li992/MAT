Where there are noreadily available market values to determine fair values, cash flows relating to the various instruments have been discounted atprevailing interest and exchange rates to give an estimate of fair value.
Accordingly, the fair value of cash deposits and short term borrowings approximates to the book value due to the shortmaturity of these instruments.
The same applies to trade and other receivables and payables excluded from the above analysis.
Financial instruments Effective 1 January 2013, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 13 for financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following hierarchy: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices orindirectly that is, derived from prices level 2 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
All of the Groups financial instruments are classified as level 3.
Borrowing facilities As at 31 December 2017, the Group had undrawn committed facilities of 390.2m 2016: 410.6m.
In addition, the Group had other undrawn facilities of 59.0m 2016: 65.0m available.
Of the Groups total committed facilities of 814.4m, 688.7m expire after 2020.

Borrowings, other financial liabilities and other financial assets continued Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk.
The Groups overall risk management strategy is approved by the Board and implemented and reviewed by the Risk Management Committee.
Detailed financial risk management is then delegated to the Group Finance department which has a specific policy manual that sets outguidelines to manage financial risk.
Regular reports are received from all operating companies to enable prompt identification offinancial risks so that appropriate action may be taken.
In the management and definition of capital the Group includes ordinary andpreference share capital and net debt.
Currency risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect tothe US Dollar and the Euro.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities andnet investments in foreign operations.
Entities in the Group use foreign currency bank balances to manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities.
The Groups risk management policy is to manage transactional risk up to three months forward.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed toforeign currency translation risk.
Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations is not specifically hedged but is reduced primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies where it is efficient to do so.
For 2017, had the Groups basket of reporting currencies been 10% weaker stronger than the actual rates experienced, post-tax profitfor the year would have been 17.4m 2016: 14.8m lower higher than reported, primarily as a result of the translation of the profitsof the Groups overseas entities, and equity would have been 56.6m 2016: 47.7m lower higher.
Interest rate risk The Group has both interest bearing assets and liabilities.
In 2016, the Group had a policy of maintaining no more than 60% of its gross borrowings at fixed interest rates in normal circumstances.
During 2016, the Group increased its amount of fixed rate debt following payment of the 136m special dividend and consequent increase in core debt requirements.
Bonds were issued in the amounts of 100m and 100m with an average maturity of 9.1 years and interest rate of 2.08%.
The Group also retained its US$100m loan note repayable in 2020 carrying a fixed rate of 5.94%.
During 2017, the policy formally increased the upper limit for fixed rate debt to 75% of gross borrowings.
At 31 December 2017, approximately 59% of Group borrowings were at fixed rates.
As at 31 December 2017, aside from the loan notes referred to above, all Group debt and cash was exposed to repricing within 12months of the balance sheet date.
At 31 December 2017, the Groups fixed rate debt was at a weighted average rate of 3.16% 2016: 3.26%.
The Groups floating rate liabilities are predominantly based on LIBOR and its overseas equivalents.
Based on the above, had interest rates moved by 10 basis points in the territories where the Group has substantial borrowings, post-tax profits would have moved by 0.2m 2016: 0.2m due to increased interest expense on the Groups floating rate borrowings.
Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of long term and short term committed facilities designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds available for operations and planned investments.
The Group also has a share buyback programme that is managed toensure the efficiency of the Groups funding structure.
On a regular basis, management monitors forecasts of the Groups cash flows against both internal targets and those targets imposed by external lenders.
The Group has substantial committed, unused facilities and the Directors are confident this situation will remain thecase forthe foreseeable future.
Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high-credit quality .
The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution.
