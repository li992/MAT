BAE Systems 148 Annual Report 2017 Notes to the Group accounts 1.
Segmental analysis Revenue and profit recognition Revenue represents income derived from the provision of goods and services by the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
Long-term contracts The majority of the Groups long-term contract arrangements are accounted for under IAS 11, Construction Contracts.
Revenue is recognised when the Group has obtained the right to consideration in exchange for its performance, which is when a separately identifiable phase milestone of a contract or development has been completed.
Profit is calculated by reference to reliable estimates of contract revenue and forecast costs after making suitable allowances for technical and other risks related to performance milestones yet to be achieved.
No profit is recognised until the outcome of a contract can be reliably estimated.
Profit is recognised progressively as risks have been mitigated or retired.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense.
Goods sold and services rendered Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, rebates and other similar allowances.
Revenue from the sale of goods not under long-term contract is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue and costs can be measured reliably.
Profit is recognised at the time of sale.
Revenue from the provision of services not under long-term contract is recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract at the reporting date.
The stage of completion is measured on the basis of direct expenses incurred as a percentage oftotal expenses to be incurred for material contracts and labour hours delivered as a percentage of total labour hours to be delivered for timecontracts.
Revenue from the sale of software licences is recognised on delivery to the customer when the Group has no remaining obligations to perform and collection of the consideration is considered probable.
In circumstances where the Group has future obligations to perform as part of a software licence and related services contract, revenue is recognised over the contract term.
Revenue and profits on intercompany trading are determined on an arms-length basis.
Research and development The Group undertakes research and development activities either on its own behalf or on behalf of customers.
Where the research and development activity is performed on behalf of customers, the revenue arising is recognised in the income statement inaccordance with the Groups revenue recognition policy on long-term contracts.
Reporting segments During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group had the following six reporting segments: Electronic Systems comprises the US and UK-based electronics activities, including electronic warfare systems, electro-optical sensors, military and commercial digital engine and flight controls, next-generation military communications systems and data links, persistent surveillance capabilities, and hybrid electric drive systems: Cyber & Intelligence comprises the US-based Intelligence & Security business and UK-headquartered Applied Intelligence business, and covers the Groups cyber security, secure government, and commercial and financial security activities: Platforms & Services US, with operations in the US, UK and Sweden, manufactures combat vehicles, weapons and munitions, and delivers services and sustainment activities, including ship repair and the management of government-owned munitions facilities: Platforms & Services UK comprises the Groups UK-based air, maritime, land and shared services activities: Platforms & Services International comprises the Groups businesses in Saudi Arabia, Australia and Oman, together with its 37.5% interest inthe pan-European MBDA joint venture: and HQ comprises the Groups head office activities, together with a 49% interest in Air Astana.

Taxation expense Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination or items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted atthe reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences: on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxableprofit or loss: related to investments in subsidiaries and equity accounted investments to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that havebeen enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

The US federal tax rate has been reduced from 35% to 21% with effect from 1 January 2018, while the estimated state tax rate has increased from 5% to 6%.
In line with this change, the rate applying to US deferred tax assets andliabilities at 31 December 2017 has been reduced from 40% to 27%, creating a rate adjustment in 2017, which is partly reflected in the Consolidated income statement and partly intheConsolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Purpose Provides a measure of underlying performance that is comparable over time.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets are excluded because they are not related to the in-year operational performance of the business, being driven by the timing and quantum of investment in acquired businesses and software.
Non-cash finance movements on pensions are excluded because they are driven by external factors, such as corporate bond yields and inflation.
Non-cash finance movements on financial derivatives are excluded because they are driven by external factors, such as foreign exchange rates andinterest rates.
Non-recurring items are not relevant to an understanding of the Groups underlying performance.
The impact of US tax reform enacted in December 2017 has been excluded because it does not reflect the Groups in-year underlying taxrate.

Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost or valuation, less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Cost or valuation Goodwill Under the acquisition method for business combinations, goodwill is the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred, less the net ofthe acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included inintangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisitions of jointventures and associates is included in the carrying value of equity accounted investments.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Software Software includes: Computer software licences acquired for use within the Group are capitalised as an intangible asset on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software: and Software development costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.
Group-funded expenditure associated with enhancing or maintaining computer software programs for sale is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs Development costs funded by the Group on activities applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products arecapitalised as an internally generated intangible asset if certain conditions are met.
The costs capitalised includematerials, direct labour and related overheads.
Programme and customer-related Intangible assets recognised by the Group include those relating to ongoing programmes within businesses acquired, mainly in respect ofcustomer relationships and order backlog.
Other Other intangible assets includes patents, trademarks and licences.
Amortisation Goodwill is not amortised.
Amortisation on intangible assets, excluding goodwill, is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis overtheir estimated useful lives.
For programme-related intangibles, amortisation is set on a  basis over the life of the individual programme.
Amortisation for customer-related intangibles is also set on an individual basis.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Software 2 to 5 years Development costs up to 10 years Programme and customer-related up to 15 years Other up to 20 years The Group has no indefinite-life intangible assets other than goodwill.
Impairment of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment property and equity accounted investments The carrying amounts of the Groups intangible assets excluding goodwill, property, plant and equipment, investment property and equity accounted investments are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment as required by IAS36, Impairment of Assets.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill and intangible assets thatare notyet available for use, impairment testing is performed annually.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its Cash-Generating Unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash-Generating Unit to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
An impairment loss in respect of other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment property and equity accounted investments is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised or if there has been a change in the estimate used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Impairment testing The recoverable amount of the Groups goodwill is based on value in use estimated using risk-adjusted future cash flow projections from the five-year Integrated Business Plan IBP and a terminal value based on the projections for the final year of that plan, with growth rate assumptions in the range 0% to 2% applied.
The IBP process includes the use of historical experience, available government spending data and the Groups order backlog.
Pre-tax discount rates, derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 6.60% 2016 7.01% adjusted for risks specific to the market in which the Cash-Generating Unit CGU operates, have been used in discounting these projected risk-adjusted cashflows.

The majority of the projected cash flows within these CGUs are underpinned by expected levels of primarily UK government spending on defence, aerospace and security, and the Groups ability to capture a broadly consistent market share.
In the case of Applied Intelligence, the future cash flow projections are based on the expectation of growth in cyber and intelligence, in the UK and overseas government markets, together with increasing demand for products and services in commercial markets.
Impairment In 2017, the impairment charge of 384m reflects lower growth assumptions in the Applied Intelligence CGU.
The recoverable amount of the Applied Intelligence CGU is based on value in use calculated using a pre-tax discount rate of 16% 2016 11%.

Property, plant and equipment Cost Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
The cost ofdemonstration assets iswritten off as incurred.
The reimbursement of the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment by a customer is presented as deferred income and recognised in the income statement on a basis consistent with the depreciation of the asset over its estimated useful life.
Assets held for leasing out under operating leases are included inproperty, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided, normally on a straight-line basis, to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives to any estimated residual value, using the following rates: Buildings up to 50 years, or the lease term if shorter Plant and machinery: Computing equipment and motor vehicles 4 to 5 years Other equipment 10 to 20 years, or the project life if shorter For certain items of plant and equipment in the Groups US businesses, depreciation is normally provided on a basis consistent with cost reimbursement profiles under US government contracts.
Typically, this provides for a faster rate of depreciation than would otherwise arise onastraight-line basis.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land and assets in the course of construction.
The assets residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there isanyindication of impairment in accordance with the policy shown in note 8.

Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are stated at their cost less provision for bad debts.
A provision for bad debt is established when there is objective evidence thatthe Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of thedebtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments areconsidered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
Receivables with a short-term duration are not discounted.
A loss on provision for bad debt is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring afterthe impairment loss was recognised.
Amounts due from customers for contract work includes long-term contract balances and amounts due from contract customers, less attributable progress payments.
Long-term contract balances are stated at cost less provision for any anticipated losses.
Provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when it becomes probable that total estimated contract costs will exceed total contract revenues.
Such provisions are recorded as write downs of long-term contract balances for that portion of the work which has already been completed, and the remainder is included as amounts due to long-term contract customers within trade and other payables.
Losses are determined onthebasis of estimated results on completion of contracts and are updated regularly.
Progress payments are amounts received from customers in accordance with the terms of contracts which specify payments in advance of deliveryand are credited, as progress payments, against any expenditure incurred for the particular contract.
Any unexpended balance in respectof progress payments is held in trade and other payables as customer stage payments or, if the amounts are subject to advance payment guarantees unrelated to Group performance, as cash received on customers account.
Amounts due from contract customers represent unbilled income and are stated at cost, plus attributable profit.

Other financial assets and liabilities Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The international nature of the Groups business means it is exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates.
In order to protect itself against currency fluctuations, the Groups policy is to hedge all material firm transactional exposures.
The Group uses interest rate derivative instruments to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits by varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt over the forward time horizon.
The Group uses foreign exchange derivative instruments to manage the Groups exposure to currency fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits with the Groups subsidiaries and equity accounted investments.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
The Group aims to achieve hedge accounting treatment for all derivatives that hedge material foreign currency exposures and those interest rate exposures where hedge accounting can be achieved.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, such instruments are stated at fair value atthe balance sheet date.
The fair values are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows.
Fair value through profit or loss Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement for theperiod.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of cash flows relating to a highly probable forecast transaction income or expense, the effective portion of any change in the fair value of the instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented inthehedging reserve in equity.
Amounts recognised in equity are reclassified from reserves into the cost of the underlying transaction and recognised in the income statement when the underlying transaction affects profit or loss.
The ineffective portion of any change in the fair valueof the instrument is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Fair value hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk, and gains and losses on the derivative instrument, are recognised in the income statement for the period.

Deferred tax A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced tothe extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
The most significant recognised deferred tax assets relate to the deficits on the Groups pension retirement schemes see below.
This is because retirement benefit costs are deducted in determining accounting profit as service is provided by employees, but deducted in determining taxable profit either when contributions are paid to the pension retirement schemes or when retirement benefits are paid.
In reviewing the probability that taxable profits will be available in the future against which such contributions payments can be deducted, account has been taken of the new deficit recovery plans agreed with the trustees of the relevant schemes in November 2017 under which the deficits are expected to be cleared between 2021 and 2026 see note 21.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to incometaxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

Deferred tax continued Future changes in tax rates The US federal tax rate has been reduced from 35% to 21% with effect from 1 January 2018, while the estimated state tax rate has increased from 5% to 6%.
This will reduce future US current tax charges accordingly.
Recognised US deferred tax balances as at 31December 2017 have been calculated at a combined federal and state tax rate of 27% 2016 40%.
The UK current tax rate reduced from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and will reduce to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.
This will reduce future UK current tax charges accordingly.

Retirement benefits Pension schemes Defined contribution Obligations for contributions are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit The cost of providing benefits is determined periodically by independent actuaries and charged to the income statement in the period in which those benefits are earned by the employees.
Remeasurements, including actuarial gains and losses, are recognised in the Consolidated statement ofcomprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Past service costs resulting from a plan amendment orcurtailment are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The retirement benefit surpluses and obligations recognised in the Groups balance sheet represent the fair value of scheme assets, less the present value of the defined benefit obligations calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions as set out on page 178.
The bid values of scheme assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present values of scheme liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are, therefore, inherently uncertain.
IAS 19, Employee Benefits, limits the measurement of a defined benefit surplus to the lower of the surplus in the defined benefit scheme and the asset ceiling.
The asset ceiling is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the scheme or reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
IFRIC 14, IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, issued in 2007, provides an interpretation of the requirements of IAS 19, clarifying that a refund is available if the entity has an unconditional right to a refund in certain circumstances.
The Group has applied IFRIC 14 and has determined that there is no limit on the recognition of the surpluses in itsdefined benefit pension schemes as at 31 December 2017.
MBDA participates in the Groups defined benefit schemes and, as these are multi-employer schemes, the Group has allocated a share of the IAS19 pension surpluses and deficits to MBDA based on the relative payroll contributions of active members, which is consistent with prior years.
Whilst this methodology is intended to reflect a reasonable estimate of the share of the deficit, it may not accurately reflect the obligations of the participating employers.
In the event that an employer who participates in the Groups pension schemes fails or cannot be compelled to fulfil its obligations as a participating employer, the remaining participating employers are obliged to collectively take on its obligations.
The Group considers the likelihood of this event arising as remote.
The Groups share of the IAS 19 pension deficit allocated to the equity accounted investments is included in the balance sheet within equity accounted investments.

Retirement benefits continued Background Pension schemes BAE Systems plc operates pension schemes for the Groups qualifying employees in the UK, US and other countries.
The principal schemes in the UK and US are funded defined benefit schemes, and the assets are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
Thetwo largest funded defined benefit schemes are the Main Scheme and the BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan 2000 Plan which, inaggregate, represent 81% 2016 69% of thetotal IAS 19 defined benefit obligation at 31December 2017.
The schemes in other countries are primarily defined contribution schemes.
At 31 December 2017, the weighted average durations of the UK and US defined benefit pension obligations were 18 years 2016 19years and 12years 2016 12 years, respectively.
The split of the defined benefit pension liability on a funding basis between active, deferred and pensioner members for the Main Scheme, 2000 Plan and US schemes in aggregate is set out below: Active Deferred Pensioner % % % 1 Main Scheme 35 20 45 2 2000 Plan 16 30 54 3 US schemes 31 16 53 1.

Regulatory framework The funded UK schemes are registered and subject to the statutory scheme specific-funding requirements outlined in UK legislation, including thepayment of levies to the Pension Protection Fund as set out in the Pension Act 2004.
These schemes were established under trust and the responsibility for their governance lies jointly with the trustees and the Group.
The funded US schemes are tax-qualified pension schemes regulated by the Pension Protection Act 2006 and insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation PBGC up to certain limits.
These schemes were established under and are governed by the US Employee Retirement Income Security Act 1974 and the BAE Systems Administrative Committee is a named fiduciary with the authority to manage their operation.
Benefits The UK defined benefit schemes provide benefits to members in the form of a set level of pension payable for life based on members final salaries.
The benefits attract inflation-related increases both in deferment and payment.
All UK defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants, with benefits for new employees being provided through a defined contribution scheme.
The Normal Retirement Age for active members of the Main Scheme and 2000 Plan is 65.
Specific benefits applicable to members differ between schemes.
Further details on the benefits provided by each scheme are provided on the BAE Systems Pensions website: baesystemspensions.
The US defined benefit schemes ceased to be final salary schemes in January 2013.
The benefits accrued based on the final salaries ofmembers atthat point will become payable on retirement.
The Normal Retirement Age for the largest scheme in the US is 65.
Other retirement benefits The Group operates a number of non-pension retirement benefit schemes, under which certain employees are eligible to receive benefitsafter retirement, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired employees of the Groups subsidiaries in the US.

Retirement benefits continued Funding Introduction Disclosures in respect of pension funding are provided below.
Disclosures in respect of pension accounting under IAS 19 are provided on pages 178to 183.
The majority of the UK and US defined benefit pension schemes are funded by the Groups subsidiaries and equity accounted investments.
Theindividual pension schemes funding requirements are based on actuarial measurement frameworks set out in their funding policies.
For funding valuation purposes, pension scheme assets are included at market value at the valuation date, whilst the liabilities are measured onanactuarial funding basis using the projected unit credit method and discounted to their present value based on prudent assumptions set bythe trustees following consultation with scheme actuaries.
The funding valuations are performed by professionally qualified independent actuaries and include assumptions which differ from the actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 accounting purposes shown on page 178.
The purpose of the funding valuations is to design funding plans which ensure that the schemes have sufficient funds available to meet future benefit payments.
UK valuations Funding valuations of the Groups nine UK defined benefit pension schemes are performed every three years.
The latest valuations were performed as at 31 March 2017.
The next funding valuation will have an effective date of no later than 31 March 2020.
In November, the 2017 triennial funding valuations and, where necessary, deficit recovery plans were agreed with the trustees and certified bythescheme actuaries after consultation with the UK Pensions Regulator.
The funding valuations have resulted in a significantly lower deficit than under IAS 19.
The results of the most recent triennial valuations are shown below: At 31 March 2017 Main 2000 Scheme Plan Other Total bn bn bn bn Market value of assets 12.8 4.3 4.5 21.6 Present value of liabilities 14.4 4.6 4.7 23.7 Funding deficit 1.6 0.3 0.2 2.1 Percentage of accrued benefits covered by the assetsat the valuation date 89% 93% 96% 91% The valuations were determined using the following mortality assumptions: 2017 Life expectancy of a male currently aged 65 years 86 89 Life expectancy of a female currently aged 65 years 88 90 Life expectancy of a male currently aged 45 years 88 92 Life expectancy of a female currently aged 45 years 91 93 The discount rate assumptions are based on prudent levels of expected returns for the assets held by each of the schemes.
The discount rates arecurves which provide a different rate for each year into the future.
The discount rates used in the 2014 valuation were based on a traditional gilts yield plus a margin which varied by scheme and over time.
The discount rates used in the 2017 valuation are directly based on prudent return assumptions for the assets held by the schemes, reflecting the planned investment strategies and maturity profiles of each scheme.
The inflation assumptions are derived using data from the Bank of England which is based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed interest long-term government bonds.
The inflation assumption is a curve which provides a different rate for each year into the future.
In aggregate, the net funding deficit across the UK schemes at 31 March 2017 was 2.1bn.
The funding deficit is approximately 3bn lower thanthe accounting deficit of the equivalent UK schemes prepared under IAS 19, using like-for-like mortality assumptions and asset values at 31December 2017, largely due to lower liabilities reflecting the higher discount rate assumption.
Under IAS 19, the discount rate for accounting purposes is based on third-party AA corporate bond yields whereas, for funding valuation purposes, the discount rate is based on a prudent level of expected returns from the broader and mixed types of investments held in the schemes, which areexpected to yield higher returns than bonds.
The agreements reached are underpinned by contingency plans, which include a commitment by the Group to a further 50m of deficit funding into the largest scheme prior to the next triennial valuation in the event that the scheme funding level was to fall below pre-determined parameters.
In addition, the Group would be required to pay 187m across its schemes with deficits at the valuation date if the funding levels for those schemes were to fall significantly and were to remain at or below those levels for nine months.
There will be no change to the contributions or benefits, as set out in the rules of the schemes, for pension scheme members as a result of the new funding valuations.
The results of future triennial valuations and associated funding requirements will be impacted by a number of factors, including the future performance of investment markets and anticipated members longevity.
US valuations The Groups US pension schemes are valued annually, with the latest valuations performed as at 1 January 2017.
Financial statements BAE Systems Annual Report 2017 177 21.
Retirement benefits continued Contributions Under the terms of the trust deeds of the UK schemes, the Group is required to have a funding plan determined at the conclusion of the triennial funding valuations.
Equity accounted investments make regular contributions to the schemes in which they participate in line with the schedule of contributions andare allocated a share of deficit funding contributions.
In 2017, total contributions to the Groups pension schemes were 433m 2016 461m, including amounts funded by equity accounted investments of 31m 2016 50m, and included approximately 209m and 62m of deficit recovery payments in respect of the UK and USschemes, respectively.
Based on the new funding valuations, current annual deficit recovery payments to the UK schemes, including amounts funded by equity accounted investments, will increase to 220m a year from 1 April 2018.
Deficit contributions will further increase in line with any percentage growth in dividend payments made by the Group.
Under the new deficit recovery plans, these annual payments would subsequently fall by50min 2022 as the deficits oncertain schemes are expected to be cleared.
The annual payments are expected to end in 2026 when alldeficitsare projected to be cleared.
Under the last agreement made in 2014, all scheme deficits were projected to be cleared in 2026.
Based on the latest valuations of the Groups US pension schemes, contributions are expected to remain at a level consistent with 2017 throughto2022.
In 2018, the Group expects to make total contributions to its pension schemes of 0.5bn.
Risk management The defined benefit pension schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks, including market investment risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk andlongevity risk.
Risk Mitigation Market investment risk The investment portfolios are highly diversified, investing in a wide range of assets, in order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security could have a materially adverse impact Asset returns may not move onthe total portfolio.
To reduce volatility, certain assets are held in a matching portfolio, which largely inlinewith the liabilities and consists of index-linked bonds, gilts and swaps, designed to mirror movements in corresponding liabilities.
Some 47% 2016 47% of the Groups pension scheme assets are held in equities and pooled investment vehicles due to the higher expected level of return over the long term.
Some of the Groups pension schemes use derivative financial instruments as part of their investment strategy to manage the level of market risk.
The Main Scheme has a long-dated equity option strategy protecting 1.4bn of assets against a significant fall in equity markets.
Interest rate risk In addition to investing in bonds as part of the matching portfolio, some of the UK schemes invest in interest rate swaps to reduce the exposure to movements in interest rates.
The swaps are held with several Liabilities are sensitive to banks to reduce counterparty risk.

rate risk than theywere in the 2014 funding valuation.
Accordingly, the 2017 approach provides a more natural hedge against interest rate risk.
The planned investment strategy, which is reflected in the discount rate and liability calculation, is for the schemes to increase their investments in bonds or other assets which match the liabilities as the schemes mature.
Under the 2017 UK funding valuation, the Group expects the schemes to be fully hedged against interest rate movements following a five-year transition period to the planned investment strategy.
Inflation risk In addition to investing in index-linked bonds as part of the matching portfolio, the principal UK schemes invest in long-term inflation swaps to reduce the exposure to movements in inflation.

Under the 2017 UK funding valuation approach, the Group is already fully hedged against inflation movements and, under the planned investment strategy, the Group aims to maintain afully hedged position.
In 2014, the Main Scheme implemented a pension increase exchange to allow retired members to elect for a higher current pension in exchange for foregoing certain rights tofuture pension increases.
Longevity risk Longevity adjustment factors are used in the majority of the UK pension schemes in order to adjust thepension benefits payable so as to share the cost of people living longer withemployees.
Liabilities are sensitive to lifeexpectancy, with increases In 2013, with the agreement of the Company, the trustees of the 2000 Plan, Royal Ordnance Pension inlifeexpectancies leading Scheme and Shipbuilding Industries Pension Scheme entered into arrangements with Legal & General toanincrease in the valuation toinsure against longevity risk for the current pensioner population, covering a total of 4.4bn of pension ofliabilities.
These arrangements reduce the funding volatility relating to increasing life expectancy.

This inherently captures the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments.
For the UK territory, the discount rate used for future service differs from that used for past service as it only uses the cash flows relating to active members, which have a different duration.
Further information on the duration of the schemes is detailed onpage 175.
Retail Prices Index RPI inflation In the UK, the inflation assumptions are derived by reference to the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds, or advice from the local actuary depending on the available information.
In the US, inflation assumptions are not relevant asthe Groups US pension schemes are not indexed with inflation.
Rate of increase in salaries The rate of increase in salaries for the UK schemes is assumed to be RPI inflation of 3.1% 2016 RPI inflation of 3.2%, plus apromotional scale.
From 1 January 2013, employees in the US schemes no longer accrue salary-related benefits.
Rate of increase in deferred pensions The rate of increase in deferred pensions for the UK schemes is based on Consumer Prices Index CPI inflation of 2.1% 2016 CPI inflation of2.2%, with the exception ofthe 2000 Plan, which is based on RPI inflation of 3.1% 2016 RPI inflation of 3.2%.
For all UK schemes, the rate ofincrease in deferred pensions is subject to inflation caps.
Rate of increase in pensions in payment The rate of increase in pensions in payment differs between UK schemes.
Different tranches of the schemes increase at rates based on either RPI or CPI inflation, and some are subject to an inflation cap.
With the exception of two smaller schemes, the rate of increase in pensions in payment is based on RPI inflation.
Life expectancy For its UK pension schemes, the Group has used the Self-Administered Pension Schemes S2 mortality tables based on year of birth as published by the Institute of Actuaries for both pensioner and non-pensioner members in conjunction with the results of an investigation into the actual mortality experience of scheme members and information on the demographic profile of the schemes membership.
In addition, to allow for future improvements in longevity, the Continuous Mortality Investigation 2016 tables published by the Institute of Actuaries have been used in2016, the Continuous Mortality Investigation 2015 tables were used, with an assumed long-term rate of future annual mortality improvements of 1.25% 2016 1.25%, for both pensioner and non-pensioner members.
In October 2015, the Society of Actuaries in the US released updated mortality assumptions reflecting the results of its comprehensive mortality study.
For the majority of the US schemes, the mortality tables used at 31 December 2017 are a blend of the fully generational RP-2014 Aggregate table and the RP-2014 White Collar table, both projected using Scale MP-2017.
The IRS have approved the new mortality tables to be adopted for funding valuation purposes from 2018.
US healthcare schemes The latest valuations of the principal schemes, covering retiree medical and life insurance schemes in certain USsubsidiaries, were performed by independent actuaries as at 1 January 2017.
These valuations were rolled forward to reflect the information at 31 December 2017.
The method of accounting for these is similar to that used for defined benefit pension schemes.
The assumption for long-term healthcare cost increases is 4.9% 2016 4.8% based on the assumptions that the increases are 7.8% in2017 reducing to 4.5% by 2026 and 4.5% each year thereafter for pre-retirement, and 8.5% in 2017 reducing to 4.5% by 2026 and 4.5% eachyear thereafter for post-retirement.

Retirement benefits continued Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity information has been derived using scenario analysis from the actuarial assumptions as at 31 December 2017 and keeping all other assumptions as set out on page 178.
Financial assumptions The estimated impact of changes in the discount rate and inflation assumptions on the defined benefit pension obligation, together with the estimated impact on scheme assets, is shown in the table below.
The estimated impact on scheme assets takes into account the Groups risk management activities in respect of interest rate and inflation risk.
The sensitivity analysis on the defined benefit obligation is measured on anIAS19 accounting basis and, therefore, does not reflect the natural hedging in the discount rate used for funding valuation purposes.
Increase decrease Increase decrease 1 1 inpension obligation inscheme assets bn bn Discount rate: 0.1 percentage point increase 0.5 0.2 0.1 percentage point decrease 0.5 0.2 Inflation: 0.1 percentage point increase 0.5 0.2 0.1 percentage point decrease 0.5 0.2 1.
Before allocation to equity accounted investments.
The sensitivity of the valuation of the liabilities to changes in the inflation assumption presented above assumes that a 0.1 percentage point change to expectations of future inflation results in a 0.1 percentage point change to all inflation-related assumptions rate of increase in salaries, rate of increase in deferred pensions and rate of increase in pensions in payment used to value the liabilities.
However, upper and lower limits exist on the majority of inflation-related benefits such that a change in expectations of future inflation may not have the same impact on the inflation-related benefits, and hence will result in a smaller change to the valuation of the liabilities.
Accordingly, extrapolation of the above results beyond the specific sensitivity figures shown may not be appropriate.
To illustrate this, the increase decrease in the defined benefit pension obligation resulting from larger changes in the inflation assumption would be as follows: Increase decrease 1 inpension obligation bn Inflation: 0.5 percentage point increase 1.5 0.5 percentage point decrease 1.5 1.0 percentage point increase 3.1 1.0 percentage point decrease 2.8 1.
Demographic assumptions Changes in the life expectancy assumption, including the benefit of longevity swap arrangements see longevity risk on page 177, wouldhave the following effect on the total net IAS 19 deficit: Increase decrease 1 innet deficit bn Life expectancy: One-year increase 1.1 One-year decrease 1.1 1.

Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
Warranties and after-sales service Warranties and after-sales service are provided in the normal course of business with provisions for associated costs being made based on an assessment of future claims with reference to past experience.
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products and services are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighting of possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
Reorganisations A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been publicly announced.
The costs associated with the reorganisation programmes are supported by detailed plans and based on previous experience as well as other known factors.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
Legal, contractual and environmental The Group holds provisions for expected legal, contractual and environmental costs that it expects to incur over an extended period.
Management exercises judgement to determine the amount of these provisions.
Provision is made for known issues based on past experience of similar items and other known factors.
Each provision is considered separately and the amount provided reflects the best estimate of the most likely amount, being the single most likely amount in a range of possible outcomes.

There are no individual provision releases in excess of 10m.
Warranties and after-sales service Warranty and after-sales service costs are generally incurred within three years post-delivery.
Whilst actual events could result in potentially significant differences to the quantum, but not the timing, of the outflows in relation to the provisions, management has reflected current knowledge in assessing the provision levels.
Reorganisations Reorganisation costs are generally incurred within one to three years.
There is limited volatility around the timing and amount of the ultimate outflows related to these provisions.
Other debtors includes 89m which is reimbursable in respect of reorganisation costs incurred in 2017 seenote12.
Legal, contractual and environmental Reflecting the inherent uncertainty within many legal proceedings, the amount of the outflows could differ significantly from the amount provided and the timing of the outflows cannot be reliably estimated.
Other There are no individually significant provisions included within other provisions.

Fair value measurement Fair value of financial instruments Certain of the Groups financial instruments are held at fair value.
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of financial instruments held at fair value have been determined based on available market information at the balance sheet date, and the valuation methodologies listed below: the fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts are calculated by discounting the contracted forward values and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates: and the fair values of both interest rate and cross-currency swaps are calculated by discounting expected future principal and interest cash flows andtranslating at the appropriate balance sheet rates.
Due to the variability of the valuation factors, the fair values presented at 31 December may not be indicative of the amounts the Group would expect to realise in the current market environment.
Fair value hierarchy The fair value measurement hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices orindirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data i. e. unobservable inputs.

US$500m of the US$800m 3.8% bond, repayable 2024, has been converted to a floating rate bond by utilising interest rate swaps.
These derivatives have been designated as fair value hedges.
Changes in the fair value of the interest rate risk on the bond, and gains and losses on the derivatives are recognised in the income statement.
The bond has been included in financial instruments not measured at fair value because its carrying value has only been adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate risk on a portion of the bond, which has been calculated by discounting the future cash flows and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rate.
All of the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as level 2 using the fair value hierarchy.
There were no transfers between levels during the year.
Financial assets and liabilities in the Groups Consolidated balance sheet are either held at fair value or their carrying value approximates to fair value, with the exception of loans, most of which are held at amortised cost.
The fair value of loans presented in the table above is derived from market prices.
BAE Systems 190 Annual Report 2017 Notes to the Group accounts continued 28.
Financial risk management Interest rate risk The Groups objective is to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings through varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt with derivative instruments, including interest rate and cross-currency swaps.
The Groups interest rate management policy is that a minimum of 50% 2016 50% and a maximum of 90% 2016 90% of gross debt is maintained at fixed interest rates.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had 82% 2016 81% of fixed rate debt and 18% 2016 19% of floating ratedebt based on a gross debt of 4.0bn, including debt-related derivative financial assets 2016 4.3bn.
Based on contracted maturities and or repricing dates, the following amounts are exposed to interest rate risk over the future as shown below: Less than Between one More than one year and two years two years m m m Cash and cash equivalents 3,271 Loans and overdrafts 746 739 661 The floating rate debt has been predominantly achieved by entering into interest rate swaps which swap the fixed rate US dollar interest payable ondebt into either floating rate sterling or US dollars.
At the end of 2017, the Group had a total of $1.0bn 2016 $1.0bn of this type of swap outstanding with a weighted average duration of 5.6 years 2016 2.6 years.
In respect of the fixed rate debt, the weighted average period in respect of which interest is fixed was 9.5 years 2016 11.6 years.
Given the level of short-term interest rates during the year, the average cost of the floating rate debt was 4.6% 2016 4.1% on US dollars.
Thecost of the fixed rate debt was 4.9% 2016 4.8%.
A change of 100 basis points in short-term rates applied to the average fixed floating mix and level of borrowings would vary the interest cost tothe Group by 7m 2016 8m.
In respect of cash deposits, given the fluctuation in the Groups working capital requirements, cash is generally invested for short-term periods based at floating interest rates.
A change of 100 basis points in the average interest rates during the year applied to the average cash deposits would vary the interest receivable by 14m 2016 14m.

Financial risk management continued Borrowing facilities The Groups objective is to maintain adequate undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had a committed Revolving Credit Facility RCF of 2bn 2016 2bn.
The RCF is contracted until2018 at 2bnand from 2018 to 2020 at 1.9bn.
The RCF was undrawn throughout the year.
The RCF also acts as a back stop to Commercial Paper issuedby the Group.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had no Commercial Paper in issue 2016 nil.
Cash management Cash flow forecasting is performed by the businesses on a monthly basis.
The Group monitors a rolling forecast of its liquidity requirements toensure that there is sufficient cash to meet operational needs and maintain adequate headroom.
Surplus cash held by the businesses over and above balances required for working capital management is loaned to the Groups centralised treasury department.
Surplus cash is invested in instant-access current accounts, short-term deposits and money market funds, choosing instruments with appropriate maturities or sufficient liquidity to provide adequate headroom as determined by cash forecasts.
The Groups objective is to monitor and control counterparty credit risk and credit limit utilisation.
The Group adopts a conservative approach tothe investment of its surplus cash which is deposited with financial institutions with strong credit ratings for short periods.
The cash and cashequivalents balance at 31 December 2017 of 3,271m 2016 2,769m was invested with 33 2016 33 financial institutions.
A credit limit isallocated to each institution taking account of its market capitalisation, credit rating and credit default swap price.
The cash and cash equivalents of the Group are invested in non-speculative financial instruments which are usually highly liquid, such asshort-term deposits.
The Group, therefore, believes it has reduced its exposure to counterparty credit risk through this process.
Currency risk The Groups objective is to reduce its exposure to transactional volatility in earnings and cash flows from movements in foreign currency exchangerates, mainly the US dollar, euro, Saudi riyal and Australian dollar.
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of foreign currency denominated transactions.
All material firmtransactional exposures are hedged and the Group aims, where possible, to apply hedge accounting to these transactions.
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of the translation of net assets and income statements of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments.
The Group does not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the income statements or balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments it regards as long-term investments.
The estimated impact on foreign exchange gains and losses in net finance costs of a ten cent movement in the closing US dollar exchange rate onthe retranslation of US dollar-denominated bonds held by BAE Systems plc is approximately 49m 2016 59m.
Credit risk The Group has material receivables due from the UK, US and Saudi Arabian governments where credit risk is not considered an issue.
For the remaining trade receivables, a provision for bad debts has been calculated taking into account individual assessments based on past credit history and prior knowledge of debtor insolvency or other credit risk, and no one counterparty constitutes more than 2% of the balance 2016 11%.
The ageing of trade receivables is detailed below: 2017 2016 Gross Provision Net Gross Provision Net m m m m m m Not past due and not impaired 1,143 1,143 850 850 Up to 180 days overdue and not impaired 369 369 466 466 Past 180 days overdue and not impaired 176 176 76 76 Past 180 days overdue and impaired 35 35 85 40 45 1,723 35 1,688 1,477 40 1,437 Movements on the provision for bad debts are as follows: 2017 2016 m m At 1 January 40 34 Created 16 15 Utilised 1 2 Released 19 13 Foreign exchange adjustments 1 6 At 31 December 35 40 BAE Systems 192 Annual Report 2017 Notes to the Group accounts continued 29.

Adoption of IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Adoption of IFRS 15 Impact of adoption of IFRS 15 From 1 January 2018, the Group will adopt IFRS 15, Revenue from Revenue recognition Contracts with Customers.
The standard replaces IAS 11, Construction Revenue on the majority of contracts, currently being recognised Contracts, IAS 18, Revenue, and all other existing revenue accounting based on the completion of milestones or deliveries, will cumulatively requirements within IFRS.
It applies to all revenue arising from contracts be recognised earlier.

Under IAS 11, revenue under long-term contracts is recognised when IFRS 15 outlines principles for the measurement and recognition of aseparately identifiable phase milestone has been completed.
Under revenue from contracts with customers, with the core principle being IAS 18, revenue from the sale of goods not under long-term contracts that revenue should be recognised at an amount that reflects the isrecognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for been transferred to the customer, for example, upon delivery.

Under IAS 11, the recognition of revenue over time based on The standard also covers the accounting for the incremental costs milestones gives rise to work-in-progress in respect of costs expended ofobtaining a contract and the costs to fulfil a contract, together in pursuit of milestones which have not been completed at the balance withpresentation and disclosure requirements.
Under IFRS 15, it is not deemed appropriate to recognise significant work-in-progress as an asset on the Groups balance sheet The Group will adopt IFRS 15 fully retrospectively in accordance with when revenue is recognised over time as the Standard considers the paragraph C3 a. Comparatives for the year ended 31 December 2017 control of the work-in-progress to have been transferred to the will be restated.
Consequently, under IFRS 15, the Group will recognise revenue based on costs incurred reflecting the continuous transfer ofthe benefit of the Groups performance to the customer.
The adoption of IFRS 15 will not impact contracts for the provision of services currently accounted for on the basis of the stage of completion measured on the basis of either direct expenses incurred or labour hours delivered as these have already been determined to meet the criteria for over time revenue recognition.
If the over time criteria for revenue recognition are not met, revenue isrecognised at the point in time that control is transferred to the customer, which is usually when legal title passes and the business hasthe right to payment.

The development activity on these contracts has a ofcontracts with customers which have been determined to fulfil the lower margin than the subsequent production activity and, therefore, criteria for point in time revenue recognition, together with products under IFRS 15, less profit is allocated to development, with more manufactured to stock without contractcover.
Impact on reported results Licence revenue The Group will adopt IFRS 15 fully retrospectively in accordance Some licence revenue in Applied Intelligence originally recognised withparagraph C3 a.
Provisional comparatives for the year ended upfront under IAS 18 will be deferred and recognised over the 31December 2017 are shown in the following tables.
BAE Systems Applied Intelligence generates revenue from the sale of licences of its intellectual property.
The licences have varying terms and conditions and can be provided for a fixed term or in perpetuity.
Under IAS 18, the Group recognises revenue in respect of software licences in line with the substance of those transactions, either on delivery to the customer or spread over the licence term typically five years or, in relation to perpetual licences, over the related customer relationship.
The Group has determined that, under IFRS 15, certain licences that qualified for upfront recognition under IAS 18 in its Applied Intelligence business represent the right to access the Groups intellectual property on the basis that the customers have an expectation that the Group will provide significant updates to the software during the licence term to ensure its continuing value to the customer.
Accordingly, revenue relating to these licences is deferred and recognised over the licence term under IFRS 15 rather than being recognised upfront under IAS 18.
