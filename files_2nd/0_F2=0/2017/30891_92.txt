Pensions The primary pension arrangement is a funded final salary pension plan in the UK under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity.
This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated directors, four company-nominated directors, an independent director, and an independent chairman nominated by the company.
The trustee board is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan.
The plan is closed to new joiners but remains open to ongoing accrual for current members.
New joiners are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.
The level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
During 2017 the aggregate level of contributions was $509 million 2016 $539 million.
The aggregate level of contributions in 2018 is expected to be approximately $483 million, and includes contributions we expect to be required to make by law or under contractual agreements, as well as an allowance for discretionary funding.
For the primary plan there is a funding agreement between the company and the trustee.
On an annual basis the latest funding position is reviewed and a schedule of contributions covering the next five years has been agreed.
The funding agreement can be terminated unilaterally by either party with two years notice.
Contractually committed funding therefore represents seven years of future contributions, which amounted to $2,623 million at 31December2017, of which $106 million relates to past service.
The surplus relating to the primary pension plan is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that the company is entitled to a refund of any remaining assets once all members have left the plan.
The obligation and cost of providing the pension benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method.
The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31December2017.
The principal plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years in the UK.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the primary pension plan was as at 31 December 2014, and a valuation as at 31 December 2017 is currently under way.
The material financial assumptions used to estimate the benefit obligations of the plans are set out below.
The assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year, and are used to evaluate accrued pension benefits at 31December and pension expense for the following year.
