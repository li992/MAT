This reflects both the interest payable and the repayment of the borrowing on maturity.
Due to the seasonal nature of the home credit business, drawings under the groups revolving bank facilities are typically drawn for only three months at any time despite having the ability to draw the borrowings for much longer under the committed borrowing facility.
In the table below, the cash flows of borrowings made under the groups syndicated revolving bank facility are required to be shown as being due within one year, despite the group having the ability to redraw these amounts until the contractual maturity of the underlying facility.

The groups exposure to movements in interest rates is managed by the treasury committee and is governed by a Board-approved interest rate hedging policy which forms part of the groups treasury policies.
The group seeks to limit the net exposure to changes in interest rates.
This is achieved through a combination of issuing fixed-rate debt and by the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps.
A 2% movement in the interest rate applied to borrowings during 2017 and 2016 would not have had a material impact on the groups profit before taxation or equity as the groups interest rate risk was substantially hedged.
d Foreign exchange rate risk Foreign exchange rate risk is the risk of a change in foreign currency exchange rates leading to a reduction in profits or equity.
The groups exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates during 2017 arose from the home credit operations in the Republic of Ireland which are hedged by matching euro-denominated net assets with euro-denominated borrowings or forward contracts as closely as practicable.
In 2016 the available for sale investment held by Vanquis Bank in respect of Visa Europe Limited, up until Visa Inc. s acquisition of Visa Europe on 21 June 2016, and then Visa Inc. following the acquisition.
Prior to completion of the acquisition, the available for sale investment comprised expected upfront euro cash consideration, which was hedged through matching the cash consideration with eurodenominated borrowings, together with deferred consideration of preferred stock which was convertible into US dollar denominated Class A common stock of Visa Inc. on completion of the transaction.
Due to the inherent uncertainty of the valuation and timing of completion, the valuation of the common stock was not hedged.
Following completion of the acquisition, the US dollar denominated Class A common stock of Visa Inc. and an element of euro-denominated deferred cash consideration have not been hedged due to the inherent uncertainty of the valuation and timing of any cash flows.
As at 31 December 2017, a 2% movement in the sterling to euro exchange rate would have led to a 0.9m 2016: 1.2m movement in customer receivables with an opposite movement of 0.9m 2016: 1.2m in external borrowings.
Due to the natural hedging of matching eurodenominated assets with euro-denominated liabilities, there would have been a minimal impact on reported profits and equity.
As at 31 December 2017, a 2% movement in the sterling to euro exchange rate would have led to a nil 2016: 0.2m movement in the available for sale investment and a nil impact on reported profits and equity 2016: 0.2m.
As at 31 December 2017, a 2% movement in the sterling to US dollar exchange rate would have led to a 0.2m 2016: 0.1m movement in the available for sale investment.
Due to the US dollar element relating to the unhedged deferred consideration at 31 December 2016, there would have been a 0.2m impact on reported profits and equity.
e Market risk Market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse market movements caused by active trading positions taken in interest rates, foreign exchange markets, bonds and equities.
The groups corporate policies do not permit it to undertake position taking or trading books of this type and therefore it does not do so.
Capital risk management The groups results in 2017 have been adversely impacted by the significant losses incurred by CCDs home credit business as a result of the operational disruption following the transition to a new operating model and the estimated costs associated with the resolution of the FCA investigation into Vanquis Bank and the ongoing FCA investigation into affordability, forbearance and termination options in Moneybarn.
The group is seeking to raise additional capital of approximately 300.0m 331m gross proceeds before deduction of expenses of 31m through a fully underwritten rights issue.
During February 2018, the group shared a revised capital plan with the PRA, which incorporated the proposed rights issue.
As a result, on a fully loaded basis, the groups minimum regulatory capital requirement was increased, primarily due to an increase of approximately 100m in respect of conduct and operational risk assessments.
As a result, on a fully loaded basis, the groups minimum regulatory capital requirement going forward is a CET ratio of 25.5%.
The successful completion of the rights issue will ensure that the group has the appropriate levels of regulatory capital to meet its current and future regulatory capital requirements and strengthens its balance sheet with the appropriate level of buffers in order to enable it to capture underlying organic growth opportunities.
In addition, the rights issue will allow the group to seek to maintain its investment grade rating and should re-establish normal access to funding from the bank and debt capital markets.
To support the delivery of the groups strategy, the group will continue to operate a financial model which is founded on investing in customercentric businesses which offer attractive returns and which aligns an appropriate capital structure with the groups dividend policy and future growth plans whilst maintaining sufficient regulatory capital headroom.
Going forward, the group will fund its receivables book through a combination of 25% equity and 75% debt.
This equates to meeting the groups minimum regulatory capital requirement of a CET 1 ratio of 25.5%.
Accordingly, the capital generated by the group will be calculated as cash generated from operating activities, after assuming that 75% of the growth in customer receivables is funded with borrowings, less net capital expenditure.
143 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Financial statements Financial and capital risk management continued Capital risk management continued Regulatory capital As a result of holding a banking licence and accepting retail deposits, Vanquis Bank is regulated by the PRA which sets requirements for Vanquis Bank as an individual entity relating to capital adequacy, liquidity and large exposures.
Vanquis Bank is also regulated by the FCA for conduct purposes.
In addition, the group, incorporating Vanquis Bank, CCD and Moneybarn, is the subject of consolidated supervision by the PRA as Provident Financial plc being the parent company of Vanquis Bank.
The PRA sets requirements for the consolidated group in respect of capital adequacy, liquidity and large exposures.
The minimum amount of regulatory capital held by the group and Vanquis Bank represents the higher of the PRA imposed requirement, being their respective Target Capital Requirement TCR together with the CRD IV stipulated buffers, and their respective internal assessments of minimum capital requirements based upon an assessment of risks facing the group.
The Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP considers all risks facing the business, including credit, operational, counterparty, conduct, pension and market risks, and assesses the capital requirement for such risks in the event of downside stresses.
In addition, the group and Vanquis Bank continually monitor and assess the internal assessment of minimum regulatory capital requirements.
The minimum regulatory capital requirements of each of Vanquis Bank and the group reflects the expected TCR, together with a fixed add-on in respect of pension risk, expected to be effective from April 2018 following completion of the rights issue.
The groups and Vanquis Banks minimum regulatory capital requirements are expected to be 25.5% and 24.9% of total risk weighted assets respectively.
These assessments include fully loaded CRD IV buffers of 3.5% of total risk weighted assets, the minimum Pillar 1 prescribed requirement of 8.0% of risk weighted assets and Pillar 2a regulatory capital requirements of 14.0% and 13.4% of total risk weighted assets for the group and Vanquis Bank, respectively.

2 Expected net proceeds from the proposed rights issue of 300.0m.
The groups CET 1 ratio prior to the recognition of the expected impact of the FCA investigations at Vanquis Bank and Moneybarn increased from 21.9% at 31 December 2016 to 23.0% at 31 December 2017.
After recognising the exceptional costs in respect of FCA investigations, the groups CET 1 decreased to 14.5% at 31 December 2017, which is below the groups minimum regulatory capital requirement.
On an unaudited pro forma basis, after assuming completion of the proposed rights issue, the CET 1 ratio increases to 28.7%, comfortably higher than the groups revised TCR.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments is effective from 1 January 2018.
Based on finalised transitional arrangements, the regulatory capital impact of IFRS 9 will be phased in on a transitional basis over five years.
The groups future capital generation, together with the minimum dividend cover target of 1.4 times is expected to absorb the transitional impact of IFRS 9.
The treasury committee is responsible for monitoring the level of regulatory capital.
The level of surplus regulatory capital against the TCR is reported to the Board on a monthly basis in the groups management accounts.
144 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Financial statements Capital risk management continued Borrowings to tangible net worth To seek to maintain its investment grade rating, the group targets a borrowings to tangible net worth ratio of 2.8 times or below.
The calculation of borrowings to tangible net worth is set out below: 2017 2016 Pre FCA FCA Rights Pro forma 1 2 settlements settlements Reported issue unaudited Reported m m m m m m Total borrowings 2,174.1 2,174.1 165.0 2,009.1 1,855.1 Less cash on deposits 35.6 35.6 35.6 30.0 Net borrowings 2,138.5 2,138.5 165.0 1,973.5 1,825.1 Net assets 729.6 194.5 535.1 300.0 835.1 790.1 Goodwill 71.2 71.2 71.2 71.2 Other intangible assets 79.4 79.4 79.4 78.1 Deferred tax on acquired intangible asset 8.5 8.5 8.5 9.8 Tangible net worth 587.5 194.5 393.0 300.0 693.0 650.6 Borrowings to tangible net worth 3.6 5.4 2.8 2.8 1 Comprises the estimated cost of the ROP settlement in Vanquis Bank of 172.1m and the estimated cost of 20.0m in respect of the ongoing FCA investigation at Moneybarn together with a net tax charge on these costs of 2.4m.
2 Expected net proceeds from the proposed rights issue of 300.0m with 165.0m applied as a reduction in borrowings and 135.0m applied as an increase in the liquid assets buffer.
The groups underlying borrowings to tangible net worth ratio has increased from 2.8 times at 31 December 2016 to 3.6 times at 31 December 2017 reflecting the significant losses in the home credit businesses, the strong growth in Vanquis Bank, Moneybarn and Satsuma receivables and payment of the 133.4m 2016 final dividend in June 2017.
After recognising the exceptional costs in respect of the FCA investigations, the groups borrowings to tangible net worth ratio increases to 5.4 times before decreasing to 2.8 times on an unaudited pro forma basis after the proposed rights issue.
The groups credit rating from Fitch ratings was downgraded from BBB to BBBand placed on ratings watch negative following the groups announcement on 22 August 2017.
Gearing In order to maintain an efficient capital structure, the group historically targeted a gearing ratio of 3.5 times.
As a result of the expected increase in the groups regulatory capital requirements following the proposed rights issue, the groups minimum regulatory capital requirement as opposed to gearing will be the main determinant of the groups capital structure going forward.
The groups gearing covenant is calculated as follows: 2017 2016 Pre FCA FCA Rights Pro forma 1 2 settlements settlements Reported issue unaudited Reported m m m m m m Total borrowings 2,174.1 2,174.1 165.0 2,009.1 1,855.1 Liquid assets buffer 263.4 263.4 135.0 398.4 168.9 Arrangement fees 4.8 4.8 4.8 2.2 Borrowings for gearing purposes 1,915.5 1,915.5 300.0 1,615.5 1,688.4 Net assets 729.6 194.5 535.1 300.0 835.1 790.1 Pension 102.3 102.3 102.3 72.4 Other intangible assets 17.4 17.4 17.4 12.3 Hedging reserve 0.2 Net assets for gearing purposes 644.7 194.5 450.2 300.0 750.2 730.2 Gearing 3.0 4.3 2.2 2.3 1 Comprises the estimated cost of the ROP settlement in Vanquis Bank of 172.1m and the estimated cost of 20.0m in respect of the ongoing FCA investigation at Moneybarn together with a net tax charge on these costs of 2.4m.
The groups underlying gearing increased from 2.3 times at 31 December 2016 to 3.0 times at 31 December 2017, consistent with the increase in the borrowings to tangible net worth ratio.
After recognising the exceptional costs in respect of the FCA investigations, the groups gearing increases to 4.3 times as reported at 31 December 2017, before decreasing to 2.2 times on an unaudited pro forma basis after assuming successful completion of the proposed rights issue.
This compares with a covenant limit of 5.0 times.
