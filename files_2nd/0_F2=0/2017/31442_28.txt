Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 1.
General information Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Alfa or the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group is a public company limited by shares and is incorporated and domiciled in England.
The registered office is Moor Place, 1 Fore Street Avenue, London, EC2Y 9DT, United Kingdom.
The principal activity of the Group is to provide software solutions and consultancy services to the asset finance industry in the United Kingdom, United States of America, Europe and Asia Pacific.
Prior to the admission of Alfas shares on the main market of the London Stock Exchange on 1 June 2017 the Admission, the Company obtained control of the entire share capital of Alfa Financial Software Group Limited AFSGL via a share-for-share exchange.
In substance, these consolidated financial statements reflect the continuation of the pre-existing Group previously headed by AFSGL, and the consolidated financial statements have been prepared applying the principles of predecessor accounting as this was a common control transaction and therefore outside the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Accounting policies The accounting policies adopted in preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those used to prepare the AFSGL Groups consolidated financial information for the years ended 31 December 2014, 2015 and 2016 as published in the prospectus for the admission of Alfas shares the Annual Historical Financial Information.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in applying the Groups accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were materially the same as those applied to the consolidated Annual Historical Financial Information, other than share based payment expense which is not included in the current year as it is related to an estimate made in relation to valuations in prior periods.
2.1 Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, other than the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments recorded at fair value through profit or loss.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS, and IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC interpretations as adopted by the European Union and with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
2.2 Standards, amendments and interpretations relevant to the Groups operation that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group.
a New standards, amendments and interpretations No new standards, amendments or interpretations, effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2017, have had a material impact on the Group or parent company.
b New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted The following standards and amendments have been published and are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 or later periods, but the Group has not early adopted them.
Unless otherwise indicated, these publications are not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements: IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
This new standard establishes a comprehensive framework for determining core principles for revenue recognition and disclosures.
The guidance permits two methods for adoption, either applying: retrospectively to each prior period or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognised to the date of initial application.
The Group will apply this new standard for the financial reporting period commencing on 1 January 2018 and will apply the modified retrospective method of adoption of this standard.
The Group has performed a detailed analysis of the impact of IFRS 15 by reviewing individually material contracts in relation to both implementation and ODS customers.
The Group does not expect there to be a material impact on the consolidated financial statements under the final issued version of the standard and the latest authoritative guidance.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC 95 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 continued 2.
Accounting policies continued IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
This new standard replaces existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and introduces revised guidance on the classification, recognition, derecognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities as well as a new expected credit losses model for calculating impairment on financial assets.
It also includes new general hedge accounting requirements.
Although the Group is still assessing the potential effect of this new standard, it is not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The Group will apply this new standard for the financial reporting period commencing on 1 January 2018.
IFRS 16 Leases, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
This new standard supersedes IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.
It sets out a comprehensive new set of rules for recognition and measurement of arrangements containing a lease.
Although the Group continues to evaluate the impact of this new standard, it is expected that it will result in the recognition of some of its operating lease commitments as a right to use asset and a corresponding liability.
The Group will apply this new standard for the financial reporting period commencing on 1 January 2019.
2.3 Going concern The Group meets its day to day working capital requirements through its cash reserves.
The Groups forecasts and projections take into account reasonably possible changes in trading performance due to the impact of operational, legal, macro-economic risks or reputational risks.
Having assessed the principal risks, and other matters discussed in the viability statement, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that Alfa has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, being a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report, and therefore they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
2.4 Basis of consolidation The Groups consolidated financial statements include the financial information of Alfa and its subsidiary undertakings.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control.
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

Prior to the Admission, the Group was reorganised to insert Alfa, the new holding company of the Group, by way of a share-forshare exchange with AFSGL, the previous parent company of the Group.
The restructuring has been accounted for as a common control transaction, applying the principle of predecessor accounting ownership.
This policy reflects the economic substance of the transaction and these consolidated financial statements are presented as if Alfa had been the parent company of the Group since the beginning of the earliest period presented.
96 Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information The Group reorganisation also effected the conversion of the A and A1 shares held by an employee trust.
The table below summarises the movements in share capital from incorporation to 1 June 2017, being the date of the reorganisation completing: Shares Ordinary Shares A Shares A1 000s 1 At date of incorporation of Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC 1 2 Share-for-share exchange 2,663,689 91,020 75,689 424,560 3 Capital reduction 263,705,310 9,010,980 7,493,211 424,277 4 Reorganisation of share capital bonus issue 16,238,969 409,254 311,877 17 4 Reorganisation of share capital re-designation of A and A1 shares 17,392,031 9,511,254 7,880,777 300,000,000 300 1 On 6 April 2017, Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC was incorporated with one 0.1 pence ordinary share issued.
2 On 28 April 2017, Alfa was inser ted into the Group above AFSGL as the new holding company by way of the share-for-share exchange agreement.
The exchange was a 1:1 exchange and the nominal value of shares issued was 150.
3 On 3 May 2017, Alfa undertook a capital reduction and ultimately the nominal value of each share was reduced to 0.1 pence.
4 On 1 June 2017, Alfa undertook a bonus issue and share reorganisation to re-designate existing A and A1 shares into ordinary shares.
2.6 Foreign currency Functional currency Items included in the consolidated financial statements of each of the Groups subsidiaries are measured using the currency deemed to be their functional currency.
Previously all subsidiaries were deemed to have a functional currency of pounds sterling as these entities were considered to be operating as an extension of the UK trading subsidiary.
During the year, the functional currency for one of our subsidiaries changed to the local currency due to a change in the underlying contracting method with customers.
Presentation currency The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling.
Alfas functional and presentation currency is the pounds sterling, which is the Groups presentation currency and the currency in which the majority of the Groups transactions are denominated.
Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at the reporting date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.
The average annual rate for the US dollar used was 1.2887 in 2017 2016: 1.3554.
The closing rate for the US dollar used was 1.3493 in 2017 2016: 1.2341.
Critical accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty The preparation of historical financial information requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the reporting date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the period.
The nature of estimation means that the actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
In the process of applying the accounting policies, the Directors have made the following judgements that may have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the historical financial information.
The key assumptions concerning the future, and the other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies 3.1 Revenue recognition As detailed in note 4.2, the Group is required to make an assessment as to whether the implementation process, which includes license, implementation and development revenues streams, forms one performance obligation when assessing how to recognise the software license component.
In doing so the Group assesses each software license contract as to whether the underlying software requires significant modification or customisation by the Group in order to meet the customers requirements and before Alfa Systems can be utilised by the customer.
Where significant modification or customisation is required, the license fee is recognised over the life of the software implementation based on a  method.
Therefore there is judgement required in determining what efforts relate to the implementation process and what efforts could be determined to be additional development and services which are separate from the implementation effort.
In making this judgement, the Group assesses the contractual terms and the original project plan for the implementation but also uses historical evidence of what is core implementation work.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC 97 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 continued 3.
Critical accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty continued 3.2 Internally generated software development As detailed in note 5.1, the Group is required to make an assessment of each ongoing project in order to determine at what stage a project meets the criteria outlined in the Groups accounting policies.
Such assessment may, in certain circumstances, require significant judgement.
In making this judgement, the Group evaluates, amongst other factors, the stage at which technical feasibility has been achieved, managements intention to complete and use or sell the product, the likelihood of success, availability of technical and financial resources to complete the development phase and managements ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the project.
Research and product development expenditure incurred on minor or major upgrades, or other changes in software functionality, does not satisfy the criteria where it is considered that the product is not substantially new in its design or functional characteristics.
Such expenditure is therefore recognised as an expense.
The total research and product development expenses for the period was 14.0 million 2016: 13.6 million and there was nil capitalised development costs in the year 2016: nil.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 3.3 Revenue recognition The Group estimates the percentage of completion, specifically with regards to the total project days remaining to complete the relevant software implementation.
Estimates of total project days required for a relevant implementation are based on historical evidence of past implementations, knowledge of the customers systems being replaced and scope of customisation.
The Group applies the  method when calculating implementation revenues and updates estimates at each quarter end accordingly.
At 31 December 2017 the Group has 4.7 million of deferred license revenue and, if the Groups estimates of project days to complete increased by 10%, this would result in deferred license revenue increasing by 1.0 million, with the increase recognised as a reduction to revenue in the current period, although this would be partially offset by an increase in accrued professional fees.
Segment information 4.1 Segments Operating segments and reporting segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance, has been identified as the Groups Chief Executive Officer CEO.
The CODM regularly reviews the Groups operating results in order to assess performance and to allocate resources.
The CODM considers the business from a product perspective and, therefore, recognises one operating and reporting segment, being the sale of software and related services.
The Group is choosing to present revenue segmentation by type of project and a consolidated adjusted Earnings Before Interest and Taxation Adjusted EBIT measure, as presented to the CODM, as additional information in this note, along with the required entity wide disclosure.
The Group discloses revenue split by type of project: being Software implementation, Ongoing development and services and Maintenance.
There is judgement in relation to which revenue is derived from implementations which include initial implementations and upgrades in comparison to ongoing development and services.
98 Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information 4.2 Revenue The Group derives external revenue from the following sources: 1 software implementation revenue which includes software licenses, software development and other software implementation services: 2 software maintenance help desk and other support services : and 3 ongoing development and support services.
The Group recognises revenue in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
This requires the exercise of judgement and the use of estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of revenue to be recognised in each accounting period.
In exercising such judgement, the Group draws upon guidance from specific software industry revenue recognition practices which comply with IAS 18 Revenue.
Revenue, which excludes value added tax and trade discounts, represents the value of goods and services supplied.
i Software implementation services represents income from perpetual licenses, the cost of software implementation and client specific development efforts, all of which are delivered under a master services agreement.
Long-term software implementation arrangements are accounted for on a  basis, whereby revenue recognised during the period represents the man days effort incurred up to the end of the reporting period as a percentage of the total estimated man days to complete the implementation.
These estimates are continually reevaluated and revised, when necessary, throughout the life of the contract.
Any adjustments to revenue due to changes in estimates are accounted for in the period in which the change in estimates occurs.
Such revenue is recognised when mandays efforts are provided and collection is deemed probable.
Provisions are made for estimated losses on contracts where applicable and such provision would comprise the valuation of the estimated loss until the completion of the work.
ii Maintenance revenue from annual maintenance contracts is recognised on a straight-line basis over the course of the contract, which is generally 12 months.
Revenue is recognised when collection is reasonably assured.
iii Ongoing development and services such services are recognised as revenue as services are delivered.
4.3 Unrealised gains or losses on derivative financial instruments The Group has made an accounting policy election to recognise unrealised gains or losses on derivative financial instruments within revenue, therefore such gains or losses are shown net of revenue where instruments have been entered into match the US dollar denominated projected cash flows.
1.7 million of unrealised gains on derivative financial instruments were recognised in the year ended 31 December 2017 2016: 3.8 million of unrealised losses.
4.4 Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted Earnings The CODM analyses the financial performance of the business on two adjusted profit measures, being adjusted earnings before interest and tax Adjusted EBIT and adjusted earnings Adjusted Earnings.
Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted Earnings are not measures defined by IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure to both Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted Earnings is net income for the relevant period.
Adjusted EBIT Adjusted EBIT is defined as profit from continuing operations before income taxes, finance income, pre-IPO share based compensation and IPO related expenses.
Management utilises this measure to monitor performance as it illustrates the underlying performance of the business by excluding items considered by management not to be reflective of the underlying trading operations of the Group or adding items which are reflective of the overall trading operations, as applicable.
Adjusted Earnings Adjusted Earnings is defined as profit for the period from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the Company, before IPO-related expenses and share based compensation, less the tax effect of these adjustments.
Adjusted Earnings is used by the CODM in measuring profitability because it represents a Group measure of performance which excludes the impact of certain non-cash charges and other charges not associated with the underlying operating performance of the business, while including the effect of items that management believe affect shareholder value and in-year return, such as income tax expense and net finance costs.
Management use Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted Earnings to i provide senior management with a monthly report of operating results that is prepared on an adjusted earnings basis and ii prepare strategic plans and annual budgets on an adjusted earnings basis.
Senior managements annual compensation may also be reviewed, in part, using adjusted performance measures.
In addition, Adjusted Earnings is used for the purposes of calculating diluted Adjusted Earnings per share.
Management uses diluted Adjusted Earnings per share to assess performance on a consistent basis at a per share level.

Operating profit 5.1 Operating profit is calculated after items such as personnel costs including training and recruitment, cost of hardware not capitalised, research and development costs and other infrastructure expenses.
Implementation and Services expenses Such expenses relate to the remuneration of personnel assigned to software implementation services, in addition to project related travel and accommodation expenses and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads.
Research and product development expenses The Group invests a substantial part of its time in research and product development work in relation to the enhancement of its product platform and capabilities.
Research and product development work is charged to the client where it is linked to specific client projects such as initial software implementations.
The Groups research and product development costs include the remuneration costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads.
Internally generated research and product development costs only qualify for capitalisation if the Group can demonstrate all of the following: The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale, its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it: Its ability to use or sell the intangible asset: how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits: The existence of a market or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset: The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset: Its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during development.
Generally, commercial viability of new products, modules or capabilities is not proven until all high risk development issues have been resolved through testing in the marketplace.
Development expenditure incurred on minor or major upgrades, or other changes in software functionality, does not satisfy the criteria, where it is considered that the product is not substantially new in its design or functional characteristics.
See note 3.2 for further discussion.
The Group continues to assess the eligibility of development costs for capitalisation on a project by project basis.
All other operating costs are recorded through Sales, general and administrative expenses.
5.2 Leases, where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor, are classified as operating leases.
Various buildings, machinery and equipment from third parties are leased under operating lease agreements.
Under such operating lease agreements, the total lease payments are recognised as rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement, and are included in Sales, general and administrative expenses, reflecting the nature of the leased assets.
Lease incentives received to enter into an operating lease are credited to the consolidated income statement, to reduce the lease expense, on a straight-line basis, over the period of the lease.
The Groups property lease in respect of its London headquarters has a lease term of 10 years with an additional five-years extension.
The following items have been included in arriving at operating profit: 000s 2017 2016 Personnel, external consultants, training and recruitment expenses 32,641 29,490 Other personnel related expenses 1,912 1,314 Advertising, sponsorship and marketing expenses 855 793 Depreciation note 10 495 437 Property expenses 1,857 1,929 Travel expenses 4,057 2,589 IT expenses 1,241 721 Professional advisor expenses 4,772 1,797 Foreign currency differences 1,100 1,251 Share based payment expense note 20 4,400 16,200 Other 680 206 The Group also incurred 14.0 million 2016: 13.6 million in research and product development expenditure of which 12.1 million 2016: 11.9 million is included in personnel costs, external consultants, training and recruitment expenses.

There were no non-audit related services provided after Admission on 1 June 2017.
Employees and Directors Employee benefits The Group provides a range of benefits to employees, including paid holiday arrangements and defined contribution pension plans.
Short term benefits including health cover and other similar non-monetary benefits, are recognised as an expense in the period in which the service is received.
Pensions The Group operates various defined contribution plans for its employees.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan where the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate independent entity.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to the employees service in the current and prior periods.
Share based payment expense is recognised in line with the accounting policy in note 20.

Income tax expense Taxation expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax recognised in the reporting period.
Tax is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
In this case tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.
i Current tax The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the Groups subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
ii Deferred tax Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of Alfa by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share For the periods presented, the ordinary shares which are held in an employee trust on behalf of employees are treated as having a potentially dilutive effect as these shares have service conditions attaching to them.
Should the service conditions not be met, the shares will be forfeited.
The shares have no right to voting or to dividends while held in trust.
Diluted Adjusted Earnings per share, is defined as Adjusted Earnings, as reconciled in note 4, divided by the weighted average number of shares issued and outstanding, diluted.
As a result of the Group reorganisation as detailed in note 2.5, the basic and diluted earnings per share metrics, actual and adjusted, are calculated with reference to the share structure of the new parent company, as if it has been the parent for all periods presented.

Property, plant and equipment 10.1 Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the item.
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straightline method to allocate their cost over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Furniture and fittings 3-10 years IT equipment 3-5 years Motor vehicles 10 years, or over life of the lease.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if necessary at each reporting date.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Any gains or losses on disposals are recognised within Sales, general and administrative expenses in the income statement unless otherwise specified.
10.2 Impairment, finite lived non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC 105 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 continued 10.
Goodwill Goodwill arose on the acquisition of subsidiaries by AFSGL in 2012 as part of a Group reorganisation and represents the excess of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the investment over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
The carrying amount is allocated to the cash-generating unit CGU that is expected to benefit from investment and which represents the lowest level at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The carrying value of the CGU is then compared to the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
Any impairment attributed to the goodwill is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
000s 2017 2016 Cost At 1 January 24,737 24,737 At 31 December 24,737 24,737 Impairment of goodwill The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment on an annual basis in accordance with the accounting policy stated above.
The Group has one CGU, being the Group, as its geographical operations do not have separate or distinct cash inflows.
The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections based on financial budgets for a five-year period using a discount rate of 10%.
Cash flows beyond these periods have been extrapolated using a steady 2% average growth rate in both the US and Europe.
This growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the markets in which the Group operates.
106 Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Budgeted cash flow projections are based on the expectation of signing new customers in the Groups sales pipeline as well as ongoing projects or additional ODS projects with existing customers.
Budgeted gross margin is based on historical evidence and the expectations of market development and efficiency leverage.
Management believes that any reasonable change in any of the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based would not cause the reported carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount of the CGU.
The discount rate represents the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for tax effect to determine the pre-tax rate as required by IFRS.
Management believes that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based would not cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount.
At 31 December 2017 and 2016 the carrying amount of the goodwill was 24.7 million.
Amounts owed by related parties Amounts owed by the Parent, as defined in note 24, were settled during the year ended 31 December 2017 2016: 27.0 million.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
An impairment loss is recognised when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable.
The amount of the impairment charge is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The impairment loss is recognised in the income statement within Sales, general and administrative expenses.
Subsequent recoveries are credited in the same account previously used to recognise the impairment charge.
As the total carrying amount of the current portion of the trade and other receivables is due within the next 12 months after the reporting date, the impact of applying the effective interest method is not significant and, therefore, the carrying amount equals the contractual amount or the fair value initially recognised.
Accrued income represents fees earned but not yet invoiced at the reporting date.
Amounts owed by related parties are unsecured, bearing interest at 2% above base rate and repayable on maturity, being 17-20 years.

The credit qualities of these receivables are periodically assessed by reference to external credit ratings if available or to historical information about their default rates.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.

Trade and other payables current liabilities Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services which have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised costs using the effective interest rate method.
Deferred revenue includes license or annual maintenance amounts invoiced in advance and subsequently recognised as revenue in line with the percentage of completion of the software implementation process.
Amounts owed to related parties are unsecured, non-interest bearing and repayable on demand.
Trade and other payables are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
As the total carrying amount is due within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date, the impact of applying the effective interest method is not significant and, therefore, the carrying amount equals the contractual amount or the fair value initially recognised.
Accounts payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less.
If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
When the effect of the time value is material, provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
A provision for onerous leases is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived from a lease are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract.
The onerous lease provision comprises future rent and rate expenses in relation to a vacated property.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

The final lease payment was made in September 2016, at which point the provision was utilised in full.
Dilapidation provisions are made for expected future expenditure of the Alfa headquarters at Moor Place in London in accordance with lease obligations and are based on the Groups best estimate of the likely committed cash outflow.
These costs are expected to be incurred at the end of the lease.
Financial assets and liabilities including financial instruments 17.1 Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group becomes party to the contractual provision of the instrument.
17.2 Financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables or as available-for-sale financial assets.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Management determines the classification at initial recognition.
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date, being the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
All financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not subsequently reported at fair value through profit or loss, transactions costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.
Subsequent measurement Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading.
A financial asset is classified in this category if it is: Acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing it in the near-term: A derivative not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.
They are subsequently measured at fair value and the resulting gains or losses are presented in profit or loss within Revenue.
FVTPL financial assets are classified as current assets.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting date.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents notes 13 and 14.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, except for the current portion where the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
The effective interest income is recognised in profit or loss within Finance income.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability and allocating the interest income or expense over the relevant periods.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows including all fees on points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets, other than those measured at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset has been impacted.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is directly reduced by the impairment loss for all financial assets carried at amortised costs with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount may be reduced through the use of an allowance account note 13.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC 109 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 continued 17.
Financial assets and liabilities including financial instruments continued 17.3 Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of financial liabilities measured at amortised costs, net of directly attributable costs.
Subsequent measurement Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are financial liabilities held for trading.
A financial liability is classified as held for trading if it is: Acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing it in the near-term: A derivative not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost such liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The resulting discounted interest charge is recognised in profit or loss within Finance costs.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
17.4 Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value at each reporting date.
The method of recognising the gains and losses depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the hedged item.
The Group designates derivatives as held for trading.
While providing effective economic hedges under the Groups risk management policies, certain derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments according to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
They are classified as held for trading and the changes in the fair value are immediately recognised within Revenue.
Related cash-flows are reported as cash flows from investing activities.
Derivatives not designated for hedge accounting are classified as a current asset or liability.
Fair value measurement The Group measures certain financial instruments at fair value.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability: or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal market or the most advantageous market must be accessible to or by the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the Groups consolidated financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, as follows: Level 1 inputs: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 inputs: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: Level 3 inputs: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The Groups policy is to recognise transfers into and out of fair value hierarchy levels at the end of the reporting period when the event or change in circumstances occurred.
Fair values of financial instruments For the following financial assets and liabilities : trade and other payables excluding tax and social security, trade and other receivables excluding prepayments and accrued income, short-term bank deposits, cash at bank and in hand and other financial liabilities, the carrying value amount approximates the fair value of the instrument.
The Group has 0.1 million of foreign currency financial instruments assets outstanding at 31 December 2017 2016: 4.0 million liability.
The Group uses Level 2 inputs for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments.
See note 22.2 for settlement profiles of such instruments.

Unremitted earnings totalled 4.0 million at 31 December 2017 2016: 3.2 million.
Called up share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

No additional shares have been issued or cancelled after 1 June 2017.
Share based compensation Share based payment arrangements where the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share based payment transactions.
The grant date fair value of awards granted to any Director or employee is recognised as an associated expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that any Director or employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the awards.
The fair value of the awards granted is measured using the Black-Scholes valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were granted.
The Group granted 91,020 Ordinary A shares and 75,689 Ordinary A1 shares to employees in 2014 and 2015, which were subsequently fair valued when a listing event became probable in the fourth quarter of 2016.
The share based compensation charge in relation to these grants has been recognised in full as at Admission and the charge in the year ended 31 December 2017 was 4.4million.
Dividends Dividends are recognised through equity when approved by Alfas shareholders or on payment, whichever is earlier.
In February and May 2017, dividends of 31.5 million and 29.2 million were declared and paid to the ultimate parent company 2016: 1.0 million.

Financial risk management 22.1 Financial risk factors The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk and price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management policy focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the finance function under policies approved by the Chief Financial Officer CFO.
The finance function identifies, evaluates and mitigates financial risks when deemed necessary.
Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies, primarily with respect to those described below.
Revenue is predominantly denominated in pounds sterling and US dollar.
Operating costs are influenced by the currencies of the countries where the Groups subsidiaries are based and the pounds sterling and the US dollar are the currencies most significantly influencing operating costs.
Foreign exchange risk arises from: Forecasted revenue and costs denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency: and Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency.
The policy of the Group is to hedge committed and highly probable forecasted foreign currency operational transactions.
The Group uses foreign exchange forwards for this purpose.
At any point in time, the Groups policy is to mitigate the next 12 months of future cash flows in foreign currency.
The Group uses forward contracts as hedging instruments.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding commercial foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2017 and 2016 were as follows: 2017 2017 2016 2016 Forward exchange contracts notional $000s 000s $000s 000s USD 9,000 6,726 41,000 29,014 Hedge accounting is not applied and therefore the mark-to-market impact is recorded net of revenue as disclosed in note 4.3.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the impact of these derivatives was an unrealised gain of 1.7 million 2016: loss of 3.8 million as the US dollar depreciated against pounds sterling in 2017 compared to 31 December 2016.
The offsetting loss related to the forecasted revenue is not visible due to the sales not yet being recorded in the books of the Group as a significant amount of US dollar denominated revenue is in relation to license and maintenance which are recognised rateably in the income statement.
As the US dollar appreciates against pounds sterling, the derivative contracts entered into with financial institutions have a negative mark-to-market.
The Groups financial derivative counterparties require margin call should its mark-to-market exceed a pre-agreed contractual limit.
In order to protect from the potential margin calls for significant market movements, the Group holds a liquidity buffer in cash and monitors margin requirements on a daily basis for adverse movements in the US dollar versus pounds sterling.
At 31 December 2017 and 2016, the margin requirement related to foreign exchange hedges was nil and 0.5 million respectively.
A 10% movement in the USD GBP exchange rate in the year ended 31 December 2017 would impact revenue and operating profit excluding share based payments by 5% and 9% respectively.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.
The Group is exposed to credit risk with financial institutions and other parties as a result of cash at bank, cash deposits, mark-to-market on derivative transactions and customer trade receivables arising from the Groups operating activities.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial asset.
The Group does not generally hold any collateral as security.
i Credit risk related to transactions with financial institutions Credit risk with financial institutions is managed by the Groups finance function in accordance with a Board approved policy.
Management is not aware of any significant risks associated with financial institutions as a result of cash and cash equivalents deposits including short-term investments and financial derivative transactions.
All financial counterparties where assets held are over 250,000 are AA rated or above as per Parent ratings from Moodys Investor Services.
ii Credit risks related to customer trade receivables Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, change of strategy and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable could be impaired.
Given the complexity, the size and the length of certain software implementation of service-related projects, a delay in the settlement of an open trade receivable does not constitute objective evidence that the trade receivable is impaired.
112 Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information The Group has a relatively diverse customer base geographically and by industry.
The responsibility for customer credit risk management rests with management of the Group.
Payment terms are set in accordance with practices in the different geographies and end-markets served, typically being 30 days from the date of the invoice.
Trade receivables are actively monitored and managed.
Collection risk is mitigated through the use of upfront payments of licenses and maintenance.
Historically, there has been a very low level of customer default as a result of long history of dealing with the Groups customer base and an active credit monitoring function.
Where applicable, credit limits may be established based on internal or external rating criteria, which take into account such factors as the financial condition of the customers, their credit history and the risk associated with their industry segment.
See note 13 Trade and other receivables for the ageing of trade receivables.
22.2 Capital risk management and liquidity The Groups principal objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents note 14 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk through short and long-term forecasts and by seeking to align the maturity profiles of its financial assets with its financial liabilities.
The Groups policy is to maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet its liabilities expected to be settled in the short or near term, under both normal and stressed conditions.
The following table details the remaining contractual maturity of the Groups derivative and non-derivative financial liabilities.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
