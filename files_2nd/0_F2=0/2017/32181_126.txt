Accounts Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2017 15 Post-employment benefits 15a Group The group operates a number of post-employment retirement and medical benefit plans around the world, the forms of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
The retirement plans in the UK, US and other countries include both defined contribution and defined benefit plans.
For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee and the investment returns on those contributions prior to retirement.
The group also makes payments to employees personal pension plans.
For defined benefit plans, which include final salary, career average and other types of plans with committed pension payments, the retirement benefits are based on factors such as the employees pensionable salary and length of service.
The majority of the groups final salary and career average defined benefit retirement plans are now closed to new entrants but remain open to ongoing accrual for current members.
The groups principal defined benefit retirement plans are funded through separate fiduciary or trustee administered funds that are independent of the sponsoring company.
The contributions paid to these arrangements are jointly agreed by the sponsoring company and the relevant trustee or fiduciary body after each funding valuation and in consultation with independent qualified actuaries.
The plans assets together with the agreed funding contributions should be sufficient to meet the plans future pension obligations.
The groups principal post-employment medical plans are in the UK and US and are unfunded arrangements that have been closed to new entrants for over ten years.
Regulatory framework and governance The UK pension plan, the Johnson Matthey Employees Pension Scheme JMEPS, is a registered arrangement and established under trust law and, as such, is subject to UK pension, tax and trust legislation.
It is managed by a corporate trustee, JMEPS Trustees Limited.
The trustee board includes representatives appointed by both the parent company and employees and includes an independent chairman.
Although the parent company bears the financial cost of the plan, the trustee directors are responsible for the overall management and governance of JMEPS, including compliance with all applicable legislation and regulations.
The trustee directors are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and to set certain policies: to manage the day to day administration of the benefits: and to set the plans investment strategy following consultation with the parent company.
UK pensions are regulated by the Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website: www.
The US pension plans are qualified pension arrangements and are subject to the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Pension Protection Act 2006 and the Department of Labor and Internal Revenue.
The plans are managed by a pension committee which acts as the fiduciary and, as such, is ultimately responsible for the management of the plans investments: compliance with all applicable legislation and regulations: and overseeing the general management of the plans.
Other trustee or fiduciary arrangements that have similar responsibilities and obligations are in place for the groups other funded defined benefit pension plans outside of the UK and US.
Benefits The UK pension plan is segregated into two sections a legacy section which provides final salary and career average pension benefits and a cash balance section.
The final salary element of the legacy section was closed to future accrual of benefits from 1st April 2010 and the career average element of the legacy section was closed to new entrants on 1st October 2012 but remains open to future accrual for existing members.
All new entrants join the cash balance section of the plan.
The legacy section provides benefits to members in the form of a set level of pension payable for life based on the members length of service and final pensionable salary at retirement or averaged over their career with the parent company.
The benefits attract inflation-related increases both before and after retirement.
The cash balance section provides benefits to members at the point of retirement in the form of a cash lump sum.
The benefits attract inflation-related increases before retirement but following the payment of the retirement lump sum benefit the plan has no obligation to pay any further benefits to the member.
The group operates two defined benefit pension plans in the US.
The hourly pension plan is for unionised employees and provides a fixed retirement benefit for life based upon years of service.
The salaried pension plan provides retirement benefits for life based on the members length of service and final pensionable salary averaged over the last five years.
The salaried plan benefits attract inflation-related increases before leaving but are non-increasing thereafter.
On retirement, members in either plan have the option to take the cash value of their benefit instead of a lifetime annuity in which case the plan has no obligation to pay any further benefits to the member.
The US salaried pension plan was closed to new entrants on 1st September 2013 but remains open to future accrual for existing members.
All new non-unionised US employees now join a defined contribution plan.
143 Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2017 15 Post-employment benefits continued 15a Group continued Funding UK legislation requires that pension plans are funded prudently and that when undertaking a funding valuation every three years assets are taken at their market value and the liabilities are determined based on a set of prudent assumptions set by the trustee following consultation with their appointed actuary.
The assumptions used for funding valuations may therefore differ to the actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 accounting purposes.
The last funding valuation of JMEPS was carried out as at 1st April 2015.
This valuation showed that there was a deficit of 69 million in the legacy section of the plan, or 28 million after taking account of the future additional deficit funding contributions from the special purpose vehicle SPV set up in January 2013.
To address the deficit, the parent company agreed to continue to make deficit contributions of 23.1 million per year up to 31st December 2019.
The valuation also revealed a surplus of 2 million in the defined benefit cash balance section.
The SPV was set up to provide additional deficit reduction contributions and to provide greater security to the trustee.
The group invested 50.0 million in a bond portfolio which is beneficially held by the SPV.
The income generated by the SPV is used to make annual distributions of 3.5 million to JMEPS for a period of up to 25 years.
These annual distributions are only payable if the legacy section of JMEPS continues to be in deficit.
This bond portfolio is held as a non-current available-for-sale investment note 21 and the groups liability to pay the income to the plan is not a plan asset under IAS 19, although it is for actuarial funding valuation purposes.
The SPV is exempt from the requirement to prepare audited annual accounts as it is included on a consolidated basis in these accounts.
In accordance with the governing documentation of JMEPS, any future plan surplus would be returned to the parent company by way of a refund assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the plan.
As such, there are no adjustments required in respect of IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
The last annual review of the US defined benefit pension plans was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 1st July 2016 which showed a surplus of US $2.2 million.
The assumptions used for funding valuations may differ to the actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 accounting purposes.
Similar funding valuations are undertaken on the groups other defined benefit pension plans outside of the UK and US in accordance with prevailing local legislation.
Risk management The group is exposed to a number of risks relating to its post-retirement pension plans, the most significant of which are: Risk Mitigation Market investment risk Asset returns may not move in line with the The groups various plans have highly diversified investment portfolios, investing in a liabilities and may be subject to volatility.
wide range of assets that provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security could have a material adverse impact on the plan.
A fide-risking strategy is in place to reduce volatility in the plans as a result of the mismatch between the assets and liabilities.
As the funding level of the plans improve and hit pre-agreed triggers, plan investments are switched from return seeking assets to liability matching assets.
The plans also implement partial currency hedging on their overseas assets to mitigate currency risk.
Interest rate discount rate risk Liabilities are sensitive to movements in bond The groups defined benefit plans hold a high proportion of their assets in government yields interest rates, with lower interest rates or corporate bonds, which provide a natural hedge against falling interest rates.

Inflation risk Liabilities are sensitive to movements in Where plan benefits provide inflation-related increases, the plan holds some inflation-linked inflation, with higher inflation leading to an assets which provide a natural hedge against higher than expected inflation increases.
increase in the valuation of liabilities.
In the UK, this inflation hedge is extended by the use of inflation rate swaps.
The swaps are held with several banks to reduce counterparty risk.
Longevity risk The majority of the groups defined benefit The group has closed most of its defined benefit pension plans to new entrants replacing plans provide benefits for the life of the them with either a cash balance plan or defined contribution plans, both of which are member, so the liabilities are sensitive to unaffected by life expectancy.
life expectancy, with increases in life For the plans where a benefit for life continues to be payable, prudent mortality expectancy leading to an increase in the assumptions are used that appropriately allow for a future improvement in life valuation of liabilities.
These assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis to minimise the risk of using an inappropriate assumption.

Accounts Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2017 15 Post-employment benefits continued 15a Group continued Financial assumptions Qualified independent actuaries have updated the funding valuations under IAS 19 of the groups major defined benefit plans to 31st March 2017.
The assumptions used are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long term nature of the plans, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The main financial assumptions used were: 2017 2017 2017 2016 2016 2016 UK plans US plans Other plans UK plans US plans Other plans %% % % % % First 2016: first 2 year's rate of increase in salaries 3.10 3.00 2.59 3.00 3.00 2.50 Ultimate rate of increase in salaries 3.85 3.00 2.59 3.75 3.00 2.50 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.05 1.12 2.90 1.05 Discount rate 2.60 4.10 2.15 3.70 4.00 2.43 Inflation 2.20 1.61 2.20 1.53 UK RPI 3.10 3.00 UK CPI 2.10 2.20 Current medical benefits cost trend rate 5.40 2.95 5.40 6.90 Ultimate medical benets cost trend rate 5.40 2.95 5.40 4.50 Demographic assumptions The mortality assumptions are based on country-specific mortality tables and where appropriate include an allowance for future improvements in life expectancy.
In addition, where credible data exists, actual plan experience is taken into account.
The groups most substantial pension liabilities are in the UK and the US where, using the mortality tables adopted, the expected future lifetime of average members currently at age 65 and average members at age 65 in 25 years time i. e. members who are currently aged 40 years is respectively: Currently age 65 Age 65 in 25 years UK plan US plans UK plan US plans Male 21.6 21.4 23.8 23.5 Female 24.2 23.4 26.5 25.4 Sensitivities The calculations of the defined benefit obligations are sensitive to the assumptions used.
The following summarises the estimated impact of a change in the assumption on the groups main plans while holding all other assumptions constant.
This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another.
A 0.1% change in the discount rate and rate of increase in salaries would have the following increases decreases on the pension plans defined benefit obligations at 31st March 2017: 0.1% increase 0.1% decrease UK plan US plans UK plan US plans million million million million Effect of discount rate 36.7 4.0 37.7 4.2 Effect of inflation 35.4 34.5 Effect of rate of increase in salaries 2.9 1.2 3.0 1.1 A one year increase in life expectancy would have the following increase on: UK plan US plans million million Pension defined benefit obligation 61.1 5.4 A 1% point change in the assumed medical cost trend rates would have the following increase decrease on: 1% point increase 1% point decrease UK plan US plan UK plan US plan million million million million Post-retirement medical plan defined benefit obligation 1.3 1.1 145 Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2017 15 Post-employment benefits continued 15a Group continued Estimated effect on future cash flows It is estimated that the group will contribute about 70 million to the post-employment defined benefits plans during the year ending 31st March 2018.
The maturity profile of the defined benefit obligations will also affect future cash flows.

The assets for the cash balance section of the UK plan are held separately from the assets of the legacy section.
At 31st March 2017 the defined benefit obligation related to the contributory cash balance section was 32.7 million and the fair value of the plan assets was 32.3 million.
Past service costs in the UK pension plan were pension enhancements for eligible employees who have been made redundant.
A past service credit arose in the US post-retirement medical benefits plan due to plan amendments capping the groups contribution towards medical coverage by limiting the increase in medical inflation to a cost of living increase and giving retirees a choice between the current Platinum plan and a Gold plan.
