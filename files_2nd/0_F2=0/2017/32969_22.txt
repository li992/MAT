FINANCIAL REPORT FINANCIAL REPORT Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies A summary of the principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year, is set out below.
a Basis of accounting i Statement of compliance The consolidated accounts have been prepared and approved in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRS, interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Standards Committee, applicable legal and regulatory requirements of the Companies Guernsey Law, 2008 and the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
The consolidated accounts give a true and fair view and are also in compliance with the Companies Guernsey Law, 2008 as amended.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for investment trust companies issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in November 2014 and updated in January 2017 is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the Directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP.
ii Basis of preparation The consolidated accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis and adopt the historical cost basis, except for investment property and derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value.
The notes and financial statements are presented in pounds sterling being the functional currency of the Company and presentational currency for the Company and the Group and are rounded to the nearest thousand except where otherwise indicated.
iii Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenue and expenses during the period.
The nature of the estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
Significant estimates and assumptions are made in the valuation of the investment properties held.
Further information on the valuation, market risk and sensitivity to market changes are provided in notes 1f, 8 and 16. iv Going concern After making enquiries, and bearing in mind the nature of the Companys business and assets, the Directors consider that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the next twelve months.
In assessing the going concern basis of accounting the Directors have had regard to the guidance issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
They have considered the current cash position of the Group, forecast rental income and other forecast cash flows.
The Group has agreements relating to its borrowing facilities with which it has complied during the year.
Based on this information the Directors believe that the Group has the ability to meet its financial obligations as they fall due for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the accounts.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
v Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except that the following new standards have been adopted in the current year: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses Amendment to IAS 12 Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to IAS 7, and Annual improvements 2014 2016 cycle vi New standards and interpretations not yet adopted A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except the following set out below: IFRS 9, Financial instruments, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities.
The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014 and was endorsed by the EU on 2 November 2016.
It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through Other Comprehensive Income OCI and fair value through P&L.
The basis of classification depends on the entity's business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in OCI with no recycling.
Report and Accounts 2017 | 49 F&C COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 1.
Accounting policies continued a Basis of accounting continued There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39.
For financial liabilities, there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in a companys own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss.
IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests.
It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the hedged ratio to be the same as the one management actually uses for risk management purposes.
Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39.
The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The Directors have assessed the requirements of IFRS 9 and determine that there will be no material impact on the accounting for available-for-sale financial assets and derivatives.
IFRS 15, 'Revenue from contracts with customers' deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entitys contracts with customers.
Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service.
The standard replaces IAS 18, 'Revenue' and IAS 11, 'Construction contracts' and related interpretations.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier application is permitted.
The Directors have assessed the requirements of IFRS 15 and determine that there will be no material impact on the provision of services and management income that fall under the scope of IFRS 15.
IFRS 16, Leases was issued in January 2016 and was endorsed by the EU on 31 October 2017.
For lessees, it will result in almost all leases being recognised on the statement of financial position, as the distinction between operating and finance leases will be removed.
Under the new standard, an asset the right to use the leased item and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised.
The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases.
The accounting for lessors will not significantly change.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier application is permitted.
The Directors have assessed the requirements of IFRS 16 and determine that there will be no material impact on its current accounting practices.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year.
Subsidiaries are those entities, including special purpose entities, controlled by the Company.
An investor controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Business combinations the Group acquires subsidiaries that own real estate.
At the time of acquisition, the Group considers whether each acquisition represents an acquisition of a business or an acquisition of an asset.
The Group accounts for an acquisition as a business combination where an integrated set of activities is acquired together with the property.
More specifically, the following criteria, which indicate the acquisition of a business, are considered: the number of properties acquired, the extent to which strategic management processes and operational processes are acquired and the complexity of the processes acquired.
When the acquisition of subsidiaries does not represent a business, it is accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets and liabilities.
The cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their relative fair values, and no goodwill or deferred tax is recognised.
On the acquisition of subsidiaries and operations that do not constitute a business, the acquisition consideration is allocated between the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values on the acquisition date without attributing any amount to goodwill or deferred taxes.
Non-controlling interests, if any, participate at their relative share of the fair value of the net identifiable assets on the acquisition date.
Directly attributable costs are recognised as part of the acquisition cost.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The acquisition is recognised at the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
50 | F&C Commercial Property Trust Limited FINANCIAL REPORT FINANCIAL REPORT 1.
Accounting policies continued b Basis of consolidation continued When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions at the acquisition date.
This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest is remeasured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
All contingent consideration arrangements classified as assets or liabilities arising from a business combination should be subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss whether or not they fall within the scope of IAS 39.
Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
c Revenue recognition Rental income, excluding VAT, arising on investment properties is accounted for in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term of ongoing leases.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.
Surrender premiums received by the Group following the break of a lease are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income to the extent that there are no obligations directly related to that surrender.
Distribution income received from any indirect property fund is recognised on the date the Group becomes entitled to the distribution and recorded separately from any unrealised or realised gains or losses on revaluation of indirect property funds.
Interest income is accounted for on an accruals basis.
d Expenses Expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
The Groups investment management and administration fees, finance costs and all other expenses are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
e Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
As the Directors consider the value of the property portfolio is likely to be realised by sale rather than use over time, and that no charge to Guernsey or United Kingdom taxation will arise on capital gains, no provision has been made for deferred tax on valuation uplifts.
f Investment properties Investment properties consist of land and buildings held to earn rental income together with the potential for capital and income growth.
Investment properties are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of consideration given, including associated transaction costs.
Any subsequent capital expenditure incurred in improving investment properties is capitalised in the year during which the expenditure is incurred and included within the book cost of the properties.
After initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and transferred to the Capital Reserve Investments Held.
Fair value is based on valuations provided by Property Valuers, at the balance sheet date using recognised valuation techniques.
For the purposes of these financial statements, in order to prevent double accounting, the assessed fair value provided by Property Valuers is reduced by the carrying amount of any accrued income resulting from the spreading of lease incentives and or minimum lease payments.
This accrued income is separately recorded in the accounts within current assets.
Report and Accounts 2017 | 51 F&C COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 1.
Accounting policies continued f Investment properties continued Techniques used for valuing investment properties The Traditional Method converts anticipated future cash flow benefits in the form of rental income into present value.
This approach requires careful estimation of future benefits and application of investor yield or return requirements.
One approach to value the property on this basis is to capitalise net rental income on the basis of an Initial Yield, generally referred to as the All Risks Yield approach or Net Initial Yield approach.
The Discounted Cash Flow Method involves the projection of a series of periodic cash flows either to an operating property or a development property.
To this projected cash flow series an appropriate market-derived discount rate is applied to establish an indication of the present value of the income stream associated with the property.
The calculated periodic cash flow is typically estimated as gross income less vacancy and collection losses and operating expenses outgoings.
A series of periodic net operating incomes, along with an estimate of the reversion terminal exit value which uses the traditional valuation approach anticipated at the end of the projection period, are discounted to present value.
The aggregate of the net present values equals the market value of the property.
The fair value of investment properties is measured based on each propertys highest and best use from a market participants perspective and considers the potential uses of the property that are physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible.
Investment properties held under finance leases and leased out under operating leases are classified as investment properties and stated at fair value.
On derecognition, realised gains and losses on disposals of investment properties are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and transferred to the Capital Reserve Investments Sold.
Recognition and derecognition occurs on the completion of a sale between a willing buyer and a willing seller.
Any investment properties on which contracts for sale have been exchanged but which had not completed at the period end are disclosed as properties held for sale and stated at fair value.
g Investments Investment of indirect property funds are recognised and derecognised on the trade date where a purchase or sale is under a contract whose terms require delivery within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value.
After initial recognition, investment of indirect property funds are measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and transferred to the Capital Reserve Investments Held.
Financial assets designated as at fair value through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which is either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
Unlisted indirect property funds fair value is determined based on the criteria set out in IAS 39.
On derecognition, realised gains and losses on disposals of investment of indirect property funds are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and transferred to the Capital Reserve Investment Sold.
h Fair value measurement Assets and liabilities within the hierarchy designated as fair value through profit or loss are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Accounting standards recognise a hierarchy of fair value measurements for assets and liabilities within the hierarchy which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3.
The classification within the hierarchy depends on the lowest significant applicable input, as follows: Level 1 Unadjusted, fully accessible and current quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Examples of such instruments would be investments listed or quoted on any recognised stock exchange.
Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, or other directly or indirectly observable inputs which exist for the duration of the period of investment.
Examples of such instruments would be those for which the quoted price has been suspended, forward exchange contracts and certain other derivative instruments.
The interest rate swap entered into hedge the interest on the 50 million bank loan and the forward interest rate swap are included in Level 2.
Level 3 External inputs are unobservable.
Value is the Directors best estimate, based on advice from relevant knowledgeable experts, use of recognised valuation techniques and on assumptions as to what inputs other market participants would apply in pricing the same or similar instrument.
All investments in direct property are included in Level 3.
The Company measures financial instruments, such as investment properties, at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost, if any, are disclosed in note 12.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
52 | F&C Commercial Property Trust Limited FINANCIAL REPORT FINANCIAL REPORT 1.
Accounting policies continued i Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its risk associated with interest rate fluctuations.
The Groups policy is not to trade in derivative instruments.
Derivative instruments are initially recognised in the Balance Sheet at their fair value.
Fair value is determined by a model using market values for similar instruments.
Transaction costs are expensed immediately.
Gains or losses arising on the fair value of effective cash flow hedges in the form of derivative instruments are taken directly to Other Comprehensive Income.
The gains or losses relating to the ineffective position are recognised in operating profit in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
On maturity or early redemption, the unrealised gains or losses arising from effective cash flow hedges in the form of derivative instruments, initially recognised in Other Comprehensive Income, are reclassified to profit or loss.
The Group considers that its interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting when the following criteria are satisfied: The instruments must be related to an asset or liability: They must change the character of the interest rate by converting a variable rate to a fixed rate or vice versa: They must match the principal amounts and maturity dates of the hedged items: and As cash-flow hedges the forecast transactions incurring interest payable on the bank loans that are subject to the hedges must be highly probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect the profit or loss.
The effectiveness of the hedges must be capable of reliable measurement and must be assessed as highly effective on an ongoing basis throughout the financial reporting periods for which the hedges were designated.
j Cash and cash equivalents Cash in banks and short-term deposits are carried at cost.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in hand and short-term deposits in banks with an original maturity of three months or less.
k Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which are generally due for settlement at the relevant quarter end, are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Reverse lease premia and other capital incentives paid to tenants are recognised as current and non-current assets and amortised over the period from the date of lease commencement to the earliest termination date.
l Interest-bearing borrowings All non-current borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being fair value of the consideration received, net of arrangement costs associated with the borrowings.
After initial recognition, all interest-bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any loan arrangement costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
m Segmental information The Board has considered the requirement of IFRS 8 operating segments.
The Board is of the view that the Group is engaged in a single segment of business, being property investment and in one geographical area, the United Kingdom.
n Reserves Share capital Under the Companys Articles of Incorporation, the Company may issue an unlimited number of Ordinary Shares.
Subject to the solvency test contained in the Companies Guernsey Law, 2008 as amended being satisfied, ordinary shareholders are entitled to all dividends declared by the Company and to all of the Companys assets after repayment of its borrowings and ordinary creditors.
Ordinary shareholders have the right to vote at meetings of the Company.
All Ordinary Shares carry equal voting rights.
Special reserve The Special Reserve is distributable reserve to be used for all purposes permitted under Guernsey Law, including the buy back of shares and payment of dividends.
The surplus of net proceeds received from the issue of Ordinary Shares over the nominal value of such shares, is credited to this account subsequent to its initial recognition in the Share Capital account.
Report and Accounts 2017 | 53 F&C COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 1.
Accounting policies continued Capital reserve investments sold The following are accounted for in this reserve: gains and losses on the disposal of investments in indirect property funds and investment properties, including the transfer of any unrealised gains or losses now realised which were previously recognised through Capital Reserve Investments Held.
Capital reserve investments held The following are accounted for in this reserve: increases and decreases in the fair value of investment properties held at the year-end: and increases and decreases in the fair value of any investments in indirect property funds held at the year end.
Hedging reserve Movements relating to the interest rate swap arrangements accounted for as a cash flow hedge are recognised in this reserve.
Revenue reserve Any surplus arising from the net profit on ordinary activities after taxation, after adding back capital gains or losses, is taken to this reserve, with any deficit transferred from the Special Reserve.
Investment Management fee 2017 2016 000 000 base management fee 7,692 5,280 performance fee 1,126 7,692 6,406 Throughout the year the Groups investment manager was F&C Investment Business Limited FCIB, a wholly-owned subsidiary of F&C Asset Management plc.
The property management arrangements of the Group have been delegated by FCIB, with the approval of the Company, to BMO REP Asset Management plc, which is also part of the F&C Asset Management plc group.
The Company and FCIB entered into a revised investment management agreement, to reflect amended fee arrangements, with an effective date from 1 January 2017.
FCIB is entitled to a base management fee of 0.55 per cent per annum of the Groups gross assets reduced to 0.525 per cent per annum on assets between 1.5 billion and 2 billion and 0.5 per cent per annum in excess of 2 billion and reduced to 0.25 per cent per annum on cash net of gearing in excess of 5 per cent of net assets, payable quarterly in arrears.
FCIB is not entitled to a performance fee.
In the prior year FCIB was entitled to a base management fee of 0.50 per cent per annum of the Groups net assets and reduced to 0.25 per cent per annum on cash net of gearing in excess of 5 per cent of net assets, payable quarterly in arrears.
The fees of any managing agents appointed by the investment managers was payable out of the management fee with the exception of managing agents fees on residential properties which was paid for by the Company.
In the prior year FCIB was also entitled to a performance fee equal to 20 per cent of the amount by which the total return whether positive or negative on the directly held properties exceeded 110 per cent of the total return 90 per cent if the total return was negative on the benchmark and multiplied by the Groups average total assets excluding any indirect property holdings.
The benchmark for measuring the comparative performance of directly held properties was the total return from the MSCI IPD Quarterly Universe.
The performance fee payable in each financial year was capped at an amount which, when taken with the aggregate base management fee payable in each financial year, equalled 0.60 per cent of the gross assets of the Group.
The investment management agreement may be terminated by either party by giving not less than six months notice.
The agreement may be terminated earlier by the Company provided that a payment in lieu of notice, equivalent to the amount FCIB would otherwise have received during the notice period, is made.

An annual fee of 1,200 per company was paid to the States of Guernsey in respect of this exemption.
No charge to Guernsey taxation will arise on capital gains.
The Directors conduct the Groups affairs such that management and control is not exercised in the United Kingdom and so that neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries carries on any trade in the United Kingdom.
Accordingly, the Company and its subsidiaries will not be liable for United Kingdom taxation on their income or gains other than certain income deriving from a United Kingdom source.
The Group had unutilised tax losses carried forward of 5,554,000 2016: 6,090,000 at 31 December 2017.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised on this amount as it is uncertain that there will be taxable profits arising within the relevant subsidiary from which the future reversal of the deferred tax asset could be deducted.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to United Kingdom income tax on income arising on the property portfolio after deduction of its allowable debt financing costs and other allowable expenses.

All the Groups investment properties were valued as at 31 December 2017 by RICS Registered Valuers working for the company CBRE Limited CBRE, commercial real estate advisors, acting in the capacity of a valuation adviser to the AIFM.
All such valuers are Chartered Surveyors, being members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS.
CBRE completed the valuation of the Groups investment properties at 31 December 2017 on a fair value basis and in accordance with The RICS Valuation Professional Standards UK January 2017.
The CBRE valuation report is dated 19 January 2018 the Valuation Report.
Fair value is defined by IFRS 13 as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
CBRE has been carrying out valuations for the Group for a continuous period since December 2011.
CBRE also values properties held by other companies for which the F&C Asset Management plc group is also the investment manager.
CBRE provides, and has provided in the past, ad hoc investment and occupational agency advice, landlord and tenant and building consultancy advice to members of the F&C Asset Management plc group.
The proportion of total fees payable by the F&C Asset Management plc group to the total fee income of CBRE was less than 5 per cent of total UK revenues.
The property valuer is independent and external to the Group.
The property valuer takes account of deleterious materials included in the construction of the investment properties in arriving at its estimate of fair value, when the Managers advise the presence of such materials.
All leasehold properties are carried at fair value rather than amortised over the term of the lease.
The same valuation criteria are therefore applied to leasehold as freehold properties.
All leasehold properties have more than 60 years remaining on the lease term.
The Group has entered into leases on its property portfolio as lessor see note 18 for further information.
All of the properties per fair value band are shown on page 27.
58 | F&C Commercial Property Trust Limited FINANCIAL REPORT FINANCIAL REPORT 8.
Investment properties continued There are no restrictions on the realisability of the Groups investment properties or on the remittance of income or proceeds of disposal.
However, the Groups investments comprise UK commercial property, which may be difficult to realise as described in Liquidity Risk in note 16.
Other than the capital commitments disclosed in note 17, the Group is under no contractual obligations to purchase, construct or develop any investment property.
The majority of leases are on a full repairing basis and, as such, the Group is not liable for costs in respect of repairs, maintenance or enhancements to those investment properties.
All investment properties are categorised as Level 3 fair values as they use significant unobservable inputs.
There have not been any transfers between Levels during the year.
Investment properties have been classed according to their real estate sector.
Information on these significant unobservable inputs per class of investment property is disclosed below: 2017 2016 Valuation Valuation Significant 2017 Weighted 2016 Weighted Sector 000 Technique Assumption Range Average Range Average Retail 407,550 All Risks Yield Current Rental 2016: 382,975 Value per square foot psf per annum 23 - 102 46 23 - 107 50 Estimated Rental Value psf per annum 22 - 120 63 22 - 118 64 Net Initial Yield 2.6% - 5.4% 3.2% 2.6% - 5.3% 3.4% Equivalent Yield 2.9% - 5.2% 3.9% 2.9% - 5.3% 3.9% Estimated Capital Value psf 404 - 3,600 1,725 399 - 3,789 1,721 Retail 218,850 All Risks Yield Current Rental Warehouse 2016: 218,055 Value psf per annum 14 - 30 26 14 - 30 24 Estimated Rental Value psf per annum 12 - 29 25 13 - 29 25 Net Initial Yield 4.6% - 7.0% 5.3% 3.3% - 6.8% 4.4% Equivalent Yield 4.8% - 6.9% 5.2% 3.2% - 6.5% 4.6% Estimated Capital Value psf 193 - 547 467 193 - 526 460 Office 513,562 All Risks Yield Current Rental 2016: 469,375 Value psf per annum 0 - 83 25 0 - 81 32 Estimated Rental Value psf per annum 15 - 102 47 15 - 105 40 Net Initial Yield 0% - 6.7% 4.2% 0% - 13.0% 4.2% Equivalent Yield 3.8% - 8.9% 5.7% 4.0% - 8.7% 5.9% Estimated Capital Value psf 139 - 2,045 854 134- 1,847 775 Industrial, 278,650 All Risks Yield Current Rental logistics 2016: 252,050 Value psf per annum 2 - 14 7 3 - 14 7 and other Estimated Rental Value psf per annum 4 - 15 7 4 - 15 7 Net Initial Yield 4.3% - 6.8% 5.2% 3.3% - 7.8% 5.4% Equivalent Yield 4.8% - 10.4% 5.6% 4.8% - 10.4% 5.9% Estimated Capital Value psf 79 - 307 139 74 - 294 129 The ranges are based on averages per property and include properties which were vacant at the date of valuation.

Report and Accounts 2017 | 59 F&C COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 8.
Investment properties continued For the majority of properties, the fair value was determined by using the market comparable method.
This means that valuations performed by CBRE are based on inputs determined from active markets, adjusted for differences in the nature, location or condition of the specific property.
Most valuations are based on net initial yield, although equivalent yield may also be taken into consideration.
Where properties are vacant at the date of valuation a comparable capital value per square foot is used.
In determining the net initial yield, or capital value per square foot, the valuers may have regard to the terms of any existing lease including current rental values, lease length and covenant strength, along with assumptions regarding estimated rental values, rental growth rates, vacancy rates and void or rent free periods expected after the end of each lease.
Sensitivity analysis The valuations of investment properties are sensitive to changes in the assumed significant unobservable inputs.
A significant increase decrease in estimated rental values in isolation would result in a significantly higher lower fair value of the properties.
A significant increase decrease in the all risks yield in isolation would result in a significantly lower higher fair value.
There are interrelationships between the yields and passing rental values as they are partially determined by market rate conditions.
The sensitivity of the valuation to changes in the most significant inputs per class of investment property are shown below: Industrial, Estimated movement in fair value Retail Logistics of investment properties at Retail Warehouses Offices and other Total 31 December 2017 arising from: 000 000 000 000 000 Increase in passing rental value by 5% 20,378 10,943 25,678 13,933 70,932 Decrease in passing rental value by 5% 20,378 10,943 25,678 13,933 70,932 Increase in net initial yield by 0.25% 29,799 9,903 28,771 12,875 81,348 Decrease in net initial yield by 0.25% 34,903 10,889 32,402 14,185 92,379 Industrial, Estimated movement in fair value Retail Logistics of investment properties at Retail Warehouses Offices and other Total 31 December 2016 arising from: 000 000 000 000 000 Increase in passing rental value by 5% 19,149 10,903 23,469 12,603 66,124 Decrease in passing rental value by 5% 19,149 10,903 23,469 12,603 66,124 Increase in net initial yield by 0.25% 26,387 11,635 26,475 11,133 75,630 Decrease in net initial yield by 0.25% 30,604 13,025 29,842 12,211 85,682 This represents the Groups best estimate of a reasonable possible shift in passing rental values and net initial yield, having regard to historical volatility of the value and yield.

The transaction was conducted by L&Gs lending arm, LGIM Commercial Lending Limited.
The loan has a maturity date of 31 December 2024.
Interest is payable on this loan from the commitment date, quarterly in arrears, at a fixed rate of 3.32 per cent per annum for the duration of the loan.
The loan is secured by means of a fixed and floating charge over the whole of the assets of the Secured Group which, at 31 December 2017, comprised FCPT Holdings Limited, F&C Commercial Property Holdings Limited and Winchester Burma Limited see Note 19.
Under the financial covenants related to this loan, the Group has to ensure that for the Secured Group: the loan to value percentage does not exceed 50 per cent: the interest cover is greater than 1.50 times on any calculation date: Report and Accounts 2017 | 61 F&C COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 12.
Interest-bearing loans and interest rate swap continued 260 million L&G loan continued the sector weightings measured by market value do not exceed the following percentages of the gross secured asset value: Industrial: 40 per cent: Offices: 60 per cent: Retail: 40 per cent: Retail Warehouses: 40 per cent: Other: 25 per cent: the combined holding in London and the South East of England exceeds a minimum of 40 per cent of gross secured asset value: the combined holding in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, North East of England and Yorkshire and Humberside does not exceed a maximum of 30 per cent of gross secured asset value: and the five largest tenants do not exceed 40 per cent of the aggregate net rental income from all of the secured properties.
The Secured Group has complied with all the applicable L&G loan covenants during the year.
The fair value of the interest-bearing L&G loan as at 31 December 2017, based on the yield on the Treasury 2.75% 2024 which would be used as the basis for calculating the early repayment of such loan plus the appropriate margin would be 292,234,000 2016: 294,459,000.
The exercise of early repayment approximates the carrying amount of the loan.
Secured Group loan is classified as Level 2 under the hierarchy of fair value measurement.
100 million Barclays loan On 21 June 2016, the Group amended the financing arrangements with Barclays Bank PLC Barclays in respect of its 50 million term loan facility which was repayable 28 June 2017.
The amended arrangements extend the repayment date of the 50 million term loan facility to 21 June 2021 and changed the maximum loan to value percentage to 50 per cent from 60 per cent.
The Group has agreed an additional revolving credit facility of 50 million with Barclays over the same period, which was not drawn down as at 31 December 2017 2016: nil but utilised during the year.
The combined loan arrangement costs for the term and revolving loan facility was 1,022,000.
Interest accrues on the new bank loan at a variable rate, based on 3 month LIBOR plus margin and is payable quarterly.
The margin is 1.50 per cent per annum for the duration of the loan.
The revolving credit facility pays an undrawn commitment fee of 0.60 per cent per annum.
The bank loan is secured by the way of a fixed and floating charge over the whole of the assets of SCP Estate Holdings Limited and SCP Estate Limited the SCP Group, whose assets consist of the properties held at St. Christophers Place Estate, London W1.
The SCP Group has complied with all the applicable Barclays loan covenants during the year.
On 21 June 2016, the Group terminated its existing interest rate hedging arrangements with Barclays at a cost of 1,283,000.
On the same day, the Group entered into a new 50 million interest rate swap in connection with the extended Barclays term facility.
The hedge has been achieved by matching the notional amount of the swap with the loan principal and matching the swap term to the loan term.
Interest on the swap is receivable at a variable rate calculated on the same LIBOR basis as for the bank loan as detailed above but excluding the margin and payable quarterly at a fixed rate of 1.022 per cent per annum.
This fixes the interest rate for the 50 million term loan at 2.522 per cent.
The interest rate swap is due to expire on 21 June 2021.
The fair value of the liability in respect of the new interest rate swap contract at 31 December 2017 was 260,000 2016: 717,000, which is based on the marked to market value.
The interest rate swap is classified as Level 2 under the hierarchy of fair value measurements.

Share capital and capital risk management continued Under the Companys Articles of Incorporation, the Company may issue an unlimited number of Ordinary Shares.
The Company issued nil Ordinary Shares during the year 2016: nil raising net proceeds of nil 2016: nil.
The Company did not repurchase any Ordinary Shares during the year 2016: nil.
At 31 December 2017, the Company did not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury 2016: nil.
Transfer to Special reserve The Share Premium reserve was the surplus of net proceeds received from the issue of new shares over the par value of such shares.
As at 31 December 2017, the Share Premium reserve is cancelled and the balance credited to the Special reserve.
The Reverse Acquisition reserve was created as a result of the Group reconstruction in July 2009 to reflect the differences arising between the total of the issued share capital including the Capital Redemption reserve immediately before and after the reconstruction.
As at 31 December 2017, the Reserve Acquisition reserve is cancelled and the balance credited to the Special reserve.
The transfer and cancellation of these reserves are permitted under Guernsey Law.
Capital risk management The Groups capital is represented by the Ordinary Shares, Special Reserve, Capital Reserve-Investments Sold, Capital ReserveInvestments Held, Hedging Reserve and Revenue Reserve.
The Group is not subject to any externally-imposed capital requirements.
The objective of the Company is to provide ordinary shareholders with an attractive level of income together with the potential for income and capital growth from investing in a diversified UK commercial property portfolio.
In pursuing this objective, the Board has responsibility for ensuring the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
This involves the ability to issue and buy back share capital within limits set by shareholders in a general meeting: borrow monies in the short and long term: and pay dividends out of reserves all of which are considered and approved by the Board on a regular basis.
Dividends are set out in note 6 to the accounts and borrowings are set out in note 12.
The capital of the Group is managed in accordance with its investment policy, in pursuit of its investment objective, which is detailed in the Business Model and Strategy on page 11.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, issue new shares, manage the Groups discount to net asset value and monitor the Groups gearing level.
No changes were made to the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 December 2017 or 31 December 2016.
Net asset value per share The Groups net asset value per Ordinary Share of 141.2p 2016: 135.5p is based on equity shareholders funds of 1,128,650,000 2016: 1,083,445,000 and on 799,366,108 2016: 799,366,108 Ordinary Shares, being the number of shares in issue at the year end.
Related party transactions The Directors are considered to be the Groups key management personnel.
No Director has an interest in any transactions which are, or were, unusual in their nature or significant to the nature of the Group.
Directors shareholdings in the Ordinary Shares of the Company are provided in the Remuneration Report on page 38.
The Directors of the Company received fees for their services.
Further details are provided in the Directors Emoluments for the Year table in the Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 38.
No fees remained payable at the year end.
Transactions between the Company and the Manager are detailed in note 2 on management fees and note 11 on fees owed to the Manager at the balance sheet date.
The existence of an independent Board of Directors demonstrates that the Company is free to pursue its own financial and operating policies and therefore, under the AIC SORP, the Manager is not considered to be a related party.
Financial instruments and investment properties The Companys investment objective is to provide ordinary shareholders with an attractive level of income together with the potential for capital and income growth from investing in a diversified UK commercial property portfolio.
Consistent with that objective, the Group holds UK commercial property investments.
In addition, the Groups financial instruments during the year comprised interest-bearing loans, cash and receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations.
The Group does not have exposure to any derivative instruments other than the interest rate swap entered into to hedge the interest paid on the Barclays interest-bearing bank loan.
The Group is exposed to various types of risk that are associated with financial instruments.
The most important types are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and market price risk.
There is no foreign currency risk as all assets and liabilities of the Group are maintained in pounds sterling.
Report and Accounts 2017 | 63 F&C COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 16.
Financial instruments and investment properties continued The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing the Groups risk exposure.
These policies are summarised below and have remained unchanged for the year under review.
These disclosures include, where appropriate, consideration of the Groups investment properties which, whilst not constituting financial instruments as defined by IFRS, are considered by the Board to be integral to the Groups overall risk exposure.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
In the event of default by an occupational tenant, the Group will suffer a rental shortfall and incur additional costs, including legal expenses, in maintaining, insuring and re-letting the property.
The Board receives regular reports on concentrations of risk and any tenants in arrears.
The Managers monitor such reports in order to anticipate, and minimise the impact of, defaults by occupational tenants.
The Group has a diversified tenant portfolio.
The maximum credit risk from the rent receivables of the Group at 31 December 2017 was 742,000 2016: 1,198,000.
The maximum credit risk is stated after deducting a bad debt provision of 67,000 2016: 133,000.
As at 31 December 2017, rent receivable of 67,000 that was greater than three months overdue was fully provided for.
Of this amount nil was subsequently written off and 10,000 has been recovered.
As at 31 December 2016 the provision was 133,000.
Of this amount 53,000 was subsequently written off, nil is still outstanding and 80,000 was recovered.
Apart from the rent receivable disclosed above there were no financial assets which were either past due or considered impaired at 31 December 2017 2016: nil.
All of the Groups cash is placed with financial institutions with a long-term credit rating of A or better.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of such financial institutions may cause the Groups ability to access cash placed on deposit to be delayed or limited.
Should the credit quality or the financial position of the banks currently employed significantly deteriorate, cash holdings would be moved to another bank.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter in realising assets or otherwise raising funds to meet financial commitments.
The Groups investments comprise UK commercial property.
Property and property-related assets in which the Group invests are not traded in an organised public market and may be illiquid.
As a result, the Group may not be able to liquidate quickly its investments in these properties at an amount close to their fair value in order to meet its liquidity requirements.
The Groups liquidity risk is managed on an ongoing basis by the Managers and monitored on a quarterly basis by the Board.
In order to mitigate liquidity risk, the Group aims to have sufficient cash balances including the expected proceeds of any property sales to meet its obligations for a period of at least twelve months.
At the reporting date, the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities were on a contractual maturity basis : Within More than one year 12 years 35 years 5 years Total Financial assets 000 000 000 000 000 As at 31 December 2017 Cash and cash equivalents 35,156 35,156 Cash deposits held for tenants 508 357 701 754 2,320 Rents receivable 742 742 As at 31 December 2016 Cash and cash equivalents 85,021 85,021 Cash deposits held for tenants 959 313 565 687 2,524 Rents receivable 1,198 1,198 64 | F&C Commercial Property Trust Limited FINANCIAL REPORT FINANCIAL REPORT 16.

The exact amount attributable to each of the interest-bearing 50 million bank loan and the related interest rate swap will vary depending on the rate of 3 month LIBOR over the instruments duration.
The terms of both the interest-bearing bank loan and the interest rate swap are detailed in note 12.
In certain circumstances, the terms of the Groups interest-bearing loans entitle the lender to require early repayment and, in such circumstances, the Groups ability to maintain dividend levels and the net asset value attributable to the Ordinary Shares could be adversely affected.
Interest rate risk Some of the Groups financial instruments are interest-bearing.
They are a mix of both fixed and variable rate instruments with differing maturities.
As a consequence, the Group is exposed to interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing market rate.
The Groups exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to its long-term debt obligations.
Interest rate risk on long-term debt obligations is managed by fixing the interest rate on such borrowings, either directly or through interest rate swaps for the same notional value and duration.
Long-term debt obligations and the interest rate risk they confer to the Group is considered by the Board on a quarterly basis.
Long-term debt obligations consist of a 260 million L&G loan on which the rate has been fixed at 3.32 per cent until the maturity date of 31 December 2024.
The Group also has a 50 million Barclays loan on which the rate has been fixed through an interest rate swap at 2.522 per cent per annum until the maturity date of 21 June 2021.
The Group has agreed an additional revolving credit facility of 50 million with Barclays over the same period, which was not drawn down as at 31 December 2017.
The following table sets out the carrying amount of the Groups financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk: Assets Weighted liabilities Weighted average where no average period for Fixed Variable interest is interest which rate Total rate rate received rate is fixed Type 000 000 000 000 % years As at 31 December 2017 Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 35,156 10,013 25,143 0.3 Cash deposits held for tenants 2,320 2,320 Rents receivable 742 742 Financial liabilities L&G loan 258,029 258,029 3.32 7.0 Barclays loan and interest rate swap 49,906 49,646 260 2.52 3.5 Report and Accounts 2017 | 65 F&C COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 16.

Considering the effect on the L&G loan at 31 December 2017, it is estimated that an increase of 150 basis points in interest rates would have decreased its fair value by approximately 25,831,000 2016: 29,110,000, and a decrease of 150 basis points would have increased its fair value by approximately 28,966,000 2016: 33,087,000.
Considering the effect on the 50 million Barclays loan and related interest rate swap combined, it is estimated that an increase of 150 basis points in interest rates as at the balance sheet date would have decreased their fair value by approximately 2,405,000 2016: 3,067,000, and a decrease of 150 basis points would have increased their fair value by approximately 2,567,000 2016: 3,320,000.
The carrying value of the interest rate swap liability in the financial statements would have been adjusted by these amounts, thereby increasing decreasing net assets and income for the year.
When the Group retains cash balances, they are ordinarily held on interest-bearing deposit accounts.
The benchmark which determines the interest income received on interest-bearing cash balances is the bank base rate of the Bank of England which was 0.50 per cent as at 31 December 2017 2016: 0.25 per cent.
The Companys policy is to hold cash in variable rate or short-term fixed rate bank accounts and not usually in fixed rate securities with a term greater than three months.
Considering the effect on cash balances, an increase of 150 basis points in interest rates would have increased net assets and income for the year by 527,000 2016: 1,275,000.
A decrease of 150 basis points would have had an equal but opposite effect.
The calculations are based on the cash balances at the respective balance sheet dates.
Market price risk The Groups strategy for the management of market price risk is driven by the investment policy as outlined within the Business Model and Strategy on page 11.
The management of market price risk is part of the investment management process and is typical of commercial property investment.
The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse valuation movements through detailed and continuing analysis, with an objective of maximising overall returns to shareholders.
Investments in property and property-related assets are inherently difficult to value due to the individual nature of each property.
As a result, valuations are subject to substantial uncertainty.
There is no assurance that the estimates resulting from the valuation process will reflect the actual sales price even where such sales occur shortly after the valuation date.
Such risk is minimised through the appointment of external property valuers.
The basis of valuation of the property portfolio is set out in detail in the accounting policies and note 8.
Any changes in market conditions will directly affect the profit or loss reported through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Details of the Groups investment property portfolio held at the balance sheet date are disclosed on page 27.
A 10 per cent increase in the fair value of the direct properties at 31 December 2017 would have increased net assets and income for the year by 141,862,000 2016: 132,246,000.
A decrease of 10 per cent would have had an equal but opposite effect.
The calculations above are based on the investment property valuations at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
Capital commitments The Group had capital commitments totalling 6,800,000 as at 31 December 2017 2016: 4,271,000.
These commitments related mainly to contracted development work at the Group property at Cassini House, London SW1.

Lease length The Group leases out its investment properties under operating leases.
The total future income based on the unexpired lessor lease length at the year end was as follows based on annual rentals : 2017 2016 000 000 Less than one year 60,455 55,278 Between two and five years 221,233 195,660 Over five years 262,310 228,884 Total 543,998 479,822 The largest single tenant at the year end accounted for 6.2 per cent 2016: 4.3 per cent of the current annual rental income.
Unoccupied property expressed as a percentage of estimated total rental value excluding properties under development was 6.9 per cent 2016: 6.9 per cent at the year end.
The Group has entered into commercial property leases on its investment property portfolio.
