Strategic Report 1.2 Chief Executive Officers Report 1 Over the past five years, we have laid the foundations to significantly improve returns and grow value.
Andrew Mackenzie Chief Executive Officer Dear Shareholder, To meet the challenges of today, we must think in decades and generations.
BHPs ability to plan, work and invest for the long term has always been our competitive advantage.
Over the past five years, we have laid the foundations to significantly improve returns and grow value.
The benefits of this deliberate path are clear in our FY2017 results.
Safety is, and always will be, our highest priority.
In the last 12 months, tragically, two of our colleagues died at work one at our Escondida mine in Chile in October 2016 and one at the Goonyella Riverside mine in Australia in August 2017.
I offer my sincere condolences to the families, friends and colleagues of the two team members who lost their lives.
The most important job our people have, myself included, is to make sure our team goes home safe at the end of each day.
While our safety performance has improved in terms of total recordable injury frequency down to 4.2 per million hours worked, we have renewed our efforts to help our people understand the risks and critical controls that must be in place to protect the health and safety of everyone who works with BHP.
Our new five-year sustainability performance targets came into effect 1 July 2017.
These targets are a public statement to our stakeholders about our commitment to sustainability and are consistent with our commitment to the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
They are also at the heart of how we work at BHP we are determined to make a positive difference through our performance.
Our FY2017 financial and operational results were strong.
All our operated assets were free cash flow positive and delivered a total free cash flow of US$12.6 billion.
We used this cash to strengthen the balance sheet and return US$4.4 billion to you, our shareholders.
We have achieved a great deal over the past year, but we will not stand still.
We are committed to maximising cash flow, maintaining capital discipline and improving value and returns.
We will deliver consistent and transparent application of our capital allocation framework, which includes cash returns to shareholders.
Our strong performance in FY2017 was achieved thanks to the hard work and passion of the people of BHP.
It is a testament to what we can all achieve when we come together as a team of teams.
We know that the most diverse teams are those who perform the best our data tells us this.
Thats why we were proud to announce at last years Annual General Meetings our aspirational goal to achieve gender balance by FY2025.
BHP has made great progress in 12 months, but we know we still have a long way to go.
The past financial year has taught us many things, but especially this the world needs people who think boldly, think creatively and bring the best of themselves to what they do.
It needs people who think big.
For corporations like BHP, it is up to us to shape change for the better, through innovation, productivity and technology.
It is our responsibility to have a voice and be transparent.
Thank you to our people, shareholders, suppliers, customers and host communities who work with us.
Together, we work to improve the lives of millions of people across the world and drive global economic growth.
I also extend my thanks to outgoing Chairman Jac Nasser, who has been a source of strength and leadership for BHP, and to me personally, over the last decade.
His remarkable legacy and contribution will be felt for years to come.
BHP is well-positioned for the future with our incoming Chairman, Ken MacKenzie.
Together with the Board, I look forward to FY2018 and beyond as we grow shareholder value and increase returns.

BHP Annual Report 2017 15 Strategic Report Governance at BHP Remuneration Report Directors Report Financial Statements Additional information Shareholder information 1.5 Our strategy Our strategy is to own and operate large, long-life, low-cost, expandable, upstream assets diversified by commodity, geography and market.
Our plan to grow value Consistent with our strategy, we have a plan to create long-term shareholder value.
This plan is focused on six key areas: We have a six point plan to grow value Cost efficiencies Since FY2012, we have reduced unit costs across BHP by more than 40 per cent.
Our simple focused on portfolio, standardised systems and greater connectivity across our assets and commodities, 1 further gains position us to further improve productivity.
Latent capacity We have further opportunities to optimise and debottleneck our existing mine, rig, port, rail and attractive returns, processing facilities.
That means we can get more production, or replace production, from our 2 1 limited risk existing infrastructure for lower cost.
For example, we plan to increase capacity at our Western Australia Iron Ore asset during FY2019 to a record 290 million tonnes per annum, by improving our rail signalling system and better utilising our equipment and infrastructure.
This will help make full use of the port, rail network and mines weve already built.
Major projects We have a pipeline of potential growth projects that could create significant shareholder value timed for value over the long term, in particular in conventional oil, copper and coal.
This includes the Mad Dog 3 and returns Phase 2 project, which has the potential capacity to produce up to 140,000 gross barrels of crude oil per day, and the Spence Growth Option.
In the first 10 years of operation, incremental production from the Spence Growth Option is expected to be approximately 185 ktpa of payable copper in concentrate and 4 ktpa of payable molybdenum, with first production scheduled for the 2021 financial year.
We are also continuing to investigate one of the best undeveloped potash resources in the world in Jansen in Canada.
There are many ways we could realise the value of this project, but Board approval will be sought only if the project passes our strict investment hurdles and is in the best interests of our shareholders.
Exploration We are focused on finding new oil and copper deposits through targeted exploration.
Production positive results of these commodities is declining, while demand is forecast to increase.
Exploration is the lowest 4 reduce risk for cost way to add these resources to the portfolio, and investing now means we can take advantage future wells of lower exploration costs.
We recently had positive drilling results at Wildling in the US Gulf of Mexico following the discovery of oil in multiple horizons.
Together with the successful bid for Trion and positive drilling results in the Caribbean, this provides us with additional confidence.
Technology We will continue to develop and introduce new technology that increases efficiency, improves improves safety, safety, and unlocks resource.
Our diverse portfolio enables us to adapt technology developed 5 lowers cost and for one commodity to other areas of our business: for example, a tool that has been developed unlocks resource for assaying iron ore is now being trialled for use in our copper assets.
Onshore US Our regular portfolio review has concluded that the Onshore US assets are non-core and we are value and flexibility pursuing options to exit our quality acreage.
This will take time, which we will use productively to 6 maximise the value of our acreage through disciplined development, larger completions, acreage swaps, gas hedging and divestments.

1 Focus areas Three critical focus areas underpin our strategy: safety, culture and productivity.
Safety We achieve nothing if we do not do it safely.
We seek to prioritise the health and safety of our people, our host communities and the environment.
We know that we can never take the safety of our people for granted.
We reassess our safety risks and controls regularly.
If anything changes for example, new technology is developed, new risks emerge or we gather new information, then we adapt our approach as needed to make sure our people are as safe as possible.
The performance of all of our people is measured by how safe our workplaces are.
We have a goal of zero fatalities, and our total recordable injury frequency TRIF is a key performance indicator throughout BHP.
For more information on our approach to safety and our safety performance, see section 1.10.3 and our Sustainability Report 2017 at bhp.
Culture We focus on our culture as it enables performance.
We believe it is important for every employee to understand how their work contributes to achieving our strategy, work in an environment where its safe to speak up and be able to take up their full accountability.
Our Employee Perception Survey EPS results serve to guide us on areas where we have performed well, and areas that require further attention.
In FY2017, our leaders put in place tailored plans to increase care and trusted relationships within our teams attributes we have identified as critical in making the most of our Operating Model.
These plans include local and BHP-wide priorities, including new leadership development programs focused on the identification and realisation of value and the management of risk.
This work builds on years of investment in developing our leaders capabilities to engage and develop their teams and to lead change.
For more information on our culture and the actions we are taking to support it, see section 1.9.
Productivity We have achieved significant productivity gains in recent years, helping us to produce our resources at significantly lower cost and achieve strong cash flows, even while commodity prices were low.
There is considerable value still to come from our assets and initiatives across BHP.
The simplicity of our portfolio, the scale and quality of our ore bodies and oil and gas fields and our standardised systems and processes are all important attributes.
When combined with a newly streamlined corporate structure, and centres of excellence in maintenance, projects and geoscience, we are well positioned to reduce costs and improve production even further.
For more on productivity, see section 1.6.

Assessment and monitoring For information on our risk management governance, refer to sections 2.13.1 and 2.14.
We review our strategy against a constantly changing external environment, to capture and manage emerging risks and opportunities and cascade them through our planning processes.
Long-term scenario planning is used to evaluate our portfolio of assets and to help us identify new opportunities and test the robustness of our strategy over a range of possible outcomes.
We also use signals tracking to monitor near-term trends and events that may give an early indication of threats and opportunities identified from evaluating the long-term scenarios.
Signals also support actions to position BHP to mitigate or benefit from these threats and opportunities, while helping to inform major portfolio investment decisions.

18 BHP Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report 1 Capital management Our Capital Allocation Framework aims to maximise the potential value of every dollar we earn for our shareholders.
We start by aiming to earn as much as we can through the safe and productive operation of our assets.
We then put this capital to work to: maintain our plant and equipment to enable safe and efficient operations over the long term: keep our balance sheet strong, to give us stability and flexibility through good times and tough times: reward our shareholders by paying out at least 50 per cent of our Underlying attributable profit in dividends at every period.
We then look at what would be the most valuable use for any excess capital that remains after these three priorities are met, and decide whether to: further reduce our debt: return more cash to shareholders through additional dividends or share buy-backs: invest in growth, either through projects within our assets or through exploration or acquisitions, provided it will create more value than a share buy-back.
This disciplined and rigorous approach helps us to maximise the value of every dollar for our shareholders.

30 BHP Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report 1 Global long-term outlook We anticipate ongoing increases in global living standards over the longer term, with urbanisation, industrialisation and trade expected to underpin commodity demand.
The development of emerging economies in South and South East Asia should drive particular demand for industrial metals, energy and fertilisers.
Key geographies Our customers are geographically diverse.
We have structured our business to flexibly meet changing demands as global market dynamics shift.
Developments in a particular country can affect the demand for our products in that country and in any countries that supply goods for import to that country.
China is the largest consumer of our commodities, with 49 per cent of our revenues being derived from China.
China is the largest manufacturing and exporting economy in the world and the second-largest importing economy, so its performance is also a significant factor in the health of the global economic system.
Chinas GDP growth in the short term is expected to remain steady.
Growth is expected to slow modestly in FY2018, while remaining within the official GDP target range of between 6.5 and 7.0 per cent.
We expect to see a cooling of growth rates in the housing and automobile markets, while infrastructure investment is expected to provide stability as overall growth slows.
Chinas policymakers are likely to continue to seek a balance between the pursuit of reform and the maintenance of macroeconomic and financial stability.
We expect a continuation of current efforts to reduce debt and deal with housing inflation.
In the long term, Chinas economic growth is expected to slow progressively as the working age population falls and the capital stock matures, with productivity reforms offsetting these impacts to some degree.
Chinas economic structure is expected to continue to move from industry to services and growth drivers will shift from investment and exports towards consumption.
This structural change is likely to produce a less-volatile underlying growth rhythm in the long run.
As both a major producer and consumer of our products, the United States is important to our performance.
As most of our transactions are denominated in US dollars, fluctuations in that currency can also influence our performance.
The medium-term outlook for the US economy is uncertain.
Consumer confidence and spending are expected to remain strong, but a slowdown in the automotive and housing sectors may impact demand.
Strong currency and higher interests rates may also reduce demand.
Progress on growth enhancing infrastructure spending and tax reform has been slow and monetary conditions are expected to tighten further.
Protectionist policies would cut consumer purchasing power and productivity growth.
Purchasing power is reduced through higher prices for imported goods and domestic goods with imported components.
Reduced competition and the unintended consequences of restrictive migration policies on the free flow of world-class talent would dent productivity growth.
Japans demographics ageing population and extremely low birth rate and its public debt burden are constraints on long-term growth.
Without population, immigration and microeconomic reform, growth is likely to stagnate.
In the short to medium term, with monetary and fiscal policy proving ineffective at spurring domestic demand, any sustained lift in Japanese growth is likely to have to come from external sources.
Europes short-term outlook has improved, with most countries in the region now experiencing growth in domestic demand.
While financial fragilities remain, downside risks have been reduced.
Significant microeconomic reform is required in Europes southern regions to prevent longer run stagnation.
In the more internationally competitive northern regions, lower savings rates would boost growth at home and help to rebalance demand within the common currency zone.
Indias short-term outlook is solid, driven by consumer demand.
Economic reform that boosts the supply of basic infrastructure is critical to Indias ability to take advantage of its demographic profile and successfully urbanise.
Progress on key reforms, including GST, real estate regulation and demonetisation of high denomination bills has been encouraging.
We expect Indias GDP growth to average more than seven per cent annually over FY2016FY2020, with energy and metals demand rising at a similar pace.

2 Exploration The world has abundant potential resources but they are increasingly difficult to find and, for many resources, demand is increasing.
For example, we estimate that demand for petroleum will increase by one per cent per year, while world production is expected to decline by three to four per cent per year by 2035.

Identifying new deposits will be more difficult and expensive than in the past, but the rewards if we get it right will be correspondingly greater.
BHP is investing in geoscience excellence as a core skill and fundamental value driver for our business.
Drawing on our petroleum liquids expertise, we have developed a systems approach to exploration that considers the whole earth system tectonics, erosion, sedimentation, climate and more in deep time, to determine where deposits are most likely to have formed.
From this, we can determine which areas to target for further investigation and development.
This approach gives us more confidence in the potential of targeted areas, earlier, at lower cost.
We have the potential to gain early mover advantage in undervalued regions, and better target our exploration and development spend to create value.
Driven by our Geoscience Centre of Excellence, the systems approach is already delivering results.
We brought together an expert team of geoscientists from across our petroleum and copper assets, and reviewed our model for targeting copper exploration.
From approximately 3,000 land-based sedimentary basins worldwide identified by our Petroleum business, we have selected around 200 with potential to contain copper deposits, and determined which to further investigate.
As further data is collected, the certainty of finding a significant deposit improves.

Our usual policy is to sell our products price shifts and impacts at the prevailing market prices.
The diversity provided by our relatively broad portfolio of commodities of ongoing global economic does not necessarily insulate BHP from the effects of price changes.
Fluctuations in commodity prices volatility may negatively can occur due to price shifts reflecting underlying global economic and geopolitical factors, industry affect our results, including demand, increased supply due to the development of new productive resources or increased production cash flows and asset values from existing resources, technological change, product substitution and national tariffs.
We are particularly exposed to price movements in minerals, oil and gas.
For example, a US$1 per tonne decline in the average iron ore price and US$1 per barrel decline in the average oil price would have an estimated impact on FY2017 Profit after taxation from Continuing and Discontinued operations of US$142 million and US$48 million, respectively.
For more information in relation to commodity price impacts, refer to section 1.6.
Volatility in global economic growth, particularly in developing economies, has the potential to adversely affect future demand and prices for commodities.
The impact of sustained price shifts and short-term price volatility, including the effects of unwinding the sustained monetary stimulus in the United States, and uncertainty surrounding the details of the United Kingdoms exit from the European Union, creates the risk that our financial and operating results, including cash flows and asset values, will be materially and adversely affected by shortor long-term volatility in the prevailing prices of our products.
Our financial results may The geographic diversity of the countries in which our assets are located means that our assets, be negatively affected by earnings and cash flows are influenced by a variety of currencies.
Fluctuations in the exchange rates exchange rate fluctuations of those currencies may have a significant impact on our financial results.
The US dollar is the currency in which the majority of our sales are denominated and the currency in which we present our financial performance.
Operating costs are influenced by the currencies of those countries where our assets and facilities are located and also by those currencies in which the costs of imported equipment and services are determined.
Reduction in Chinese The Chinese market has been driving global materials demand and pricing over the past decade.

A continued slowing in Chinas economic growth and demand could result in lower prices for our products and materially and adversely impact our results, including cash flows.
34 BHP Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report External risks 1 Actions by governments, There are varying degrees of political, judicial and commercial stability and activism in the locations regulation, political, in which we have operated and non-operated assets around the globe.
At the same time, our exposure community or social to emerging markets may involve additional risks that could have an adverse effect on the profitability events, judicial or of an operation.
Risks in the locations in which we have operated and non-operated assets could include community activism or terrorism, civil unrest, judicial activism, community challenge or opposition, regulatory investigation, unrest in the countries nationalisation, protectionism, renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts, leases, permits where our assets are or other agreements, imposts, controls or prohibitions on the production or use of certain products, located could have restrictions on repatriation of earnings or capital and changes in laws and policy, as well as other a negative impact unforeseeable risks.
Risks relating to bribery and corruption, including possible delays or disruption on our business resulting from a refusal to make so-called facilitation payments, may be prevalent in some of the countries where our assets are located.
If any of our major assets are affected by one or more of these risks, it could have a material adverse effect on our assets in those countries, as well as BHPs overall operating results, financial condition and prospects.
Our operated and non-operated assets are based on material long-term investments that are dependent on long-term fiscal stability and could be adversely affected by changes in fiscal legislation, changes in interpretation of fiscal legislation, periodic challenges and disagreements with tax authorities and legal proceedings relating to fiscal matters.
The natural resources industry continues to be regarded as a source of tax revenue and can also be adversely affected by broader fiscal measures applying to businesses generally.
BHP is currently involved in a number of uncertain tax and royalty matters.
For more information, refer to note 5 Income tax expense in section 5.
Our business could be adversely affected by new or evolving government regulations and international standards, such as controls on imports, exports, prices and greenhouse gas emissions.
The nature of the industries in which we conduct business means many of our activities are highly regulated by laws relating to health, safety, environment and community impacts.
Increasing requirements relating to regulatory, environmental, social or community engagement or approvals can potentially result in significant delays or interruptions and may adversely affect the economics of new mining and oil and gas projects, the expansion of existing assets and operations and the performance of our assets.
As regulatory standards and expectations are constantly developing, we may be exposed to increased regulatory review, compliance costs to meet new operating and reporting standards and unforeseen closure and site rehabilitation expenses.
Infrastructure, such as rail, ports, power and water, is critical to our business operations.
We have assets or potential development projects in countries where government-provided infrastructure or regulatory regimes for access to infrastructure, including our own privately operated infrastructure, may be inadequate, uncertain or subject to legislative change.
The impact of climate change may increase competition for, and the regulation of, limited resources, such as power and water.
These factors could materially and adversely affect the expansion of our business and ability of our assets to operate efficiently.
We own assets or interests in countries where land tenure can be uncertain and disputes may arise in relation to ownership and use, including in respect of Indigenous rights.
For example, in Australia, the Native Title Act 1993 provides for the establishment and recognition of native title under certain circumstances.
New or evolving regulations and international standards are complex, difficult to predict and outside our control.
Potential compliance costs, litigation expenses, regulatory delays, rehabilitation expenses and operational impacts and costs arising from government action, regulatory change and evolving standards could materially and adversely affect BHPs future results, prospects and our financial condition.
Business risks Failure to discover or acquire The demand for our products and production from our assets results in existing reserves being new resources, maintain depleted over time.
As our revenues and profits are derived from our oil, gas and minerals assets, reserves or develop new our future results and financial condition are directly related to the success of our exploration and assets could negatively acquisition efforts, and our ability to generate reserves to meet our future production requirements affect our future results at a competitive cost.
Exploration activity occurs adjacent to established assets and in new regions, and financial condition in developed and less-developed countries.
These activities may increase land tenure, infrastructure and related political risks.
A failure in our ability to discover or acquire new resources, maintain reserves or develop new assets or operations in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow the current level of our reserves could negatively affect our results, financial condition and prospects.
Deterioration in commodities pricing may make some existing reserves uneconomic.
Our actual exploration drilling activities and future drilling budget will depend on our inventory size and quality, drilling results, commodity prices, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, lease expirations, land access, transportation pipelines, railroads and other infrastructure constraints, regulatory approvals and other factors.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral and oil and gas reserves.
Geological assumptions about our mineralisation that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available.
Estimates of reserves that will be recovered, or the cost at which we anticipate reserves will be recovered, are based on uncertain assumptions.
The uncertain global financial outlook may affect economic assumptions related to reserve recovery and may require reserve restatements.
Reserve restatements could negatively affect our results and prospects.
BHP Annual Report 2017 35 Strategic Report Governance at BHP Remuneration Report Directors Report Financial Statements Additional information Shareholder information Business risks Potential changes to our We regularly review the composition of our asset portfolio and from time-to-time may add assets portfolio of assets through to, or divest assets from, the portfolio.
There are a number of risks associated with acquisitions acquisitions and divestments or divestments.
These include: may have a material adverse adverse market reaction to such changes or the timing or terms on which changes are made: effect on our future results the imposition of adverse regulatory conditions and obligations: and financial condition commercial objectives not being achieved as expected: unforeseen liabilities arising from changes to the portfolio: sales revenues and operational performance not meeting our expectations: anticipated synergies or cost savings being delayed or not being achieved: inability to retain key staff and transaction-related costs being more than anticipated.
These factors could materially and adversely affect our reputation, future results and financial condition.
Increased costs and Although we devote significant time and resources to our project planning, approval and review processes, many of our development projects are highly complex and rely on factors that are outside schedule delays may adversely affect our our control, which may cause us to underestimate the cost or time required to complete a project.
For instance, incidents or unexpected conditions encountered during development projects may development projects cause setbacks or cost overruns, required licences, permits or authorisations to build a project may be unobtainable at anticipated costs, or may be obtained only after significant delay and market conditions may change, thereby making a project less profitable than initially projected.
In addition, we may fail to develop and manage projects as effectively as we anticipate and unforeseen challenges may emerge.
Any of these may result in increased capital costs and schedule delays at our development projects and materially and adversely affect anticipated financial returns.

Our minerals and oil and gas assets may also be subject to unexpected natural catastrophes such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and tsunamis.
Our Western Australia Iron Ore, Queensland Coal and Gulf of Mexico oil and gas assets are located in areas subject to cyclones or hurricanes.
Our Chilean copper and Peruvian base metals assets are located in a known earthquake and tsunami zone.
Based on our risk management and the limited value of external insurance in the natural resource sector, our risk financing insurance approach is to minimise or not to purchase external insurance for certain risks, including property damage and business interruption, sabotage and terrorism, marine cargo, construction, primary public liability and employee benefits.
Existing business continuity plans may not provide protection for all the costs that arise from such events, including clean-up costs, litigation and other claims.
The impact of these events could lead to disruptions in production, increased costs and loss of facilities.
Where external insurance is purchased, third party claims arising from these events may exceed the limit of liability of the insurance policies we have in place.
Additionally, any uninsured or underinsured losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of assets.

Mining and processing operations remain suspended following the dam failure.
Samarco is currently progressing plans to resume operations: however, significant uncertainties surrounding the nature and timing of any resumption of operations remain, including as a result of Samarcos significant debt obligations.
For financial information relating to Samarco, refer to note 29 Investments accounted for using the equity method in section 5.
BHP Billiton Brasil is among the defendants named in a number of legal proceedings initiated by individuals, non-governmental organisations NGOs, corporations and governmental entities in Brazilian federal and state courts following the Samarco dam failure.
The other defendants include Samarco, Vale and Fundao Renova.
The lawsuits seek various remedies, including rehabilitation costs, compensation to injured individuals and families of the deceased, recovery of personal and property losses, moral damages and injunctive relief.
Among the claims brought against BHP Billiton Brasil is a public civil claim commenced by the Federal Government of Brazil, the states of Esprito Santo and Minas Gerais, and certain other public authorities Brazilian Authorities on 30 November 2015, seeking the establishment of a fund of up to R$20 billion approximately US$6.1 billion in aggregate for clean-up costs and damages and a R$155 billion approximately US$47 billion claim brought by the Federal Public Prosecution Service on 3 May 2016 for reparation, compensation and moral damages in relation to the Samarco dam failure.
Given the status of these proceedings, it is not possible at this time to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential future exposures for BHP Billiton Brasil.
For further details on some of the legal proceedings relating to the Samarco dam failure, refer to section 6.5.
BHP Annual Report 2017 37 Strategic Report Governance at BHP Remuneration Report Directors Report Financial Statements Additional information Shareholder information Operational risks Our potential liability from On 2 March 2016, BHP Billiton Brasil, together with Vale and Samarco, entered into a Framework litigation and other actions Agreement Framework Agreement with the Brazilian Authorities to establish a foundation Fundao resulting from the Samarco Renova that will develop and execute environmental and socio-economic programs to remediate and dam failure are subject to provide compensation for damage caused by the Samarco dam failure.
The Framework Agreement significant uncertainty and was ratified by the Conciliation Chamber of the Federal Court of Appeal in Brasilia on 5 May 2016, cannot be reliably estimated suspending the R$20 billion public civil claim.
However, on 30 June 2016, the Superior Court of Justice at this time, but could have issued a preliminary order Interim Order suspending the 5 May 2016 ratification of the Framework a material adverse impact Agreement and reinstating the R$20 billion public civil claim.
BHP Billiton Brasil, Vale and Samarco on our business continued and the Federal Government have appealed the Interim Order before the Superior Court of Justice.
In light of the significant uncertainties surrounding the nature and timing of ongoing future operations at Samarco and based on currently available information, at 30 June 2017, BHP recognised a provision of US$1.1 billion, before tax and after discounting 30 June 2016, US$1.2 billion, in respect of BHP Billiton Brasils obligations under the Framework Agreement.
The measurement of the provision requires the use of estimates and assumptions and may be affected by, among other factors, potential changes in scope of work and funding amounts required under the Framework Agreement including further technical analysis required under the Preliminary Agreement referred to below, the outcome of the ongoing negotiations with Federal Prosecutors, costs incurred in respect of programs delivered, resolution of uncertainty in respect of operational restart, updates to discount and foreign exchange rates, resolution of existing and potential legal claims and the status of the Framework Agreement.
As a result, future actual expenditures may differ from the amounts currently provided and changes to key assumptions and estimates could result in a material impact on the amount of the provision in future reporting periods.
On 18 January 2017, BHP Billiton Brasil, together with Vale and Samarco, entered into a Preliminary Agreement with the Federal Prosecutors Office in Brazil, which outlines the process and timeline for further negotiations towards a settlement regarding the R$20 billion public civil claim and the R$155 billion public civil claim.
While a final decision by the Court on the issue of ratification of the Framework Agreement is pending, the Preliminary Agreement suspends a R$1.2 billion approximately US$365 million injunction order under the R$20 billion public civil claim.
The Preliminary Agreement also requests suspension of the public civil claim, with a decision from the Court pending.
The R$1.2 billion injunction order may be reinstated if a final settlement arrangement is not agreed by 30 October 2017.
With regard to the Preliminary Agreement, the 12th Federal Court of Belo Horizonte suspended the R$155 billion claim, including a R$7.7 billion approximately US$2.3 billion injunction request.
However, proceedings may be resumed if a final settlement agreement is not agreed by 30 October 2017.
In addition, government inquiries and investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure have been commenced by numerous agencies of the Brazilian Government.
Other lawsuits and investigations are at the early stages of proceedings, including a shareholder action in the United States against BHP, and a Samarco bondholder action in the United States against Samarco, Vale, BHP Billiton Brasil and BHP.
For more information on the shareholder and bondholder actions and other lawsuits relating to the Samarco dam failure, refer to section 6.5.
Additional lawsuits and government investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure may be brought against BHP Billiton Brasil and possibly other BHP entities in Brazil or other jurisdictions.
While additional retention structures have been completed, the potential remains for further release or downstream movement of tailings material, which may result in additional claims, fines and proceedings or impact existing proceedings and may also have additional consequences on the environment and the feasibility, timing and scope of any restart of Samarco operations.
Our potential costs and liabilities in relation to the Samarco dam failure are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and cannot be reliably estimated at this time.
The total amounts that we may be required to pay will be dependent on many factors, including the timing and nature of a potential restart of operations at Samarco, the number of claims that become payable, the quantum of any fines levied, the outcome of litigation and the amount and timing of payments under any judgements or settlements.
Nevertheless, such potential costs and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, competitive position, cash flows, prospects, liquidity and shareholder returns.
38 BHP Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Operational risks 1 Cost pressures and Cost pressures may continue to occur across the resources industry.
As the prices for our products reduced productivity are determined by the global commodity markets, we do not generally have the ability to offset these could negatively impact cost pressures through corresponding price increases, which can adversely affect our operating our operating margins margins.
Although our efforts to reduce costs and a number of key cost inputs are commodity and expansion plans price-linked, the inability to reduce costs and a timing lag could materially and adversely impact our operating margins for an extended period.
Some of our assets, such as those producing copper, are energy or water intensive.
As a result, BHPs costs and earnings could be materially and adversely affected by rising costs or supply interruptions.
These could include the unavailability of energy, fuel or water due to a variety of reasons, including fluctuations in climate, inadequate infrastructure capacity, interruptions in supply due to equipment failure or other causes and the inability to extend supply contracts on economic terms.
Many of our Australian employees have conditions of employment, including wages, governed by the operation of the Australian Fair Work Act 2009.
Conditions of employment are often contained within collective agreements that are required to be renegotiated on expiry typically every three to four years.
In some instances, under the operation of the Fair Work Act, it can be expected that unions will pursue increases to conditions of employment, including wages, and or claims for greater union involvement in business decision-making.
In circumstances where a collective agreement is being renegotiated, industrial action is permitted under the Fair Work Act.
Industrial action and any subsequent settlement to mitigate associated commercial damage can adversely affect productivity and customer perceptions as a reliable supplier, and contribute to increases in costs.
The industrial relations environment in Chile remains challenging and it is possible that we will see further disruptions.
Recent changes to labour legislation in Chile have resulted in the right to have a single negotiating body across different operations owned by a single company.
This change may lead to a higher risk of operational stoppages that can contribute to an increase in costs and a reduction in productivity.
More broadly, cost and productivity pressures on BHP and our contractors and sub-contractors may increase the risk of industrial action and employment litigation.
These factors could lead to increased operating costs at existing assets, interruptions or delays and could negatively impact our operating margins and expansion plans.
Non-operated assets have We have interests in assets which are operated and managed by joint venture partners or by other their own management companies.
Those joint venture partners or other companies have their own management and operating and operating standards, standards, controls and procedures, including health, safety, environment and community HSEC joint venture partners or standards and may take action contrary to BHPs management and operating standards, controls and other companies managing procedures.
Failure by those joint venture partners or other companies to adopt equivalent standards, those non-operated assets controls and procedures at these non-operated assets could lead to higher costs and reduced production, may take action contrary litigation and regulatory action, delays or interruptions and adversely impact our results, prospects to our standards or fail to and reputation.

Health Health risks faced include fatigue, musculoskeletal illnesses and occupational exposure to substances or agents, including noise, silica, coal mine dust, diesel exhaust particulate, nickel and sulphuric acid mist and mental illness.
Longer-term health impacts may arise due to unanticipated workplace exposures or historical exposures of our workforce or communities to hazardous substances.
These effects may create future financial compensation obligations, adversely impact our people, reputation, regulatory approvals or licence to operate and affect the way we conduct our assets.
Given the global location of our assets, we could be affected by a public health emergency such as influenza or other infectious disease outbreaks in any of the regions in which our assets are located.

These include uncontrolled tailings containment breaches, subsidence from mining activities, escape of polluting substances and uncontrolled releases of hydrocarbons.
We provide for operational closure and site rehabilitation.
Our operating and closed facilities are required to have closure plans.
Changes in regulatory or community expectations may result in the relevant plans not being adequate.
This may increase financial provisioning and costs at the affected assets.
Climate change The physical and non-physical impacts of climate change may affect our assets, productivity and the markets in which we sell our products.
This includes acute and chronic changes in weather patterns, policy and regulatory change, technological development and market and economic responses.
Fossil fuel-related emissions are a significant source of greenhouse gases contributing to climate change.
We produce fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas for sale to customers.
We use fossil fuels in our mining and processing operations either directly or through the purchase of fossil fuel based electricity.
A number of national governments have already introduced, or are contemplating the introduction of, regulatory responses to greenhouse gas emissions, including from the extraction and combustion of fossil fuels to address the impacts of climate change.
This includes countries where we have assets such as Australia, the United States and Chile, as well as customer markets such as China, India and Europe.
In addition, the international community completed a new global climate agreement at the 21st Conference of the Parties COP21 in Paris in December 2015.
The absence of regulatory certainty, global policy inconsistencies and the challenges presented by managing our portfolio across a variety of regulatory frameworks have the potential to adversely affect our assets and supply chain.
From a mediumto long-term perspective, we are likely to see some adverse changes in the cost position of our greenhouse gas-intensive assets as a result of regulatory impacts in the countries where we do business.
These proposed regulatory mechanisms may adversely affect our assets directly or indirectly through our suppliers and customers.
Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change regulation are uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in the many countries in which we do business.
Examples of this include China, which is launching the worlds largest emissions trading system in 2017 and Australia, where the federal government repealed a carbon tax in 2014 and introduced new legislation to take its place.
There is a potential gap between the current valuation of fossil fuel reserves on the balance sheets of companies and in global equities markets and the reduced value that could result if a significant proportion of reserves were rendered incapable of extraction in an economically viable fashion due to technology, regulatory or market responses to climate change.
In such a scenario, stranded reserve assets held on our balance sheet may need to be impaired or written off and our inability to make productive use of such assets may also negatively impact our financial condition and results.
The growth of alternative energy supply options, such as renewables and nuclear, could also present a change to the energy mix that may reduce the value of fossil fuel assets.
The physical effects of climate change on our assets may include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, rising sea levels, increased storm intensities and higher temperatures.
These effects could materially and adversely affect the financial performance of our assets.
Community Our assets and activities may directly impact communities and also risk the potential for adverse impacts on human rights or breaches of other international laws or conventions.
Local communities may become dissatisfied with our operations or oppose our new development projects, including through legal action leading to, potential schedule delay, increased costs and reduced production.
Community-related risks may include community protests or civil unrest, adverse human rights impacts, community health and safety, complaints and grievances, and civil society activism.
In extreme cases the risks may affect viability, adversely impacting our reputation and licence to operate.

Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas the states in which we currently operate have adopted various laws and regulations, or issued regulatory guidance, concerning hydraulic fracturing.
Some states are considering changes to regulations in relation to permitting, public disclosure, and or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing and related operations, including the possibility of outright bans on the process.
For more information, refer to section 7.10.
While we have not experienced a material delay or substantially higher operating costs in our Onshore US assets as a result of current regulatory requirements, we cannot predict whether additional federal, state or local laws or regulations will be enacted and what such actions would require or prohibit.
Additional legislation or regulation could subject our assets to delays and increased costs, or prohibit certain activities, which could adversely affect the financial performance of our Onshore US assets.
Governance and compliance A failure of our governance or compliance processes may lead to regulatory penalties and loss of reputation.
We conduct our business in a global environment that encompasses multiple jurisdictions and complex regulatory frameworks.
Our governance and compliance processes which include the review of internal controls over financial reporting and specific internal controls in relation to trade and financial sanctions and offers of anything of value to government officials and representatives of state-owned enterprises may not operate to identify financial misstatements or prevent potential breaches of law, or of accounting or governance practice.
Our BHP Code of Business Conduct, together with our mandatory policies, such as the anti-corruption, trade and financial sanctions and competition policies, may not prevent instances of fraudulent behaviour and dishonesty nor guarantee compliance with legal or regulatory requirements.
This may lead to regulatory fines, disgorgement of profits, litigation, allegations or investigations by regulatory authorities, loss of operating licences and or reputational damage.

Its an aspiration designed to harness challenges of our current culture.
Despite the diversity of our business, we found a handful of enduring traits that span business the enormous potential that a more inclusive and diverse workplace will deliver at BHP.

Mooka OCRS took on the challenge of achieving a more inclusive workplace.
As part of our push for continuous improvement, we redesigned the OCRS to reduce risk from activities such as shunting and overhead crane use.
This not only made the workplace safer, it also made it possible for a diverse pool of talent from the local community to participate in our workforce, without requiring specialist technical qualifications.
For example, the introduction of automated guided vehicles and a robotic gantry system means that dogging and rigging licences are no longer required, while the mechanisation of tasks that formerly required heavy lifting means people of different physiques can perform them safely.
Tasks that require a trade-qualified operator are separated from tasks that do not, which has enabled the participation of people without trade qualifications or previous experience.
As a result, we were able to adapt our recruitment and assessment processes to reach a broader range of people from our local communities.
We used information sessions and assessment centres to promote opportunities.
Assessment focused on characteristics such as demonstrated behaviours and the ability to work in a team, rather than technical capabilities.
Our workforce is now 30 per cent women up from five per cent in FY2016 and 10 per cent Indigenous as at 30 June 2017.
We know that in addition to improving diversity, we must support inclusive workplaces.
We focused on creating an inclusive culture through visible leadership, more face-to-face updates on performance and regular updates on any changes impacting the team.
The strength of this approach is reflected in this years Mooka OCRS Employee Perception Survey results, which are higher than the BHP average, and above external norms for high performing companies.
The success at Mooka OCRS means it can also act as a talent incubator for other BHP assets.

To understand the impact of this uncertainty on BHPs portfolio, our corporate planning process uses scenario analysis to consider a wide spectrum of potential outcomes.
Designed to interpret external factors, including technical, economic, political and governance trends facing the global resources industry, the scenarios offer a means to explore potential portfolio discontinuities and opportunities, as well as to test the robustness of decisions.
We also test the portfolio against shock events: unlikely and extreme events, which are typically short term, but may have associated longer-term impacts.

We also have a strong project Analysis pipeline with many capital-efficient growth options that continue to generate shareholder value in a two degree Celsius world.
In September 2016, we released Climate Change: Portfolio Analysis Views after Paris, which included analysis of emerging climate policy e. g. 21st Conference of the Parties COP21 and low-emissions technology developments.
As an outcome of COP21 in Paris, the Paris Agreement was significant for establishing a common ambition to reduce emissions, but 2015 2016 the Nationally Determined Contributions, which described each nations plans to achieve this targets, were still relatively modest.
It is important that Parties to the Paris Agreement provide regular progress assessments and increase ambition over time.
We expect non-hydro renewables, principally wind and solar, will gain market share in the power sector, mainly at the expense of energy coal.
This uptake is expected to triple the combined share of wind and solar in the power mix in the next 25 years.
We expect demand growth for oil to decrease due to the rise in electric vehicles and an increase in fuel efficiency of internal combustion engines vehicles.
Nevertheless, despite rapid growth in renewables and electric vehicles, the world will still require roughly four-fifths of its growing total energy needs to come from non-renewable sources in 2040.
As such, it is important to look at other options to reduce emissions from the production and use of fossil fuels, such as CCS and improved power generation efficiency.
We are committed to keeping our stakeholders informed of the impact of climate change to BHP.

The asset includes a fully integrated metallurgical complex with a grinding and concentrating circuit, a hydrometallurgical plant incorporating solvent extraction circuits for copper and uranium, a copper smelter, a copper refinery and a recovery Coober Pedy circuit for precious metals.
Key developments during FY2017 Olympic Dam Maralinga Olympic Dams copper production decreased following the state-wide power outage during September and October 2016 and unplanned maintenance that took place at the refinery during December 2016 and January 2017.
Port Augusta Looking ahead Development in the Southern Mining Area is progressing well and is expected to support a gradual increase in copper production to 230 kilotonnes kt in FY2021.
Through the first half of FY2018, BHPs Olympic Dam smelter operations will be enhanced Port Lincoln through a total A$350 million investment.
Adelaide Victor Harbor The smelter upgrade involves combined investment in the following three areas to Kangaroo ensure the ongoing integrity of critical infrastructure and to continue to deliver safe South Australia Island and reliable performance: rebuilding key elements of the smelter flash furnace: Olympic Dam Port Hwy demolishing and building a new electric slag furnace: s1001 v1 removing and replacing the five-storey high electro static precipitator.
Olympic Dam is also using the planned down time to undertake further refinery asset maintenance.
We are investigating further options for expanding production at Olympic Dam.
The brownfield expansion project could see production grow to approximately 280 kilotonnes per annum ktpa, with a potential upside of 330 ktpa.
We are also seeing encouraging results in our heap leach trials which, if proven, would enable potential growth to 450500 ktpa of copper.
54 BHP Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Rail Line Iron ore asset 1 Western Australia Iron Ore Overview Western Australia Iron Ore WAIO is an integrated system of four processing hubs and five mines, connected by more than 1,000 kilometres of rail infrastructure and port facilities in the Pilbara region of northern Western Australia.
WAIOs Pilbara reserve base is relatively concentrated, allowing development to be planned around integrated mining hubs joined to the mines and satellite orebodies by conveyors or spur lines.
This approach enables the value of installed infrastructure to be maximised by using the same processing plant and rail infrastructure for a number of orebodies.
At each mining hub Newman, Yandi, Mining Area C and Jimblebar ore from mines Western is crushed, beneficiated where necessary and blended to create high-grade hematite Australia lump and fines products.
Iron ore products are then transported along the Port Hedland Newman Rail Line to the Finucane Island and Nelson Point port facilities at Port Hedland.
Port Hedland There are four main WAIO joint ventures JVs : Mt Newman, Yandi, Mt Goldsworthy and Nelson Point Finucane Island Jimblebar.
BHPs interest in each of the joint ventures is 85 per cent, with Mitsui and ITOCHU South Hedland Goldsworthy Karratha owning the remaining 15 per cent.
The joint ventures are unincorporated, except Jimblebar.
Yarrie Marble Bar BHP, Mitsui and ITOCHU have entered into separate joint venture agreements with Great Northern some customers that involve the sublease of parts of WAIOs existing mineral leases: Highway JW4, Wheelarra and Posmac.
The JW4 sublease arrangement expired on 1 April 2017 Port Hedland Newman Rail Line and, as such, control of the sublease area was handed back to the Yandi JV.
Chichester The ore is sold to the main joint ventures.
BHP is entitled to 85 per cent of production Deviation from these subleases.
Karijini National Yandi All ore is transported by rail on the Mt Newman JV and Mt Goldsworthy JV rail lines to Park Mining Area C our port facilities.
WAIOs port facilities at Nelson Point are owned by the Mt Newman JV, Orebody and Finucane Island is owned by the Mt Goldsworthy JV.
24 25 Orebody 18 Jimblebar Key developments during FY2017 Mt Whaleback Newman Wheelarra Orebody 29 30 35 WAIO has achieved record production as a result of continued focus on productivity improvements, the rail renewal program and the ramp-up of additional capacity Existing Operations Port Port Hedland Newman Rail Line Goldsworthy Rail Line at Jimblebar, where a new primary crusher and additional conveying capacity was successfully commissioned.
s1002 v1 Productivity improvements included a reduction of locomotive service times by 50 per cent and the introduction of an improved drilling fleet configuration, which has lowered fuel usage and engine load factor.
Automation was introduced for blast hole drilling across all WAIO mine sites.
With some mine blasts requiring more than 6,000 drill holes, automation reduces people exposure to hazardous environments, is a key enabler for diversity, saves time and allows for greater accuracy.
The rail renewal and maintenance program progressed ahead of schedule and is now complete.
In the short term, the program has resulted in higher unit costs for FY2017.
However, this cost is offset by the benefits of creating a more integrated and just in time supply chain: the re-railing has unlocked further capacity and enabled us to better mitigate the impacts of unplanned events, such as bad weather.
Looking ahead We will continue to focus on productivity improvements through standardised work processes, simplification and further cost reduction.
BHP will continue to work with the regulatory authorities in relation to the necessary licence amendment to increase BHPs current authorised export capacity to 290 million tonnes Mt.
Pre-commitment funding of US$184 million has been approved for the development of the South Flank deposit adjacent to the existing Mining Area C operations.
The South Flank project, which will leverage and expand the existing Mining Area C hub, is BHPs preferred option to replace production from the 80 million tonnes per annum Mtpa Yandi mine 100 per cent basis when it reaches the end of its economic life in the early-to-mid 2020s.
The project is expected to be submitted for Board approval in the middle of CY2018, with first ore targeted in CY2021 and ramp-up timed to coincide with the ramp-down of Yandi.

60 BHP Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Iron ore asset 1 Samarco Brazil BHP Billiton Brasil Limitada and Vale S. A. each holds a 50 per cent shareholding in Samarco Minerao S. A. Samarco, which operates the Samarco iron ore mine in Brazil.
Overview As a result of the tragic dam failure at Samarco in November 2015, operations at Samarco remain suspended.
For further information on the Samarco dam failure, refer to section 1.7.
Samarco comprises a mine and three concentrators located in the state of Minas Gerais, and four pellet plants and a port located in Anchieta in the state of Esprito Santo.
Three 400-kilometre pipelines connect the mine site to the pelletising facilities.
Samarcos main product is iron ore pellets.
Prior to the suspension of operations, the Minas Gerais, extraction and beneficiation of iron ore were conducted at the Germano facilities in Esprito Santo Brazil the municipalities of Mariana and Ouro Preto.
Front end loaders were used to extract the ore and convey it from the mines.
Ore beneficiation then occurred in concentrators, where crushing, milling, desliming and flotation processes produced iron concentrate.
Valadares The concentrate leaves the concentrators as slurry and is pumped through the slurry pipelines from the Germano facilities to the pellet plants in Ubu, Anchieta, where the slurry is processed into pellets.
The iron ore pellets are then heat treated.

Juiz fide Fora Samarco 1st pipeline 2nd pipeline 3rd pipeline s1008 v1 BHP Annual Report 2017 61 Strategic Report Governance at BHP Remuneration Report Directors Report Financial Statements Additional information Shareholder information Potash Overview Potash is a potassium-rich salt mainly used in fertiliser to improve the quality and yield of agricultural production.
As an essential nutrient for plant growth, potash is a vital link in the global food supply chain.
The demands on that supply chain are intensifying: there will be more people to feed in future, as well as rising calorific intake comprised of more varied diets.
The strains this will place on finite land supply mean sustainable increases in crop yields will be crucial and potash fertilisers will be critical in replenishing our soils.
However, in the near term, overcapacity is likely to get worse.
In the 10 years to 2016, the industry added nearly 27 Mt of annual nameplate capacity.
Further greenfield supply will come on-stream over the next five years.
As a result, potash prices are currently at their lowest levels in a decade and are likely to get worse before they get better.
Prince Albert Although the near-term outlook may be sombre, we expect the peak of oversupply Saskatchewan, to occur within the next few years.
Positive underlying demand fundamentals, assisted Canada by affordable pricing, should see consumption catch up to capacity in the 2020s.
Our projections are that demand for potash will continue to grow at a rate of about Wolverine Burr two to three per cent per year compound annual growth rate and that, even taking Saskatoon into account new projects and latent capacity in the industry, demand will outstrip Jansen supply within the next decade.
Young Potash has the potential to create significant value and provide BHP with an opportunity Yorkton Boulder to capture long-term growth and diversification benefits.

Weyburn Assiniboia Jansen Potash Project BHP holds exploration permits and mining leases covering approximately 9,600 square BHP Potential Projects BHP Land Permits kilometres in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada.
The Jansen Potash Project is Extent of Mine Integrity Prairie Evaporite 1,100m located about 140 kilometres east of Saskatoon.
We own 100 per cent of this Project.
s1010 v1 Jansens large resource endowment provides the opportunity to develop it in stages, with anticipated initial capacity of 4 Mtpa.
Key developments during FY2017 Over the year, our focus was on the safe excavation and lining of two 7.3 metre diameter shafts.
Both shafts were safely excavated through the Blairmore formation which lies about 450 metres below the surface, with steel tubbing in place to prevent water inflow and provide structural support.
By the end of FY2017, the production shaft had reached a depth of approximately 730 metres of the design depth of 975 metres and the service shaft had been excavated to approximately 710 metres of its eventual one-kilometre depth.
Capital expenditure in the Jansen Potash Project in FY2017 was US$162 million.
During the year, we awarded the detailed engineering design contract studying the feasibility of Jansen Stage 1 to Hatch Bantrel, which formed a joint venture partnership to complete this work.
Looking ahead Jansen is in the feasibility study phase and we continue to assess how we can reduce risk and unlock value.
The current scope of work was 70 per cent complete at the end of FY2017.
Work on the shafts will continue in FY2018.
Once shaft excavation is complete, the shafts will be connected underground and shaft infrastructure will be installed.
This falls within the current approved scope of work.
Construction beyond the current scope of work will require Board approval.
With a later market window now anticipated, the Jansen Potash Project will not be brought to the Board in CY2018.
In the meantime, we are considering multiple options to maximise the value of Jansen, including further improvements to capital efficiency, further optimisation of design and diluting our interest by bringing in a partner.
Board approval will be sought for the project only if it passes our strict Capital Allocation Framework tests.

Operating cash costs by definition do not include non-cash costs.
The change in operating cash costs also excludes the impact of exchange rates and inflation, changes in fuel and energy costs, changes in exploration and business development costs and one-off items.
These items are excluded so as to provide a consistent measurement of changes in costs across all segments, based on the factors that are within the control and responsibility of the segment.
Change in controllable cash costs and change in operating cash costs are not measures that are recognised by IFRS.
They may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Higher average realised prices across our key commodities increased Underlying EBITDA by US$9.0 billion in FY2017.
This was partially offset by an increase to price-linked costs of US$779 million reflecting higher royalty charges.
Productivity volumes in Underlying EBITDA improved by US$340 million primarily as a result of ongoing efficiency improvements and the release of latent capacity across the Group, excluding US$602 million one-off items from the industrial action at Escondida, power outage at Olympic Dam and the impact of Cyclone Debbie at Queensland Coal.
This was partially offset by US$267 million lower growth volumes reflecting deferral of development activity for value at Onshore US and expected natural field decline.
Our focus on best-in-class performance underpinned a US$961 million reduction in controllable cash costs during FY2017.
Lower costs reflect a decrease in labour and contractor costs per tonne produced at WAIO, favourable impacts from inventory movements across the mineral assets and a change in estimated recoverable copper in the Escondida sulphide leach pad.
These are partially offset by additional WAIO rail maintenance costs, closure and rehabilitation adjustments in Petroleum and the impact of higher exploration expenditure attributable to expensing the Burrokeet wells in Trinidad and Tobago and the Wildling-1 well in the Gulf of Mexico.
A weaker US dollar against the Australian dollar and Chilean peso decreased Underlying EBITDA by US$516 million during the period.
Increased depletion of capitalised stripping and a lower strip ratio consistent with the Escondida mine plan further reduced Underlying EBITDA by US$357 million.

This increase reflects, higher commodity prices, a continued focus on cash cost efficiency and higher dividends received from equity accounted investments in line with higher prices.
This was partially offset by higher net interest paid due to higher benchmark interest rates, settlement of cash management related instruments and higher net taxation paid as a result of higher profits.
Net investing cash outflows of US$4.2 billion decreased by US$3.1 billion.
The decrease reflects lower planned capital spend on major projects in FY2017 and higher cash proceeds from divestment and sale of assets during FY2017.
For additional information and a breakdown of capital and exploration expenditure on a commodity basis, refer to section 1.13.
Net financing cash outflows of US$9.1 billion increased by US$9.4 billion.
This primarily reflects the Groups focus on debt reduction with US$3.3 billion of senior debt repaid at maturity and US$2.5 billion paid on bonds repurchased during March 2017 compared with an inflow of US$4.6 billion in FY2016 primarily due to the Group issuing multi-currency hybrid notes of US$6.4 billion.
This was partially offset by lower dividends paid in FY2017 compared to FY2016 in line with the revised dividend policy.
For additional information, refer to section 1.12.3 and note 19 Net debt in section 5.

The combined amount drawn under the facility or as commercial paper will not exceed US$6.0 billion.
As at 30 June 2017, US$ nil commercial paper was drawn FY2016: US$ nil, therefore US$6.0 billion of committed facility was available to use FY2016: US$6.0 billion.
The revolving credit facility expires on 7 May 2021.
A commitment fee is payable on the undrawn balance and an interest rate comprising an interbank rate plus a margin applies to any drawn balance.
The agreed margins are typical for a credit facility extended to a company with the Companys credit rating.

In BHPs opinion, working capital is sufficient for BHPs present requirements.
BHPs credit ratings are currently A3 P-2 outlook positive Moodys long-term short-term and A A-1 outlook stable Standard & Poors long-term short-term.
A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time by an assigning rating agency, and any rating should be evaluated independently of any other information.

We engage in third party trading for the following reasons: Production variability and occasional shortfalls from our assets means that we sometimes source third party materials to ensure a steady supply of product to ourcustomers.
To optimise our supply chain outcomes, we may buy physical product from third parties.
To support the development of liquid markets, we will sometimes source third party physical product and manage risk through both the physical and financial markets.

Underlying EBITDA Earnings before net finance costs, depreciation, amortisation and impairments, taxation expense, Discontinued operations and exceptional items.
Underlying EBITDA includes BHPs share of profit loss from investments accounted for using the equity method, including net finance costs, depreciation, amortisation and impairments, and taxation expense benefit.
Underlying EBIT Underlying EBITDA, including depreciation, amortisation and impairments.
Further alternate performance measures are defined and calculated as follows: Adjusted effective tax rate Total taxation expense benefit, excluding exceptional items and exchange rate movements included in taxation expense benefit divided by profit loss before taxation and exceptional items.
Management believes this measure provides useful information regarding the tax impacts from underlying operations.
Exceptional items attributable to Exceptional items attributable to BHP shareholders divided by the weighted basic average number BHP shareholders per share of shares.
1 Free cash flow Net operating cash flows less Net investing cash flows.
1 Gearing ratio Ratio of Net debt to Net debt plus Net assets.

80 BHP Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report 1.12.5 Definition and calculation of alternate performance measures continued 1 Alternate performance measure Method of calculation Net operating assets Operating assets net of operating liabilities, including the carrying value of equity accounted investments and predominantly excludes cash balances, loans to associates, interest bearing liabilities and deferred tax balances.
The carrying value of investments accounted for using the equity accounted method represents the balance of the Groups investment in equity accounted investments, with no adjustment for any cash balances, interest bearing liabilities and deferred tax balances of the equity accounted investment.
Management believes this measure provides useful information by isolating the net operating assets of the business from the financing and tax balances which, in combination with our other measures, provides a meaningful indicator of underlying performance.
Operating assets free cash flow Net operating cash flows adjusted for dividends received, net interest received paid and net income tax and royalty-related taxation refunded paid less net investing cash flows.
Dividends received, net interest and net income tax and royalty-related taxation are not allocated to operating asset free cash flow as financing structures and tax regimes differ across the Groups assets and substantial components of the Groups interest and tax charges are levied at a Group level rather than an operational level.
Segment contribution to the Segment Underlying EBITDA divided by the Groups Underlying EBITDA excluding Group and Groups Underlying EBITDA unallocated items.
Underlying basic earnings per share Underlying attributable profit divided by the weighted average number of basic shares.
Underlying EBITDA margin Underlying EBITDA, excluding third party product Underlying EBITDA, divided by revenue excluding third party product revenue.
1 Calculation is performed with reference to IFRS measures.
1.12.6 Definition and calculation of principal factors The method of calculation of the principal factors that affect Revenue, Profit loss from operations and Underlying EBITDA is as follows: Principal factor Method of calculation Change in sales prices Change in average realised price for each operation from the corresponding period to the current period, multiplied by current period volumes.
Price-linked costs Change in price-linked costs for each operation from the corresponding period to the current period, multiplied by current period volumes.
Productivity volumes Change in volumes for each operation not included in the Growth category from the corresponding period to the current period, multiplied by the prior year Underlying EBITDA margin.
Growth volumes Volume Growth comprises Underlying EBITDA for operations that are new or acquired in the current period minus Underlying EBITDA for operations that are new or acquired in the corresponding period, change in volumes for operations identified as a Growth project from the corresponding period to the current period multiplied by the prior year Underlying EBITDA margin, and change in volume for our petroleum assets from the corresponding period to the current period multiplied by the prior year Underlying EBITDA margin.
Controllable cash costs Operating cash costs and exploration and business development costs, excluding Discontinued operations.
Management believes this measure provides useful information regarding the Group's financial performance because it considers these expenses to be the principal operating and overhead expenses that are most directly under the Groups control.
Operating cash costs Change in total costs, other than price-linked costs, exchange rates, inflation on costs, fuel and energy costs, non-cash costs and one-off items as defined below for each operation from the corresponding period to the current period.
Exploration and business Exploration and business development expense in the current period minus exploration and development business development expense in the corresponding period.
Exchange rates Change in exchange rate multiplied by current period local currency revenue and expenses.
The majority of the Groups selling prices are denominated in US dollars and so there is little impact of exchange rate changes on Revenue.
Inflation on costs Change in inflation rate applied to expenses, other than depreciation and amortisation, price-linked costs, exploration and business development expenses, expenses in ceased and sold operations and expenses in new and acquired operations.
Fuel and energy Fuel and energy expense in the current period minus fuel and energy expense in the corresponding period.
Non-cash Includes non-cash items mainly depletion of stripping capitalised.
One-off items Change in costs exceeding a pre-determined threshold associated with an unexpected event that had not occurred in the last two years and is not reasonably likely to occur within the next two years.
Asset sales Profit loss on the sale of assets or operations in the current period minus profit loss on sale in the corresponding period.
Ceased and sold operations Underlying EBITDA for operations that ceased or were sold in the current period minus Underlying EBITDA for operations that ceased or were sold in the corresponding period.
Share of operating profit from Share of operating profit from equity accounted investments for the period minus share of operating equity accounted investments profit from equity accounted investments in the corresponding period.

Outlook Total copper production is expected to increase to between 1.66 and 1.79 Mt in FY2018.
Escondida production is expected to increase to between 1.13 and 1.23 Mt following the ramp-up of the Los Colorados Extension project during the September 2017 quarter, which will enable utilisation of three concentrators.
At Olympic Dam, production is expected to decrease to 150 kt as a major smelter maintenance campaign is phased through August to November 2017.
Production at Pampa Norte is expected to be higher than the prior year following completion of the Spence Recovery Optimisation project in FY2017.
Production at Antamina is expected to decrease to 125 kt as mining continues through a zinc rich ore zone.
FY2018 unit cash costs at our operated copper assets are expected to remain broadly unchanged at approximately US$1.15 per pound.
At Escondida, unit cash costs are expected to rise to approximately US$1.00 per pound, reflecting an expected 10 per cent grade decline, in line with the optimised mine plan, to approximately 0.90 per cent, higher price-linked commodity input costs and an increase in usage of higher cost desalinated water.
This will be partially offset by lower mining cost per tonne of material moved expected as a result of continued productivity improvements.

The iron ore to 231 Mt, or 268 Mt on a 100 per cent basis, following record price increase was driven by higher pig iron production in China annual production at WAIO.
This increase reflected strong and a preference for higher grade materials amid improved steel productivity improvements across the supply chain as well margins and high coke prices.

108 BHP Annual Report 2017 Governance at BHP Board evaluation in action A number of improvements were agreed and implemented following the FY2016 Board evaluation.
These included refining the approach to Board strategy discussions and improvements to culture, training and development and Board composition.
Two particular actions agreed in the FY2016 Board evaluation that have been implemented are to provide greater opportunity to attend site 2 visits and to make those visits more focused, and to better tailor induction programs to the particular skills and experience of the Director.
The range of site visits that took place can be seen in section 2.9 Director induction, training and development.
Not all Directors attended each site visit, but there was particular emphasis on the attendance of members of the Sustainability Committee.
Part of the site visit schedule related to the individual induction requirements of the new Directors.
Ken MacKenzie visited Western Australia Iron Ore, Blackwater, Spence, Onshore US, Gulf of Mexico and Jansen.
Grant King visited Onshore US, Gulf of Mexico, Spence and Western Australia Iron Ore. Alongside the standard induction manual and various governance documents, the induction program includes a tailored selection of specific Board papers and minutes for Board and Committees for the prior 12 to 18 months.
In addition, specific meetings and briefings were held for the new Directors, those briefings being conducted by a range of stakeholders, including the Chairman, Committee Chairmen, CEO and other ELT members, members of Group Governance and senior management.
2.12 Board meetings and attendance The Board meets as often as necessary to fulfil its role.
Directors are required to allocate sufficient time to BHP to perform their responsibilities effectively, including adequate time to prepare for Board meetings.
During the reporting year, the Board met 11 times, with seven of those meetings held in Australia, three in the United Kingdom and one in Chile.
Regularly scheduled Board meetings generally run over two days including committee meetings and Director training and development sessions.
Members of the Executive Leadership Team and other members of senior management attended meetings of the Board by invitation.
