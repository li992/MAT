Financial Instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups Statement of Financial Position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or are transferred.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Financial Assets The Groups financial assets are all categorised as loans and receivables with the exception of derivative assets.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise Trade and other receivables and Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise short-term cash deposits with major United Kingdom and European clearing banks earning floating rates of interest based upon bank base rates or rates linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The currency profile of cash and cash equivalents is shown below: 2017 2016 000 000 Bank balances and cash floats 247,560 215,996 Sterling 159,094 136,459 Euros 75,619 67,245 US Dollars 5,084 7,981 Australian Dollars 4,227 611 New Zealand Dollars 196 588 Swedish Krona 280 792 Danish Krone 1,292 791 Other 1,768 1,529 247,560 215,996 Financial Liabilities The Groups financial liabilities are all categorised as other financial liabilities.
Other financial liabilities, with the exception of foreign exchange forward contracts and put option liabilities, are measured at amortised cost.
The Groups other financial liabilities comprise Interest-bearing loans and borrowings and Trade and other payables.
The currency profile of interest-bearing loans and borrowings is shown below: 2017 2016 000 000 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 33,960 6,575 Sterling 25,741 6,500 Euros 718 53 Australian Dollars 7,073 4 New Zealand Dollars 9 18 Other 419 - 33,960 6,575 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 19.
Financial Instruments continued Risk Management The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk and its liquidity position.
The Group manages these risks through the use of derivative instruments, which are reviewed on a regular basis.
Derivative instruments are not entered into for speculative purposes.
There are no concentrations of risk in the period to 28 January 2017.
Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations by a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The Groups borrowings are at floating rates, partially hedged by floating rate interest on deposits, reflecting the seasonality of its cash flow.
Interest rate risk therefore arises from bank borrowings.
Interest rate hedging has not been put in place on the current facility.
The Directors continue to be mindful of the potential volatility in base rates, but at present do not consider a long term interest rate hedge to be necessary given the inherent short term nature of both the revolving credit facility and working capital facility.
This position is reviewed regularly, along with the level of facility required.
The Group has potential bank floating rate financial liabilities on the 215,000,000 committed bank facility, together with overdraft facilities in subsidiary companies see note 18.
At 28 January 2017 nil was drawn down from the committed bank facility 2016: nil.
When drawdowns are made, the Group is exposed to cash flow interest risk with interest paid at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.10% 2016: 1.10%.
As at 28 January 2017 the Group has liabilities of 964,000 2016: 108,000, in respect of finance lease or similar hire purchase contracts.
A change of 1.0% in the average interest rates during the year, applied to the Groups floating interest rate loans and borrowings as at the reporting date, would change profit before tax by 108,000 2016: 610,000 and would change equity by 108,000 2016: 610,000.
The calculation is based on any floating interest rate loans and borrowings drawn down at the period end date.
This includes the Groups committed bank facility, Tiso Group Limiteds overdraft, Next Athleisure Limiteds overdraft and Go Outdoors Limiteds bank loans.
Calculations are performed on the same basis as the prior year and assume that all other variables remain unchanged.
Foreign Currency Risk Foreign Currency Translation Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange at the reporting date.
Exchange differences in monetary items are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange at the reporting date.
Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the accounting period.
Foreign currency differences are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and are presented in the foreign currency translation reserve.

Financial Instruments continued Derivative Financial Instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value and remeasured at each period end.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
Interest rate swaps are recognised at fair value in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position with movements in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the period.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates and the respective risk profiles of the swap counterparties.
Hedging of Monetary Assets and Liabilities Where a derivative financial instrument is used to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than pound sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are the Euro and US Dollar with sales made in Euros and purchases made in both Euros and US Dollars principal exposure.
To protect its foreign currency position, the Group sets a buying rate in each country for the purchase of goods in US Dollars at the start of the buying season typically six to nine months before the product actually starts to appear in the stores and then enters into a number of local currency US Dollar contracts whereby the minimum exchange rate on the purchase of dollars is guaranteed.
As at 28 January 2017, options have been entered into to protect approximately 92% of the US Dollar requirement for the period to January 2018.
The balance of the US Dollar requirement for the period will be satisfied at spot rates.
As at 28 January 2017, the fair value of these instruments was a liability of 3,303,000 2016: liability of 4,344,000 and these are all classified as due within one year.
A loss of 4,405,000 2016: loss of 4,344,000 has been recognised in cost of sales within the Consolidated Income Statement for the change in fair value of these instruments.
We have considered the credit risk of the Groups and counterpartys credit risk and this is not expected to have a material effect on the valuation of these options.
A 10.0% strengthening of sterling relative to the following currencies as at the reporting date would have reduced profit before tax and equity as follows: Profit before tax Equity 2017 2016 2017 2016 Impact of 10% strengthening of sterling 000 000 000 000 Euros 4,862 4,147 13,069 10,937 US Dollars 400 615 400 615 Australian Dollars 262 28 718 55 Other 124 82 31 55 5,648 4,872 14,218 11,552 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 19.

Credit Risk Credit risk arises from the possibility of customers and counterparties failing to meet their obligations to the Group.
Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative instruments are made through major United Kingdom and European clearing banks, which must meet minimum credit ratings as required by the Board.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for impairment where amounts are not thought to be recoverable see note 16.
At the reporting date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk and receivables which are not impaired are believed to be recoverable.
The Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be equivalent to total trade and other receivables of 118,602,000 2016: 56,375,000 and cash and cash equivalents of 247,560,000 2016: 215,996,000.
Liquidity Risk The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirement to minimise net interest expense, whilst ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of the business.
The forecast cash and borrowing profile of the Group is monitored on an ongoing basis, to ensure that adequate headroom remains under committed borrowing facilities.
The Board review 13 week and annual cash flow forecasts each month.
Information about the maturity of the Groups financial liabilities is disclosed in note 18.
As at 28 January 2017, there are committed facilities with a maturity profile as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 Expiring in more than two years but no more than three years 215,000 - Expiring in more than three years but no more than four years - 215,000 215,000 215,000 The commitment fee on these facilities is 0.35% 2016: 0.35%.

Financial Instruments continued Fair Values The fair values together with the carrying amounts shown in the Statement of Financial Position as at 28 January 2017 are as follows: Carrying amount Fair value 2017 2017 Note 000 000 Trade and other receivables 16 73,075 73,075 Cash and cash equivalents 17 247,560 247,560 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings - current 18 31,431 31,431 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings - non-current 18 2,529 1,995 Trade and other payables - current 399,345 399,345 Trade and other payables - non-current 7,455 6,368 120,125 118,504 Unrecognised gains 1,621 The comparatives at 30 January 2016 are as follows: Carrying amount Fair value 2016 2016 Note 000 000 Trade and other receivables 16 25,889 25,889 Cash and cash equivalents 17 215,996 215,996 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings - current 18 6,301 6,301 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings - non-current 18 274 189 Trade and other payables - current 275,910 275,910 Trade and other payables - non-current 4,890 4,282 45,490 44,797 Unrecognised gains 693 In the opinion of the Board, the fair value of the Groups current financial assets and liabilities as at 28 January 2017 and 30 January 2016 are not considered to be materially different to that of the book value.
On this basis, the fair value hierarchy reflects the carrying values.
In respect of the Groups non-current financial assets and liabilities as at 28 January 2017 and 30 January 2016, the fair value has been calculated using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.7% 2016: 12.3% which reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the specific risks applicable to the liability.
Estimation of Fair Values For trade and other receivables payables, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
