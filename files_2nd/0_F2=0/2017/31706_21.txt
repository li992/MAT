Trading Information Ordinary Shares Listing London Stock Exchange ISIN GB0003085445 SEDOL 0308544 Ticker EPIC code ELTA Bloomberg ELTALN Reuters ELTAL Share Fraud Warning We are aware that in the past a number of shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters.
These are typically from overseas based brokers who target UK shareholders, offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high-risk shares.
These operations are commonly known as Boiler Room scams.
Please be very wary of any such calls or correspondence.
Ask for the name and organisation of the person calling you and check if they can be found on the FCA Register.
If they are not listed, please report it directly to the FCA using their consumer helpline 0800 111 6768.
You may also wish to advise us by telephoning 020 3874 8300 or emailing IR@electrapeplc.
It is very unlikely that either the Company or the Companys Registrars, Equiniti, would make unsolicited telephone calls to shareholders.
Such calls would only relate to official documentation already circulated to shareholders and never be in respect of investment advice.
Please remember that if you use an unauthorised firm to buy or sell shares, you will not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if things go wrong.

Electra Private Equity PLC is an AIF.
AIFM Alternative Investment Fund Manager.
Epiris Managers LLP was the AIFM for Electra Private Equity PLC until 31st May 2017.

Carried Interest The incentive arrangements, which are similar to arrangements found elsewhere in the private equity industry, were designed to align previous managers interests with those of Electras shareholders.
These arrangements are typically referred to as carried interest.
The carried interest payable to previous managers is based on three year pools of investments.
Under the terms of this arrangement all qualifying investments in a three year period are aggregated into a separate pool.
Electra must first receive back the aggregate cost of all the investments in the pool, plus related priority profit share see below and an 8% compound return this is often referred to as the hurdle.
Once Electra has received sufficient cash to pay the amounts as described above, the previous managers will be entitled to a carried interest of 18% of the profits.
Consequently, they will receive the next 18 82 of the hurdle so that they will have an amount equal to 18% of the profits on the pool up to that point this is referred to as a catch up.
Thereafter, Electra and previous managers will share future cash flows in the ratio of 82:18.
Below is an example to illustrate in principle how the above described arrangements work: m Assumptions Amount invested 500 Amount invested and priority profit share Amount realised 1,000 Realised after year five Pool profit 500 Hurdle 210 8% per annum compound Catch up 46 18 82 of the hurdle Balance 44 The amount over the hurdle to get to an aggregate 18% of the pool profit Total carry 90 18% Electra 410 82% On 31st May 2017, when the contract with the previous managers terminated, any provision on post 2006 Pools, which was unpaid at that date and any future uplift to it will be reduced by 20% which will revert back to the Company.
