BASIS OF PREPARATION The consolidated financial statements on a cash result basis have been prepared by adjusting the financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRSs and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC for items which do not reflect the cash emerging from the business.
The adjustments are as follows: 1.
Unit liabilities and net assets held to cover unit liabilities, as set out in Note 10, are policyholder balances which are removed in the statement of financial position on a cash result basis.
No adjustment for payments in or out is required in the statement of comprehensive income as this business is subject to deposit accounting, which means that policyholder deposits and withdrawals are recognised in the statement of financial position under IFRS, with only marginal cash flows attributable to shareholders recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
However, adjustment is required for the investment return and the movement in investment contract liabilities, which are offsetting and are both zero-ised.
Deferred acquisition costs, the purchased value of in-force business and deferred income assets and liabilities are removed from the statement of financial position on a cash result basis, and the amortisation of these balances is removed in the statement of comprehensive income on a cash result basis.
The assets, liabilities and amortisation are set out in Note 8.
Share-based payment expense is removed from the statement of comprehensive income on a cash result basis, and the equity and liability balances for equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment schemes respectively are removed from the statement of financial position on a cash result basis.
Share-based payment balances are set out in Note 19.
Non-unit linked insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance assets, as set out in Note 13, are removed in the statement of financial position on a cash result basis.
The movement in these balances is removed from the statement of comprehensive income on a cash result basis.
Goodwill, computer software intangible assets and some other assets and liabilities which are inadmissible under the Solvency II regime are removed from the statement of financial position on a cash result basis, however the movement in these figures are included in the statement of comprehensive income on a cash result basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted in the statement of financial position on a cash result basis to reflect the adjustments noted above and other discounting differences between tax charges and IFRS accounting.
However, the impact of movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities are not included in the statement of comprehensive income on a cash result basis.
