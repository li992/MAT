Notes to the fiNaNcial statemeNts 1 segmental analysis IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be determined based on the Groups internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM has been determined to be the Companys Board members as they are primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of performance of the segments.
The business is managed centrally by functional teams Demand, Supply, Procurement and Finance that have responsibility for the whole of the Groups product portfolio.
Although some discrete financial information is available to provide insight to the management team of the key performance drivers, the product group profit is not part of the CODMs review.
Management has judged that the continuing Group comprises one operating segment under IFRS 8.
As such, disclosures required under IFRS 8 for the financial statements are shown on the face of the consolidated income statement and balance sheet.
To assist the readers of the financial statements, management considers it appropriate to provide voluntary disclosure on a basis consistent with historical reporting of the cheese and functional ingredients product group and the butters, spreads and oils product group results included within the consolidated income statement.
In disclosing the product group profit for the year, certain assumptions have been made when allocating resources which are centralised at a group level.
The Other product group comprises revenue earned from distributing products for third parties and certain central costs net of recharges to the other product groups.
Generally, central costs less external Other revenue is recharged back into the product groups such that their result reflects the total cost base of the Group.
Other operating profit therefore is nil.
The results under the historical segmentation basis for the Group included in the financial information are as follows: 2017 2016 Note m m external revenue Cheese and Functional Ingredients 254.8 263.7 Butters, Spreads and Oils 150.7 152.6 Other 11.1 6.0 total product group external revenue continuing operations 416.6 422.3 Product group profit Cheese and Functional Ingredients 42.8 36.4 Butters, Spreads and Oils 25.5 29.6 total product group profit continuing operations 68.3 66.0 Finance costs 5 7.7 8.3 adjusted profit before tax continuing operations 60.6 57.7 Acquired intangible amortisation 2 0.4 0.4 Exceptional items 4 19.1 11.3 Other finance expense pensions 21 0.8 0.6 Group profit before tax continuing operations 40.3 45.4 2017 2016 m m total assets Cheese and Functional Ingredients 305.8 331.6 Butters, Spreads and Oils 150.5 147.2 Investments 0.5 Other 100.8 47.8 Total product group 557.1 527.1 Unallocated assets 137.9 total assets 557.1 665.0 Profit on operations before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles.
Adjusted profit before tax from continuing operations is presented as managements key Group profit measure because it excludes exceptional items and therefore gives a better indication of the underlying operational performance of the Group.
The calculations also exclude amortisation of acquired intangibles and pension interest in relation to the Groups defined benefit pension scheme, being dependent on market assumptions at 31 March each year.

Other product group assets comprise certain property, plant and equipment that is not reported in product groups.
Product group depreciation and amortisation excludes amortisation of acquired intangible assets of 0.4 million 2016: 0.4 million as these costs are not charged in the product group result.
Product group additions to non-current assets comprise additions to goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment through capital expenditure and acquisition of businesses.

84 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 4 exceptional items Exceptional items comprise those items that are material and one-off in nature that the Group believes should be separately disclosed to assist in the understanding of the underlying financial performance of the Group.
The exceptional items charge to the operating costs of the continuing operations are analysed below.
The exceptional items charged in relation to discontinued operations are analysed in Note 7.
2017 2016 operating costs m m Demineralised whey powder and GOS projects 19.0 16.2 Property provision 1.8 Spreads restructuring costs 0.7 Disposal costs in relation to closed manufacturing sites 2.3 21.3 17.3 Settlement gain in relation to Farmright Limited and Quadra Foods Limited 2.2 Gain on remeasurement to fair value of original investment in Promovita Ingredients Limited 6.0 19.1 11.3 Tax relief on exceptional items 2.8 3.0 Release of deferred tax liability in respect of industrial buildings 0.7 15.6 8.3 Demineralised whey powder and Gos projects The Group has completed an investment in its cheese creamery at Davidstow, Cornwall enabling the Group to manufacture demineralised whey powder, a base ingredient of infant formula, and  GOS, widely used in infant formula.
During the year 19.0 million of costs were charged to the income statement in relation to this project.
12.3 million related to commissioning of the facility of which 7.3 million was for the write-down of product produced during the commissioning process which did not meet the required standard to be considered for infant formula.
In addition, 5.8 million related to project review costs.
A further 0.9 million has been charged in respect of a financial liability relating to the project that did not meet the criteria for hedge accounting due to it being an ineffective hedge at 31 March 2017.
In the prior year 16.2 million of exceptional costs were incurred of which 5.3 million related to the commissioning and 6.5 million on project review costs.
A further 4.4 million was charged for set up costs.
The tax credit relating to this exceptional charge in the year was 3.1 million 2016: 2.7 million.
Management considers these costs to be exceptional due to the materiality and the one-off nature of the capital project to which they relate and do not expect any significant costs in relation to this project going forward.
Disposal costs in relation to closed manufacturing sites The Group has incurred costs of 2.3 million relating to the disposal of closed manufacturing sites in Totnes in Devon, Fenstanton in Cambridgshire and Crudgington in Shropshire.
Management has determined these properties to be held for sale at the 31 March 2017 and any future gains in respect of these properties will be treated as exceptional consistent with the historical closure costs.
The tax credit in relation to these costs was 0.1 million.
settlement gain in relation to farmright limited and Quadra foods limited On 9 May 2016, the Group paid 1.0 million in full and final settlement of claims arising out of the debt originally owed to Farmright Limited.
Claims between the Group, Farmright Limited and Quadra Foods Limited and any assignees of the claims are now resolved.
Following settlement, 2.1 million plus a provision for professional fees of 0.1 million which was no longer required, have been released.
Management considers this credit to be exceptional due to it being one-off in nature and in relation to the debt of Quadra Foods Limited, for which 4.3 million was provided for under an exceptional impairment provision in the year ended 31 March 2012.
The tax charge in relation to this release was 0.4 million.
Prior Year Property provision The Group commissioned a dilapidation assessment on some of its leasehold properties.
The 1.8 million exceptional charge represents an increase in provision for property dilapidation liabilities on properties where the Group considers there to be a high likelihood of exiting when the lease term expires.
The tax credit on this exceptional charge was 0.4 million.
spreads restructuring costs During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Group completed the consolidation of its spreads production operations into one site in Kirkby, Liverpool.
As a result of this consolidation, the site at Crudgington, Shropshire ceased production in December 2014.
The exceptional credit of 0.7 million in the year represents the release of a prior year provision relating to the completion of this project that was not required.
The tax charge relating to this exceptional credit was 0.3 million.
Gain on remeasurement to fair value of original investment in Promovita ingredients limited On 18 December 2015, the Group completed the stepped acquisition of Promovita Ingredients Limited Promovita.
In accordance with IFRS 3 Revised, the original investment was revalued to fair value at point of acquisition and the resulting gain of 6.0 million has been recognised within exceptional items.

The tax impact of the capitalised interest was 0.6 million 2016: 0.7 million.
6 tax expense continuing operations The major components of income tax expense for continuing operations for the years ended 31 March 2017 and 2016 are: 2017 2016 consolidated income statement m m Current income tax Deferred income tax Net utilisation of deferred tax asset 8.5 7.5 Effect of change in tax rate 0.5 0.2 Adjustment in respect of previous years deferred tax 0.8 0.4 7.2 6.9 Analysed: Before exceptional items 10.7 9.9 Exceptional items 3.5 3.0 7.2 6.9 There is no current tax charge in the year due to tax relief in respect of pensions contributions, capital allowances and in relation to the disposal of the Dairies operation in December 2015.
Reconciliation between the tax charge and the profit before tax multiplied by the statutory rate of corporation tax in the UK: 2017 2016 m m Profit before tax 40.3 45.4 Tax at UK statutory corporation tax rate of 20% 2016: 20% 8.1 9.1 Adjustments in respect of previous years 0.8 0.4 Adjustment for change in UK corporation tax rate 0.5 0.2 Non-deductible expenses 1.2 1.1 Profits offset by available tax relief 0.8 2.7 7.2 6.9 The effective pre-exceptional rate of tax on the Groups profit before tax from continuing operations is 18.0% 2016: 17.5%.
The total Group effective tax rate is below the headline rate of UK corporation tax at 17.9% 2016: 15.2%.
One of the reasons for this is the availability of capital losses for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised against profits of 3.0 million on the disposal of closed depots.
We expect the effective tax rate to remain below the headline rate of UK corporation tax next year due to the expected disposal of closed properties.
Two further reductions in the UK Corporation tax rate have been enacted, taking the rate to 19% from April 2017 and to 17% from April 2020.
Accordingly, deferred tax has been provided on all temporary differences at the rate in force when they are anticipated to reverse.
Discontinued operations The total income tax credit in respect of discontinued operations for the year ended 31 March 2017 is 9.8 million 2016: 35.7 million.
Tax relief on exceptional costs incurred by discontinued operations in the year ended 31 March 2017 was 5.7 million 2016: 28.8 million.
A 3.8 million tax credit has been realised in respect of the disposal of St Hubert SAS.
Tax attributable to discontinued operations is disclosed in Note 7.

This has been recognised within discontinued operations consistent with the results of St Hubert SAS following disposal.
costs associated with the separation and proposed sale of the Dairies operations In the prior year the Group incurred 8.9 million of separation costs such as one-off systems costs and professional fees.
A tax credit of 0.5 million has been recognised in the period 2016: 1.9 million.
Rationalisation of operating sites In September 2014, the Group announced it had started consultation with employees and their representatives regarding the closure of its glass bottling dairy in Hanworth, West London.
In the prior year, an exceptional charge of 1.7 million was incurred in the year, primarily comprising accelerated depreciation of assets following an assessment of their useful economic lives as well as other associated closure costs.
The Group ceased production at its specialist cream potting factory in Chard, Somerset in September 2015.
In the prior year a charge of 6.0 million was recognised in relation to site decommissioning and demolition costs.
The tax credit on these exceptional costs in the prior year was 0.3 million.
Net cash flows attributable to discontinued operations Net cash flows attributable to the Dairies operation in the period and comparative period are as follows: 2017 2016 m m Cash flow from operating activities 2.1 51.6 Cash used in investing activities 10.4 Net cash flows attributable to discontinued operations 2.1 62.0 8 earnings per share The basic earnings per share EPS measures for the year have been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders from the relevant operations continuing, discontinued and total Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding those held by the Dairy Crest Employees Share Ownership Plan Trust which are held as treasury shares and treated as cancelled.
The weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of basic EPS is detailed below along with the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares used for the calculation of diluted EPS.
The diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares reflects the dilutive impact of share options exercisable under the Groups share option schemes.
Note that in the circumstances where there is a basic loss per share from continuing operations, share options are anti-dilutive and therefore are not included in the calculation of any other EPS measures.

Goodwill recognised on the acquisition of Promovita Ingredients Limited is included in the Cheese and Functional Ingredients CGU as the business is directly linked to the Cheese and Functional Ingredients product group with a number of shared overheads.
All groups of CGUs with goodwill are tested for impairment annually by comparing the carrying amount of that CGU with its recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount is determined based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections based on financial budgets and strategic plans approved by senior management covering a three-year period and appropriate growth rates beyond that.
The discount rate applied to the projections was 6.5% for Butters and Spreads, MH Foods and Cheese and Functional Ingredients 2016: 6.0%.
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three-year period for Butters and Spreads, MH Foods and Cheese and Functional Ingredients is nil 2016: nil.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to groups of CGUs at 31 March 2017 is: MH Foods 6.7 million 2016: 6.7 million Butters and Spreads 65.5 million 2016: 65.5 million Cheese and Functional Ingredients 14.1 million 2016: 14.1 million Key assumptions on which management has based its cash flow projections Gross margin budgeted gross margins are based initially on actual margins achieved in the preceding year further adjusted for projected input and output price changes, volume changes, initiatives implemented and associated efficiency improvements.
The budgeted margins form the basis for strategic plans, which incorporate longer-term market trends.
Discount rates Discount rates are pre-tax and calculated by reference to average industry gearing levels, the cost of debt and the cost of equity based on the capital asset pricing model and CGU-specific risk factors.
Raw materials prices budgets are prepared using the most up to date price and forecast price data available.
This is based on forward prices in the market place adjusted for any contracted prices at the time of forecast.
The key resources are milk, vegetable oils, fuel oil, diesel, gas and electricity and packaging costs.
Growth rate estimates for periods beyond the length of the strategic plans, growth estimates are based upon published industry research adjusted downwards to reflect the risk of extrapolating growth beyond a three-year time frame.
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each CGU where appropriate and to be realistically achievable in the light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
2017 and 2016 sensitivity to changes in assumptions With regard to the assessment of value-in-use of the Butters and Spreads, MH Foods and Cheese and Functional Ingredients CGUs, management believes that no reasonably possible change in the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of those units to exceed their recoverable amount.

Defined Benefit Pension Scheme The Dairy Crest Group Pension Fund the Fund is a final salary defined benefit pension scheme, which was closed to future service accrual from 1 April 2010 and had been closed to new joiners from 30 June 2006.
This pension scheme is a final salary scheme.
The Fund is administered by a corporate trustee which is legally separate from the Company.
The Trustees directors comprise representatives of both the employer and employees, plus a professional trustee.
The Trustee is required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and is responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets plus the day to day administration of the benefits.
The Company and Trustee have agreed a long-term strategy for reducing investment risk as and where appropriate.
This includes an asset-liability matching policy which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the pension plan by investing in assets which perform in line with the liabilities of the plan so as to protect against inflation being higher than expected.
In December 2008 and June 2009, certain obligations relating to retired members were hedged by the purchase of annuity contracts.
During the financial year, a Flexible Retirement Option FRO exercise was carried out.
An offer enabling deferred pensioners aged 55 and over to take cash equivalent transfer values or trivial commutation lump sums, where applicable, with financial advice paid for by the company.
Transfer values totalling 16.7 million and trivial commutation lump sums totalling 0.1 million were accepted.
This resulted in a settlement gain before costs of 2.0 million, representing IAS19 liabilities extinguished of 18.8 million less amounts paid of 16.8 million.
UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Fund was carried out as at 31 March 2013 by the Funds independent actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Full actuarial valuations are carried out triennially.
This valuation resulted in a deficit of 145.0 million compared to the IAS19 deficit of 56.3 million reported at that date.
The next full actuarial valuation is currently being carried out on the 31 March 2016 position.
We expect the results of the valuation in the first half of 2017 18.
Under the latest schedule of contributions, which was signed in March 2014, the level of contributions is 13 million per annum from April 2014 to March 2016, then 16 million per annum until March 2017 and then 20 million per annum until March 2020.
Until June 2018, these contributions included 2.8 million per annum of rental payments for land and buildings that were subject to a sale and leaseback arrangement between the Group and the Fund as part of the final schedule of contributions.
The Group bought back the land and buildings for 8.3 million in November 2015 with rental payments ceasing from this date.
This reduced contributions payable to 11.8 million per annum to March 2016, 13.2 million per annum from April 2016 to March 2017, 17.2 million per annum from April 2017 until June 2018 and then 20 million per annum until March 2020.
A new schedule of contributions will be agreed with the Trustee following the next actuarial review as at 31 March 2016.
The Fund duration is an indicator of the weighted-average time until benefit payments are made.
For the Fund as a whole, the duration is around 20 years reflecting the approximate split of the defined benefit obligation including insured pensioners between deferred members duration of 27 years, current non-insured pensioners duration of 15 years and insured pensioners duration of 11 years.
The principal risks associated with the Groups defined benefit pension arrangements are as follows: Asset Volatility The liabilities are calculated using the discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The Fund holds a significant proportion in a range of return-seeking assets which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term, create volatility and risk in the short-term.
The allocation to return-seeking assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Funds long-term objectives.
Changes in Bond Yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Funds liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Funds bond holdings.
Inflation Risk A significant portion of the Funds benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher expected future inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in expected future inflation will also increase the deficit.
Longevity Risk The majority of the Funds obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in liabilities.
A contingent liability exists in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP.
The UK Government intends to implement legislation which could result in higher benefits for some members.
This would increase the defined benefit obligation of the Fund.
At this stage, it is not possible to quantify the impact of this change.

Includes obligations to deferred members of 676.9 million 2016: 541.9 million and non-insured members of 317.1 million 2016: 244.9 million.
The Group is entitled to any surplus on winding up of the Fund albeit refunds are subject to tax deductions of 35% at source.
Based on the present value of committed cash contributions at 31 March 2017 and the IAS 19 valuation at that date of 109.6 million, there would be nothing deducted from any notional surplus returned to the Group 2016: 12.1 million.
In the prior year this was recognised as an additional liability in accordance with IFRIC 14.
It should be noted that cash contributions are determined by reference to the triennial actuarial valuation, not the IAS 19 valuation.
The actuarial deficit is greater than that recognised under IAS 19 since liabilities are discounted by reference to gilt yields rather than high quality corporate bond yields.

102 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 21 Retirement benefit obligations continued The Group does not use any of the pension fund assets.
This is debt issued by emerging market countries denominated in the emerging markets domestic currency.
The debt is almost entirely issued by governments and not by corporations.
Investors benefit from higher yields on the bonds due to the a dditional risks of investing in emerging market countries, compared to developed countries and it is also expected that emerging market currencies will appreciate over time relative to developed countries.
Multi Asset Credit strategies invest globally in a wide range of credit-based asset classes which include bank loans, high yield bonds, securitised debt, emerging market debt and distressed debt of non-investment grade.
The investment strategies will also allocate amounts in investment grade credit, sovereign bonds and cash for defensive reasons.
The strategies are opportunistic and allocate dynamically to the best opportunities within the credit market from an asset allocation and individual security selection perspective.
Insurance linked securities are event-linked investments which allow investors outside the insurance industry to access insurance premiums for assuming various forms and degrees of insurance risk.
The underlying risk premium is a type of investment risk where the event is linked to natural or man-made catastrophes.
The premium paid to the investor represents compensation for the expected loss due to the uncertainty around the size and timing of the insured event.
Absolute Return Bond strategies are designed to deliver a positive return in all market environments and will take advantage of numerous alpha opportunities within the fixed income universe.
The objective of the strategy is to capture returns from active management in a number of areas within fixed income including interest rates, currencies, asset allocation and security selection.
The strategy will have long and short positions and employ a degree of leverage.
The strategies tend to have low sensitivity to the direction of interest rates and credit.
Insight have been appointed to manage the Liability Driven Investment LDI portfolio for the Fund.
The objective is to hedge a proportion of the Funds liabilities against changes in interest rates and inflation expectations by investing in assets that are similarly sensitive to changes in interest rates and inflation expectations.
Insight will seek to add interest and inflation exposure to the LDI portfolio over time in line with parameters that have been set by the Trustee.
Insight are permitted to use a range of swaps and gilt based derivative instruments as well as physical bonds to structure the liability hedge for the Fund.
In addition, Insight are responsible for monitoring market yields against a number of pre-set yield triggers and will increase the level of hedging as and when the triggers are met.
The principal assumptions used in determining retirement benefit obligations for the Fund are shown below: 2017 2016 2015 % % % Key assumptions: Price inflation RPI 3.3 3.2 3.1 Price inflation CPI 2.2 2.1 2.0 Pension increases Pre 1993 RPI to 7% annum 3.3 3.2 3.1 Pension increases 1993 to 2006 RPI to 5% annum 3.2 3.1 3.0 Pension increases Post 2006 RPI to 4% annum 3.0 2.9 2.8 Life expectancy at 65 for a male currently aged 50 years 24.1 24.0 23.9 Average expected remaining life of a 65 year old retired male years 22.5 22.4 22.4 Life expectancy at 65 for a female currently aged 50 years 27.0 26.9 26.8 Average expected remaining life of a 65 year old retired female years 24.8 24.7 24.6 Discount rate 2.4 3.5 3.4 The financial assumptions reflect the nature and term of the Funds liabilities.
The mortality assumptions are based on analysis of the Fund members, and allow for expected future improvements in mortality rates.
It has been assumed that members exchange 25% of their pension for a cash lump sum at retirement and 30% of deferred members take the Pension Increase Exchange option at retirement.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The key assumptions used for IAS 19 are discount rate, inflation and mortality.
If different assumptions were used, this could have a material effect on the results disclosed.
The sensitivity of the results to these assumptions is as follows: Expected Expense for 2017 18 Service Net Total P&L March 2017 Cost Interest Charge Deficit m m m m Current Figures 1.0 2.4 3.4 109.6 Effect of a 0.1% decrease in the discount rate 0.4 0.4 22.9 Recalculated value 1.0 2.8 3.8 132.5 Effect of a 0.1% increase in the inflation assumption 0.5 0.5 20.3 Recalculated value 1.0 2.9 3.9 129.9 Effect of a 1 year increase in life expectancy 1.0 1.0 41.6 Recalculated value 1.0 3.4 4.4 151.2 The above sensitivities assume that, with the exception of the annuity contracts, the Funds assets remain unchanged due to changes in assumptions, but in practice changes in market interest and inflation rates will also affect the value of the Funds assets.
The Company and Trustee have agreed a long-term strategy for reducing investment risk as and when appropriate.
This includes an asset-liability matching policy Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 103 The numbers Notes to the fiNANCiAl stAtemeNts CoNtiNueD 21 Retirement benefit obligations continued which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the Fund by investing in assets which perform in line with the liabilities of the Fund.
In December 2008 and June 2009, certain obligations relating to retired members were fully hedged by the purchase of annuity contracts.
The Funds other investments include matching assets which protect against changes in bond yields and against inflation risk.
The respective interest rate and inflation hedge ratios for these assets as at 31 March 2017 were both 36% of those obligations not covered by annuity contracts.
The Company recognises no liabilities on its balance sheet, or charges or credits in its income statement or statement of recognised income and expense in relation to the Fund.
The legal sponsor of the Fund is Dairy Crest Limited.
Defined Contribution Pension Scheme The Group has charged 2.0 million in respect of the Dairy Crest Group defined contribution scheme in the year ended 31 March 2017 2016: 2.1 million.

The reserve is not distributable.
The hedging reserve records the gains and losses on hedging instruments, to the extent that they are effective cash flow hedges.
Any gains and losses previously recorded in the hedging reserve are reclassified in profit and loss when the underlying hedged item affects profit and loss.
The translation reserve records exchange differences arising from the translation of the accounts of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries offset by the movements on loans and derivatives designated to hedge the net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
Parent Company As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no separate profit and loss account is presented for the Company.
The profit for the year dealt with in the accounts of the Company is 196.9 million 2016: 34.5 million, this included a profit on the sale of shares held in Dairy Crest Limited of 194.6 million and dividends received from subsidiary companies of nil 2016: 34.5 million.

Not all the retained earnings are distributable at this point as this is dependent on the proceeds for the sale being settled in cash, as is the Companys intention in the future.
In 1996 the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of Dairy Crest Limited.
Consideration was in the form of cash and the issue of 109.8 million ordinary shares of 25 pence each.
The fair value of the shares issued was estimated as 170.2 million.
The capital reserve of 142.7 million, shown in the statement of changes in equity, represents the difference between the fair value of shares issued and their nominal value of 27.5 million.
During the year these shares were sold to Dairy Crest UK Limited.
27 Share based payment plans Consolidated The Group has five share option schemes in operation.
The Dairy Crest Long Term Alignment Plan LTAP The LTAP is a long-term incentive scheme under which awards are made to Directors and senior managers consisting of the right to acquire shares for a nominal price.
The vesting period for grants made under this scheme is 50% of the award after 4 years and 50% after 5 years.
Pre-grant performance criteria determine the amount of any initial grant after which there are no significant performance conditions prior to vesting.
As such, these options are fair valued at 100% of the price at the date of the grant.
The Transformational Incentive Award TIA The TIA was granted, under the rules of the LTISP, in December 2014.
The TIA is a nil price option to acquire ordinary shares subject to certain performance objectives being met in addition to continuing employment.
The performance objectives relate to three categories detailed below: 1 managing the competition approval process relating to the proposed Dairies operation disposal: 2 appropriate reshaping of the Group, taking into account the competition approval process: and 3 establishing a successful future business, by reference to the development of the Group, including delivering value to shareholders.
The vesting period is three years from the date of grant.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
106 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 27 Share based payment plans continued Deferred Bonus Plan DBP Any bonus in excess of 50% of basic annual salary is deferred in share options with a vesting period of 3 years.
The only vesting condition is continuing employment.
The cost of these share options is based on the number of shares issued and the share price at the date of grant, spread over the vesting period.
During the year ended 31 March 2017, no deferred shares were awarded in relation to the year ended 31 March 2016 2016: none.
The Dairy Crest Long Term Incentive Share Plan LTISP This is a long-term incentive scheme under which awards are made to Directors and senior managers consisting of the right to acquire shares for a nominal price subject to the achievement of financial targets based on i total shareholder returns TSR over a three year period versus comparator companies and ii growth in adjusted basic earnings per share.

Options are granted at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares.
No financial performance criteria are attached to these options and they vest three years from the date of grant with an exercise period of six months.
During the current year 629,639 options were granted at 463 pence 2016: none.

The remaining weighted average contractual life of options outstanding at March 2017 is 7.8 years for the LTAP, 7.7 years for the TIA, 7.7 years for the DBP, 5.1 years for the LTISP and 2.2 years for the Sharesave Scheme 2016: LTAP 8.4 years, TIA 8.7 years, DBP 8.6 years, LTISP 6.1 years and Sharesave Scheme 1.8 years.
The fair value factor of the Sharesave Scheme options issued in May 2016 was 19.0% giving a fair value of 1.06 per option granted.
This has been computed using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The key assumptions used in the valuation model were expected share price volatility 24%, risk free rate of interest 0.61% and dividend yield 3.57%.
The volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Dairy Crest Group plc share price over a period commensurate with the expected option life, ending on the grant date of option.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 107 The numbers Notes to the fiNANCiAl stAtemeNts CoNtiNueD 27 Share based payment plans continued The fair value of TIA options issued on 23 December 2014 was 4.91 per option granted.

The lease does not end until July 2032, with break clauses in July 2022 and July 2027.
Muller UK & Ireland Group LLP have announced they intend to close the site in 2018, however any obligations are dependent on the intentions of the landlord in respect of the site.
The Directors are not quantifying the potential liability in respect of this obligation because to do so may be prejudicial to the interests of the Group as the matter may be subject to negotiation or judicial proceedings.
Litigation in relation to the capital project at Davidstow There are a number of contractual disputes in respect of the demineralised whey and GOS capital project at Davidstow which remain outstanding as of 31 March 2017.
In a number of instances, claims have been made by the Group, and in others, claims made against the Group.
To the extent that claims are being made by the Group, including the most significant ongoing dispute, the status of the resolution of these matters does not support recognition of an asset.
The Group has rebutted all claims against it, but nonetheless has accrued for professional fees on these claims.
In the case of both the claims made by the Group and those made against it, the Group is not disclosing detail of the claims due to the legal sensitivity of the matter.
In each instance, it is anticipated that the case will be resolved in the next financial year.
It is the opinion of the Directors that there is no significant financial liability that would require being provided for as at 31 March 2017.

30 Business combinations and disposals i Disposal of Discontinued Operations On 26 December 2015, the Group completed the disposal of its Dairies operation to Muller UK & Ireland Group LLP Mller.
The Dairies operation has therefore been classified as discontinued operations.
The disposal resulted in a post tax loss of 108.0 million which is analysed below.
The final consideration of 23.5 million comprised 54.5 million received in cash during the prior year net of 25.9 million which was provided for in the prior year but repaid to Mller in 2017.
The final consideration adjustment of 2.5 million was agreed in the current year.
The disposal resulted in a net cash outflow in the current year of 28.4 million 2016: 49.0 million inflow, after 5.5 million of professional fees.

In the prior year, the Group acquired the outstanding share capital of Promovita Ingredients Limited Promovita for a cash consideration of 6.0 million bringing its shareholding to 100%.
Promovita was established in 2014 as a joint venture between the Group and Fayrefield Foods Limited to develop and produce GOS, a prebiotic for use in infant formula.
In accordance with IFRS 3 Revised Business Combinations, the value of the previously held 50% shareholding has been restated to fair value at the acquisition date.
The difference between the fair value of the equity owned prior to acquisition of 6.0 million and the book value of the original investment of nil was recognised in the consolidated income statement, with the gain of 6.0 million reported in exceptional items under continuing operations.

31 Financial risk management objectives and policies The objective of the treasury function, which is accountable to the Board, is to manage the Groups and Companys financial risk, secure cost-effective funding for the Groups operations and to minimise the effects of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates on the value of the Groups and Companys financial assets and liabilities, on reported profitability and on cash flows.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts, loan notes, finance leases and cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions: principally cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout 2016 and 2017, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, price risk and credit risk.
Information on how these risks arise is set out below, as are the objectives, policies and processes agreed by the Board for their management and the methods used to measure each risk.
Derivative instruments are used to change the economic characteristics of financial instruments in accordance with the Groups treasury policies.
The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in the Accounting Policies note.
Liquidity risk The Groups objectives are: to ensure that forecast peak net borrowings, plus a prudent operating headroom are covered by committed facilities which mature after at least 12 months: to ensure that prudent headroom versus bank and loan note covenant ratios are forecast for the next three years: to maintain flexibility of funding by employing diverse sources of funds eg use of non-bank markets such as private placements : and to avoid a concentration of facility maturities in any particular year.
The maturity analysis of Group borrowings is set out in Note 20.
At 31 March 2017 the Groups total credit facilities amounted to 397.9 million 2016: 479.8 million excluding finance leases of 2.5 million 2016: 3.9 million and the impact of cross-currency swaps on US Dollar and Euro loan notes of 12.2 million 2016: 19.4 million.
The facilities at 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 consisted of: March 2017 240 million revolving credit facility of which 80 million will expire on 6 October 2018 and 160 million on 6 October 2020. loan notes totalling 157.9 million repayable between April 2017 and March 2026.
March 2016 240 million revolving credit facility of which 80 million will expire on 6 October 2018 and 160 million on 6 October 2020. loan notes totalling 239.8 million repayable between April 2016 and March 2026.
Undrawn revolving credit facilities at 31 March 2017 amounted to 112.0 million 2016: 135.0 million.
Effective headroom including cash and short-term deposits amounted to 132.9 million 2016: 235.3 million.
The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by closely managing cash generation by its operating businesses and by monitoring performance to budgets and forecasts.
Capital investment is carefully controlled, with detailed authorisation limits in place up to Executive level and cash payback criteria considered as part of the investment appraisal process.
Short-term and long-term cash and debt forecasts are constantly reviewed and there are regular treasury updates to the Executive highlighting facility headroom and net debt performance.
Day-to-day cash management utilises undrawn revolving credit facilities, overdraft facilities and occasionally short-term money market deposits if there is excess cash.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 111 The numbers Notes to the fiNANCiAl stAtemeNts CoNtiNueD 31 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk for changes in market interest rates relate primarily to the Groups long-term debt obligations with a floating interest rate.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.
The Groups long-term strategy is to keep between one third and three quarters of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest in the medium term.
To manage this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the Group has issued fixed coupon loan notes and also enters into interest rate swaps from time to time on a portion of its floating bank borrowings, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt interest cash flow obligations.
In the short-term the proportion of fixed and floating rate borrowings can go outside the long-term range.
At 31 March 2017, 55% of the Groups borrowings were at a fixed rate of interest 2016: 70%.
On 23 March 2016, the Group raised 76.1 million sterling equivalent by way of fixed coupon loan notes and on 4 April 2016 the Group repaid 80.2 million sterling equivalent of fixed coupon loan notes.
This resulted in a high percentage of fixed interest rate debt as at 31 March 2016.
In the medium term we expect the fixed proportion of borrowings to continue to be in the target range.
The Groups borrowing facilities require minimum interest cover of 3.0 times.
The Groups exposure to interest rate risk is shown by way of a sensitivity analysis in Note 32.
Foreign currency risk The Group has no significant operations outside the UK.
However it buys and sells a small amount of goods in currencies other than Sterling.
As a result the value of the Groups non-Sterling revenues, purchases, assets, liabilities and cash flows can be affected by movements in exchange rates predominantly Euro Sterling.
The Groups exposure to Euro Sterling is increasing due to the investment in demineralised whey production which is sold in Euros.
The Groups policy is to match foreign currency transaction exposures where possible and where appropriate the Group will use financial instruments in the form of forward foreign currency contracts to hedge future transaction and cash flows denominated in currencies other than Sterling.
The majority of the Groups transactions are carried out in the relevant entitys functional currency and therefore transaction exposures are currently limited.
It can be seen in Note 16 that the only significant non-Sterling trade receivables are in Euros.
In 2016 17, the Group began trading demineralised whey products in Euros resulting in an increase in trade receivables denominated in Euros from 1.0 million at 31 March 2016 to 2.3 million at 31 March 2017.
We expect this to increase further in 2017 18.
Currency exposures on other transactions, such as certain capital expenditure denominated in a foreign currency, are hedged following approval of the project using forward foreign exchange contracts.
In 2007, 2011 and 2016 the Group issued loan notes denominated either in $US, or.
Cross-currency swaps were implemented as required to hedge the interest and principal repayment cash flows.
These have the effect of fixing the liability and coupon in Sterling.
The principal amount and interest and principal payment dates on these swaps match those on the loan notes exactly and all swaps are with counterparties with strong credit ratings.
There is no profit and loss exposure in relation to $US or note debts as any retranslation impact on the profit and loss account is offset by reclassification of amounts from other comprehensive income into profit and loss.
Price risk The Group is exposed to price risk related to certain commodities and their by-products used by the Groups businesses.
The principal non-milk commodities that affect input prices for the Group are vegetable oils, gas, electricity, diesel, heavy fuel oil and crude oil by-products used in packaging.
The Group monitors prices on an ongoing basis in order to assess the impact that movements have on profitability and to assess whether the amount of forward cover is appropriate.
This includes vegetable oil contracts and energy, which is generally contracted one season in advance for both summer and winter energy but with some requirement contracted at more regular intervals.
The Group regularly reviews relevant commodity markets and levels of future cover.
Fixed price contracts are only entered into with the approval of the Commodity Risk Committee comprising senior operational and finance management and external advisers.
Credit risk It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
The Group only offers these terms to recognised, creditworthy third parties.
In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups history of bad debt losses is not significant.
Debtor days outstanding are closely monitored throughout the year and action is taken promptly when payment terms are breached.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other debtors excludes prepayments and certain derivative instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The maximum exposure for the Group is equal to the carrying amount of these financial assets of 62.1 million 2016: 158.2 million.
All revolving credit facility borrowings are through banks with long-term credit ratings of A or above.
Funds temporarily surplus to business requirements are invested through deposit accounts with mainstream UK commercial banks with a credit rating of A or better.
The Group currently has no requirement to place deposits for long periods, accordingly counterparty risk is considered to be acceptable.
Derivative financial instruments are contracted with a range of banks with long-term credit ratings of A or above to avoid excessive concentration of financial instruments with one counterparty.
112 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 31 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains an appropriate level of gearing in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
In addition, the Group monitors its forecast net debt to EBITDA ratios in order that they are comfortably within its banking covenant requirements.
The maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio for the purposes of bank covenants is 3.5 times though the Directors target a ratio of below 2 times.
At 31 March 2017 the ratio of net debt to EBITDA was 2.94 times March 2016: 2.69 times.
The Group monitors its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions or changes in Group structure.
Possible mechanisms for changing capital structure include adjusting the level of dividends, issuance of new shares or returning capital to shareholders.
No significant changes in capital structure have been implemented in the year ended 31 March 2017 or the prior year.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by shareholders funds.
The analysis of net debt is included in Note 34.
The gearing ratio at 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 can be analysed as follows: 2017 2016 m m Net debt 249.8 229.0 Shareholders funds 71.9 134.2 Gearing ratio 347% 171% Dividends Details of dividends paid and proposed during the year are given in Note 9.
The dividend policy is to maintain a progressive dividend whilst seeking to maintain a level of dividend cover between 1.5 and 2.5 times.
The final proposed dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2017 is 16.3 pence, up 0.3 pence from last year 2016: 16.0 pence.
Total dividends paid and proposed in respect of the year ended 31 March 2017 amount to 22.5 pence 2016: 22.1 pence.

Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Interest rate risk The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no material impact on the Groups equity resulting from movements in interest rates other than in relation to the $US GBP and EUR GBP cross-currency swaps used as a cash flow hedge on $US and EUR loan notes.
The impact on equity is nil over the life of the instruments as these swaps comprise an effective hedge.
At 31 March 2017, 55% of Group borrowings were at fixed rates of interest 2016: 70% see Note 30.
The sensitivity analysis below excludes all non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes non-derivative floating rate financial instruments except those where interest rate swaps have been used as cash flow hedges.
This is due to the fact that gains and losses on the hedging instrument offset losses and gains on the non-derivative floating rate financial instrument which are subject to the hedge and are matched in both profit and loss and cash terms.
No non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments have profit and loss exposure due to floating rates as a result of interest rate swaps.
The 2017 analysis below reflects lower reasonably possible changes in interest rates to 2016 upside LIBOR expectations assumed last year were not realised and the assumption is that base rates will increase less than anticipated at March 2016.

114 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 32 Financial instruments continued Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The carrying amounts and the fair values of all of the Groups financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements are the same, with the exception of the loan notes.
The carrying amount of the loan notes was 157.9 million 2016: 239.8 million and the fair value was 156.4 million 2016: 231.0 million.
The fair value of borrowings has been calculated based on the principles of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement under Hierachy Level 2, by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
Cross currency swaps The notional principal amount of the outstanding $US GBP cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2017 was $126.3 million 101.0 million 2016: $249.4 million 173.5 million.
These cross currency swaps have both legs at fixed interest rates, are designated as cash flow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
Any gains losses arising from fair value adjustments deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement finance costs during the next six years being the life of the swaps.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding EUR GBP cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2017 was 10.7 million 9.2 million 2016: 10.7 million 8.5 million.
The loss deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement finance costs during the next year being the life of the swaps.
Forward currency contracts The Group enters into certain forward currency contracts in order to hedge the Sterling cost of currency-denominated future purchases and receipts.
The forward currency purchases in place at 31 March 2017 do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting and the loss in respect of these has been recognised within the income statement.
Borrowing facilities The Group has undrawn committed long-term borrowing facilities available at 31 March 2017 of 112.0 million 2016: 135.0 million in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date.
