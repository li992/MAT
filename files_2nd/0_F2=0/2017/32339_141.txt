Awards under the ISP are valued using Monte Carlo simulations.
TSRs are generated for BT and the comparator group at the end of the three-year performance period, using each companys volatility and the cross correlation between pairs of stocks.
Volatility has been determined by reference to BTs historical volatility which is expected to reflect the BT share price in the future.
An expected life of three months after vesting date is assumed for Employee Saveshare options.
For all other awards the expected life is equal to the vesting period.
The risk-free interest rate is based on the UK gilt curve in effect at the time of the grant, for the expected life of the option or award.
The fair values for the DBP were determined using the market price of the shares at the grant date.
The weighted average share price for DBP awards granted in 2016 17 was 421p 2015 16: 451p, 2014 15: 393p.
