Strategic report Governance Financial statements 6.2 Equity transactions Accounting policy When there is a change in ownership of a subsidiary without a change in control, the difference between the consideration paid received and the relevant share of the carrying amount of net assets acquired disposed of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.
The carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary.
Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid is recognised directly in equity.

6.3 Disposals The Group continues to make disposals in order to further progress towards a portfolio of integrated cross-media marketing and communication services designed to serve specific commercial and professional communities.
These disposals have generated resources to invest in activities that are closely linked to the Groups strategic priorities.
Disposals are disclosed as part of the Groups discontinued operations when they represent a single major line of business or geographical area of operations, as required by IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations.
Accounting policy When the Group disposes of, or loses control, joint control or significant influence over a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, it derecognises the assets including goodwill and liabilities of the entity, the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest and any cumulative translation differences recorded in equity.
The fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any investment retained is recognised.
The resulting gain or loss for disposals not disclosed as discontinued operations is recognised in profit or loss within other operating income expense or in exceptional items if the gain or loss is material.

A disposal group consists of assets that are to be disposed of, by sale or otherwise, in a single transaction together with the directly associated liabilities.
Goodwill arising from business combinations is included for cash generating units which are part of the disposal group.
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets or components of a disposal group are remeasured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Any impairment on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill and then to remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis.
Impairment on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in the income statement.
Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment.
No amortisation or depreciation is charged on non-current assets including those in disposal groups classified as held for sale.
Assets classified as held for sale are disclosed separately on the face of the statement of financial position and classified as current assets or liabilities, with disposal groups being separated between assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale.
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2017 142 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 6.4 Discontinued operations and assets held for sale continued 2016 discontinued operations As disclosed in Section 1, the sale of the PR Newswire businesses was completed during 2016.
PR Newswire was recognised as discontinued at 31 December 2016.
During 2017, the Group has recognised an additional 7.8m gain on disposal of PR Newswire primarily due to the release of warranties and indemnities recognised in accordance with specific clauses in the sale agreement.
This gain has been recognised as an exceptional item for discontinued operations for the year ended 31 December 2017.
The gain has a 2.0 pence impact on basic and diluted earnings per share and no cash flow effect.
The results of the discontinued operations which have been included in the consolidated income statement in 2016 were as follows: PR Newswire 2016 m Revenue 103.0 Other operating income 0.1 Operating expenses 75.2 Share of results from joint ventures and associates 0.2 Adjusted operating profit from discontinued operations 28.1 Amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions Exceptional operating items 390.2 Profit before tax from discontinued operations 418.3 Attributable tax 1.8 Exceptional tax items 1.1 Profit for the year from discontinued operations 415.4 Earnings per share for discontinued operations Basic 98.2 Diluted 97.2 Net cash flows attributable to discontinued operations Net cash from operating activities 20.9 Net cash from investing activities 3.9 Net cash from financing activities 26.9 Net cash flows attributable to discontinued operations 9.9 The PR Newswire exceptional item was the profit on disposal of 389.1m which included: 34.8m of disposal costs for services incurred relating to the disposal.
The costs included broker fees, management transaction bonuses, legal advice and warranties and indemnities recognised in accordance with specific clauses in the sale agreement: and 20.4m foreign exchange loss on the fair value measurement of a deal contingent forward used to fix the US dollar proceeds into sterling which was in addition to a 21.0m loss recognised in 2015.
Consistent with the accounting treatment adopted for a similar instrument taken out for the Advanstar acquisition, hedge accounting was not applied.
In addition, included in discontinued operations was an 8.2m charge for the settlement of the Axio legal dispute in respect of the Delta disposal after specific provisions, recoveries and legal costs.
The total net exceptional credit for discontinued operations in 2016 was 380.9m.

The defined benefit schemes included in the following disclosures are: i UK schemes: the UBM Pension Scheme UBMPS and the United Newspapers Executive Pension Scheme UNEPS : and ii US schemes: CMP Post Retirement Medical Plan.
Both the UK plans are final salary pension plans, which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on members length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement.
All the liabilities in the schemes relate to members who are deferred members, and pensions in payment.
The UBMPS was closed to future accrual in 2016.
Responsibility for governance of the plans including investment decisions and contribution schedules lies jointly with the Company and the Board of Trustees.
The Board of Trustees must comprise one-third nominated by the plan members and the remainder are appointed by the company and can include independent appointees, in accordance with the plans regulations.
Deferred members benefits and pensions in payment are increased by a fixed amount or updated in line with RPI or CPI inflation in accordance with the specific rules applying to the members' scheme section.
Plan assets are held in Trusts and are invested in accordance with the Statement of Investment Principles.
Every three years, in accordance with legislation, the Board of Trustees reviews the level of funding of the pension plans and the level of contribution required by the Group to clear the deficit.
Following the 2014 funding valuation, the Group agreed to make special contributions to the UK pension schemes of 2.5m per annum until June 2019.
This contribution schedule remains in place until the 2017 funding valuations are finalised, which is expected in the first half of 2018.
The following initiatives have taken place in the UBMPS scheme in 2017 in line with Government pension freedom flexibilities, to give members greater access to their pension: Pension Increase Exchange allows pensioners to exchange some of their future annual increases for a one-off uplift in pension, supported by independent financial advice.
This option has now been implemented as an option for pensions at the point of retirement.
The exchange results in the scheme liabilities and deficit being reduced and a past service credit in the income statement.
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2017 144 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 7.2 Retirement benefit obligations continued Accounting policy For the defined contribution schemes, the contributions paid or payable in respect of employee service rendered during the accounting period are recognised as an expense in that period.
For the defined benefit pension schemes, the liability for the benefits earned by employees in return for service rendered in the current and prior periods is determined using the projected unit credit method as determined annually by qualified actuaries.
This is based upon a number of assumptions, the determination of which is significant to the valuation.
The following are charged to operating profit: the net finance expense measured using the discount rate applied in measuring the defined benefit obligation: the increase in the present value of pension scheme liabilities arising from employee service in the current period current service cost : the increase in the present value of pension scheme liabilities as a result of benefit improvements over the period during which such improvements vest past service cost : gains and losses arising on settlements curtailments: and scheme administration costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Defined benefit pension surpluses are recognised when scheme rules indicate that such surpluses are recoverable as either an unconditional right to refund if the scheme were to be wound up or reductions in future contributions.
The availability of refunds or reductions of future contributions takes into account any minimum funding requirement of the UK defined benefit schemes.
Any tax expense arising on refunds is deducted from any surplus recognised.
Any gains or losses arising on the recognition of defined benefit plan surpluses or adjustments to such surpluses are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Defined contribution schemes The expense for the year for defined contribution schemes was 4.3m 2016: 3.0m.
Defined benefit schemes The preliminary results for the 2017 actuarial funding valuations for the UK schemes were updated to 31 December 2017 for accounting purposes by qualified actuaries.
Assumptions and sensitivities Principal actuarial assumptions used in determining pension obligations for the Groups UK schemes: UK UK schemes schemes 2017 2016 m m Discount rate 2.50 2.70 Future salary increases n a n a Weighted average pension increases 2.90 3.25 Retail price inflation 3.15 3.25 Consumer price inflation 2.15 2.25 At 31 December 2017, the discount rate is determined by discounting the estimate future cash flows using interest rates of corporate bonds with an AA rating and that have terms to maturity approximate to the terms of the related pension liability.
The life expectancy rates used are 105% of the SAPS S2 tables based on the year of birth of scheme members, which is currently on average 1943 for pensioners and 1958 for non-pensioners.
Allowances for future changes in mortality rates are in line with the CMI 2016 projections with a 1% p. a. long term trend rate 2016: CMI 2015 projections with a 1% p. a. long term trend rate.
These projections allow for life expectancy to improve over time due to improvements in medical treatments and other lifestyle factors such that younger members who have not yet reached pensionable age are expected to live longer than current pensioner members.
The assumed average life expectancy of current pensioner members at age 65 is 21.7 years for males and 23.7 years for females 2016: 21.7 years and 23.8 years respectively.
For current non-pensioner members aged 45, the assumed average life expectancy at age 65 is 22.8 years for males and 24.8 years for females 2016: 23.0 years and 25.3 years respectively.
The average rate of improvement underlying the standard tables is an increase of approximately 0.8 years life expectancy in every 10 years 2016: 0.8 years.
For the valuation of US scheme liabilities, the 2016 valuation has been maintained.
RP 2014 mortality tables and MP 2014 longevity improvements model have been used.
The assumed average life expectancy of current pensioner members at age 65 is 21.6 years for males and 23.8 years for females 2016: 21.6 years and 23.8 years respectively.
Non-pensioner members are assumed to take cash lump sums at retirement.
Additional assumptions used for valuing the UK scheme liabilities are an allowance for all non-pensioners to take 25% of pension as tax-free cash upon retirement 2016: 25%.
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2017 145 Section 7: Employee benefits continued 7.2 Retirement benefit obligations continued Assumptions and sensitivities The discount rate, assumed salary increases and assumed mortality all have a significant effect on the measurement of the defined benefit obligation.
The sensitivity of the valuation to changes in these assumptions is as follows: Impact on Impact on deficit deficit 2017 2016 m m 0.25 percentage point decrease to discount rate 19.8 25.0 0.25 percentage point increase to discount rate -19.8 -24.0 1 0.25 percentage point increase to inflation including pension increases linked to inflation 8.5 13.0 1 0.25 percentage point decrease to inflation including pension increases linked to inflation -8.4 -13.0 One year increase to life expectancy 24.9 20.0 One year decrease to life expectancy -24.9 -21.0 1 Inflation includes the effects of RPI and CPI.
The sensitivity analyses above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period.
Risks and uncertainties Plan assets are mainly invested in equities, bonds, gilts, property and diversified growth funds and are exposed to the risks outlined below: Asset volatility The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if plan assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The UBMPS holds a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform bonds in the long term while providing volatility and risk in the short term.
The Group believes that due to the long term nature of the plan liabilities and the strength of the supporting group, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the Groups long term strategy to manage the plans efficiently.
Some of the UBMPS assets are invested in Diversified Growth Funds.
These funds invest in a wide range of assets including equities, bonds, commodities and cash.
These actively managed funds aim to provide equity-like returns over the medium to long term, but with less volatility.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans bond holdings.
Inflation Risk Some of the Group pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation.
Within the plans assets are some UK government bonds linked to inflation however the majority of the plans assets are either unaffected by inflation or loosely correlated with inflation equities, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the plans obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.

Approximately 38.0% of the UK plan assets are held in a combination of government bonds, credit, LIBOR and bespoke Liability Driven Investment LDI funds.
The objective of this allocation is to provide protection against the impact of interest rate and inflation movements as well as giving an expected return above government yield bonds.
The LDI fund is a unit fund invested with Legal & General, and the underlying investments include derivatives.
The LDI portfolio is designed to match approximately 60% of the interest rate and inflation exposure of the UK Pension Scheme liabilities.
The illiquid credit fund is managed by M&G, with underlying investments in a variety of credit instruments.
The investment objective of the fund is a total return of three month LIBOR plus 5% over a 5 year investment period net of fees.
Diversified growth funds DGFs are multi-asset funds held with Newton and Schroder.
The DGF allocation contains a variety of underlying asset classed including equities, bonds and alternative assets and seeks to achieve long term equity type returns but with lower volatility.
By appointing a DGF manager, asset allocation decisions are delegated to the fund manager.
