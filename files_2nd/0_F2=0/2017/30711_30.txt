e Capital Risk Management The Companys capital consists of equity and net cash.
Net cash comprises cash at bank, loans receivable from subsidiaries and borrowings.
It is managed with the aim of maintaining an appropriate level of financing available for the Companys activities, having due regard to interest rate risks and the availability of borrowing facilities.
Changes in equity arise from the retention of earnings and from issues of share capital.
Net cash is monitored on a periodic basis.
Atthe year end, capital comprised: 2017 2016 $m $m Total equity 712.3 687.2 Cash at bank 4.5 Loans receivable from subsidiaries note C5 275.2 245.6 Net cash 275.2 250.1 Capital employed 437.1 437.1 The increase in total equity during the year is mainly attributable to the retained profit for the year of $13.6m and an increase in the share-based payments reserve of $11.6m.
During March 2017, the Groups treasury function put in place a sweeping arrangement with the Company, such that at the end of each day any balances in its bank accounts are swept to the treasury function, with a corresponding increase in the loan balance with subsidiaries.
As a result, at the end of the year, cash at bank is $nil.
The loans receivable from subsidiaries increased during the year following the receipt of a dividend of $9.7m from a subsidiary and the sweeping arrangement in place with the treasury function.
There have been no significant changes in the Companys funding policy during the year.
Financial Instruments: Sensitivity Analysis The following sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Companys financial instruments and show the impact on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
Financial instruments affected by market risk include non-current receivables from subsidiaries, cash at bank and borrowings.
The sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at 31 December 2017.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of provisions and on non-financial assets and liabilities.
The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have an asymmetric impact on the Companys results, that is, an increase inrates does not result in the same amount of movement as a decrease in rates.
For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to be outstanding for the whole year.
The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost do not change as interest rates change.
a Interest Rate Sensitivity The post-tax impact on the income statement, with all other variables held constant, at 31 December 2017, for an increase of 0.75% 2016 0.5% in US interest rates, is to increase profits by $1.7m 2016 $1.0m.
If the US interest rates were to decrease by 0.75% 2016 0.5%, then the post-tax impact would be to reduce profits by $1.7m 2016 $1.0m.
The movements arise on US dollar denominated intra-group loans.
There is no impact on OCI for a change in interest rates.
HUNTING PLC 149 2017 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED C10.
Financial Instruments: Sensitivity Analysis continued b Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity The post-tax impact on the income statement, with all other variables held constant, at 31 December 2017, for an increase or decrease of 10% 2016 15% in the Sterling foreign exchange rate, is not material.
The movement in the income statement arises from Sterling denominated accruals, other payables and borrowings, offset by Sterling loans receivable from subsidiaries.
There is no impact on OCI for a change in foreign exchange rates.
