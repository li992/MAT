No changes have been made to asset lives during the year.
In previous years, fully depreciated assets have been retained in the Companys fixed asset register.
In order to provide greater understanding of the Companys annual depreciation charge, assets which have become fully depreciated in the year have been removed from both cost and accumulated depreciation.
Included in the note above is an amount of 839m 2016: 843m relating to non-depreciable land and 2m 2016: 6m of assets under construction.
The cost of assets held under finance leases at 29 January 2017 is 354m 2016: 353m, with related accumulated depreciation of 158m 2016: 143m.
The cost of financing asset developments prior to them being ready for use has been included in the cost of the project.
The cumulative amount of interest capitalised in the total cost above amounts to 73m 2016: 73m.
Interest is capitalised at the effective interest rate of 5% 2016: 5% incurred on borrowings.
The Company considers that each store is a separate cash generating unit CGU and therefore considers every store for an indication of impairment annually.
The Company calculates each stores recoverable amount and compares this amount to its book value.
The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal.
If the recoverable amount is less than the book value, an impairment charge is recognised.
The methodology applied by the Company is the same methodology as applied by the Group, see note 3.3 for further details.
Having applied the methodology and assumptions, the Company has recognised a net impairment charge of 29m during the year 2016: nil 88m impairment charge offset by 59m impairment reversal.
This movement reflects fluctuations expected from store level trading performance and local market conditions.
