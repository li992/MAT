Impaired loans are all loans including loans subject to forbearance for which an impairment provision has been established: for collectively assessed loans, impairment loss provisions are not allocated to individual loans and the entire portfolio is included in impaired loans.
Accruing loans past due 90 days or more comprises loans past due 90 days where no impairment loss is expected.
The coverage ratio reduces if the loan written-off carries a higher than average provision and increases if the loan written-off carries a lower than average provision.
2 Impaired loans at 31 December 2017 include 1,324 million 2016 - 2,496 million: 2015 - 2,300 million of loans subject to forbearance granted during the year.

This category is used for advances which are not past due 90 days or revolving credit facilities where identification as 90 days overdue is not feasible.

Therefore impaired assets which are highly collateralised, such as mortgages, will have a low coverage ratio of provisions held against the reported impaired balance.
366 Additional information Forbearance The table below shows loans granted forbearance during the year.
These loans are unimpaired: either the loan was performing before and after the granting of forbearance or the loan was non-performing before but subsequently transferred to the performing book.
Loans with impairment provisions subject to forbearance continue to be reported as impaired loans.
