Financials Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 1 JULY 2017 1 Segmental reporting The Group has one reportable segment, in accordance with IFRS 8 - Operating Segments, which is the retail of homewares in the UK.
Customers access the Groups offer across multiple channels and often their journey involves more than one channel.
Therefore internal reporting focuses on the Group as a whole and does not identify individual segments.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Executive Board of Directors of Dunelm Group plc.
Internal management reports are reviewed by them on a monthly basis.
Performance of the segment is assessed based on a number of financial and nonfinancial KPIs as well as on profit before taxation.
Management believe that these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions.
All material operations of the reportable segment are carried out in the UK.
The Groups revenue is driven by the consolidation of individual small value transactions and as a result, Group revenue is not reliant on a major customer or group of customers.
2 Acquisition On 28 November 2016 the Group acquired the whole of the trade and certain assets and liabilities of the Worldstores Group Worldstores Limited in administration, Kiddicare Limited in administration and Achica Limited in administration for a cash consideration of 1 through Globe Online Limited, a 100% owned subsidiary of Dunelm Limited.
A payment of 7.5m was made to a secured creditor as part of the terms of the acquisition.
The Worldstores Group was one of the UKs largest online retailers of products for the home and garden, with over 300,000 products on the site.
Achica is a members-only online store offering furniture, homewares and accessories, often at significant discounts to RRPs for limited periods through flash sales.
Kiddicare is a multichannel retailer, selling nursery supplies and merchandise for children and young families.
The Group anticipates significant benefits to be realised from the acquisition, particularly in relation to: z A next day delivery proposition for a much wider range of products, including furniture: z Ability to offer an improved two-man, owned and branded delivery service that is more reliable for customers and cheaper to operate: z Potential to offer Kiddicare products in Dunelm stores and to a greater number of customers online: and z Access to a new proprietary technology platform that will enable much faster development of products and services for customers.
The purchase has been accounted for as a business combination.
The provisional fair value amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, are set out below.
The Group anticipates full cash collection of all receivables acquired.

indd 125 06 10 2017 12:12:14 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements CONTINUED FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 1 JULY 2017 2 Acquisition continued Since the acquisition date, the acquiring company, Globe Online Limited, generated revenues of 54.5m and made an operating loss of 10.7m before exceptional items.
Exceptional items of 16.9m relating to the acquisition and subsequent integration are set out in note 3.
If the acquisition had taken place on 3 July 2016, the Group adjusted operating profit would have been reduced by a further 10.4m and revenue would have been increased by a further 53.7m.
On 1 July 2017, the trade and net assets of Globe Online Limited were transferred to another Group company, Dunelm Soft Furnishings Limited, the main trading entity of the Group at nil gain or loss.
All assets and liabilities were transferred at book value.
3 Exceptional items Exceptional items have arisen as a result of the acquisition and subsequent integration of the Worldstores Group as set out in note 2.
2016 2017 52 weeks 52 weeks m m Acquisition costs administrator fees 0.9 Acquisition costs other professional fees 0.4 Welcome payments for continuation of supply 7.3 Fair value adjustments in respect of acquired inventory 0.5 Key management retention bonuses 2.7 Asset write-offs, impairments and accelerated depreciation 2.9 Other integration costs 2.2 16.9 Capital acquisition of 1.3m costs includes 0.9m of the administrators fees and 0.4m of other professional advisory costs in relation to the acquisition of the Group from administration.
Welcome payments of 7.3m were made to suppliers to ensure continuation of supply and were part of the expected initial working capital outflow.
Fair value adjustments in respect of acquired inventory have unwound as the inventory has been sold.
Key management retention bonuses are potentially payable over a three-year period, and have both retention and performance conditions attached.
As a result of the acquisition, a review of the websites and other intangible IT assets of both the existing Dunelm business and the acquired business has been undertaken.
Decisions have been made to integrate the available assets, and as a result, certain assets have been written off and others useful economic lives have been reduced resulting in accelerated depreciation.
Such cost items have been judged as exceptional and one-off in nature and not part of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
Other integration costs include professional advisory support, and costs associated with the exit of the Peterborough site and transfer into Stoke of the Kiddicare and Achica logistics operations.
Of the above exceptional cost items, 11.3m are cash outflows in the period.
Exceptional costs items of approximately 7m are anticipated in the next financial year, of which approximately 3-4m will be cash outflows.

Further changes were announced in the Chancellors budget on 16 March 2016 reducing the UK corporation tax by a further 1% to 17% from 1 April 2020, enacted in September 2016.

The dividend will be paid on 24 November 2017 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 3 November 2017.
In the prior year, the Group made a special distribution to shareholders.
The amount paid to shareholders on 24 March 2016 was 31.5 pence per share, which equated to 63.8m.
The Board became aware during the period of a technical issue in respect of the final dividend of 16 pence per share paid on 27 November 2015.
Whilst the Company had sufficient profits and other distributable reserves to pay this dividend, it had not filed relevant accounts to demonstrate this at the time that the dividend was paid.
The Company has taken the steps needed to i appropriate the November 2015 dividend to the distributable profits of the Company as set out in the Annual Report and Accounts of the Company made up to 2 July 2016 and adopted by its shareholders on 22 November 2016: and ii ensure that all potentially affected parties are placed so far as possible in the position in which they were always intended to be, had the relevant procedures been complied with.
This required shareholder approval which was obtained on 7 March 2017.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary Shares during the period.

All amortisation is included within operating costs in the income statement.
During the year, the Group acquired the rights to the Worldstores, Achica and Kiddiecare brands which will be amortised over a five year period.
The Worldstores brand has subsequently been impaired as a result of decisions taken by management to phase out the brand as it is fully integrated into the existing Dunelm business.
In the prior year, the Group acquired the Fogarty brand which is being amortised over 15 years.
Assets acquired on the acquisition of the Worldstores Group have been depreciated over the remaining useful economic life of the asset.

indd 133 06 10 2017 12:12:15 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements CONTINUED FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 1 JULY 2017 18 Financial risk management The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
A formal process for reviewing and managing risk in the business is in place.
There are no changes to exposures to risk and how they arise and the Group objectives, policies and procedures for managing the risk and methods used to measure the risk from the previous period.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Groups deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as foreign exchange hedging agreements with its banking counterparties.
The Group only deals with creditworthy counterparties and uses publicly available financial information to rate its counterparties, and as such, credit risk is considered to be low.
Group policy is that surplus funds are placed on deposit with counterparties approved by the Board, with a minimum of A credit rating.
Credit limits with approved counterparties are limited to 25m for any individual party.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of financial assets.
At the period end the maximum exposure is detailed in the table below.
2016 2017 m m Cash and cash equivalents 17.4 14.9 Trade and other receivables 4.3 3.2 Derivative financial instruments 1.1 7.6 Total financial assets 22.8 25.7 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and extreme circumstances.
The Group manages this risk by continuously monitoring cash flow forecasts.
Further details of the Groups available facilities can be found in note 19.
The table below analyses estimated future contractual cash flows in respect of the Groups financial liabilities, according to the earliest date on which the Group could be required to settle the liability.
Floating rate interest payments are estimated based on market interest rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.

indd 134 06 10 2017 12:12:15 Financials Interest rate risk The Groups bank borrowings incur variable interest rate charges.
The Groups policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of its financial covenants.
The Group will continue to monitor movements in the interest rate swap market.
At the year end, if Libor interest rates had been 10 basis points higher lower with all other variables held constant, post tax profit would have been 0.1m lower higher 2016: 0.1m as a result of higher lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings.
Foreign currency risk All of the Groups revenues are in pounds sterling.
The majority of purchases are also in sterling, but some goods purchased direct from overseas suppliers are paid for in US dollars, accounting for just under 20% of stock purchases in the period ended 1 July 2017.
The Group uses various means to cover its exposure to US dollars: holding US dollar cash balances and taking out forward foreign exchange contracts for the purchase of US dollars.
All the Groups foreign exchange transactions are designed to satisfy US dollar denominated liabilities.
The maximum level of hedging coverage which will be undertaken is 100% of anticipated expenditure on a three-month horizon, stepping down to 75% on a nine to 12-month horizon.
Coverage beyond 12 months is minimal.
Cash flow hedges are in place to manage foreign exchange rate risk arising from forecast purchases denominated in US dollars.
At the balance sheet date, the fair value of US dollar foreign exchange forward contracts held in cash flow hedges was 0.9m liability 2016: 7.2m asset which relates to a commitment to purchase $140.0m 2016: $90.5m for a fixed sterling amount.
A fair value movement of 1.4m 2016: 10.3m was recognised in other comprehensive income and no ineffectiveness 2016: nil was noted on cash flow hedges during the period.
In the period, a gain of 9.5m 2015: 2.9m gain was recycled from the cash flow hedge reserve to inventory to offset foreign exchange movements on purchases.
The remaining hedge reserve balance will be recycled to the income statement to offset future purchases occurring after the balance sheet date, the majority of which expire in the next 12 months.
The outstanding US dollar liabilities at the period end were $0.3m 2016: $0.4m.
In the event of a significant adverse movement in the US dollar exchange rate, the Group could seek to minimise the impact on profitability by changing the selling price of goods, renegotiating terms with suppliers or sourcing from alternative markets.
At the year end, if GBP had strengthened by 10% against USD with all other variables held constant, post tax profit would have been 0.2m higher 2016: 0.2m as a result of foreign exchange gains on translation of USD denominated trade payables compensated by foreign exchange losses on translation of USD cash and cash equivalents.
Other components of equity would have been 7.7m lower 2016: 5.0m lower as a result of a decrease in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges.
Conversely, if GBP had weakened by 10% against USD with all other variables held constant, post tax profit for the year would have been 0.2m lower 2016: 0.2m and other components of equity would have been 9.4m higher 2016: 6.1m higher.
The US dollar period end exchange rate applied in the above analysis is 1.3002 2016: 1.3265.
Capital management The Company considers equity plus debt as the capital.
There are no externally imposed capital requirements on the Company.
The Boards objective with respect to capital management is to ensure the Group continues as a going concern in order to optimise returns to shareholders.
The Boards policy is to retain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development.
The Board regularly monitors the level of capital in the Group to ensure that this can be achieved.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market.
The shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Groups share option programmes.
The Board has authorised a share purchase programme designed to ensure that all options expected to vest under share option schemes can be fulfilled out of treasury shares.
During FY15, the Board reviewed its policy on capital structure and dividends.
The original policy was established at the time of the flotation of the Company in 2006 and in the Boards opinion had ceased to reflect the scale of the business and its consistent track record of cash generation over many years.
Accordingly, the Board determined that the Group will operate with a modest amount of leverage such that net debt should fall within the range of 0.25 to 0.75 times the last 12 months EBITDA.
In order to fund the ongoing debt, the Group entered into an arrangement with a syndicate of three major banks for the provision of a 150m revolving credit facility, expiring on 9 February 2020.
There are no changes from the previous period.

The fair value of foreign currency contracts are amounts required by the counterparties to cancel the contracts at the end of the period.
Fair value hierarchy Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels: z Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: z Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and z Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
