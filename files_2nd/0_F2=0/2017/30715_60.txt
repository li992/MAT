These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benefits can be provided by state schemes: by defined contribution schemes, whereby retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee: or by defined benefit schemes, whereby retirement benefits are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
Pension costs of defined benefit schemes for accounting purposes have been calculated using the projected unit method.
In certain countries pension benefits are provided on an unfunded basis, some administered by trustee companies.
Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the Groups main plans are undertaken regularly, normally at least every three years.
Actuarial movements in the year are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income.
Discount rates are derived from AA rated corporate bond yields except in countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds where government bond yields are used.
Discount rates are selected to reflect the term of the expected benefit payments.
Projected inflation rate and pension increases are long-term predictions based on the yield gap between long-term index-linked and fixed interest Gilts.
In the UK, mortality rates are determined by adjusting the SAPS S2 standard mortality tables to reflect recent scheme experience.
These rates are then projected to reflect improvements in life expectancy in line with the CMI 2016 projections with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per year for both males and females.
In the US, mortality rates are calculated using the RP2014 white collar table adjusted to reflect recent experience.
These rates are projected using MP-2017 to allow for future improvements in life expectancy.

Pensions and other post-employment benefits continued The average life expectancy assumed now for an individual at the age of 60 and projected to apply in 2037 for an individual then at the age of 60 is as follows: UK US Male Female Male Female Years Years Years Years Current 27.5 29.5 26.9 28.6 Projected for 2037 29.1 31.1 28.6 30.3 The assets of funded schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts, either as specific assets or as a proportion of a general fund, or are insurance contracts.
Assets are invested in different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return.
Investments are diversified to limit the financial effect of the failure of any individual investment.
The Group reviewed the investment strategy of the UK plans in 2011 and the asset allocation for the UK plans has been adjusted to approximately 55% return seeking assets and 45% liability matching assets.
In 2013, the target asset allocation of the US plans was also updated to 55% return seeking assets and 45% liability matching assets.
The Pension Plans are exposed to risk that arises because the estimated market value of the Plans assets might decline, the investment returns might reduce, or the estimated value of the Plans liabilities might increase.
In line with the agreed mix of return seeking assets to generate future returns and liability matching assets to better match future pension obligations, the Group has defined an overall long-term investment strategy for the Plans, with investments across a broad range of assets.
The main market risks within the asset and hedging portfolio are against credit risk, interest rates, long-term inflation, equities, property, and bank counterparty risk.
The Plan liabilities are a series of future cash flows with relatively long duration.
On an IAS 19R basis, these cash flows are sensitive to changes in the expected long-term inflation rate and the discount rate AA corporate bond yield curve where an increase in long-term inflation corresponds with an increase in the liabilities, and an increase in the discount rate corresponds with a decrease in the liabilities.
In the UK the defined benefit pension schemes operated for the benefit of former Glaxo Wellcome employees and former SmithKline Beecham employees remain separate.
These schemes were closed to new entrants in 2001 and subsequent UK employees are entitled to join a defined contribution scheme.
In the US the former Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham defined benefit schemes were merged during 2001.
In addition, the Group operates a number of post-retirement healthcare schemes, the principal one of which is in the US.

In 2016, GSK reached an agreement with the trustees of the UK pension schemes to make additional contributions to eliminate the pension deficit identified at the 31 December 2014 actuarial funding valuation.
Based on the funding agreements following the 2014 valuation, the additional contributions to eliminate the pension deficit are expected to be 123 million in 2018.
The contributions were based on a government bond yield curve approach to selecting the discount rate: the rate chosen included an allowance for expected investment returns which reflected the asset mix of the schemes.
Employer contributions for 2018, including special funding contributions, are estimated to be approximately 360 million in respect of defined benefit pension schemes and 90 million in respect of post-retirement benefits.
