During 2017, the Group incurred additional expenditure with the Groups auditor, as part of the acquisition of the remaining shares in RAI not previously owned.
This was due to the SEC listing requirements to re-audit 2015 and 2016 under Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB, to audit the purchase price allocation, to provide assurance services on the registration documents and to provide, amongst other things, assurance services with regards to the planned 2018 implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley.
Accordingly, the following costs, related to the acquisition of RAI and treated as an adjusting item, were incurred within the respective categories: audit-related assurance service 7.7 million and within other assurance services 3.5 million.
Under SEC regulations, the remuneration of our auditors of 30.1 million in 2017 2016: 11.4 million: 2015: 12.6 million is required to be presented as follows: audit fees 29.2 million 2016: 9.2 million: 2015: 9.3 million, audit-related fees 0.5 million 2016: 0.2 million: 2015: 0.2 million, tax fees 0.2 million 2016: 0.5 million: 2015: 1.0 million and all other fees 0.2 million 2016: 1.5 million: 2015: 2.1 million.

d Master Settlement Agreement In 1998, the major US cigarette manufacturers Group subsidiaries including R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company RJRT, Lorillard and Brown & Williamson, businesses which are part of RAI entered into the Master Settlement Agreement MSA with attorney generals representing most US states and territories.
The MSA imposes a perpetual stream of future payment obligations on the major US cigarette manufacturers.
The amounts of money that the participating manufacturers are required to annually contribute are based upon, amongst other things, the US volume of cigarettes sold and US market share based on cigarette shipments in that year.
Given these facts, the Groups accounting for the MSA payments is to accrue for them in the cost of products sold as the products are shipped and no provision is made in respect of potential payments relating to future years.
The event which gives rise to the obligation is the actual sales of products shipped and the MSA payments are therefore recognised as part of the costs of those business operations.
During 2012, RJRT, Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company SFNTC, various other tobacco manufacturers, 17 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico reached an agreement related to the Non-Participating Manufacturer NPM adjustment under MSA.
Under this agreement RJRT and SFNTC will receive credits, in respect of its NPM Adjustment claims for the period 2003 to 2014.
These credits are applied against the companys MSA payments subject to, and dependent upon, meeting the various ongoing performance obligations.
In 2013 and 2014, five additional states joined NPM, including two states that were found to not have diligently enforced their qualifying statutes in 2003.
An additional two states joined the agreement in 2017 and, as a result, expenses for the MSA were reduced by US$17 million for the year ended 31 December 2017.
As a result of meeting the performance requirements in the agreement, RJRT and SFNTC, collectively, recognised additional credits of US$130 million and US$295 million for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, respectively.
Credits recognised in both these years include the benefit of the additional credits received as a result of the acquisition of Lorillard, Inc. in 2015.
RJRT expects to recognise additional credits through 2020.
In October 2015, RJRT, SFNTC and certain other tobacco manufacturers entered into a settlement agreement, referred to as the NY Settlement Agreement, with the State of New York to settle certain claims related to the NPM Adjustment.
The NY Settlement Agreement resolves NPM Adjustment claims related to payment years from 2004 through 2014, providing RJRT and SFNTC, collectively, with credits, of approximately US$290 million, plus interest, subject to meeting various performance obligations.
These credits will be applied against annual payments under the MSA over a four-year period, which commenced with the April 2016 MSA payment.
RJRT and SFNTC, collectively, recognised credits of US$99 million and US$95 million as a reduction to cost of products sold for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, respectively.
Credits in respect of future years payments and the NPM adjustment would be accounted for in the applicable year and will not be treated as adjusting items.
Only credits in respect of prior year payments are included in adjusting items.
e Restructuring and integration costs Restructuring costs reflect the costs incurred as a result of initiatives to improve the effectiveness and the efficiency of the Group as a globally integrated enterprise, including the relevant operating costs of implementing the new operating model.
These costs represent additional expenses incurred, which are not related to the normal business and day-to-day activities.
The new operating model is underpinned by a global single instance of SAP with full deployment occurring during 2016 with benefits already realised within the business and future savings expected in the years to come.
The initiatives also include a review of the Groups trade marketing and manufacturing operations, supply chain, overheads and indirect costs, organisational structure and systems and software used.

f Amortisation and impairment of trademarks and similar intangibles Business combinations in 2017 of RAI, Winnington AB and Must Have Limited, along with the acquisition of tobacco assets in Bulgartabac and Fabrika Duhana Sarajevo see note 24, as well as business combinations of Ten Motives, CHIC, TDR, Bentoel and ST in previous years, have resulted in the capitalisation of trademarks and similar intangibles which are amortised over their expected useful lives, which do not exceed 20 years.
The amortisation and impairment charge of 383 million 2016: 149 million: 2015: 65 million is included in depreciation, amortisation and impairment costs in profit from operations.
g Fox River As explained in note 28, a Group subsidiary has certain liabilities in respect of indemnities given on the purchase and disposal of former businesses in the United States and in 2011, the subsidiary provided 274 million in respect of claims in relation to environmental clean-up costs of the Fox River.
On 30 September 2014, a Group subsidiary, NCR, Appvion and Windward Prospects entered into a Funding Agreement with regard to the costs for the clean-up of Fox River.
In January 2017, NCR and Appvion entered into a consent decree with the US Government to resolve how the remaining clean-up will be funded and to resolve further outstanding claims between them.
The Consent Decree was approved by a US District Judge in August 2017 butiscurrently subject to appeal in the US Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, see note 28 for further details.
In July 2016, the High Court ruled in a Group subsidiarys favour that a dividend of 135 million paid by Windward to Sequana in May 2009 was a transaction made with the intention of putting assets beyond the reach of the Group subsidiary and of negatively impacting its interests.
On 10 February 2017, further to a hearing in January 2017 to determine the relief due, the Court found in the Group subsidiarys favour, ordering that Sequana must pay an amount up to the full value of the dividend plus interest which equates to around US$185 million, related to past and future clean-up costs.
The Court granted all parties leave to appeal and Sequana a stay in respect of the above payments.
The appeal hearing is expected to take place in June 2018.
Due to the uncertain outcome of the case no asset has been recognised in relation to this ruling.
In February 2017, Sequana entered into a process in France seeking court protection the Sauvegarde, exiting the Sauvegarde in June 2017.
No payments have been received.
The provision is 138 million at 31 December 2017 2016: 163 million.
Based on this Funding Agreement, 25 million has been paid in 2017, which includes legal costs of 7 million 2016: 17 million, including legal costs of 11 million: 2015: 17 million, including legal costs of 8 million.
In addition, in 2016 the devaluation of sterling against the US dollar lead to a charge of20 million.
h Other adjusting items In 2017, the release of the fair value acquisition accounting adjustments to finished goods inventories of 465 million on the RAI acquisition has been adjusted within Changes in inventories of finished goods and work in progress.
Also included in 2017 is the impairment of certain assets of 69 million related to a third-party distributor Agrokor in Croatia, that has been adjusted within other operating expenses.
In 2016, the Board of Audit and Inspection of Korea BAI concluded its tax assessment in relation to the 2014 year-end tobacco inventory, and imposed additional sales tax excise and VAT and penalties.
This resulted in the recognition of a 53 million charge by a Group subsidiary.
Management deems the tax and penalties to be unfounded and has appealed to the tax tribunal against the assessment.
Based on the legal opinion from a local law firm, management believes that this appeal will be successful, and that the findings of the BAI will be reversed.
On grounds of materiality and the high likelihood of the tax and penalties being reversed in future, the Group has classified the tax and penalties charge as an adjusting item in 2016. i Flintkote In December 2014, a Group subsidiary entered into a settlement agreement in connection with various legal cases related to a former nontobacco business in Canada.
Under the terms of the settlement, the subsidiary will obtain protection from current and potential future Flintkote related asbestos liability claims in the US.
The settlement was finalised in 2015 when approvals of certain courts in the US were obtained.
This agreement has led to a charge of nil million in 2017 2016: nil million: 2015: 3 million.
