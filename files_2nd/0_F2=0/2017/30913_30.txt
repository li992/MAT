GENERAL INFORMATION AND PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE COMPANY General information The Company is a public company limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in the UK, and registered in England and Wales.
The registered office is Millstream, Maidenhead Road, Windsor, Berkshire, SL4 5GD.
The Company Financial Statements are presented in pounds sterling with all values rounded to the nearest million pounds.
Pounds sterling is the functional currency of the Company.
Basis of preparation The Company Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101: Reduced disclosure framework FRS 101.
In preparing these Financial Statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006 and sets out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
From 1 January 2017, the following amendments are effective in the Company's Financial Statements.
Their first time adoption did not have a material impact on the Financial Statements.
Amendments to IAS 12: Income taxes related to the recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses.
In these Financial Statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: the requirements of IAS 7: Statement of cash flows: the statement of compliance with Adopted IFRSs: the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs: prior year reconciliations for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets: the prior year reconciliation in the number of shares outstanding at the beginning and at the end of the year for share capital: disclosures in respect of related party transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries in a group: disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel: and disclosures in respect of capital management.
As the consolidated Financial Statements of Centrica plc, which are available from the registered office, include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures: IFRS 2: Share-based payment in respect of Group settled share-based payments: and certain disclosures required by IFRS 13: Fair value measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7: Financial instruments: disclosures have not been provided apart from those which are relevant for the financial instruments which are held at fair value.
Measurement convention The Company Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for: investments in subsidiaries that have been recognised at deemed cost on transition to FRS 101: derivative financial instruments, available-for-sale financial assets, financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition, and the assets of the defined benefit pension schemes that have been measured at fair value: the liabilities of the defined benefit pension schemes that have been measured using the projected unit credit valuation method: and the carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities qualifying as hedged items in fair value hedges that have been adjusted from cost by the changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged.
Going concern The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis, as described in the Directors Report and note 24 b of the consolidated Group Financial Statements.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty are set out in note 3 of the consolidated Group Financial Statements.
The key accounting judgement of the Company is the carrying value of its investments in subsidiary undertakings and receivables from these undertakings.
The Company does not deem its investments in subsidiary undertakings to be impaired and supports this judgement through its impairment review process as detailed below.
This impairment review process identified that some receivables from Group undertakings were not fully recoverable and accordingly an increase in the bad debt provision of 17 million 2016: 87 million was recognised against receivables during the year and impairments of 709 million 2016: 404 million made in previous years were reversed.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty include the allocation of the Companys share of pension scheme surplus deficit, as detailed further within the accounting policies section of these Company Financial Statements, and also in note XVI.

GENERAL INFORMATION AND PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE COMPANY Principal accounting policies The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Company Financial Statements.
Employee share schemes The Group has a number of employee share schemes under which it makes equity-settled share-based payments as detailed in the Remuneration Report on pages 78 to 89 and in note S2 to the consolidated Group Financial Statements.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis together with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the number of awards that will vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The issue of share incentives by the Company to employees of its subsidiaries represents additional capital contributions.
When these costs are recharged to the subsidiary undertaking, the investment balance is reduced accordingly.
Fair value is measured using methods detailed in note S2 to the consolidated Group Financial Statements.
Foreign currencies The Companys functional and presentational currency is pounds sterling.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into pounds sterling at closing rates of exchange.
Exchange differences on monetary assets and liabilities are taken to the Income Statement.
Property, plant and equipment PP&E is included in the Balance Sheet at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.
The initial cost of an asset comprises purchase price and construction cost and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation.
The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, on a straight-line basis, over a period of 3 to 10 years.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.
Intangible assets consist of application software for internal use.
The cost of purchased application software, for example investments in financial and administrative systems, includes contractors charges, materials, directly attributable labour and directly attributable overheads.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis at rates sufficient to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of individual assets over their estimated useful lives of up to 10 years.
Amortisation of assets under construction commences when the asset is operational.
Investments Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries shares are held at deemed cost on transition to FRS 101 and at cost in accordance with IAS 27: Separate financial statements, less any provision for impairment as necessary for any subsequent investments.
Impairment The Companys accounting policies in respect of impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and financial assets are consistent with those of the Group.
The carrying values of investments in subsidiary undertakings are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount of an investment in a subsidiary undertaking is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Receivables from Group undertakings are compared to their recoverable amount, which is also assessed using the same estimated discounted future cash flow for each undertaking as described above.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets.
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Payments under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

GENERAL INFORMATION AND PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE COMPANY Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Companys employees participate in a number of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes.
The total Group cost of providing benefits under defined benefit schemes is determined separately for each of the Groups schemes under the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
The key assumptions used for the actuarial valuation are based on the Groups best estimate of the variables that will determine the ultimate cost of providing postemployment benefits, on which further detail is provided in note 22 to the consolidated Group Financial Statements.
The Companys share of the total Group surplus or deficit at the end of the reporting period for each scheme is calculated in proportion to the Companys share of ordinary employer contributions to that scheme during the year: ordinary employer contributions are determined by the pensionable pay of the Companys employees within the scheme and the cash contribution rates set by the scheme trustees.
Current service cost is calculated with reference to the pensionable pay of the Companys employees.
The Companys share of the total Group interest on scheme liabilities, expected return on scheme assets and actuarial gains or losses is calculated in proportion to ordinary employer contributions in the prior accounting period.
Changes in the surplus or deficit arising as a result of the changes in the Companys share of total ordinary employer contributions are also treated as actuarial gains or losses.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences identified at the balance sheet date, except for differences arising on: the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and which at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit: and investments in subsidiaries where the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of the Companys assets and liabilities and their tax base.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Company has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.
Deferred tax assets that are not eligible for offset against deferred tax liabilities are recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that there will be suitable taxable profits in the foreseeable future, against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences expected from the manner in which the asset or liability is recovered or settled.
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
Financial instruments The Companys accounting policies for financial instruments are consistent with those of the Group as disclosed in note S2 to the consolidated Group Financial Statements.
The Companys financial risk management policies are consistent with those of the Group and are described in the Strategic Report Principal Risks and Uncertainties on pages 52 to 62 and in note S3 to the consolidated Group Financial Statements.
Presentation of derivative financial instruments In line with the Groups accounting policy for derivative financial instruments, the Company has classified those derivatives held for the purpose of treasury management as current or non-current, based on expected settlement dates.
Provisions A provision is recognised when the Company has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event that can be measured reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation.
