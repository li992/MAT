The litigation alleged that the formation of the Twin America joint venture in 2009 was anti-competitive.
A settlement was agreed with the USDepartment of Justice and the New York Attorney Generals office, and has received court approval.
Related to the Twin America litigation involving the Group's North America Division, which we have set out in previous reports and which as noted in our annual report for the year ended 30 April 2016 was settled, the Department of Justice investigated the conduct of company personnel in responding to discovery obligations in the investigation and litigation.
The Group co-operated with the investigation, which is no longer ongoing, and we do not anticipate any further action.
v The Group and the Company are from time to time party to other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.
Liabilities have been recognised in the financial statements for the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle obligations arising under such legal actions.
As at 29 April 2017, the accruals in the consolidated financial statements for such claims total 0.6m 2016: 0.1m in addition to the amounts recognised specifically in respect of the Twin America litigation noted in iv above.
In addition, certain of the claims intended to be covered by the insurance provisions see note 23 are subject to or might become subject to litigation against the Group and or the Company.
