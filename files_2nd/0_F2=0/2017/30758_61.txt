Riskmanagement The Group is exposed to market risk including interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board of Directors oversees the management of these risks.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks that are summarisedbelow.
Marketrisk Market risk is the risk that the fair values of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
The financial instruments held by the Group that are affected by market risk are principally the Groups cash balances, bank borrowings along with a number of interest rate derivatives entered into to mitigate interest raterisk.
The Group monitors its interest rate exposure on a regular basis.
A sensitivity analysis performed to ascertain the impact on the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income and net assets of a 50 basis point shift in interest rates would result in an increase of 0.30million 2016: 2.71million or a decrease of 0.30million 2016: 2.71million.
Creditrisk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.
The Group is exposed to credit risks from both its leasing activities and financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions.
Credit risk is assisted by tenants being required to pay rentals in advance under their lease obligations.
The credit quality of the tenant is assessed based on an extensive credit rating scorecard at the time of entering into a leaseagreement.
Outstanding trade receivables are regularly monitored.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financialasset.
Tradereceivables Trade receivables, primarily tenant rentals, are presented in the Statement of Financial Position net of allowances for doubtful receivables and are monitored on a case by case basis.
Credit risk is primarily managed by requiring tenants to pay rentals in advance and performing tests around strength of covenant prior to acquisition.
