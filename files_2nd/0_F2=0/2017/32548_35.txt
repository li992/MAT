Financial statements Glossary Alternative Performance Measures Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures APMs issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority came into effect for all communications released on or after 3 July 2016 for issuers of securities on a regulated market.
In the reporting of financial information, the Directors have adopted various APMs of historical or future financial performance, position or cash flows other than those defined or specified under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The Directors measure the performance of the Group based on the following financial measures which are not recognised under EU-adopted IFRS, and consider these to be important measures in evaluating the Groups strategic and financial performance.
The Directors believe that these APMs assist in providing additional useful information on the underlying trends, performance and position of the Group.
APMs are also used to enhance the comparability of information between reporting periods, by adjusting for non-underlying items, to aid the user inunderstanding the Groups performance.
Consequently, APMs are used by the Directors and management for performance analysis, planning, reporting and incentive setting purposes andhave remained consistent with prior year.
All APMs relate to the current periods results and comparative periods where provided.
53 week prior year comparison The FY17 audited period represents the 52 weeks to 30 March 2017.
The audited comparative period represents 53 weeks to 31 March 2016, butto better reflect the businesss underlying performance, the more appropriate comparable period is the 52 weeks to 24 March 2016.
On this basis, allcommentary in respect of the comparative period is based on the proforma 52 week period to 24 March 2016 unless otherwise stated.
Inorder to calculate the 52 week financials, where applicable, the outcome of the 53rd week has been used as the basis for the adjustment, although in some instances, a degree of judgement has been applied in deriving certain income statement costs in relation to the final week.
Thefullstatutory financials, which compare the current financial year to the 53 week prior year, are detailed starting on page 117.
