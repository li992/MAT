SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Company has three equity share-based payment arrangements, namely an LTIP scheme with approved and unapproved components, an Employee Share Save Scheme SAYE and a Long Term Bonus Performance Plan.
The Group recognised a total expense in the year related to equity-settled sharebased payment transactions of 2,324,000 2016: 2,539,000.
Equity-settled share option plans Since 2004 the Group has operated an Employee Share Save Scheme SAYE which allows any employee who has more than six months service to purchase shares at a 20% discount to the average quoted market price of the Group shares at the date of grant.
The associated savings contracts are three years at which point the employee can exercise their option to purchase the shares or take the amount saved, including interest, in cash.
The scheme is administered by Yorkshire Building Society.
On an annual basis since 2004 the Group awarded nil-paid options to senior management under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The awards are conditional on the achievement of challenging performance targets as described on page 78 of the Remuneration Report.
The awards granted in 2004, 2005 and 2006 vested in full.
The awards granted in 2007 and 2009 lapsed, and the awards granted in 2008 and 2010 partially vested.
The awards granted in 2011, 2012 and 2013 fully vested.
