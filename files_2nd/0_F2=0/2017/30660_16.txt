Mortgage spreads were at lower levels than 2016, driven by competition as well as lower funding costs, in part as a result of the TFS.
As a result, new mortgage lending in 2017 was priced at an average spread of 168 basis points, compared to 187 basis points in 2016.
However, further optimisation of our funding base continued to support Banking NIM in a competitive environment.
We successfully repriced four tranches of deposits and this, along with drawings from the TFS, contributed to a reduction in the cost of funds from 80 basis points in 2016 to 59 basis points in 2017.
Taken together, these factors reduced Banking NIM to 172 basis points in 2017 from 175 basis points in 2016.
Total NIM also reduced by 3 basis points to 157 basis points.
Credit card income has benefitted from further growth in the cards book, resulting in an increasing contribution to total net interest income NII in the year.
Credit card NII in the year includes an accrual of 78.0 million 2016: 61.5 million arising from the credit card effective interest rate EIR method.
Credit card EIR is calculated over the expected card life, up to a maximum of seven years.
Historical evidence and data continue to support our modelling assumptions and the use of a seven year modelling life.

Other income included a gain of 6.1 million from the sale of the investment in Vocalink in the first half of 2017.
Excluding the gain from the sale of Vocalink and the gain of 5.3 million on the investment held in Visa Europe during the first half of 2016, other income increased by 4.3 per cent.

Set against income growth of 13.5 per cent, this produced positive JAWS of 9.8 per cent and reduced the cost:income ratio by 4.9 percentage points to 52.3 per cent.
This performance meant that we successfully achieved our stated target of exiting 2017 with a cost:income ratio of less than 50 per cent, delivering a ratio of 49.4 per cent for the fourth quarter.
This controlled growth in costs was achieved despite higher depreciation and amortisation during the year.
Efficiency improvements continued across the business with our ongoing programme of operational effectiveness and the ability to leverage our central functions being key drivers.
Our strong cost performance helped to create the capacity for increased investment in the business.
Total investment in the core business was 52.8 million, of which 41.8 million was capital expenditure.
A further 38.3 million of capital expenditure was invested in the development of our new digital banking platform.

We maintained a low cost of risk in 2017 through our established risk appetite framework, ongoing focus on underwriting rigour and the origination of high credit quality customers and prime assets.
The cost of risk for mortgages was flat between 2016 and 2017 at 0.01 per cent and the impairment charge reduced by 0.6 million compared to the prior year.
This performance reflected the high quality of the mortgage portfolio combined with the benign economic environment, leading to a continuing low level of defaults.
The percentage of mortgages over three months in arrears was 0.12 per cent at the end of 2017 2016: 0.15 per cent.
In credit cards, set against growth of 23.6 per cent in balances, the impairment charge for the portfolio increased by only 20.7 per cent to 42.0 million.
The resulting cost of risk for credit cards decreased by 19 basis points to 1.51 per cent in 2017.
This underlines the high credit quality of new and existing cards which continue to have a low rate of default.
Performance of new cohorts of cards remained strong with all cohorts showing a cost of risk lower than or in line with previous vintages.
When accounts under 18 months old are excluded the cost of risk remains low at 1.66 per cent.
Provisions as a percentage of balances in arrears increased to 32.9 per cent 2016: 29.4 per cent as we retained appropriate coverage of balances at risk of loss.
Impaired loans as a percentage of loans and advances for the Group increased marginally to 0.5 per cent in 2017 compared to 0.4 per cent in 2016.
This was due to an increase in secured balances with qualitative impairment indicators, such as interest only expired terms or fraud cases, which we prudently categorise as impaired regardless of arrears status or expected recoverable amount.
Expired term loans which are more than six months past their maturity date have an average LTV of 25.8 per cent, and therefore do not require increased impairment provisions given the high level of collateral cover.
The growth in these balances within the impaired loans category is therefore reflected in the reduced provision coverage of impaired loans.

The most significant impact on the Group arises from the changes to loan loss impairment with the introduction of an expected credit loss Peter Bole approach.
Given the low LTV and high credit quality of the Chief Financial Officer mortgage portfolio and high credit ratings of the wholesale 26 February 2018 book, the main impact will arise from the Groups credit card portfolio.
