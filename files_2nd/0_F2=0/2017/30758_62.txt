Financial Statements: Notes to the Consolidated Accounts 22.
FINANCIAL RISKMANAGEMENT CONTINUED Credit risk related to financial instruments and cashdeposits One of the principal credit risks of the Group arises with the banks and financial institutions.
The Board of Directors believes that the credit risk on short-term deposits and current account cash balances is limited because the counterparties are banks, who are committed lenders to the Group, with high credit ratings assigned by international .
Liquidityrisk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of working capital and, going forward, the finance charges, principal repayments on its borrowings and its commitments under forward funded development arrangements.
It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due, as the majority of the Groups assets are property investments and are therefore not readily realisable.
The Groups objective is to ensure it has sufficient available funds for its operations and to fund its capital expenditure.
This is achieved by continuous monitoring of forecast and actual cash flows by management ensuring it has appropriate levels of cash and available drawings to meet liabilities as they falldue.

CAPITALMANAGEMENT The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it remains a going concern and continues to qualify for UK REITstatus.
The Board, with the assistance of the Investment Manager, monitors and reviews the Groups capital so as to promote the long-term success of the business, facilitate expansion and to maintain sustainable returns for Shareholders.
The Group considers proceeds from share issuances, bank borrowings and retained earnings as capital.
The Groups policy on borrowings is as set outbelow: The level of borrowing will be on a prudent basis for the asset class, and will seek to achieve a low cost of funds, while maintaining flexibility in the underlying security requirements, and the structure of both the portfolio and the REITGroup.
The Directors intend that the Group will maintain a conservative level of aggregate borrowings with a medium-term limit of 40% of the Groups grossassets.
