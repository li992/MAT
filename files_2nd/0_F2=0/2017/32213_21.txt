Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Principal Activity Fidelity China Special Situations PLC is an Investment Company incorporated in England and Wales with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange.
The Companys registration number is 7133583, and its registered office is Beech Gate, Millfield Lane, Lower Kingswood, Tadworth, Surrey, KT20 6RP.
The Company has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs as an Investment Trust under Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act, 2010 and intends to conduct its affairs so as to continue to be approved.
2 Accounting Policies The Companys Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, to the extent that they have been adopted by the European Union, the Companies Acts that apply to companies reporting under IFRS, IFRC interpretations and, as far as it is consistent with IFRS, with the Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC, in November 2014.
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are summarised below.
a Basis of accounting The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of investments and derivative assets and liabilities.
b Adoption of new and revised Financial Reporting Standards The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, the following IFRS were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 9: Financial Instruments IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers IFRS 16: Leases It is anticipated that the adoption of these IFRS in future periods will have no material effect on the financial position and performance of the Company.
c Segmental reporting The Company is engaged in a single segment business and, therefore, no segmental reporting is provided.
d Presentation of the Income Statement In order to reflect better the activities of an investment company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been prepared alongside the Income Statement.
The net revenue profit after taxation is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Companys compliance with certain requirements set out in Section 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. e Significant accounting estimates and judgements The Directors make judgements and estimates concerning the future.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, such as expectations of future events, and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The judgements required in order to determine the appropriate valuation methodology of unlisted investments and the assumptions made have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities.
These judgements include making assessments of the possible valuations in the event of a listing and other marketability related risks.
f Income Income from equity investments and derivative instruments is credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established, normally the ex-dividend date.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as a gain in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Special dividends are treated as a revenue receipt or a capital receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
Interest income is accounted for on an accruals basis.
g Functional currency and foreign exchange The Directors, having regard to the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined the functional currency to be UK sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are calculated in UK sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities and those carried at fair value and denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
All capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserve.

i Finance costs Finance costs comprise interest and fees on bank loans and overdrafts and interest paid on CFDs, which are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method, and dividends paid on short CFDs, which are accounted for on the date on which the obligation to incur the cost is established, normally the ex-dividend date.
Finance costs are allocated equally between revenue and capital with effect from 1 April 2017, they will be allocated 25% to revenue and 75% to capital.
j Taxation The taxation expense represents the sum of current taxation and deferred taxation.
Taxation currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation, as reported in the Income Statement, because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Companys liability for current taxation is calculated using taxation rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred taxation is the taxation expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the corresponding taxation bases used in the computation of taxable profit based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted when the taxation is expected to be payable or recoverable, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Taxation is charged or credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement, except where it relates to items of a capital nature, in which case it is charged or credited to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Where expenses are allocated between revenue and capital any tax relief in respect of the expenses is allocated between revenue and capital returns on the marginal basis using the Companys effective rate of corporation tax for the accounting period.
The Company is an approved Investment Trust under Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 and is not liable for UK taxation on capital gains.
k Dividends paid to shareholders Dividends payable to equity shareholders are recognised when the Companys obligation to make payment is established.
l Investments The portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss, which is initially taken to be their cost, and is subsequently measured as bid or last traded prices, depending upon the convention of the exchange on which they are listed, where available, or otherwise at fair value based on published price quotations.
Investments which are not quoted, or are not frequently traded, are stated at the Directors best estimate of fair value.
The Managers Fair Value Committee, which is independent of the Portfolio Managers team, provides a recommendation of fair values to the Directors based on recognised valuation techniques that take account of recent arms length transactions in the same or similar investments.
In accordance with the AIC SORP, the Company includes transaction costs, incidental to the purchase or sale of investments within gains on investments held at fair value through profit or loss in the capital column of the Income Statement and has disclosed them in note 10 below.

Derivative transactions into which the Company may enter include CFDs, futures, options, warrants and forward currency contracts.

Where such transactions are used to protect or enhance income, if the circumstances support this, then the income derived is included in derivative income in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where such transactions are used to protect or enhance capital, if the circumstances support this, the gains and losses derived are included in gains on derivative instruments held at fair value through profit or loss in the capital column of the Income Statement.

p Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents may comprise cash and short-term money market funds which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
q Bank loans Loans are initially included in the financial statements at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of any issue costs relating to the borrowing.
After initial recognition, the loans are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
r Other payables Other payables include securities purchased for future settlement, amounts payable on share repurchases, performance fees payable, investment management and secretarial fees payable, interest payable and other creditors and expenses accrued in the ordinary course of business.
Other payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business, if longer.

As a result of technical guidance by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in TECH 02 10: Guidance on the determination of realised profits and losses in the context of distributions under the Companies Act 2006, changes in the fair value of investments which are readily convertible to cash, without accepting adverse terms at the Balance Sheet date, can be treated as realised.
Capital reserves realised and unrealised are shown in aggregate as capital reserve in the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Balance Sheet.
At the Balance Sheet date all investments held by the Company were listed on a recognised stock exchange and were considered to be readily convertible to cash, with the exception of level 3 investments which had unrealised investment holding gains of 8,448,000 2016: 3,392,000.

It can be used to fund share repurchases and it is distributable by way of dividend.
The Board has stated that it has no current intention to pay dividends out of capital.
The revenue reserve represents the net revenue surpluses recognised in the revenue column of the Income Statement that have not been distributed as dividends to shareholders.
It is distributable by way of dividend.
18 Net Asset Value per Ordinary Share The net asset value per Ordinary Share is based on net assets of 1,243,794,000 2016: 908,478,000 and on 551,914,480 2016: 553,339,480 Ordinary Shares, being the number of Ordinary Shares held outside Treasury in issue at the year end.
It is the Companys policy that Ordinary Shares held in Treasury will only be issued at a premium to net asset value per share and, therefore, the shares held in Treasury have no dilutive effect.
19 Financial Instruments Management of risk The Companys investing activities in pursuit of its investment objective involve certain inherent risks.
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks faced by the Company.

Short term flexibility is achieved by the use of a bank overdraft, if required.
The Company has the facility to borrow up to US$150,000,000 2016: US$150,000,000 until 14 February 2020.
The current borrowing is shown in Note 15 above.
Other financial liabilities are repayable within one year.
Counterparty risk Certain of the derivative instruments in which the Company may invest are not traded on an exchange but instead will be traded between counterparties based on contractual relationships, under the terms outlined in the International Swaps Dealers Associations ISDA market standard derivative legal documentation.
These are known as Over The Counter OTC trades.
As a result the Company is subject to the risk that a counterparty may not perform its obligations under the related contract.
In accordance with the risk management process which the Investment Managers employ, they will seek to minimise such risk by: only entering into transactions with counterparties which they believe to have an adequate credit rating at the time the transaction is entered into, by ensuring that formal legal agreements covering the terms of the contract are entered into in advance, and through adopting a counterparty risk framework which measures, monitors and manages counterparty risk by the use of internal and external credit agency ratings and evaluates derivative instrument credit risk exposure.
Collateral For OTC and exchange traded derivative transactions, collateral is used to reduce the risk of both parties to the contract.
Collateral is managed on a daily basis for all relevant transactions.
At 31 March 2017, 23,717,000 2016: 3,121,000 was received from brokers and held, in a segregated collateral account, on behalf of the Company to reduce the credit risk exposure of the Company.
This collateral comprised: Deutsche Bank AG 9,689,000 in European Government bonds denominated in euros and UBS AG 14,028,000 in UK Government bonds denominated in Sterling.
2,069,000 2016: 12,740,000, shown as amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers on the Balance Sheet, was held by the Company, in a segregated collateral account, on behalf of the brokers to reduce the credit risk exposure of the brokers.
This collateral comprised: HSBC Bank plc 415,000 in cash and UBS AG 1,654,000 in cash.
Osetting To further mitigate counterparty risk for OTC derivative transactions, the ISDA legal documentation is in the form of a master agreement between the Investment Trusts managed by Fidelity and the broker.
This allows enforceable netting arrangements in the event of a default or termination event.
Derivative instrument assets and liabilities that are subject to netting arrangements have not been offset in preparing the Balance Sheet.

This Charter was approved by the Board and allows the use of derivative instruments for the following purposes: to gain exposure to equity markets, sectors or individual investments: to hedge equity market risk in the Companys investments with the intention of mitigating losses in the event of market falls: to enhance portfolio returns by writing call and put options: and to take short positions in equity markets, which would benefit from a fall in the relevant market price, where the Investment Managers believe the investment is overvalued.
These positions distinguish themselves from other short exposures held for hedging purposes since they are expected to add risk to the portfolio.
The risk and investment performance of these instruments are managed by an experienced, specialist derivative team of the Investment Managers using portfolio risk assessment tools for portfolio construction.
RISK SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis Based on the financial instruments held and interest rates at the Balance Sheet date, an increase of 0.25% in interest rates throughout the year would have decreased the profit after taxation for the year and decreased the net assets of the Company by 487,000 2016: increased the loss after taxation and decreased the net assets by 641,000.
A decrease of 0.25% in interest rates throughout the year would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Foreign currency risk sensitivity analysis Based on the financial assets and liabilities held and the exchange rates ruling at the Balance Sheet date, a strengthening of the UK sterling exchange rate by 10% against other currencies would have decreased the net profit after taxation for the year 2016: increased the net loss and decreased the net assets of the Company by the following amounts: 2017 2016 currency 000 000 Australian dollar 340 233 Canadian dollar 119 84 Chinese renminbi 15,839 17,462 Hong Kong dollar 68,726 49,132 Singapore dollar 415 680 South Korean won 467 Taiwan dollar 3,778 3,380 US dollar 48,159 9,368 137,843 80,339 60 Fidelity China Special Situations PLC Annual Report 2017 Job No: 29380 Proof Event: 19 Black Line Event:5 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA Customer: Fidelity Project Title: FCSS Annual Report 2016 T: 0207 055 6500 F: 020 7055 6600 19 Financial Instruments continued Based on the financial assets and liabilities held and the exchange rates ruling at the Balance Sheet date, a weakening of the UK sterling exchange rate by 10% against other currencies would have increased the net profit after taxation for the year 2016: decreased the net loss and increased the net assets of the Company by the following amounts: 2017 2016 currency 000 000 Australian dollar 415 285 Canadian dollar 145 103 Chinese renminbi 19,359 21,342 Hong Kong dollar 83,999 60,050 Singapore dollar 507 831 South Korean won 571 Taiwan dollar 4,618 4,131 US dollar 58,861 11,449 168,475 98,191 Other price risk sensitivity analysis Changes in market prices affect the net profit loss after taxation for the year and the net assets of the Company.
Details of how the Board sets risk parameters and performance objectives are disclosed in the Strategic Report, on pages 11 and 12.
An increase of 10% in the share prices of the investments held at the Balance Sheet date would have increased the profit after taxation for the year and increased the net assets of the Company by 129,527,000 2016: decreased the loss after taxation and increased the net assets by 98,788,000.
A decrease of 10% in the share prices of the investments designated at fair value through profit or loss would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Derivative instruments exposure sensitivity analysis The Company invests in derivative instruments to gain exposure to the equity market.
An increase of 10% in the share prices of the investments underlying the derivative instruments at the Balance Sheet date would have increased the profit after taxation for the year and increased the net assets of the Company by 22,682,000 2016: decreased the loss after taxation and increased the net assets by 16,747,000.
A decrease of 10% in the share prices of the investments underlying the derivative instruments would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are stated in the Balance Sheet at values which are not materially different to their fair values.
As explained in Note 2 l and m above, investments and derivative instruments are shown at fair value.
In the case of cash and cash equivalents, book value approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.
The exception is the US dollar denominated bank loan, its fair value having been calculated by discounting future cash flows at current US dollar interest rates.
