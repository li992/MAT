UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
ICG has determined that where ICG holds an investment, loan, fee receivable, guarantee or commitment with an investment fund, CLO or CDO, that this represents an interest in a structured entity.
ICG does not have any exposure to loans, guarantees or commitments.
Where ICG does not hold an investment in the structured entity, management has determined that the characteristics of control are not met.
ICG acts in accordance within pre-defined parameters set out in various agreements and the decision making authority is well defined, including third party rights in respect of the investment manager.
These agreements include management fees that are commensurate with the services provided and performance fee arrangements that are industry standard.
As such ICG is acting as agent on behalf of these investors and therefore these entities are not consolidated into ICGs results.
Consolidated structured entities are detailed in note 31.
At 31 March 2017, ICGs interest in and exposure to unconsolidated structured entities including outstanding management and performance fees is detailed in the table below, and recognised within financial assets: loans, investments and warrants and trade and other receivables in the statement of financial position: Management Performance Maximum Investment fees Management fees Performance exposure in Fund receivable fees receivable fees to loss Funds m m % m % m CLOs 62.3 1.7 0.35% to 0.60% 0.05% to 0.20% 64.0 Credit Funds 39.8 0.4 0.50% to 0.75% N A 40.2 Corporate 20% 25% of total performance fee of Investment Funds 61.3 23.7 0.75% to 2.0% 5.3 20% of profit over the threshold 90.3 Real Asset Funds 92.5 8.7 0.40% to 1.33% 2.7 20% of returns in excess of 9% IRR 103.9 20% of total performance fee of 12.5% Secondaries Funds 152.1 7.2 1.15% to 1.40% 0.5 of profit over the threshold 159.8 Total 408.0 41.7 8.5 458.2 Management fees are charged on third party money managed by ICG on either a committed or invested basis dependent on the fund.
The accounting policy for the recognition of performance fees is included in note 3.
ICGs maximum exposure to loss is equal to the value of any investments held and unpaid management fees and performance fees.
ICG has not provided non-contractual financial or other support to the unconsolidated structured entities during the year.
It is not the current intention to provide such support, including the intention to assist the structured entity in obtaining financial support.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES The Company and its subsidiaries may be party to legal claims arising in the course of business.
The Directors do not anticipate that the outcome of any such potential proceedings and claims will have a material, adverse effect on the Groups financial position and at present there are no such claims where their financial impact can be reasonably estimated.
The Company and its subsidiaries may be able to recover any monies paid out in settlement of claims from third parties.
