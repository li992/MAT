 EquityPlans We issue our share-based compensation awards, which at November 30, 2017 included time-based share awards restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, performance-based share awards and market-based share awards collectively equity awards, under the Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc stock plans.
Equity awards are principally granted to management level employees and members of our Boards of Directors.
The plans are administered by the Compensation Committee which is made up of independent directors who determine which employees are eligible to participate, the monetary value or number of shares for which equity awards are to be granted and the amounts that may be exercised or sold within a specified term.
We had an aggregate of 15.5 million shares available for future grant at November 30, 2017.
We fulfill our equity award obligations using shares purchased in the open market or with unissued shares or treasury shares.
Our equity awards generally vest over a three-year period, subject to earlier vesting under certain conditions.
 We have several single-employer defined benefit pension plans, which cover some of our shipboard and shoreside employees.
The U. S. and UK shoreside employee plans are closed to new membership and are funded at or above the level required by U. S. or UK regulations.
The remaining defined benefit plans are primarily unfunded.
In determining all of our plans benefit obligations at November 30, 2017 and 2016, we assumed a weighted-average discount rate of 2.7% for 2017 and 2.9% for 2016.
