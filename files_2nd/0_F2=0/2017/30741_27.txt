Under this method an individuals attributed benefit for valuation purposes related to a particular exit date e. g. expected date of retirement, leaving service or death is the benefit described under the Scheme, determined using the projected compensation and service that would be used in the calculation of the benefit onthe expected exit date, multiplied by the ratio of credited service as of the measurement date to credited service as of the expected exit date.
The benefit obligation is the total present value assessed using appropriate assumptions of the individuals attributed benefits for valuation purposes at the measurement date.
The discount rate was derived using a yield curve approach and based onScheme specific cash flow data from the last formal actuarial valuation to arrive at an appropriate single-equivalent rate.
The fair value of the assets is based on the underlying bid value statements issued by the various investment managers.
The manager statements reflect the relevant pricing basis of the units held in the underlying pooled funds.
An alternative method of valuation is the estimated cost of buying out benefits at 31 December 2017 with a suitable insurer.
This amountrepresents the amount that would be required to settle the Scheme liabilities at 31 December 2017 rather than the Company continuing to fund the ongoing liabilities of the Scheme.
The Company estimates the amount required to settle the Schemes liabilities at 31 December 2017 isaround 196 million which gives aScheme shortfall on a buyout basis of approximately 87 million.
