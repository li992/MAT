Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information The Weir Group PLC 131 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements 1.
Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance The Consolidated Financial Statements of The Weir Group PLC the Company and its subsidiaries together, the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017 2017 were approved and authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 28 February 2018.
The comparative information is presented for the period commencing 2 January 2016 and ended 31 December 2016 2016.
The Consolidated Financial Statements of The Weir Group PLC have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The Weir Group PLC is a public limited company incorporated in Scotland and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The principal activities of the Group are described in note 3.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation These financial statements are presented in Sterling.
All values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million pounds m except where otherwise indicated.
The accounting policies which follow are consistent with those of the previous period.
The following amendment applies for the first time in 2017: Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 7 The amendment requires disclosure of information that will allow users to understand changes in liabilities arising from financing activities.
This includes changes arising from: cash flows, such as drawdowns and repayments of borrowings: and non-cash changes, such as acquisitions, disposals and unrealised exchange differences.
Additional disclosure has been included in note 26.
There are no other new standards or interpretations, in addition to the above, which are considered to have a material impact on the annual Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group.
Basis of consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the results, cash flows and assets and liabilities of The Weir Group PLC and its subsidiaries, and the Groups share of results of its joint ventures.
For consolidation purposes, subsidiaries and joint ventures prepare financial information for the same reporting period as the Company using consistent accounting policies.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the Company, where control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The results of a subsidiary acquired during the year are included in the Groups results from the effective date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The results of a subsidiary sold during the year are included in the Groups results up to the effective date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that are not held by the Group and are presented within equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, separately from the Company shareholders equity.
A full list of the Companys related undertakings can be found on page 202.
Exceptional items & intangibles amortisation In order to provide the users of the Consolidated Financial Statements with a more relevant presentation of the Groups underlying performance, on a like for like basis, profit for each period has been analysed between: i profit before exceptional items & intangibles amortisation: and ii the effect of exceptional items & intangibles amortisation.
Exceptional items are items of income and expense which, because of the nature, size and or infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation.
These specific items are presented on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement to provide greater clarity and a better understanding of the impact of these items on the Groups financial performance.
In doing so, it also facilitates greater comparison of the Groups underlying results with prior periods and assessment of trends in financial performance.
This split is consistent with how underlying business performance is measured internally.
Exceptional items may include but are not restricted to: profits or losses arising on disposal or closure of businesses: the cost of significant business restructuring: significant impairments of intangible or tangible assets: adjustments to the fair value of acquisition-related items such as contingent consideration and inventory: other items deemed exceptional due to their significance, size or nature: and the related exceptional taxation.
Intangibles amortisation has been shown separately to provide visibility over the ongoing impact on the Groups Income Statement of prior and current period investment activities.
Further analysis of the items included in the column Exceptional items & intangibles amortisation is provided in note 5 to the financial statements.
The Weir Group PLC 132 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Use of estimates and judgements The Groups significant accounting policies are set out below.
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, in conformity with IFRS, requires management to make judgements that affect the application of accounting policies and estimates that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense.
Management base these judgements on a combination of past experience, professional expert advice and other evidence that is relevant to each individual circumstance.
Actual results may differ from these judgements and the resulting estimates which are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised.
Areas requiring significant judgement in the current year and on a recurring basis are presented to the Audit Committee, as summarised on page 90.
The areas where management consider critical judgements and estimates to be required are those in respect of: i.
Retirement benefits The assumptions underlying the valuation of retirement benefit assets and liabilities include discount rates, inflation rates and mortality assumptions which are based on actuarial advice.
Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of the Groups retirement benefit obligations.
Sensitivities to changes in key assumptions are provided in note 24. ii.
Provisions Management judgement is used to determine when a provision is recognised taking into account the commercial drivers which gave rise to them, the Groups previous experience of similar obligations and the progress of any associated legal proceedings.
The calculation of provisions typically involves management estimates of associated cash flows and discount rates.
The key provision which currently requires a greater degree of management estimate is the US asbestos provision, details of which are included in note 22. iii.
Taxation The level of current and deferred tax recognised in the financial statements is dependent on subjective judgements as to the interpretation of complex international tax regulations and, in some cases, the outcome of decisions by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world, together with the ability of the Group to utilise tax attributes within the limits imposed by the relevant tax legislation.
The Group faces a variety of tax risks which result from operating in a complex global environment including the ongoing reform of both international and domestic tax rules in some of the Groups larger markets and the challenge to fulfil ongoing tax compliance filing and transfer pricing obligations given the scale and diversity of the Groups global operations.
The Group makes provision for open tax issues where it is probable that an exposure will arise including, in a number of jurisdictions, ongoing tax audits and uncertain tax positions which are by nature complex and can take a number of years to resolve.
In all cases, provisions are based on managements interpretation of tax law in each country, as supported, where appropriate, by discussion and analysis undertaken by the Groups external advisers, and reflect the single best estimate of the likely outcome for each liability.
Provisions for uncertain tax positions are included in current tax liabilities and total 26.6m at 31 December 2017.
The Group believes it has made adequate provision for such matters although it is possible that amounts ultimately paid will be different from the amounts provided.
The risk that the application of management judgements and estimates in tax provisioning in the financial statements fails to present a true and fair view of the tax position is a risk which receives significant focus from management, tax advisers and auditors.
Actions to mitigate this risk include the following: i The Group has capable people and strong processes and controls in place in order to deliver tax filings and tax payments in compliance with local tax requirements.
This includes the recruitment and continued training and development of tax and finance staff with recognised professional qualifications.
ii Local tax systems and controls are monitored by Group management via a compliance scorecard process and any companies reporting a sub-standard level of performance are required to prepare and execute improvement plans.
iii R egular training is organised by the Group in our key jurisdictions and encouraged elsewhere to ensure we maintain appropriate standards of technical competence.
iv A ll personnel involved in filing tax returns are encouraged to share knowledge and seek input on best practice across the Group.
v External tax advisers either prepare or review the annual tax provisions and balances and are involved with the identification and management of transfer pricing policies and related documentation and filing requirements.
vi Standard operating procedures are in place to provide assurance at Group level that tax risks are being adequately managed and issues are escalated to Group level as appropriate.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information The Weir Group PLC 133 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 vii The Group tax team provides technical support on the progression and completion of tax audits and the resolution of issues raised under audit is handled in an open and collaborative manner.
Detailed tax disclosures are provided in notes 7 and 23.
Joint ventures The Group has a number of long-term contractual arrangements which represent joint ventures.
The Groups interests in the results and assets and liabilities of its joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
These investments are carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets less any impairment in value.
The Consolidated Income Statement reflects the share of results of operations of these investments after tax.
Where there has been a change recognised directly in the investees equity, the Group recognises its share of any changes and discloses this when applicable in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture, representing the excess of the cost of the investment over the Groups share of the net fair value of the joint ventures identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is included in the carrying amount of the joint venture and is not amortised.
To the extent that the net fair value of the joint ventures identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised and added to the Groups share of the joint ventures profit or loss in the year in which the investment is acquired.
Foreign currency translation The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared using their functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.
At entity level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the entitys functional currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except when hedge accounting is applied and for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Groups net investment in a foreign operation.
These are recognised in other comprehensive income until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in profit or loss.
On consolidation, the results of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at the average exchange rate for the year and their assets and liabilities are translated into Sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences, including those on monetary items that form part of a net investment in a foreign operation, are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve and in other comprehensive income.
In the event that a foreign operation is sold, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement is determined after taking into account the cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the operation.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group elected to deem cumulative currency translation differences to be nil as at 27 December 2003.
Accordingly, the gain or loss on disposal of a foreign operation does not include currency translation differences arising before that date.
In the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the cash flows of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at the average exchange rate for the year.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is shown net of sales taxes, discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, usually on despatch of goods, and reliable measurement is possible.
No revenue is recognised where recovery of the consideration is not probable or there are significant uncertainties regarding associated costs, or the possible return of goods.
Transfers of risks and rewards vary depending on the nature of the products sold and the individual terms of the contract of sale.
Where the sale of a product requires customer inspection, revenue is not recognised until the inspection has been completed and approved by the customer.
This policy is applicable to the sale of both original equipment and spare parts, whether sold individually, in bulk or as part of a cross-selling marketing strategy.
The Weir Group PLC 134 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 2.
Provision of services Revenue from the rendering of services is generally recognised on completion if the service contract is short-term in nature.
Where this is not the case, revenue from services is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the service at the balance sheet date.
The stage of completion is assessed by reference to the contractual agreement with each separate customer and the costs incurred on the contract to date in comparison to the total forecast costs of the contract.
Revenue recognition commences only when the outcome of the contract can be reliably measured, by reference to individual terms and conditions within each service contract, and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the contract will flow to the Group.
Construction contracts Construction contracts usually contain discrete elements separately transferring risks and rewards to the customer.
The stage of completion of a contract is determined either by reference to the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, or by reference to the completion of a physical proportion of the contract work.
The basis used is dependent upon the nature of the underlying contract and takes into account the degree to which the physical proportion of the work is subject to formal customer acceptance procedures.
Losses on contracts are recognised in the year when such losses become probable.
Construction contracts are primarily entered into by the Groups Engineer to order businesses.
Property, plant & equipment Property, plant & equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
Depreciation of property, plant & equipment is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost less residual value, to the Consolidated Income Statement over the expected useful life of the asset concerned, and is in the following ranges: Freehold buildings, long leasehold land & buildings 10 40 years Short leasehold land & buildings duration of lease Plant & equipment 3 20 years Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of businesses and represents any excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the Groups interest in the fair value of the entitys identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities determined at the date of acquisition.
Acquisition costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the year in which they are incurred.
Goodwill in respect of an acquired business is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses and is tested at least annually or where there are indicators of impairment.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit.
Any contingent consideration is recognised at the date of acquisition or disposal.
For acquisitions, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
If the change does not qualify as a measurement period adjustment, it is reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement.
For disposals, any subsequent change in contingent consideration is adjusted against the disposal proceeds and the gain loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured at cost on initial recognition.
An intangible resource acquired in a business combination is recognised as an intangible asset if it is separable from the acquired business or arises from contractual or legal rights, is expected to generate future economic benefits and its fair value can be measured reliably.
An intangible asset with a finite life is amortised on a straight-line basis so as to charge its cost, which in respect of an acquired intangible asset represents its fair value at the acquisition date, to the income statement over its expected useful life.
An intangible asset with an indefinite life is not amortised but is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
The expected useful lives of acquired intangible assets are as follows: Brand names indefinite life Customer & distributor relationships 5 25 years Purchased software 4 8 years Intellectual property & trademarks 6 15 years Other up to 6 years Acquired brands which are considered to have a finite life are amortised accordingly.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information The Weir Group PLC 135 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Research & development costs All research expenditure is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the year in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the year in which it is incurred unless it relates to the development of a new product or technology and it is incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the product has been proven, the development costs can be measured reliably, future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends, and has sufficient resources, to complete the development and to use or sell the asset.
Any such capitalised development expenditure is amortised on a straight-line basis so that it is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement over the expected life of the resulting product or technology.
Impairment of non-current assets All non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values might be impaired.
Additionally, goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life are subject to an annual impairment test.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that an assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, which represents the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
An assets value in use represents the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is conducted for the cash generating unit to which it belongs.
Similarly, the recoverable amount of goodwill is determined by reference to the discounted future cash flows of the cash generating units to which it is allocated.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Impairment losses recognised in previous periods for an asset other than goodwill are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount.
The carrying amount of an asset shall not be increased above the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with due allowance for any obsolete or slow-moving items.
Cost represents the expenditure incurred in bringing inventories to their existing location and condition and comprises the cost of raw materials, direct labour costs, other direct costs and related production overheads.
Raw material cost is generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell.
Financial assets & liabilities The Groups principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short-term borrowings, loans and fixed-rate notes, commercial paper, cash and short-term deposits.
The Group also has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations, and contingent consideration in relation to acquisitions.
A financial asset is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Trade receivables Trade receivables, which are generally of a short-term nature, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Cash & cash equivalents Cash & cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits available on demand and other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less and bank overdrafts and short-term borrowings with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount.
The Weir Group PLC 136 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Interest-bearing loans & borrowings Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to settle the liability at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, the obligation can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Derivative financial instruments & hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements.
The Group also uses foreign currency borrowings as a hedge of its exposure to foreign exchange risk on its investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Additionally, the Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot and forward foreign exchange rates and counterparty, and the Groups own, credit risk.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on interest rate curves, spot foreign exchange rates and counterparty and own credit risk.
Changes in their fair values are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, except where hedge accounting is used, provided the conditions specified by IAS 39 are met.
Hedge accounting is applied in respect of hedge relationships where it is both permissible under IAS 39 and practical to do so.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges, as appropriate.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability will be adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss will be recognised in the income statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow or net investment hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument will be recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
When the hedged asset or liability is recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income will be either recycled to the Consolidated Income Statement or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is kept in other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income, or recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the year.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are recognised separately as derivative financial instruments when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at its fair value with changes in its fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Share-based payments Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and as a consequence of occasional one-off conditional awards.
The fair value of the LTIP or other conditional awards at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service or performance conditions.
The conditions of the LTIP which took effect in 2014 are summarised in the Directors Remuneration Policy which can be found on the Companys website, www.
Treasury shares The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to retained earnings.
No gain or loss is recognised in total comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information The Weir Group PLC 137 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Post-employment benefits Post-employment benefits comprise pension benefits provided to certain current and former employees in the UK, US and Canada and post-retirement healthcare benefits provided to certain employees in the US.
For defined benefit pension and post-retirement healthcare plans, the annual service cost is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is recognised over the future service lives of participating employees, in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
Current service cost and administration expenses are recognised in operating costs and net interest on the net pension liability is recognised in finance costs.
The finance cost recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the year reflects the net interest on the net pension liability.
This represents the change in the net pension liability resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening net liability, taking into account employer contributions paid into the plan and the consequent reduction in the net liability, during the year.
Past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences between interest on the plan assets, experience on the benefit obligation and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur.
The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present value of the benefit obligation, using a discount rate based on yields at the balance sheet date on appropriate high quality corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations and are denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid, minus the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date.
The balance sheet asset recognised is limited to the present value of economic benefits which the Group expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions.
In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is also given to any minimum funding requirements.
For defined contribution plans, the cost represents the Groups contributions to the plans and these are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the year in which they fall due, along with any associated administration costs.
Leases Leases which transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are included within property, plant & equipment, initially measured at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, and a corresponding liability is recognised within obligations under finance leases.
Subsequently, the assets are depreciated over a period consistent with similar owned assets or the lease term if shorter.
At the inception of the lease, the lease rentals are apportioned between an interest element and a capital element so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability.
Subsequently, the interest element is recognised as a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement while the capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding liability.
Operating lease rentals and any incentives receivable are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Taxation Current tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the year.
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future years in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future years in respect of deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unutilised tax losses and the carry forward of unused tax credits.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base with the following exceptions: i Deferred tax arising from the initial recognition of goodwill, or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, is not recognised: ii Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and iii A d eferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
The Weir Group PLC 138 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Current and deferred tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except if it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised directly in equity.
New standards & interpretations The International Accounting Standards Board and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee have issued the following standards, amendments and interpretations, which are considered relevant to the Group, with an effective date after the year covered by these financial statements.
International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS Effective date for periods commencing IFRS 9: Financial instruments 1 January 2018 IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers including associated amendments 1 January 2018 Amendments to IFRS 2: Share-based payments 1 January 2018 Annual improvements 2014 2016 1 January 2018 IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration 1 January 2018 IFRS 16: Leases 1 January 2019 IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over income tax treatments 1 January 2019 Not yet endorsed for use in the European Union.
The above standards and interpretations will be adopted in accordance with their effective dates and have not been adopted in these financial statements.
An impact assessment has been performed for each of the standards, amendments and interpretations effective from 1 January 2018, with no significant financial impact being identified.
Further details are provided below in relation to the two new standards effective from 2018: i IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets.
The Group has carried out an impact assessment which has focused on the areas of classification, measurement and impairment.
Internal procedures in these areas have been updated as appropriate in response to the new standard.
Implementing IFRS 9 is not expected to have a significant impact on the financial statements of the Group.
ii IFRS 15 is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer.
The standard permits either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach for the adoption.
The Group intends to adopt the full retrospective approach and will restate the 2017 comparative data accordingly in the 2018 Annual Report.
The Group has completed an extensive impact assessment which included submissions from each reporting entity.
Based on the assessment performed, it is expected that the new standard will have a limited impact on the results of the Group, estimated at less than 1% of Group revenue, with the main change relating to the timing of revenue recognition, either over time or point in time for certain Engineer to order contracts.
Initial planning has commenced for an assessment of the impact of the other standards applicable from 2019.
Non-GAAP measures The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
In measuring our performance, the financial measures that we use include those which have been derived from our reported results in order to eliminate factors which we believe distort period-on-period comparisons.
These are considered non-GAAP financial measures.
This information, along with comparable GAAP measurements, is useful to investors in providing a basis for measuring our operational performance.
Our management uses these financial measures, along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our performance and value creation.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information in compliance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP financial measures as reported by the Group may not be comparable with similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.
Below we set out our definitions of non-GAAP measures and provide reconciliations to relevant GAAP measures.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information The Weir Group PLC 139 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Free cash flow Free cash flow FCF is defined as cash flow from operating activities adjusted for income taxes, net capital expenditures, net interest payments, dividends paid, settlement of derivatives, purchase of shares for LTIP and other awards and pension contributions.
FCF reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that we believe is useful to investors as it represents cash flows that could be used for repayment of debt or to fund our strategic initiatives, including acquisitions, if any.
The reconciliation of cash flow from operating activities to FCF is as follows.

Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into three operating divisions: Minerals, Oil & Gas and Flow Control.
The three divisions are organised and managed separately based on the key markets served and each is treated as an operating segment and a reportable segment under IFRS 8.
The operating and reportable segments were determined based on the reports reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer which are used to make operational decisions.
The Minerals segment is the global leader in the provision of slurry handling equipment and associated aftermarket support for abrasive high wear applications used in the mining and oil sands markets.
The Oil & Gas segment provides products and service solutions to upstream, production, transportation and related industries.
The Flow Control segment designs and manufactures valves and pumps, and provides specialist support services to the global power generation, industrial and oil and gas sectors.
The Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of the operating segments based on operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items including impairments and intangibles amortisation segment result.
Finance income and expenditure and associated interest-bearing liabilities and derivative financial instruments are not allocated to segments as all treasury activity is managed centrally by the Group treasury function.
The amounts provided to the Chief Executive Officer with respect to assets and liabilities are measured in a manner consistent with that of the financial statements.
The assets are allocated based on the operations of the segment and the physical location of the asset.
The liabilities are allocated based on the operations of the segment.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arms length basis, in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
The segment information for the reportable segments for 2017 and 2016 is disclosed below.

The United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed on 22 December 2017 and included a broad range of tax reform including a reduction in the Federal rate of corporate income tax from 35% to 21% effective 1 January 2018 as well as significant changes to business deductions and other international tax provisions including changes to the rules governing interest deductibility.
US tax reform gives rise to a transitional one-off non-cash tax credit of 22.6m primarily due to the revaluation of the Groups aggregate US deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities following the reduction in the US Federal rate from 35% to 21%.
Finance arrangements are in place to fund the acquisition of business operations in overseas territories.
This finance is provided primarily to US operations through intragroup loans which provide a benefit to the Group effective tax rate.
In addition, the Group claims a partial exemption under the UK Controlled Foreign Companies legislation for profits from qualifying loan relationships.
The Group is monitoring the developments in relation to EU state aid investigations into this exemption, noting that at this stage the final outcome of any investigation is unclear.

Depreciation charge from discontinued operations for the year amounted to nil 2016: 0.3m.
During 2016, the Group disposed of land & buildings under sale and leaseback agreements in North America for 33.2m.
The gain on sale in relation to these disposals amounted to 5.1m.
The Group restructuring and rationalisation charge included the proceeds from a further property in North America which was disposed of outright for a consideration of 2.5m, resulting in an exceptional gain on sale of 1.3m.
These disposals were part of the Groups 2016 asset disposal programme.

Intangible assets continued The impairment charge recorded in 2016 of 0.4m relates to the write down of development costs in Minerals.
No impairment was recorded for the current year.
Brand names, with the exception of those acquired during the KOP Surface Products purchase, have been assigned an indefinite useful life and as such are not amortised.
The brand names acquired during 2017 will be amortised fully over the next two years.
The carrying value of brand names with an indefinite life is tested annually for impairment note 14.
There is no impairment charge in the current or prior year.
The carrying value at the year end was 223.7m 2016: 241.3m.
The brand name value includes the brands of Linatex, BDK, Warman, SPM, Gabbioneta, Multiflo, Mathena and Wales, all of which are considered to be market leaders in their respective markets.

Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information The Weir Group PLC 153 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 13. Business combinations On 27 July 2017, the Group completed the acquisition of KOP Surface Products KOP, a South Asian provider of advanced pressure control wellhead technologies, systems and services for a consideration of $118.0m less cash acquired of $3.9m.
The acquisition was funded by the issue of shares totalling 90.0m.
The provisional fair values, which are subject to finalisation during the first half of 2018, are disclosed in the table below.
There are certain intangible assets included in the 51.6m of goodwill recognised that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature.
These items include anticipated business growth, synergies and an assembled workforce.

It is expected that virtually all the contractual amounts will be collected.
KOP contributed 13.3m to revenue and an operating loss of 4.3m including exceptional items and intangibles amortisation in the period from acquisition to 31 December 2017.
If the acquisition had occurred at the start of 2017, the revenue and profit for the year from acquired operations, after exceptional items and intangibles amortisation, would not have been materially different from the results disclosed in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Acquisition costs totalled 1.5m in the year note 4.

Impairment testing of goodwill & intangible assets with indefinite lives Goodwill acquired through business combinations and intangible assets with indefinite lives have been allocated at acquisition to cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired.
KOP Surface Products, acquired during 2017 as described in note 13, has been allocated to the Oil & Gas International formerly Oil & Gas EMEA CGU.
The carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives have been allocated as per the table below.
Goodwill Intangibles Goodwill Intangibles 2017 2017 2016 2016 m m m m Flow Control 101.5 12.1 98.7 12.1 Minerals 372.9 130.0 396.0 143.2 Oil & Gas International 57.1 6.6 Oil & Gas North America 338.0 77.7 374.7 86.0 869.5 219.8 876.0 241.3 Description of CGUs A description of each of the CGUs is provided below along with a summary of the key drivers of revenue growth and EBITA margin.
Flow Control Flow Control includes the Gabbioneta brand.
Flow Control is a supplier of highly engineered pumps, valves and associated aftermarket services to oil and gas refinery, petro-chemical and power generation industries.
The key drivers for revenues are capital expenditure within oil refinery, petro-chemical industries and power generation.
Independent forecasts of expenditure in these sectors have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
These independent forecasts were prepared during the final quarter of 2017.
Minerals Minerals includes the Weir Warman, Weir Linatex and Weir Trio brands.
Weir Minerals companies supply pumps and associated equipment and services to all global mining markets.
The key drivers for revenues are: i levels of mining capital expenditure which drives demand for original equipment: and ii levels of actual mining activity which drives demand for spare parts and service.
Independent forecasts of mining capital expenditure and activity have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
Oil & Gas International Oil & Gas International comprises multiple service centre locations within the Middle East and Europe and the recently acquired wellhead locations across a number of countries in Asia Pacific.
The service centre locations supply services including repair, manufacture and certification of oilfield equipment, to a diverse portfolio of customers.
The Asia Pacific location supplies surface wellheads, surface trees, valves and actuators as well as providing support to customers including installation, maintenance, rental and refurbishment services.
The key drivers for revenues are oil and natural gas prices.
Independent forecasts of these commodity prices have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
Oil & Gas North America Oil & Gas North America includes the Weir SPM, Weir Seaboard and Weir Mathena brands.
This CGU is a supplier of oil and gas well service pumps, wellhead solutions, associated flow control equipment and services to the oil and gas production industry.
Demand in Oil & Gas North America is closely related to the number of conventional and unconventional oil drilling rigs and gas well drilling rigs in operation which is in turn dependent upon oil and natural gas prices and storage levels.
Independent forecasts of North American oil and gas well drilling activity, which take into account forecast oil and natural gas prices and storage levels, have been used during the final quarter of 2017 to derive revenue growth assumptions.

Impairment testing of goodwill & intangible assets with indefinite lives continued Impairment testing assumptions The basis of the impairment tests for the four primary CGUs including key assumptions are set out in the table below.
1 2 CGU Basis of valuation Period of forecast Discount rate Real growth Key assumptions Source External forecast 13.6% 1.2% Revenue growth Historical Flow Control Value in use 5 years 2016: 13.5% 2016: 1.2% EBITA margins experience External forecast 14.8% 1.2% Revenue growth Historical Minerals Value in use 5 years 2016: 16.3% 2016: 1.2% EBITA margins experience External forecast Oil & Gas 12.0% 1.2% Revenue growth Historical International Value in use 5 years 2016: 13.7% 2016: 1.2% EBITA margins experience External forecast Oil & Gas North 15.1% 1.2% Revenue growth Historical America Value in use 5 years 2016: 15.3% 2016: 1.2% EBITA margins experience 1 Discount rate The pre-tax nominal weighted average cost of capital WACC is the basis for the discount rate, with adjustments made, as appropriate, for geographic risk.
The WACC is the weighted average of the pre-tax cost of debt financing and the pre-tax cost of equity finance.
During the year, there have been changes in the bond yields, equity market risk premium and industry asset beta, which have led to a decrease in the overall discount rate for the majority of countries.
2 Real growth Real growth beyond the five year forecast period has been held consistent with the prior year at 1.2% 2016: 1.2%, reflecting the increasingly global nature of these businesses, the long-term growth prospects in their end markets and the fact that they sell a significant proportion of their products to emerging markets which also have strong long-term growth prospects.
EBITA margins EBITA margins have been forecast based on historical levels taking cognisance of the likely impact of changing economic environments and competitive landscapes on volumes and revenues, and the impact of associated management actions.
Impairment testing and sensitivity analysis Base case forecasts for all CGUs show significant headroom above carrying value.
No sensitivity analysis has been undertaken as there is no reasonable possible change in key assumptions that would cause the carrying values to exceed recoverable amounts.

It is expected that all costs related to such claims will have been incurred within five years of the balance sheet date.
Provision has been made in respect of sales contracts entered into for the sale of goods in the normal course of business where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contracts exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contracts.
Provision is made immediately when it becomes apparent that expected costs will exceed the expected benefits of the contract.
It is expected that the majority of these costs will be incurred within one year of the balance sheet date.
Asbestos-related claims Certain of the Groups US-based subsidiaries are co-defendants in lawsuits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are claiming damages arising from alleged exposure to products previously manufactured which contained asbestos.
The Group has comprehensive insurance cover for cases of this nature with all claims directly managed by the Groups insurers who also meet associated defence costs.
The insurers and their legal advisers agree and execute the defence strategy between them.
There are currently no related cash flows to or from the Group, and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future.
There remains inherent uncertainty associated with estimating future costs in respect of asbestos-related diseases.
Actuarial estimates of future indemnity and defence costs associated with asbestos-related diseases are subject to significantly greater uncertainty than actuarial estimates for other types of exposure.
This uncertainty results from factors that are unique to the asbestos claims litigation and settlement process including but not limited to: i The possibility of future state or federal legislation applying to claims for asbestos-related diseases: ii The ability of the plaintiffs bar to develop and sustain new legal theory and or develop new populations of claimants: iii Changes in focus of the plaintiffs bar: iv Changes in the Groups defence strategy: and v Changes in the financial condition of other co-defendants in suits naming the Group and affiliated businesses.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information The Weir Group PLC 163 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 A review of both the Groups expected liability for US asbestos-related diseases and the adequacy of the Groups insurance policies to meet future settlement and defence costs was completed in conjunction with external advisers.
The exercise was originally completed in 2014 and has been repeated in 2017 as part of our planned triennial actuarial update.
This review estimated future claims experience based on an industry standard epidemiological decay model and Weirs claims settlement history.
Due to the inherent uncertainty resulting from the changing nature of the US litigation environment as outlined above, and in conjunction with the actuarial review, the Directors consider 10 years 2016: 10 years of projected claims to provide a reliable estimate of the future liability.
A provision of 53.3m represents the Directors best estimate of the future liability, although these estimates and the period over which they are assessed will continue to be refined as the claims history develops.
Confirmation was also received from external advisers that the insurance asset remains sufficient to match the Directors best estimate of the future liability and therefore a corresponding asset continues to be recognised for insurance proceeds note 17.
There can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred.
Sensitivity analysis has been conducted which involved: i Increasing decreasing the number of projected future settled claims and estimated settlement value by 10%: or ii Increasing decreasing the basis of provision by two years.
Application of these sensitivities would not lead to a material change in the provision.
In the UK, there are outstanding asbestos-related claims which are not the subject of insurance cover.
The extent of the UK asbestos exposure involves a series of legacy employers liability claims which all relate to former UK operations and employment periods in the 1960s and 1970s.
In 1989 the Groups employers liability insurer Chester Street Employers Association Ltd was placed into run-off which effectively generated an uninsured liability exposure for all future long tail disease claims with an exposure period pre-dating 1 January 1972.
All claims with a disease exposure post 1 January 1972 are fully compensated via the Government established Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS.
Any settlement to a former employee whose service period straddles 1972 is calculated on a pro rata basis.
The Group provides for these claims based on managements best estimate of the likely costs given past experience of the volume and cost of similar claims brought against the Group.
The UK provision was reviewed and adjusted accordingly for claims experience in the year, resulting in a provision of 4.7m 2016: 5.2m.
Employee-related Employee-related provisions arise from legal obligations, the majority of which relate to compensation associated with periods of service.
Exceptional rationalisation Restructuring and rationalisation charges led to additions of 7.3m 2016: 63.0m during the year which related to continued costs from 2016 restructuring projects and additional costs of 2.1m as a result of an extension of a prior period legal claim.
During 2017, a transfer has been made from exceptional rationalisation to the warranties and onerous sales contract provision.
Included in the utilisation of the exceptional rationalisation provision in the year is non-cash utilisation items of 4.2m which led to a cash outflow of 28.6m.

In relation to the untaxed reserves, 34.7m relates to carried forward interest deductions in the US.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in the US on 22 December 2017 maintained the rule which allows surplus interest expenses to be carried forward indefinitely to be used against future earnings.
Forecasts have been prepared which indicate that this interest will be able to be substantially offset by 2022: therefore, it is considered appropriate to continue to recognise a deferred tax asset in respect of this amount.
Deferred tax asset balances for unused tax losses of 18.2m 2016: 11.5m have not been recognised on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence that these assets will be recoverable.
These assets will be recovered when future tax charges are sufficient to absorb these tax benefits.
Deferred tax asset balances for capital losses in the UK amounting to 5.9m 2016:4.2m have not been recognised, but would be available in the event of future capital gains being incurred by the Group.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information The Weir Group PLC 165 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Temporary differences associated with Group investments A deferred tax liability of 15.1m 2016: 23.1m has been recognised in respect of taxes on the unremitted earnings of the South American and Canadian subsidiaries and the unremitted earnings of the Canadian subsidiary of the US subgroup.
As at 31December 2017, this is the only recognised deferred tax liability in respect of taxes on unremitted earnings as the Group does not foresee a distribution of unremitted earnings from other subsidiaries or joint ventures which would result in a reversal of deferred tax.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised, aggregate to 1,971.9m 2016: 1,986.6m.
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.
UK Corporation tax rate changes Legislation was enacted on 26 October 2015 such that the main rate of UK corporation tax has been 19% since April 2017 and will be 17% from April 2020.
Consequently, UK deferred tax has been provided at the prevalent rates during the periods in which the UK temporary differences are expected to unwind.
As a result, deferred tax has been provided on UK temporary differences at 17.8% 2016: 17.8%.
Pensions & other post-employment benefit plans The Group has four main defined benefit pension plans in the UK and North America.
All defined benefit plans are closed to new members.
The most significant of the defined benefit plans are the two funded UK plans.
UK plans The Group has two funded defined benefit plans the Main Plan and the Executive Plan and an unfunded retirement benefit plan for retired executive directors.
The Group also operates a defined contribution plan, the contributions to which are in addition to those set out below, and are charged directly to the Consolidated Income Statement.
For the defined benefit plans, benefits are related to service and final salary.
The Main Plan closed to future accrual of benefits effective from 30 June 2015.
The weighted average duration of the expected benefit payments from the Main Plan is around 17 years and from the Executive Plan is around 14 years.
The current funding target for the UK plans is to maintain assets equal to the value of the accrued benefits.
The Main Plan holds two insurance policies which match the liabilities in respect of a significant proportion of deferred and retired pensioners.
The Executive Plan entered into an insurance contract in 2017 which matches the liabilities of the plan in full.
The regulatory framework in the UK requires the pension scheme Trustees and Group to agree upon the assumptions underlying the funding target, and then to agree upon the necessary contributions required to recover any deficit at the valuation date.
There is a risk to the Group that adverse experience against these assumptions could lead to a requirement for the Group to make considerable contributions to recover any deficit.
This risk is significantly reduced for the Main Plan and the Executive Plan through the insurance policies held.
North American plans The Group also sponsors two funded defined benefit pension plans in the US and Canada and certain unfunded postemployment healthcare benefits for senior employees in the US.
These plans combined make up 3% of the Groups pension and other post-employment benefit plan commitments and 2% of the Groups total associated assets.
The weighted average duration of these plans is around 10 years.

Pensions & other post-employment benefit plans continued Assumptions The significant actuarial assumptions used for accounting purposes reflect prevailing market conditions in the UK and NorthAmerica and are as follows.

7.2% per annum decreasing to 4.5% per annum and remaining static at that level from 2028 onwards.
The assumptions used to determine end-of-year benefit obligations are also used to calculate the following years cost.
For North America, weighted average assumptions are shown where applicable.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for expected increases in longevity.
The current disclosures above relate to assumptions based on longevity in years following retirement at the balance sheet date, with future being that relating to a member retiring in 2038 in 20 years time.

The pension plans have not directly invested in any of the Groups own financial instruments, or in properties or other assets used by the Group.
In the UK, where the majority of the Groups pension assets are held, the investment strategy is to hold equities and other return-seeking assets, such as diversified growth funds and a mixture of bonds, to meet the assessed value of the benefits promised for the non-insured deferred pensioners.
For the remaining deferred pensioners and the bulk of pensioners currently receiving their benefit, the liabilities are backed by insurance policies and suitable bonds.
The change in net liabilities recognised in the Balance Sheet is comprised as follows.
2017 2016 m m Opening net liabilities 137.2 81.8 Expense charged to profit & loss 0.7 3.5 Amount recognised in Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income 5.4 53.0 Employer contributions 4.2 3.9 Currency adjustment 1.4 2.8 Closing net liabilities 137.7 137.2 The Weir Group PLC 168 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 24.

A past service credit of 3.5m arose in 2017 in relation to certain members opting for a different benefit structure in one of the Groups US post-retirement medical arrangements.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of regular valuations using the projected unit method.
The Group made special contributions of 3.0m in 2017 2016: 2.8m in addition to the Groups regular contributions.
The most recent actuarial funding valuation of the Main Plan was as at 31 December 2014 when the funding shortfall was 65.0m.
Under the recovery plan agreed with the Trustees, the Group entered into a pension funding partnership structure under which it will contribute interests in a Scottish Limited Partnership SLP for the Main Plan.
The Main Plans interests in the SLP will reduce the deficit on a funding basis, although the agreement will not affect the position directly on an IAS 19 accounting basis as the investments held do not qualify as assets for IAS 19 purposes.
As a partner in the SLP, the Main Plan is entitled to receive a share of the profits of the SLP once a year for 15 years, subject to conditions being met.
The profits to be shared with the Plan will be reflected in the Groups financial statements as a pension contribution.
The Executive Plan actuarial valuation as at 31 December 2013 included a funding shortfall of 10.6m with agreed recovery contributions of 2.4m per annum to 31 December 2017.
The Trustees of the UK Executive Scheme entered into a full buy-in transaction in the third quarter of 2017, meaning all of the benefit payments due from the Executive Scheme are now covered by an insurance policy.
There remains an outstanding premium payment estimated to be 1.2m, which is expected to be paid in 2018 following a data cleanse process to finalise the insurance policy.
The IAS 19 Balance Sheet at the 2017 year end reflects this expected payment due.
The Group has taken legal advice regarding its UK arrangements to confirm the accounting treatment under IFRIC 14 and the current exposure draft of the revised IFRIC 14 with regard to recognition of a surplus in 2016 and also recognition of a minimum funding requirement.
This confirmed that there is no requirement to adjust the Balance Sheet and that recognition of a surplus in 2016 was appropriate on the basis that the Group has an unconditional right to a refund of a current or projected future surplus at some point in the future.
For the same reason, there is no requirement for the Group to adjust the Balance Sheet to recognise the future agreed deficit recovery contributions.
Having considered the position, taking account of the legal input received and noting that the Trustees of the UK arrangements do not have discretionary powers to unilaterally wind up the schemes without cause, the Directors of the Group have concluded that the Group has an unconditional right to a refund of any surplus.
Amendments to the current version of IFRIC 14 are currently being considered.
The total Group contributions for 2018 including those expected from the SLP in the UK are expected to be 6.2m.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information The Weir Group PLC 169 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Sensitivity analysis Changes in key assumptions can have a significant effect on the reported retirement benefit obligation and the Consolidated Income Statement expense for 2018.
The effects of changes in those assumptions on the reported retirement benefit obligation are set out in the table below.
Increase Decrease Increase Decrease 2017 2017 2016 2016 m m m m Discount rate Effect on defined benefit obligation of a 1.0% change 146.7 178.7 146.1 177.4 Effect on net liability of a 1.0% change 105.3 132.1 109.4 136.5 RPI inflation and associated assumptions Effect on defined benefit obligation of a 1.0% change 95.8 87.3 90.3 82.8 Effect on net liability of a 1.0% change 62.2 56.0 64.2 58.1 Life expectancy Effect on defined benefit obligation of a 1 year change 29.2 29.2 29.5 29.5 Effect on net liability of a 1 year change 14.0 14.0 15.5 15.5 The impact on the net liability is significantly reduced as a result of the insurance policies held.
In the absence of such policies, the impact on the net liability would be much closer to the significantly higher impact on the defined benefit obligation shown in the table.
These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the defined benefit obligation and net liability in isolation and assume no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date.
In practice, for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the invested non-insurance policy assets held by the plans.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligations are analysed as follows.

Equity settled share-based payments Employee share plans Under the Groups LTIP 2014 Rules the types of awards which may be granted under this Plan to employees include: Performance shares, Restricted shares and Bonus shares.
Details of each award are outlined in the Remuneration Report on pages 95 to 115.
One-off conditional share awards are also occasionally granted to employees.
These transactions fall under the scope of IFRS 2 and are treated in line with awards issued under the Groups LTIP.
The following tables illustrate the number and weighted average share prices WASP of shares awarded.

There are no performance conditions attached to these awards.
The fair value of occasional one-off conditional awards at grant date is also estimated on this basis.
ii Performance shares The grant date fair value of the performance share awards subject to the EPS and ROCE performance targets is calculated in the same way as the restricted share awards except that a discount of 11% is applied to reflect the holding period which applies to these awards.
The EPS and ROCE performance targets are non market vesting conditions for the purpose of IFRS 2 and so their effect is not allowed for in the grant date fair values.
The valuation of performance share awards subject to the TSR-related performance targets is performed using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The following table gives the assumptions made during the periods ended 31 December 2017 and 31December 2016 in the calculation of the fair value of awards subject to the TSR-related performance targets made in those years.
2017 2016 Weighted average expected volatility % 37.00 37.00 Weighted average expected life years 3.00 3.00 Weighted average risk free rate % 0.30 0.70 Weighted average share price 18.58 12.13 Weighted average fair value 8.17 5.84 The expected life of the awards is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
Market-related performance conditions have been taken into account in the calculation of fair values.
Bonus shares Under the Groups annual bonus plan, Executive Directors and members of the Group Executive typically receive 30% of any bonus deferred into an award of Weir Group shares which will normally be released after three years.
These awards are entitled to accrue the value of the dividends payable on any deferred bonus awards during the three year holding period.
The LTIP bonus shares are administered by the Estera EBT.
The shares are acquired on market at the grant date and are held in the Estera EBT until such time as they are vested.
Forfeited shares are reallocated in subsequent grants.
Under the terms of the Trust Deed, Weir Group is required to provide the Estera EBT with the necessary funding for the acquisition of the shares at the time of the grant.
The number of shares to be granted is determined based on the applicable annual bonus divided by the price at which the Companys shares are traded at the date of the grant.
The fair value of the rights at grant date was estimated using the market price of the Companys shares on that date.

Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business in order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk.
Derivatives are only used for economic hedging purposes and no speculative positions are taken.
Derivatives are recognised as held for trading and at fair value through profit and loss unless they are designated in IAS 39 compliant hedge relationships.
The table below summarises the types of derivative financial instrument included within each Balance Sheet category.

Financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities with the exception of derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction costs.
Subsequently they are recognised at either fair value or amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently re-measured at fair value.
Carrying amounts and fair values The table below shows the carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups financial instruments that are reported in the financial statements.

As such, disclosure of the fair value hierarchy for these items is not required.
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: q uoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: o ther techniques for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: Level 3: techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
At 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 the Group has classified contingent consideration as level 3.
A reconciliation of the movements in the contingent consideration fair value has been included in note 13.
During the periods ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and no transfers into or out of level 3 fair value measurements.
The Weir Group PLC 180 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 30.
Financial instruments continued Offsetting Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet where the Group currently has a legal right to offset the recognised amounts, and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
As at 31 December 2017, cash & short-term deposits of 284.6m 2016: 258.6m and current interest bearing loans & borrowings of 388.4m 2016: 144.0m were presented after elimination of debit and credit balances within individual pools of 1.3m 2016: 2.3m.
The Group has also entered into arrangements that do not meet the criteria for offsetting but still allow for the related amounts to be offset in specific circumstances.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had derivative financial instruments of 10.2m which were subject to master netting arrangements but not offset.
C. Hedging activities The Group designates certain derivative financial instruments in either cash flow hedging or net investment hedging relationships in accordance with IAS 39.
Cash flow hedge Net investment hedge Hedge relationship Cash flow hedge of highly probable forecast Net investment hedge of foreign operations foreign currency purchases and sales Hedged risk Transactional foreign exchange risk Translational foreign exchange risk Hedging instruments Forward foreign currency contracts Foreign currency debt Cross currency swaps Forward foreign currency contracts For each type of derivative financial instrument, the net carrying amount, maturity dates and the amounts recognised for the year in profit or loss and equity are set out in the table below.

Financial risk management Financial risk management of the Group is carried out by Group Treasury in conjunction with individual subsidiaries.
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Market risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business.
i Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to both transactional and translational foreign exchange risk.
Transactional risk arises when subsidiaries enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency for operational or financing purposes or when the Groups Treasury function enters into transactions for financing or risk management purposes.
Translational risk arises on the translation of overseas earnings and investments into Sterling for consolidated reporting purposes.
Foreign currency transactional and translational risk could result in volatility in reported consolidated earnings and net assets.
In respect of transactional foreign currency risk, the Group maintains a policy that all operating units eliminate exposures on material committed foreign currency transactions, usually by entering into forward foreign currency contracts through the Groups Treasury function.
Certain operating units apply cash flow hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39.
The Group does not engage in any speculative foreign exchange transactions.
The Group has material foreign investments in the US, Australia, Europe and South Africa.
In respect of translational risk, the Group has a policy of partially hedging its net investment exposure to US Dollar US$, Australian Dollar AUD, Euro EUR and South African Rand ZAR denominated subsidiaries.
This is achieved through designating an element of foreign currency borrowings, forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps as net investment hedges against the Groups investments.
The Group does not hedge the translational exposure arising from profit and loss items.
Sensitivity to foreign exchange rates The Group considers the most significant transactional foreign exchange risk relates to the Australian Dollar, Euro and US Dollar.
The following table shows the impact of movements in derivative valuation as a result of a weakening of these currencies.
In the Consolidated Income Statement, these amounts are offset by the retranslation of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables.
Effect on profit Effect on Increase in gain loss equity gain Transactional foreign exchange currency rate m m 2017 Australian Dollar 25% 11.1 19.5 Euro 25% 32.4 20.9 US Dollar 25% 0.7 130.1 2016 Australian Dollar 25% 6.2 18.5 Euro 25% 8.0 12.8 US Dollar 25% 1.1 124.6 The Weir Group PLC 182 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 30.
Financial instruments continued The Group is also exposed to translational foreign exchange risk as a result of its global operations and therefore the earnings of the Group will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates in relation to Sterling.
The Groups operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items and intangibles amortisation was denominated in the following currencies.
2017 2016 m m US Dollar 176.4 70.0 Australian Dollar 29.0 33.8 Euro 6.8 26.2 Canadian Dollar 33.9 36.6 United Arab Emirates Dirham 3.2 5.8 Chilean Peso 39.0 35.6 South African Rand 11.1 4.9 Brazilian Real 4.9 3.6 Russian Rouble 5.2 6.9 UK Sterling 21.6 11.2 Other 3.9 1.8 Operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items & intangibles amortisation 291.8 214.0 ii Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings.
Changes in interest rates will affect future interest cash flows on floating rate debt and the fair value of fixed rate borrowings.
The earnings of the Group are sensitive to changes in interest rates in respect of floating rate borrowings.
As at 31 December 2017, 26% of the Groups borrowings were at floating interest rates.
The interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing borrowings was as follows.
2017 2016 Floating rate Fixed rate Total Floating rate Fixed rate Total m m m m m m US Dollar 0.4 791.2 791.6 32.7 875.2 907.9 Euro 293.4 293.4 142.1 142.1 UK Sterling 43.0 43.0 43.0 43.0 Other 0.2 0.2 Sensitivity to interest rates Based on borrowings at 31 December 2017, a 1% increase in interest rates would have a 2.9m impact on the profit before tax and amortisation of the Group.
This assumes that the change in interest rates is effective from the beginning of the year and that all other variables are constant throughout the year.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its financial liabilities as they fall due.
Liquidity risk is managed by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and ensuring that sufficient committed facilities are in place to meet possible downside scenarios.
The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of fixed rate loan notes, bank loans, commercial paper and bank overdrafts.
Further details of the Groups borrowing facilities are disclosed in note 20.

The amounts disclosed in the table are undiscounted cash flows and may therefore not agree to the amounts disclosed in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The Group manages its liquidity to ensure that it always has sufficient funding to grow the business and is able to meet its obligations as they fall due.

The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables with risk spread over a large number of countries and customers, with no significant concentration of risk.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risk by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
In certain circumstances, operating entities are permitted to make use of invoice discounting facilities to reduce counterparty credit risk.
In addition, applicable creditworthiness checks are undertaken with external credit rating agencies before entering into contracts with customers and credit limits are set as appropriate and enforced.
As shown in note 17, the trade receivables presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are net of allowance for doubtful debts.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identifiable loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of amounts due to the Group.
The Groups exposure to the credit risk of financial instruments is limited by the adherence to counterparty credit limits, and by only trading with counterparties that have an investment-grade credit rating or better at contract inception, based upon ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies.
Exposures to those counterparties are regularly reviewed and, when the market view of a counterpartys credit quality changes, adjusted as considered appropriate.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of the financial assets of the Group.
The Weir Group PLC 184 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 31.
Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains robust capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group monitors capital using the following indicators.
Net debt to EBITDA cover Net debt to EBITDA comprises net debt divided by operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items, intangibles amortisation and depreciation.
The Groups banking arrangements include bi-annual financial covenants of net debt to EBITDA not greater than 3.5 and interest cover not less than 3.5.
For the purposes of the covenants required by the Groups lenders, the net debt is to be converted at the exchange rate used in the preparation of the Groups income statement and cash flows, i. e. average rate.
In addition, results of businesses acquired in the financial year have to be included as if the acquisitions occurred at the start of the financial year, while the results of businesses disposed of in the year are to be excluded.
The Group considers that the ratio of net debt to EBITDA is the key metric from a capital management perspective and seeks to maintain the ratio below two times.
Given the recent downturn in oil and gas markets, the metric is currently 2.5 times but is on a downward trajectory and remains actively managed.
