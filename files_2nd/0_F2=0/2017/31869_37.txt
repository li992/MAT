For details of the Companys bank borrowing facility, see note 14.
The Boar d gives guidance to Janus Henderson as to the maximum amount of the Companys resources that should be invested inany one company.
The policy is that the Company should remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings should be used to fund short term cash requirements.

cash at bank and overdrafts are held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.
Stock lending transactions ar e carried out with a number of approved counterparties, whose credit rating is reviewed regularly by Janus Henderson and limits are set on the amount that may be lent to any one counterparty.
Stock lending is the temporary transfer of securities by a lender to a borrower, with an agreement by the borrower to return equivalent securities to the lender at an agreed future date.
Stock lending revenue is received for making the investments available to the borrower, which increases the returns on the portfolio.
In all cases securities lent continue to be recognised in the Statement of Financial Position.
Details of the value of securities on loan at the year end, and the collateral held, can be found in note 4.
