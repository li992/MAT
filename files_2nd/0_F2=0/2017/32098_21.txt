The use of these alternative performance measures is consistent with those used by sell-side equity analysts who write research on the Group and how institutional investors consider the performance of the Group.
Facility EBITDA was the measure used under the Groups $420m Revolving Credit Facility to determine the Net Debt to Facility EBITDA covenant calculation.
Whilst the $420m facility was repaid and cancelled as part of the renancing on the acquisition of TAG, for consistency the directors will continue to use the metric Net Debt to Facility EBITDA.
These measures are not dened in IFRS and thus may not be comparable to similarly titled measures by other companies.

A deferred tax debit of $0.3m 2016: $1.7m debit as at 30 April 2017 has been recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the year in relation to the dened benefit pension schemes.
The tax charge for the year ended 30 April 2017 is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19.92% 2016: 20.0%.

Excluding these provisions, the net impact of the higher foreign tax rates is $3.9m 2016: $14.2m.
This reduction in the year ended 30 April 2017 is primarily attributable to a lower level of profits subject to US tax.
The Group realized benets in relation to intra-group nancing of $15.6m for the year ended 30 April 2017 2016: $14.4m.
The benets mostly relate to arrangements put in place to facilitate the acquisitions of TAG and Serena.
Benets from the UK patent box regime amounted to $7.6m for the year ended 30 April 2017 2016: $7.6m.
The movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year is analyzed in note 28.
The Finance Act 2016, which provides for a reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 17% effective from 1 April 2020, was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016.
This rate reduction has been reected in the calculation of deferred tax at the balance sheet date and has reduced the tax charge in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income by $1.3m.
This reects the net impact of the re-measurement of deferred tax balances, in particular liabilities relating to intangibles.
The expenses not deductible increase the tax charge in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income by $10.0m 2016: $7.7m.
The increase is due to non-deductible costs incurred in relation to the acquisitions of Serena and GWAVA and costs incurred in relation to the forthcoming HPE Software transaction.
The Group realized a net credit in relation to the true-up of prior year current and deferred tax estimates of $2.7m for the year ended 30 April 2017 2016: $4.6m.
In the year ended 30 April 2016, there was a significant movement between current and deferred tax in the US as a result of the Group being able to utilize signicantly higher deferred tax assets losses and tax credits against prior year current federal and state tax liabilities than previously anticipated.

The hindsight period adjustments in the year ended 30 April 2016 relate to transactions that occurred within 12 months of the acquisition date and are attributable to TAG acquired during the year ended 30 April 2015 note 37.
The additions to goodwill in the year ended 30 April 2017 relate to the acquisition of Spartacus Acquisition Holdings Corp. the holding company of Serena Software Inc. Serena and GWAVA Inc. GWAVA note 37.
Of the additions to goodwill, there is no amount that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to each individual cash generating unit CGU.
The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the net present value on the recoverable amount of the CGU to which goodwill has been allocated.
It has been determined that the Group has two CGUs being the two product portfolio groups: Micro Focus and SUSE.
An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of the CGU with their recoverable amount, where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
The Group has carried out its annual impairment testing at 30 April each year.
During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment, with no impairment charge resulting 2016: $nil.
The recoverable amounts of the two CGUs are determined based on the value in use VIU calculations.
The determination of whether or not the goodwill of the two CGUs has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the VIU of the CGUs to which that goodwill has been allocated.
The VIU calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the CGUs.
The cash ow projections in the three following financial years reect managements expectation of the medium and long-term operating performance of the CGU and growth prospects in the CGUs market.
Key assumptions The key assumptions in the VIU calculations are: The discount rate applied to each CGU: Operating margin: and The long-term growth rate of net operating cash ows.
In determining the key assumptions, management has taken into consideration the current economic climate, the resulting impact on expected growth and discount rates and the pressure these place on the impairment calculations.
The directors have considered combinations of a reduction in the operating margins across the two CGUs combined with a reasonably possible increase in the absolute discount rate and a reasonably possible decrease in the long-term growth rates and no impairment would occur in these scenarios.
Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 127 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2017 continued 9 Goodwill continued Discount rate applied The Group based its estimate for the pre-tax discount rate on its weighted average cost of capital WACC and using long-term market and industry data to derive the appropriate inputs to the calculation.
The discount rate applied to the two CGUs represents a pre-tax rate that reects market assessment of the time value of money at the consolidated statement of financial position date which has been adjusted for risks specic to each CGU.
For the purposes of the impairment review the directors have calculated discount rates for both CGUs and then applied the higher discount rate of 11.4% 2016: 11.6%.
The directors have assessed that a 2.0% 2016: 2.0% change in the absolute discount rate is the maximum change that could be considered as reasonably possible.
If the estimated pre-tax discount rates applied to the discounted cash ows of all of the two CGUs were 2.0% 2016: 2.0% higher in absolute terms than the managements estimate, the Group would not have any impairment charge.
Operating margins The operating margin for each CGU is primarily based upon past performance adjusted as appropriate where management believes that past operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins.
The operating margins for each of the two CGUs is primarily based upon past performance adjusted as appropriate where management believes that past operating margin are not indicative of future operating margin.
The operating margins applied to the Micro Focus CGU is c. 50% 2016: 55% and the SUSE CGU is 31% 2016: 32%.
The directors consider that a reduction of 4.0% for Micro Focus and 2.0% for SUSE in the absolute value of operating margins would be the limit of what could be considered to be reasonably possible on the basis that the Groups cost base is exible and could quickly respond to market changes.
The Group is spread across a range of geographies and sectors and also offers customer cost saving solutions, which help to insulate it from more significant changes.
If the operating margin used in the VIU calculations for all CGUs were 4.0% for Micro Focus and 2.0% for SUSE lower in absolute terms than managements estimates, the Group would not have any impairment charge.
If the operating margins remain in perpetuity at the current year levels then there would also not be any impairment charge.
Long-term growth rate The VIU calculations are based on five years projections and then a terminal value calculation.
The long-term growth rates of net operating cash ows are assumed to be 1% for the Micro Focus CGU 2016: 1% and 5% for the SUSE CGU 2016: 5%.
The Group considers that the long-term growth rates could change and that a change to 0% for Micro Focus and 2.0% for SUSE is reasonably possible.
If the absolute value of the long-term growth used in the VIU calculations for all CGUs were 0% for Micro Focus and 2.0% for SUSE lower than managements estimates, the Group would not have recognized any goodwill impairment charge.
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic life see Group accounting policy I d.

The Group considers the credit quality of trade and other receivables on a customer by customer basis.
The Group considers that the carrying value of the trade and other receivables that is disclosed below gives a fair presentation of the credit quality of the assets.
This is considered to be the case as there is a low risk of default due to the high number of recurring customers and credit control policies.
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers the ageing of each debtor and any change in the circumstances of the individual receivable.
Due to this, management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
At 30 April 2017 and 2016, the carrying amount approximates the fair value of the instrument due to the short-term nature of the instrument.
At 30 April 2017, trade receivables of $39.9m 2016: $28.8m were past due but not impaired.
These relate to a large number of independent companies for whom there is no recent history of default.
The amounts are regarded as recoverable.
The average age of these receivables was 24 days in excess of due date 2016: 20 days.
As at 30 April 2017, trade receivables of $2.6m 2016: $4.5m were either partially or fully impaired.
The amount of the provision was $2.6m 2016: $4.5m.
The ageing of these receivables is as follows: 2017 2016 $000 $000 Up to three months 48 233 Three to four months 731 473 Over four months 1,820 3,780 2,599 4,486 Movements in the Group provision for impairment of trade receivables were as follows: 2017 2016 $000 $000 At 1 May 4,486 2,520 Provision for receivables impairment 2,023 2,531 Receivables written off as uncollectable 1,271 361 Receivables previously provided for but now collected 2,542 244 Exchange adjustments 97 40 At 30 April 2,599 4,486 The creation and release of provision for impaired receivables have been included in selling and distribution costs in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

25 Pension commitments a Dened contribution The Group has established a number of pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees.
The principal funds are those in the US, UK and Germany.
These were funded schemes of the dened contribution type.
Outside of these territories, the schemes are also of the dened contribution type, except for France and Japan which is a dened benefit scheme, but which has few members and therefore is not significant to the Group.
Pension costs for dened contribution schemes are as follows: 2017 2016 $000 $000 Defined contribution schemes note 33 13,483 12,848 b Dened benefit 2017 2016 $000 $000 Within non-current assets: Long-term pension assets 22,031 22,272 Within non-current liabilities: Retirement benefit obligations 30,773 31,669 There are four 2016: three dened benefit plans in Germany under broadly similar regulatory frameworks.
All of the plans are final salary pension plans, which provide benets to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life in the case of retirement, disability and death.
The level of benets provided depends not only on the final salary but also on members length of service, social security ceiling and other factors.
Final pension entitlements are calculated by our Actuary at Swiss Life.
They also complete calculations for cases of death in service and disability.
There is no requirement for the appointment of Trustees in Germany.
The schemes are administered locally with the assistance of German pension experts.
All four plans were closed for new membership.
During the year ended 30 April 2017 a pension scheme arrangement in Germany was identied as requiring reclassication under German law from a dened contribution scheme to a dened benefit scheme.
Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 143 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2017 continued 25 Pension commitments continued Long-term pension assets Long-term pension assets relate to the reimbursement right under insurance policies held by the Company with guaranteed interest rates that do not meet the denition of a qualifying insurance policy as they have not been pledged to the plan and are subject to the creditors of the Group.
Such reimbursement rights assets are recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position as long-term pension assets.
Fair value of the reimbursement right asset is deemed to be the present value of the related obligation because the right to reimbursement under the insurance policies exactly matches the amount and timing of some or all of the benets payable under the dened benefit plan.
The movement on the long-term pension asset is as follows: 2017 2016 $000 $000 As at 1 May 22,272 14,076 Hindsight adjustment note 37 3,917 Interest on non-plan assets note 5 404 333 Benefits paid 110 8 Contributions 442 475 Included within other comprehensive income: Actuarial loss gain on non-plan assets 2,134 3,104 Reclassification from defined contribution scheme to defined benefit scheme 2,264 130 3,104 Foreign currency exchange loss gain 1,107 375 As at 30 April 22,031 22,272 The non-plan assets were not subject to an actuarial revaluation until after 30 April 2015 and therefore a hindsight adjustment has been made in respect of this and reected in last years consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Retirement benefit obligations The following amounts have been included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in respect of the German dened benefit pension arrangements: 2017 2016 $000 $000 Current service charge note 33 625 760 Charge to operating profit 625 760 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 660 546 Interest on pension scheme assets 95 79 Charge to finance costs note 5 565 467 Total charge to consolidated statement of comprehensive income 1,190 1,227 The contributions for the year ended 30 April 2018 are expected to be broadly in line with the current year.
144 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Consolidated financial Company financial Overview Strategic report Corporate governance statements and notes statements and notes Additional information 25 Pension commitments continued The following amounts have been recognized as movements in equity: 2017 2016 $000 $000 Actuarial return on assets excluding amounts included in interest income 9 108 Experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of scheme liabilities: Demographic Financial 2,821 2,024 Experience 568 565 3,389 2,589 Reclassification from defined contribution scheme to defined benefit scheme Exchange rate movement 2,996 Exchange rate movement Movement in the year 402 2,697 The key assumptions used for the German scheme were: 2017 2016 Rate of increase in final pensionable salary 2.00% 2.60% Rate of increase in pension payments 2.00% 2.00% Discount rate 1.95% 1.70% Inflation 2.00% 2.00% The net present value of the dened benefit obligations of the German scheme is sensitive to both the actuarial assumptions used and to market conditions.
If the discount rate assumption was 0.5% lower, the obligation would be expected to increase by $4.5m as at 30 April 2017 2016: $4.8m and if it was 0.5% higher, they would be expected to decrease by $3.9m 2016: $4.1m.
If the ination assumption was 0.25% lower, the obligations would be expected to decrease by $1.2m as at 30 April 2017 2016: $1.3m and if it was 0.25% higher, they would be expected to increase by $1.3m 2016: $1.4m.
The mortality assumptions for the German scheme are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics and experience in the territory, specically German pension table Richttafeln 2005 G by Prof. Dr. Klaus Heubeck.
These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at age 65: 2017 2016 Retiring at age 65 at the end of the reporting year: Male 19 19 Female 23 23 Retiring 15 years after the end of the reporting year: Male 19 19 Female 24 24 The net present value of the dened benefit obligations of the German Schemes are sensitive to the life expectancy assumption.
If there was an increase of one year to this assumption the obligation would be expected to increase by $1.1m 2.9% as at 30 April 2017 2016: $1.1m, 2.9%.
The net liability included in the consolidated statement of financial position arising from obligations in respect of dened benefit schemes is as follows: 2017 2016 $000 $000 Present value of funded obligations 36,480 37,524 Fair value of plan assets 5,707 5,855 30,773 31,669 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 145 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2017 continued 25 Pension commitments continued The retirement benefit obligation has moved as follows: 2017 2016 Defined Retirement Defined Retirement benefit Scheme benefit benefit Scheme benefit obligations assets obligations obligations assets obligations $000 $000 $000 $000 $000 $000 At 1 May 37,524 5,855 31,669 38,224 5,482 32,742 Current service cost 625 625 760 760 Benefits paid 197 87 110 100 84 16 Contributions by plan participants 114 114 126 126 Interest cost income note 5 660 95 565 546 79 467 Included within other comprehensive income: Remeasurements actuarial losses: Demographic Financial 2,821 2,821 2,024 2,024 Experience 568 568 565 565 Actuarial return on assets excluding amounts included in interest income 9 9 108 108 Reclassification from defined contribution scheme to defined benefit scheme 2,996 2,996 393 9 402 2,589 108 2,697 Foreign currency exchange changes 1,739 279 1,460 683 144 539 At 30 April 36,480 5,707 30,773 37,524 5,855 31,669 None of the plan assets are represented by financial instruments of the Group.
None of the plan assets are occupied or used by the Group.
The plan assets comprise of re-insurance with guaranteed interest rates.
The majority of the plan assets have guaranteed interest rates of 4.0%, with the remaining at 3.25% or 2.75%.
Through its dened benefit schemes the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the pledged and unpledged re-insurance holdings.
Ination Some of the Group pension obligations are linked to ination, and higher ination will lead to higher liabilities.
There is a cap on the level of inationary increase on one of the plans which protects the plan against extreme ination.
The majority of the plan assets are either unaffected by or loosely correlated with ination, meaning an increase in ination will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the plan obligations are to provide benets for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plan liabilities.
In the case of the dened benefit plans, the Company ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset liability matching ALM that has been developed by the Company to achieve long-term investments that are in line with the obligations under the pension schemes.
In addition to the plan assets outlined above, the Company had re-insurance assets valued at $22.1m as at 30 April 2017 2016: $22.3m.
These assets are designated to fund the pension obligation and do not qualify as plan assets as they have not been pledged to the plan and are subject to the creditors of the Company.
Within this framework the Companys objective is to match assets to the pension obligations by investing in re-insurances that match the benefit payments as they fall due and in the appropriate currency.
Sensitivities The table below provides information on the sensitivity of the dened benefit obligation to changes to the most significant actuarial assumptions.
The table shows the impact of changes to each assumption in isolation, although, in practice, changes to assumptions may occur at the same time and can either offset or compound the overall impact on the dened benefit obligation.
146 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Consolidated financial Company financial Overview Strategic report Corporate governance statements and notes statements and notes Additional information 25 Pension commitments continued These sensitivities have been calculated using the same methodology as used for the main calculations.

Share based payments The Group has various equity-settled share based compensation plans details of which are provided below.
a Incentive Plan 2005 On 27 April 2005 the remuneration committee approved the rules of the Incentive Plan 2005 LTIP which permits the granting of share options to executive directors and senior management.
The total number of options they receive is determined by the performance criteria set by the remuneration committee over a three year performance period.
Prior to 18 April 2011 performance conditions required that cumulative EPS growth over a three year vesting period is at least equal to Retail Prices Index RPI plus 11% at which point 25% of awards will vest, 60% of shares will vest for cumulative EPS growth of RPI plus 13% and for full vesting the cumulative EPS growth will be required to be RPI plus 15% per annum.
RPI is the general index of the UK retail prices for all items published by the Ofce of National Statistics or any similar index replacing it.
Straight-line vesting will apply between these points.
Awards granted on or after 18 April 2011 are subject to either Absolute Shareholder Returns ASR over a three year period, cumulative EPS growth or a combination of both.
ASR is dened as the average closing share price over the period of five days ending on the day prior to the vesting date less the reference price plus the total of all dividends and cash distributions and any other measures as determined by the Remuneration Committee between the award date and the vesting date.
Where the cumulative EPS growth over a three year period is at least equal to RPI plus 3% per annum 25% of awards will vest, with full vesting is achieved when the cumulative EPS growth is RPI plus 9% per annum.
Straight line vesting will apply between these points.
Where the award is subject to ASR, the resulting level of vesting will be reduced by 25% if the ASR is below 150 pence or increased by 50% if ASR is 300 pence or more.
Further details are provided in the remuneration committee report on pages 70 to 91.

Grants could be made to no more than 15 people within 18 months of the Completion date.
ASGs are nil cost options over Ordinary Shares.
The number of Ordinary Shares subject to the ASGs will be a maximum of 2.5% of the Share Capital.
The ASGs will become exercisable, subject to the satisfaction of the performance condition, on the third anniversary of the TAG acquisition or 1 November 2017, whichever is earlier the vesting date and will remain exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the TAG acquisition.
The performance condition is that the percentage of Ordinary Shares subject to the ASG which may be acquired on exercise on or after the vesting date is as follows: i 0% if the Shareholder Return Percentage as dened below is 50% or less: ii 100% if the Shareholder Return Percentage is 100% or more: and iii A percentage determined on a straight line basis between i and ii above.
The Shareholder Return Percentage will be calculated by deducting 819.425 pence per share the Reference Price, being the average of the 20 days before 3 June 2014 being the date of the heads of agreement relating to the proposed combination of Micro Focus and Attachmate between Micro Focus, Wizard, Golden Gate Capital and Francisco Partners Management LP, from the sum of the Vesting Price calculated as the average closing share price over the period of 20 days ending on the day prior to the vesting date plus the total of all dividends per share between 20 November 2014 and the vesting date.
