Remuneration report continued Implementation of remuneration policyfor 2018 Basis for determining executive Directors annual bonus awards for performance in 2018 Executive Directors annual bonus awards for performance in 2018 will be based on broadly the same performance metrics as were considered for 2017 see pages 82 and 83, including ESG factors.
The process to determine awards will be unchanged.
Targets are commercially sensitive and so both the targets and performance against those targets will be disclosed retrospectively in the 2018 Annual report on remuneration.
The Committee is satisfied that the Directors remuneration policy and its implementation do not raise ESG risks by inadvertently motivating the wrong behaviours in the executive Directors.
LTIP awards to be granted in 2018 In accordance with the Directors remuneration policy, the Committee intends to grant LTIP awards over shares with the following values to the executive Directors in March 2018: Director LTIP face value at grant Peter Harrison 600,000 Richard Keers 400,000 The vesting of these awards will be based on EPS and NNB performance conditions and targets as outlined on page 84.
The Committee has reviewed the make-up of Schroders AUM at 31 December 2017 to determine the indices and weightings that will make up the composite index against which EPS performance will be measured, as a proxy for the market movement of Schroders AUM.
For awards to be granted in March 2018, the following weighted basket of indices will be used: Weighting Index % Morgan Stanley Capital International All Countries Asia Pacific 15.0 Morgan Stanley Capital International Emerging Markets 7.5 Morgan Stanley Capital International All Countries World 15.0 Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe 7.5 FTSE All Share 5.0 Barclays Capital Global Aggregate 50.0 By Order of the Board.
