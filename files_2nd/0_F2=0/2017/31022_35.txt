FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2017 1.
Presentation of the financial statements 1.1 Critical accounting areas of judgment and estimation In preparing these financial statements, critical judgements in the application of accounting policies can have a significant effect on the financial results, moreover any changes in critical estimates and assumptions made could materially impact the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported next year as actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates or those estimates could in future change.
The following critical estimates if changed next year would materially impact reported performance: Carrying value of investments in subsidiary undertakings The Companys investments in subsidiary undertakings are carried at historical cost less any provision for impairment.
The Companys investments in the UK arise from the acquisition of Coordinated Drug Development Limited in August 1999 and Innovata Plc in January 2007, Germany from the Activaero transaction in March 2014 and the Swiss and US investments on the Skyepharma merger in June 2016.
As these investments are not amortised, their carrying values are at risk of impairment.
Their recoverable amount is assessed with reference to the discounted cash flow forecasts associated with these territories including their products, research and development programmes, technologies and intellectual property which for the more recent transactions are typically recognised as purchased intangible assets in the Consolidated financial statements of the Group.
It is likely that any significant diminution in expected value from the underlying operations from the investments would result in impairment.
The Company continues to monitor progress of its investments in Switzerland.
The carrying value of the investment in Germany is particularly sensitive to the outcome of the VR475 FAVOLIR Phase III study and VR647 SCIPE Phase II study scheduled for completion in the second half of 2018.
Basis of preparation accounting policies for the Company financial statements In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement, and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU IFRS, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 2006 and has excluded certain information as permitted by FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.
Details of Directors remuneration, share options and retirement benefits are given in the Remuneration report.
These financial statements, which are prepared using the historical cost convention and on a going concern basis, are prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework and with UK accounting presentation and the Companies Act 2006 as at 31 December 2016, with comparative figures as at 31 December 2016.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the income statement of the Company is not presented in this Annual Report.
The Company also takes exemptions in relation to share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation ofcomparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement and certain related-party transactions, onthe basis that equivalent disclosures are given in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Key accounting policies and judgements relate to investments in subsidiary undertakings and are disclosed in note 4 Investments in subsidiary undertakings.
3. Dividend income The Company received dividend income from subsidiary undertakings totalling 29.0m 2016: nil.
The Companys immediate subsidiary undertaking Skyepharma Limited declared ordinary dividends of 14.0m and 15.0m, which were fully settled for cash in September and November 2017 respectively.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiaries are stated at historical cost less any provision for impairment.
The carrying amounts of the Companys investments are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication of impairment.
If such an indication exists, then the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to ensure that the carrying value remains supportable.
Any impairment charges are recognised in the income statement and are reflected in an allowance against the carrying value.
The distributable reserves of Vectura Group plc are protected from the impact of any decrease in the valuations of investments to the extent of the merger reserves, which become distributable to offset any changes in the investment carrying value.
When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through the Company income statement.

Disposal of dormant subsidiaries On 7 December 2017, the Group disposed of 14 dormant UK-based subsidiaries by appointing KPMG as liquidator pursuant to a member voluntary liquidation process.
As these entities were dormant they were disposed of for nil consideration, and as these entities only contained intercompany positions, thereby already fully eliminated out upon consolidation, there was no impact on the Groups results.
The entities subject to the member voluntary liquidation process are as follows: 1 Quadrant Healthcare UK Limited, 2 Andaris Group Limited, 3 Quadrant Holdings Cambridge Limited, 4 Microshot Limited, 5 Quadrant Bioresource Limited, 6 Andaris DDS Limited, 7 Quadrant Trustee Limited, 8 Protosome Limited, 9 Sun Wharf Stratford Limited, 10 Vine Building Maintenance Limited, 11 VineIndustries Limited, 12 Vinestand Limited, 13 Playscheme Limited and 14 Big Ben Scaffolding Limited.
As the liquidation process has yet to be completed, the liquidator has confirmed that no contingent liabilities have been identified andhence no further costs in relation to these entities are expected to be incurred.

Merger reserves A merger reserve is used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of newshares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under section 612 and section 613 of the Companies Act 2006.
Merger relief under the UKCompanies Act 2006 is available to allow recognition of a merger reserve as opposed to non-distributable share premium.
The merger reserves are non-distributable reserves, but become distributable to offset any future diminution in the investment value or where that investment is disposed of for qualifying consideration.

Dividend policy Vectura has not paid dividends in the past.
The declaration and payment of any dividends in the future will depend on the results of operations, financial conditions, cash requirements, future prospects, profits available for distribution and other factors deemed by the Vectura Board to be relevant at the time.
At present, the Vectura Board does not expect to pay any dividends in the near to medium term.
The Board will continue to reassess this position based on the factors above.
