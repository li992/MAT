STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements 1 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS The Group has eight reportable segments which have been identified based on the operating segments of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, which has been determined to be the Executive Committee, in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
Operating segments are then aggregated into reporting segments to combine those with similar economic characteristics.
The following summary describes the operations of each of the Groups reportable segments: Distribution Australasia Distribution of new vehicles and parts in Australia and New Zealand together with associated marketing and logistics operations.
UK and Europe Distribution of new vehicles and parts, together with associated marketing activities, in mature European markets.
Asia Exclusive distribution and sale of new vehicles and parts in Asian markets, together with associated aftersales activities of service and bodyshop repairs.
Emerging Markets Distribution of new vehicles and parts in growing markets, together with associated aftersales activities of service and bodyshop repairs.
Retail Australasia Sale of new and used vehicles in Australia together with associated aftersales activities of service, bodyshop repairs and parts sales.
UK & Europe Sale of primarily new and used premium vehicles in mature markets, together with associated aftersales activities of service, bodyshop repairs and parts sales.
Emerging Markets Sale of new and used vehicles in growing markets together with associated aftersales activities of service, bodyshop repairs and parts sales.
Central Comprises the Groups head office function and includes all central activities including the Board, finance, human resources, marketing, governance and global information services.
Following the acquisition of the BMW Distribution operations in Estonia, operations with similar economic characteristics in UK and Europe have been reclassified from Retail to Distribution in the prior period comparatives for consistency.

com 119 Notes to the financial statements continued 5 PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Group operates a number of pension and post-retirement benefit schemes for its employees in a number of its businesses, primarily in the UK.
a. UK schemes: benefits, governance, cash flow obligations and investments The Group operates three main defined benefit final salary pension schemes in the UK which are all closed to new employees and largely closed to future benefit accrual.
The schemes are the Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme comprising the Group, Motors, Normand and Cash sections, the Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme and the TKM Group Pension Scheme.
Cash is a defined benefit cash balance scheme, open to accrual for current and new employees, which is designed to meet regulatory requirements for auto-enrolment legislation.
Benefit structure Final salary schemes provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on final salary at retirement or leaving date, if earlier and length of service.
The Group underwrites investment, mortality and inflation risks necessary to meet the obligations under the schemes.
In the event of poor returns, increased life expectancy or higher than expected inflation, the Group is required to address any shortfall through a combination of an increase in contributions or by making appropriate adjustments to the schemes.
Cash balance schemes like Cash allow members to accrue a percentage of their earnings each year, which then grows to provide a lump sum payment on retirement.
Members have accrued benefits under this scheme with effect from 1 January 2013.
The Group underwrites the investment risk to normal retirement age 65, but all inflation and mortality risks associated with benefits are borne solely by the members.
Across the schemes a number of exercises have been undertaken to significantly mitigate these key funding risks.
Governance Our UK schemes are registered with HMRC and comply fully with the regulatory framework published by the UK Pensions Regulator.
Benefits are paid to members from separate funds administered by an independent trustee company the Trustee appointed by the Group.
The Trustee is required to act in the best interest of the members, and is responsible for making funding and investment decisions in conjunction with the Group.
The Group also has some minor unfunded arrangements relating to post-retirement health and medical plans in respect of past employees.
There are no material defined contribution schemes in the UK.
Scheme specific cash obligation investment detail Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme Group, Motors and Normand sections closed sections The latest actuarial valuations for these sections were carried out at 5 April 2016 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the defined accrued benefit method.
The actuarial valuation determined that the duration of the liabilities was approximately 18 years and that a small surplus existed.
The Group contributes 0.6m p. a. towards the administrative costs of running these sections and no further review is scheduled until April 2019.
For the Normand section, the Group also currently pays deficit reduction contributions of 1.1m p. a. rising by 3.05% p. a. up until 5 April 2026 at which point the funding shortfall is expected to be eliminated.
Each sections investment strategy sees it holding a proportion of its assets in matching assets 75% for the Group section and 40% for the Motors and Normand sections with the remainder in growth assets.
The matching assets are invested in a liability driven investment solution complemented with absolute return bonds.
They are designed to hedge inflation and interest rate risk in a capitally efficient manner.
The growth assets are invested in assets that are expected to grow at rates significantly faster than each sections liabilities and include diversified growth funds and property.
Cash section This scheme is a defined benefit scheme under which members accrue benefits with effect from 1 January 2013, or date of joining if later.
The latest actuarial valuation was carried out at 5 April 2016 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit credit method.
The valuation showed the funding level to be 98%, with the Trustee expecting the small shortfall to be removed by the ongoing pension contributions and returns on the assets held.
The Group contributes 0.2m p. a. towards the administrative costs of running the scheme and the next review is in April 2019.
The investment strategy is to be 60% invested in diversified growth funds which are designed to grow at a rate significantly faster than the liabilities, whilst spreading investment risk across a broad spectrum of asset classes.
The remaining 40% is allocated to absolute return bonds.
120 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 120 Inchcape Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5 PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme This scheme is managed from Guernsey and is subject to regulations similar to the UK.
It is therefore reported under the United Kingdom in this note.
The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out at 31 March 2015 and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the attained age method.
The actuarial valuation determined that the duration of the liabilities was approximately 11 years and that the scheme was approximately 86% funded on a prudent funding basis.
The Group contributes 0.8m p. a. towards scheme administrative costs and improving the funding ratio.
The investments are managed under a Fiduciary Management arrangement with the level of investment risk inherent in the investment arrangements reducing as and when the funding level improves.
TKM Group Pension Scheme closed scheme In November 2015, the trustees of the TKM Group Pension Scheme completed a buy-in transaction whereby the assets of the scheme were used to acquire a bulk purchase annuity policy with Aviva under which the benefits payable to the members of the scheme are now fully insured.
The insurance policy was purchased using the existing assets of the scheme with no additional funding required from the Group.
The insurance policy has been structured to enable the scheme, in time, to move to full buy-out, following which Aviva will become directly responsible for the pension payments under the scheme.
As at 31 December 2017, approximately 20% of the individual member policies had been issued by Aviva.
The remainder of the bulk purchase annuity policy has been accounted for as an asset of the scheme and valued on the same basis as the liabilities that it matches.
Overseas schemes There are a number of smaller defined benefit schemes overseas, the most significant being the Inchcape Motors Limited Retirement Scheme in Hong Kong.
In general these schemes offer a lump sum on retirement with no further obligation to the employee and assets are held in trust in separately administered funds.
These schemes are typically subject to triennial valuations.
The overseas defined contribution schemes are principally linked to local statutory arrangements.
c. Defined contribution plans The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement is 6.2m 2016 5.4m.
There are outstanding contributions of 0.2m at the year end 2016 0.1m.
d. Defined benefit plans As the Groups principal defined benefit schemes are in the UK, these have been reported separately from the overseas schemes.
For the purposes of reporting, actuarial updates have been obtained for the Groups material schemes and these updates are reflected in the amounts reported in the following tables.
com 121 Notes to the financial statements continued 5 PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED The principal weighted average assumptions used by the actuaries were: United Kingdom Overseas 2017 2016 2017 2016 % % % % Rate of increase in salaries 3.1 3.8 3.8 3.8 Rate of increase in pensions 3.0 3.2 2.3 1.8 Discount rate 2.5 2.6 1.9 2.0 Rate of inflation: Retail price index 3.2 3.3 2.1 2.4 Consumer price index 2.1 2.3 n a n a The rate of increase in healthcare costs is 5.4% 2016 5.4% per annum.
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on published statistics and experience.
For the UK schemes, the average life expectancy of a pensioner retiring at age 65 is 23.9 years 2016 23.8 years for current pensioners and 25.8 years 2016 25.6 years for current non pensioners.
Most of the overseas schemes only offer a lump sum on retirement and therefore mortality assumptions are not applicable.

124 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 124 Inchcape Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5 PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED The following disclosures relate to the Groups defined benefit plans only.
e. Risk management Asset volatility Scheme liabilities are calculated on a discounted basis using a discount rate which is set with reference to corporate bond yields.
If scheme assets underperform this yield, then this will create a deficit.
The combined schemes hold approximately 75% of assets as defensive assets liability driven investment solutions, absolute return bonds and annuity policies which mitigate significant changes in yields, and active monitoring plans are in place to identify opportunities to increase the proportion of such assets further when economically possible.
As the schemes mature, the Trustees reduce investment risk by increasing the allocation to defensive assets, which are designed to better match scheme liabilities.
However, the Trustees believe that due to the long-term nature of the scheme liabilities, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the long-term investment strategy.
Inflation risk The majority of the Groups defined benefit obligations are linked to inflation.
Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities, although in the majority of cases there are caps on the level of inflationary increases to be applied to pension obligations.
The Groups investment strategy across the schemes is to mitigate inflation risk through holding inflation-linked assets.
Life expectancy The plans obligations are to provide a pension for the life of the member, so realised increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans benefit payments.
Future mortality rates cannot be predicted with certainty.
All of the schemes conduct scheme-specific mortality investigations annually, to ensure the Group has a clear understanding of any potential increase in liability due to pensioners living for longer than assumed.
The Trustees of the schemes hedge this risk by adopting a prudent approach in their assumption for future improvements.
f. Sensitivity analysis The disclosures above are dependent on the assumptions used.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the assumptions used for the UK schemes.
Changes in assumptions have an immaterial effect on the overseas schemes.
Impact on the defined benefit obligation United Kingdom 2017 2016 m m Discount rate -0.25% 44.8 43.5 Discount rate 0.25% -42.1 -49.7 Inflation -0.25% -28.8 -37.8 Inflation 0.25% 29.6 33.9 Life expectancy 1 year 39.3 37.4 The above analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
The above variances have been used as they are believed to be reasonably possible fluctuations.
g. Expected future cash flows The Group has agreed to pay approximately 2.7m to its defined benefit plans in 2018 on top of the ongoing employer contributions for the open Cash section.
The Group does not expect any material changes to the annual cash contributions over the next three years given the funding position of the largest schemes, which account for 90% of the Groups total pension liabilities.
The defined benefit obligations are based on the current value of expected benefit payment cash flows to members over the next several decades.
The average duration of the liabilities is approximately 18 years for the UK schemes.

Not all of the exceptional items will be allowable for tax purposes.
Therefore the tax credit on exceptional items represents the total of the current and deferred tax on only those elements that are assessed as allowable.
Factors affecting the tax expense for the year The effective tax rate for the year after exceptional items is 25.2% 2016 28.6%.
The underlying effective tax rate before the impact of exceptional items is 25.0% 2016 25.2%.
The weighted average tax rate is 24.0% 2016 24.1%.
The weighted average tax rate comprises the average statutory rates across the Group, weighted in proportion to accounting profits and losses.

com 127 Notes to the financial statements continued 8 TAX CONTINUED Factors affecting the tax expense of future years Factors that could affect the Groups future tax expense include the resolution of audits and disputes, changes in tax laws or tax rates, the ability to utilise brought forward losses and business acquisitions and disposals.
In addition, a change in profit mix between low and high taxed jurisdictions will impact the Groups future tax expense.
The utilisation of brought forward tax losses or the recognition of deferred tax assets associated with such losses may also give rise to tax charges or credits.
The recognition of deferred tax assets, particularly in respect of tax losses, is based upon an assessment of whether it is probable that there will be sufficient and suitable taxable profits in the relevant legal entity or tax group against which to utilise the assets in the future.
Judgement is required when determining probable future taxable profits.
More detail of the Groups tax losses and deferred tax assets can be found in note 16.
During the year governments in a number of markets in which the Group operates implemented tax reform programmes which included significant rule changes or reductions in corporate tax rates, or both.
As such the tax charge for the year includes the estimated cost of the transition tax resulting from US tax reforms in relation to the Groups operations in Guam and Saipan included in Taxes on undistributed earnings 1.8m.
This amount is partially offset by remeasurement of deferred tax balances at the new US corporate tax rate of 21% included in Other items including tax rate differentials and changes 0.4m.

During the year, the Group reviewed the useful life of ERP software assets in use in the business.
As a result of this review, the useful life was changed from five years to eight years.
This change has been applied prospectively and has resulted in a reduction in the amortisation charge for the year of c. 3m.
com 129 Notes to the financial statements continued 11 INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED Goodwill Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash generating units CGUs or group of CGUs hereafter collectively referred to as CGU groups that are expected to benefit from the synergies associated with that business combination.
These CGU groups represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to CGU groups within the following reporting segments: 2017 2016 Reporting segment CGU group m m UK and Europe Retail UK Retail 265.7 265.6 Emerging Markets Distribution South America 54.7 51.2 Asia Singapore 22.4 22.8 Australasia Retail Australia Retail 47.0 45.4 Australasia Distribution Peugeot Citron Australia 2.0 391.8 385.0 Goodwill is subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently where there are indications that the goodwill may be impaired.
Impairment tests were performed for all CGU groups during the year ended 31 December 2017.
The recoverable amounts of all CGU groups were determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on five year financial forecasts prepared by management.
The key assumptions for these forecasts are those relating to revenue growth, operating margins, the level of working capital required to support trading and capital expenditure, and have been based on past experience, recent trading and expectations of future changes in the relevant markets.
They also reflect expectations about continuing relationships with key brand partners.
Cash flows after the five year period are extrapolated for each market using declining growth rates of between 4.5% and 2.0% for a further five years.
A terminal value calculation is used to estimate the cash flows after year ten using a long-term growth rate of 2%.
Cash flows are discounted back to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate.
The discount rates used are calculated as the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for a risk premium attributable to the relevant country.
The pre-tax discount rates used vary between 10% and 13% and reflect long-term country risk.
Sensitivities A reasonably possible change in a key assumption will not cause a material impairment of goodwill in any of the CGU groups.
However, the Groups value in use calculations are sensitive to a change in the key assumptions used.
The base case value in use calculation for the UK Retail CGU resulted in headroom of approximately 24%.
Given the current trading conditions in the UK Retail market, sensitivities were applied to the base case calculation to model a 1% underperformance against forecast revenue, with no consequential changes to other assumptions, which reduced the headroom to approximately 10%.

Market risk and sensitivity analysis Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being primarily UK interest rates and the Japanese yen exchange rate with both the Australian dollar and Chilean peso.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges from movements in interest rates are assumed to be recorded fully in equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates have an immaterial effect on the consolidated income statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt: changes in the carrying value of financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the consolidated income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the consolidated income statement.
d. Interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis The Groups interest rate policy has the objective of minimising net interest expense, and protecting the Group from material adverse movements in interest rates.
Instruments approved for the purpose of hedging interest rate risk include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates arises primarily from the floating rate interest payable on the Groups loan notes that expire in 2019, bank borrowings, supplier related finance and the returns available on surplus cash.
In December 2016 the Group entered into agreements to issue new 3.0% fixed interest rate Private Placement loan notes to refinance the floating rate loan notes that matured in May 2017 see note 22.
Interest rate risk table The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Groups profit before tax to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on bank borrowings, supplier related finance and cash balances as at 31 December 2017 with all other variables held constant.

com 143 Notes to the financial statements continued 23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED e. Foreign currency risk The Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in Sterling and faces currency risk on the translation of its earnings and net assets, a significant proportion of which are in currencies other than Sterling.
Transaction exposure hedging The Group has transactional currency exposures, where sales or purchases by an operating unit are in currencies other than that units functional currency.
For a significant proportion of the Group, these exposures are removed as trading is denominated in the relevant local currency.
In particular, local billing arrangements are in place for many of our businesses with our brand partners.
The principal exceptions are our business in Australia, which purchases vehicles and parts in Japanese yen, and our business in South America, which purchases vehicles in Japanese yen and US dollars.
In this instance, the Group seeks to hedge forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk using forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income to the extent it is effective and recycled into the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
Under IAS 39, hedges are documented and tested for hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
Hedge of foreign currency debt The Group uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the forward foreign currency risk associated with the US$161m Private Placement.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
Foreign currency risk table The following table shows the Group sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates on its Japanese yen financial instruments.
In this table, financial instruments are only considered sensitive to foreign exchange rates when they are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.
Increase decrease in Effect on exchange equity rate m 2017 Yen 10% Yen -10% 0.1 2016 Yen 10% 0.1 Yen -10% 0.1 f. Credit risk The amount due from counterparties arising from cash deposits and the use of financial instruments creates credit risk.
The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings where applicable and through its policy of limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure that they are within Board approved limits and that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Group policy is to deposit cash and use financial instruments with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of A or better, where available.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in interest rate and foreign exchange management do not represent the credit risk arising through the use of these instruments.
The immediate credit risk of these instruments is generally estimated by the fair value of contracts with a positive value.

The maximum exposure to credit risk for cash at bank, cash equivalents, receivables and other financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.
Total cash at bank of 820.0m 2016 473.7m includes cash in the Groups regional pooling arrangements which are offset against borrowings for interest purposes.
Netting of cash and overdraft balances in the consolidated statement of financial position only occurs to the extent that there is the legal ability and intention to settle net.
As such, overdrafts are presented in current liabilities to the extent that there is no intention to offset with the cash balance.
Trade receivables include amounts due from a number of finance houses in respect of vehicles sold to customers on finance arranged through the Group.
An independent credit rating agency is used to assess the credit standing of each finance house.
Limits for the maximum outstanding with each finance house are set accordingly.
g. Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.

com 145 Notes to the financial statements continued 23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED h. Fair value measurement In accordance with IFRS 13, disclosure is required for financial instruments that are measured in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level for the following fair value measurement hierarchy: quoted prices in active markets level 1 : inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 : or inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data level 3.
The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value: 2017 2016 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m m m m m Assets Derivatives used for hedging 52.4 52.4 160.1 160.1 Available for sale financial assets 1.3 6.2 7.5 1.6 2.2 3.8 1.3 52.4 6.2 59.9 1.6 160.1 2.2 163.9 Liabilities Derivatives used for hedging 21.6 21.6 53.6 53.6 Level 1 represents the fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets and is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market level 2 is determined by using valuation techniques which include the present value of estimated future cash flows.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at their fair values.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps represents the difference between the value of the outstanding contracts at their contracted rates and a valuation calculated using the spot rates of exchange and prevailing forward interest rates at 31 December 2017.
The Groups derivative financial instruments comprise the following: Assets Liabilities 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m m m Cross currency interest rate swaps 49.7 155.0 Forward foreign exchange contracts 2.7 5.1 21.6 53.6 52.4 160.1 21.6 53.6 The ineffective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement that arises from fair value hedges amounted to a gain of 1.2m 2016 gain of 1.0m.
The ineffective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement that arises from cash flow hedges amounted to a gain of nil 2016 nil.
146 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 146 Inchcape Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Cash flow hedges The Group principally uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge purchases in a non-functional currency against movements in exchange rates.
The cash flows relating to these contracts are generally expected to occur within 12 months of the end of the reporting period 2016 12 months.
The nominal principal amount of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts relating to transactional exposures at 31 December 2017 was 910.4m 2016 1,078.7m.
Net fair value gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in shareholders equity see note 25 on forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2017 are expected to be released to the consolidated income statement within 12 months of the end of the reporting period 2016 12 months.
Fair value hedge At 31 December 2017, the Group had in place three cross currency interest rate swaps.
Two of these total US$200m, which hedge changes in the fair value of the Groups 12 year Private Placement loan notes.
Under these swaps, the Group receives fixed rate US dollar interest of 6.04% on US$200m and pays GBP LIBOR 90bps.
An additional US$39.2m cross currency interest rate swap was put in place after the debt reduction in 2009 to offset the nonrequired portion of the original US$200m swaps.
Under this swap, the Group pays US dollar interest of 6.04% on US$39.2m and receives GBP LIBOR 214bps.
The loan notes and cross currency interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
Capital management The Groups capital structure consists of equity and debt.
Equity represents funds raised from shareholders and debt represents funds raised from banks and other financial institutions.
The primary objective of the Groups management of debt and equity is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to finance the Groups activities, both now and in the future, and to maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Directors consider the Groups capital structure and dividend policy at least twice a year prior to the announcement of results, taking into account the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and the requirements of its business plan.
The Group uses return on capital employed ROCE as a measure of its ability to drive better returns on the capital invested in the Groups operations.
2017 2016 Return on capital employed 30.1% 29.8% The committed bank facilities and Private Placement borrowings are subject to the same interest cover covenant based on an adjusted EBITA measure to interest on consolidated borrowings.
The Group is required to maintain a ratio of not less than three to one and was compliant with this covenant throughout the year.
The Group monitors Group leverage by reference to three tests: Adjusted EBITA interest cover, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and the ratio of net debt to market capitalisation.
2017 2016 Adjusted EBITA interest cover times 60.0 300.9 Net debt to EBITDA times n a n a Net debt market capitalisation percentage n a n a Calculated as Adjusted EBITA interest on consolidated borrowings.
Calculated as net debt earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
Calculated as net debt market capitalisation as at 31 December.

Acquisitions On 22 December 2016, the Group acquired a multi-country scale Distribution business in South America, focused on Subaru and Hino and operating in the growth markets of Chile, Colombia, Peru and Argentina.
Given the proximity of the acquisition prior to the 2016 year end, the assets and liabilities acquired were presented at provisional fair values largely based on book values at the acquisition date.
During the year, adjustments have been made to the assets and liabilities acquired as permitted by IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
These fair value adjustments, presented below, were not material and therefore prior periods have not been restated.
These changes, together with the finalisation of the purchase consideration, have resulted in an increase in the amount of goodwill recognised on acquisition of 3.8m.

The total cost of these acquisitions was 19.3m with total goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets arising on the transactions of 13.4m.
b. Proforma full year information The businesses acquired in the year contributed 64.0m revenue and 1.1m operating profit before exceptional items to the Groups reported figures between the dates of acquisition and 31 December 2017.
If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2017, the approximate revenue and operating profit before exceptional items for the year ended 31 December 2017 of the Group would have been 9,022.7m and 408.3m respectively.

Franked Investment Income Group Litigation Order Inchcape is a participant in an action in the United Kingdom against HM Revenue and Customs HMRC in the Franked Investment Income Group Litigation Order FII GLO.
There are 25 corporate groups in the FII GLO.
The action concerns the treatment for UK corporate tax purposes of profits earned overseas and distributed to the UK.
As reported previously, HMRC has applied to the Supreme Court for permission to appeal the Court of Appeals judgment of November 2016.
However, the Supreme Court had deferred making a decision on HMRCs permission appeal pending the judgment in Littlewoods Retail versus HMRC.
Although the Supreme Court handed down its judgment in Littlewoods on 1 November 2017, the Court has not yet considered HMRCs permission appeal any further.
Therefore, resolution of the test case in the FII GLO remains incomplete.
As a consequence, no further receipts have been recognised in the year to 31 December 2017 in relation to the balance of Inchcapes claim in the FII GLO due to the uncertainty of the amounts and eventual outcome given the test case has not yet completed nor has Inchcapes specific claim been heard by the Courts.
