PZ Cussons Plc Governance and Financial Statements 2017 93 Current tax The current tax liability asset directly relates to the actual tax payable receivable on the Companys profits and is determined based on tax laws and regulations in effect at the year end date.
Assumptions and judgements are made in applying these laws to the taxable profits in any given period in order to calculate the tax charge for that period.
Where the eventual tax paid orreclaimed is different to the amounts originally estimated, the difference will be charged or credited to the Income Statement in the period in which it is determined.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the Balance Sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity or other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax liabilities on a net basis.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company Balance Sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Derivative financial instruments The Companys activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a proportion of the exposure to floating interest rate fluctuations.
The Company documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions.
The Company also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Companys policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles in the use of financial derivatives consistent with the Companys risk management strategy.
The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value at the contract date, and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.

Accounting policies continued Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of direct issue costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis through the Income Statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent they are not settled in the year in which they arise.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all ofits liabilities.
Share capital Ordinary Shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new Ordinary Shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, netoftax, from the proceeds.
Where the Company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Where such Ordinary Shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to theCompanys equity holders.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost, less any provision for impairment.
Where equity settled share based payments are granted to the employees of subsidiary companies, the fair value of the award is treated as a capital contribution by the Company and the investment in subsidiaries are adjusted to reflect this capital contribution.
The carrying amounts of the Companys investments are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indicator of impairment.
If any such indicator exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs-to-sell or its value-in-use.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of the investment, or its cash-generating unit, exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Income Statement.
An impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment may no longer exist and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are not capitalised: they are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Own shares held by ESOT Transactions of the Company-sponsored Employee Share Option Trust ESOT are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore reflected in the Companys Financial Statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases and sales of shares in the Company are debited and credited directly to equity.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys Shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Companys Financial Statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys Shareholders.
In respect of interim dividends these are recognised once paid.
