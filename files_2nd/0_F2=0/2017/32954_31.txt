FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 CHANGES IN KEY AUDIT MATTERS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR AUDIT Related Parties Transactions was previously considered a key audit matter.
Following the reduction of the shareholding of the then significant shareholder during the course of 2017 this was not considered a key audit matter for the 2017 year end audit.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements.
For planning, we consider materiality to be the magnitude by which misstatements, including omissions, could influence the economic decisions of reasonable users that are taken on the basis of the financial statements.
In order to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that any misstatements exceed materiality, we use a lower materiality level, performance materiality, to determine the extent of testing needed.
Importantly, misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identified misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole.
Level of materiality applied and rationale We consider Adjusted Profit Before Tax to be the most appropriate performance measure for the basis of materiality in respect of the audit of the Group as this measure reflects the Groups profitability excluding the impact of certain non-recurring items.
Adjusted Profit Before Tax is calculated for this purpose as Profit Before Tax adjusted for certain non-recurring items totalling to a net 96.6m reduction in profit which principally related to the release of contingent consideration in respect of the Markets acquisition and impairments of goodwill and investments recorded in the year.
Using this benchmark, we set materiality at 8.5m 2016: 13.0m being 5% 2016: 4.4% of Adjusted EBITDA of Adjusted Profit Before Tax.
Our materiality level is reduced from the previous years as a result of the change of the basis of materiality from adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Profit Before Tax.
Materiality in respect of the audit of the Parent Company has been set at 4.3m 2016: 6.5m using a benchmark of 2% of total assets, limited to 50% of Group materiality 2016: 2% of total assets, limited to 50% of Group materiality.
We consider total assets to be the most appropriate measure for the basis of materiality as the Parent Company is primarily an investment holding company.
Performance materiality was set at 70% of materiality for both the Group and Parent Company audits.
In setting the level of performance materiality we considered a number of factors including the expected total value of known and likely misstatements based on past experience and other factors and managements attitude towards proposed adjustments.
Component materiality We set materiality for each component of the Group based on a percentage of materiality dependent on the size and our assessment of the risk of material misstatement of that component.
Component materiality ranged from 2.1m to 4.3m.
Agreement with the Audit Committee We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences individually in excess of 340k 2016: 500k.
We also agreed to report differences below this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
107 PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including the Groups system of internal control, and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements at the Group level.
In determining the scope of our audit we considered the level of work to be performed at each component in order to ensure sufficient assurance was gained to allow us to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group as a whole.
We tailored the extent of the work to be performed at each component, either by us, as the Group audit team, component auditors within the BDO network or non-BDO member firms based on our assessment of the risk of material misstatement at each component.
We obtained an understanding of the entity-level controls of the Group as a whole which assisted us in identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement due to fraud or error, as well as assisting us in determining the most appropriate audit strategy.
We consider that the audit procedures we planned and performed in accordance with ISAs UK have provided us with reasonable assurance that irregularities, including fraud, would have been detected to the extent that they could have resulted in material misstatements in the financial statements.
Our audit was not designed to identify misstatements or other irregularities that would not be considered to be material to the financial statements.
Classification of components The 3 components that are considered significant defined as those that were greater than 15% of Adjusted Profit Before Tax, or where the risks of the component were significantly different to the Group risks were audited by the Group audit team.
The Group audit team centrally performed the audit of 97% of Group revenue and the audit of 100% of intangible assets including development costs using the materiality levels set out above.
For the 22 components not considered significant, the component auditors were asked to perform review procedures or specific scope procedures on certain balances based on their relative size, risks in the business and our knowledge of those entities appropriate to respond to the risk of material misstatement.
Review and specific scope procedures were performed by the Group audit team or BDO network firms on 20 reporting components and by 2 non-BDO member firms on a further 2 reporting components.
SUMMARY AUDIT SCOPE Revenue PBT Total Assets Full audit: 97.2% Full audit: 93.1% Full audit: 96.0% Specific procedures: 0.0% Specific procedures: 4.3% Specific procedures: 2.7% Group level procedures: 2.8% Group level procedures: 2.6% Group level procedures: 1.3% Based on the above scope we were able to conclude that sufficient and appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis to form our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 OTHER INFORMATION The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, other than the financial statements and our auditors report thereon.
The directors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items meet the following conditions: Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 96 the statement given by the directors that they consider the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Groups performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit: or Audit committee reporting set out on page 77 the section describing the work of the audit committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee: or Directors statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code set out on page 96 the parts of the directors statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the Companys compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS As explained more fully in the directors responsibilities statement set out on page 96, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Groups and the Parent Companys ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
AUDITORS RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our report is made solely to the Companys members, as a body, in accordance with section 80C of the Isle of Man Companies Act 2006.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Companys members those matters that we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Companys members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Councils website at: www.
This description forms part of our auditors report.

For leases currently classified as operating leases, under current accounting requirements the Group does not recognise related assets or liabilities, and instead spreads the lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term, disclosing in its annual financial statements the total commitment.
At 31 December 2017 operating lease commitments amounted to 63.4 million.
The effect of discounting those commitments is anticipated to result in right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of 50.0- 60.0 million being recognised on 1 January 2018.
However, further work still needs to be carried out to determine whether and when extension and termination options are likely to be exercised, which will result in the actual liability recognised being higher than this.
The Board still considering if it will apply the modified retrospective or the restatement approach in IFRS 16.
Instead of recognising an operating expense for its operating lease payments, the Group will instead recognise interest on its lease liabilities and amortisation on its right-of-use assets.
This will increase reported EBITDA which will approximate to its current operating lease cost, which for the year ended 31 December 2017 was approximately 13.5 million.
Other than as noted, the Directors do not expect that any other new standards, interpretations and amendments which are effective for periods beginning after 1 January 2018 to have a material effect on the Groups future financial information.

NOTE 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION Where the Company has control over an investee it is classified as a subsidiary.
The Company controls an investee if all three of the following elements are present: power over the investee: exposure to variable returns from the investee: and the ability of the investor to use its power to affect those variable returns.
Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.
The consolidated financial information presents the results of the Group as if they formed a single entity.
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial information incorporates the results of business combinations using the acquisition method.
In the statement of financial position, the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained.
They are deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases.
FOREIGN CURRENCY The financial information of the gaming division, which includes the Company and some of its subsidiaries is prepared in Euros the functional currency, which is the currency that best reflects the economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances relevant to the gaming division.
Transactions and balances in foreign currencies are converted into Euros in accordance with the principles set forth by IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
Accordingly, transactions and balances have been converted into the presentation currency of Euros as follows: Monetary assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange applicable at the balance sheet date: Income and expense items at exchange rates applicable as of the date of recognition of those items.
Non-monetary items are converted at the rate of exchange used to convert the related balance sheet items i. e. at the time of the transaction.
Exchange gains and losses from the aforementioned conversion are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The financial information of the financial division is prepared in US Dollars the functional currency, which is the currency that best reflects the economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances relevant to the financial division.
The transactions and balances are converted into the presentation currency of Euros as follows: Assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange applicable at the balance sheet date: Income and expense items at average exchange rates applicable at the period of recognition of those items: Equity at historic rate.
Exchange gains and losses from the aforementioned conversion are recognised in the foreign exchange reserve.
REVENUE RECOGNITION The Groups principal revenue streams and their respective accounting treatments are discussed below: Royalty income Royalty income relating to licensed technology and the provision of certain services provided via various distribution channels online, mobile or land-based interfaces.
Royalty income is based on the underlying gaming revenue earned by our licensees and is recognised in the accounting periods in which the gaming transactions occur.
Trading income Trading income represents gains including commission and losses arising on client trading activity, primarily in contracts for difference on shares, indexes, commodities and foreign exchange.
Open client positions are carried at fair market value and gains and losses arising on this valuation are recognised in revenue as well as gains and losses realised on positions that have closed.
Fixed-fee income Other revenue includes revenue derived from the provision of certain services and licensed technology for which charges are based on a fixed-fee and stepped according to the usage of the service technology in each accounting period.
Income is recognised over the period of service once the obligations under the contracts have passed.
Where amounts are billed and obligations not met, revenue is deferred.
Fixed-term arrangements Other income receivable under fixed-term arrangements is recognised as revenue over the term of the agreement on a straight line basis.
DISTRIBUTION COSTS Distribution costs represent the direct costs of the function of providing services to customers, costs of the development function and advertising costs.
117 PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS Certain employees participate in the Groups share option plans which commenced with effect from 1 December 2005.
The fair value of the equity settled options granted is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the vesting period and the credit is taken to equity, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is determined by the Black-Scholes and Binomial valuation model.
The share options plan does not have any performance conditions other than continued service.
Where equity settled share options are settled in cash at the Groups discretion the debit is taken to equity.
The Group has also granted awards to be distributed from the Groups Employee Benefit Trust.
The fair value of these awards is based on the market price at the date of the grant, some of the grants have performance conditions.
INCOME TAXES AND DEFERRED TAXATION Provision for income taxes is calculated in accordance with the tax legislations and applicable tax rates in force at the balance sheet date in the countries in which the Group companies are tax registered and for Group branches based on place where the branch is established.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheet differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit: and investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities assets are settled recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either: the same taxable Group company: or different Group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or recovered.
DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION Final dividends are recorded in the Groups financial information in the period in which they are approved by the Groups shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment comprise computers and gaming machines, buildings and leasehold and buildings improvements, office furniture and equipment, and motor vehicles and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Carrying amounts are reviewed on each balance sheet date for impairment.
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of fixed assets on a straight line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
The principal annual rates used for this purpose, which are consistent with those of the previous years, are: % Computers and gaming machines 20-33 Office furniture and equipment 7-33 Freehold and leasehold buildings and improvements 10-20, or over the length of the lease Motor vehicles 15 Subsequent expenditures are included in the asset carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount and are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

NOTE 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED BUSINESS COMBINATIONS The consolidated financial information incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method.
In the consolidated balance sheet, the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
PUT CALL OPTIONS Where a put call option is entered into over the non-controlling interest the ownership risks and rewards of the shares relating to the option are analysed to determine whether the equity is attributable to the non-controlling interest or the parent.
The non-controlling interest is recognised if the risks and rewards of ownership of those shares remain with them.
A financial liability is recorded to reflect the option.
All subsequent changes to the liability other than the cash settlement are recognised in profit or loss.
Where the significant risks and rewards of ownership remain with the non-controlling interest the non-controlling interest continues to be recognised and is allocated its share of profits and losses.
Where the significant risks and rewards of ownership reside with the controlling interest, the financial liability recognised offsets the non-controlling interest.
INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS Investments in subsidiary undertakings are recognised at cost less, if any, provision for impairment.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets comprise externally acquired patents, domains and customer lists.
Intangible assets also include internally generated capitalised software development costs.
All such intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Where intangible assets are acquired as part of a business combination they are recorded initially at their fair value.
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down to its recoverable amount.
Amortisation is calculated at annual rates estimated to write off the costs of the assets over their expected useful lives and is charged to operating expenses from the point the asset is brought into use.
The principal annual rates used for this purpose, which are consistent with those of the previous years, are: % Domain names Nil Internally generated capitalised development costs 20-33 Technology IP 13-33 Customer lists In line with projected cash flows or 7-20 Affiliate contracts 5-12.5 Patents and license 10-33 Management believes that the useful life of the domain names is indefinite.
Domain names are reviewed for impairment annually.
Expenditure incurred on development activities including the Groups software development is capitalised only where the expenditure will lead to new or substantially improved products, the products are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure, including that incurred in order to maintain an intangible assets current level of performance, is expensed as incurred.
119 PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED GOODWILL Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over, in the case of business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010, the Groups interest in the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and, in the case of business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
For business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010, cost comprised the fair value of assets given, and liabilities assumed, plus any direct costs of acquisition.
Changes in the estimated value of contingent consideration arising on business combinations completed by this date were treated as an adjustment to cost and, in consequence, resulted in a change in the carrying value of goodwill.
For business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, cost comprises the fair value of assets given and liabilities assumed, plus the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquired business.
Contingent consideration is included in cost at its acquisition date fair value and, in the case of contingent consideration classified as a financial liability, remeasured subsequently through profit or loss.
For combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, direct costs of acquisition are recognised immediately as an expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, within administrative costs.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated income statement.
Goodwill is not amortised and is reviewed for impairment, annually or more specifically if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually at the financial year end.
Other non-financial assets are subject to annual impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount i. e. the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to establish the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the assets cash generating unit i. e. the lowest group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the Groups cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination giving rise to the goodwill.
Impairment charges are included in the administrative expenses line item in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except to the extent they reverse gains previously recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed.
ASSOCIATES AND STRUCTURED AGREEMENTS Where the Group has the power to participate in but not control the financial and operating policy decisions of another entity, it is classified as an associate or structured agreements, as appropriate.
Associates are initially recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost.
Subsequently associates are accounted for using the equity method, where the Groups share of post-acquisition profits and losses and other comprehensive income is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income except for losses in excess of the Groups investment in the associate unless there is an obligation to make good those losses.
Profits and losses arising on transactions between the Group and its associates are recognised only to the extent of unrelated investors interests in the associate.
The investors share in the associates profits and losses resulting from these transactions is eliminated against the carrying value of the associate.
Any premium paid for an associate above the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is capitalised and included in the carrying amount of the associate.
Where there is objective evidence that the investment in an associate has been impaired the carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment in the same way as other non-financial assets.
120 PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONT.
NOTE 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED JOINT VENTURES The Group is a party to a joint arrangement when there is a contractual arrangement that confers joint control over the relevant activities of the arrangement to the Group and at least one other party.
Joint control is assessed under the same principles as control over subsidiaries.
The Group classifies its interests in joint arrangements as either: Joint ventures where the Group has rights to only the net assets of the joint arrangement: or Joint operations where the Group has rights to both the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the joint arrangement.
In assessing the classification of interests in joint arrangements, the Group considers: The structure of the joint arrangement: The legal form of joint arrangements structured through a separate vehicle: The contractual terms of the joint arrangement agreement: and Any other facts and circumstances including any other contractual arrangements.
The Group accounts for its interests in joint ventures in the same manner as investments in Associates i. e. using the equity method refer above.
Any premium paid for an investment in a joint venture above the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is capitalised and included in the carrying amount of the investment in joint venture.
Where there is objective evidence that the investment in a joint venture has been impaired the carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment in the same way as other non-financial assets.
The Group accounts for its interests in joint operations by recognising its share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in accordance with its contractually conferred rights and obligations.
FINANCIAL ASSETS The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired.
The Group has not classified any of its financial assets as held to maturity.
The Group does not hold any financial assets at fair value through profit and loss.
Loans and receivables These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise principally through the provision of services to customers e. g. trade receivables, but also incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset.
They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
The Groups receivables comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and loans to customers in the balance sheet.
Trade receivables which principally represent amounts due from licensees are carried at original invoice value less an estimate made for bad and doubtful debts based on a review of all outstanding amounts at the year-end.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Where cash is on deposit with maturity dates greater than three months, it is disclosed within other receivables.
Loans to customers are in respect of formal loan agreements entered into between the Group and its customers, which are carried at original advanced value less provision for impairment or fair value on inception, if different.
They are classified between current and non-current assets in accordance with the contractual repayment terms of each loan agreement.
Available-for-sale financial assets Non-derivative financial assets classified as available-for-sale comprise the Groups strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities.
They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value generally recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the available for sale reserve.
In accordance with IAS 39, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Purchases and sales of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised on settlement date with any change in fair value between trade date and settlement date being recognised in the available-for-sale reserve.
On sale, the amount held in the available-for-sale reserve associated with that asset is removed from equity and recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
121 PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Several of the Groups licensees participate in progressive jackpot games.
Each time a progressive jackpot game is played, a preset amount is added to a cumulative jackpot for that specific game.
The accrual for the jackpot at the consolidated balance sheet date is included in progressive jackpot and other operators jackpot liabilities.
The Groups liability in connection with client funds includes customer deposits offset by the fair value of open positions, the movement on which is recognised through profit or loss.
Such open positions are classified as short term financial derivatives in the balance sheet.
Where customers trading positions are hedged, or partly hedged, for risk management purposes, the fair value of those open hedge positions are carried at fair market value in trade receivables or trade payables depending on whether the positions are in or out of the money and classified as short term financial derivatives in the balance sheet.
Liability components of convertible loan notes are measured as described further below.
Loans and bank borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument.
Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the consolidated balance sheet.
Interest expense in this context includes initial transaction costs and premia payable on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT HIERARCHY IFRS 7 and IFRS 13 requires certain disclosure which require the classification of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the fair value measurement see Note 30.
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: a Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 : b Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 2 : and c Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs Level 3.
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the financial asset or financial liability is categorised is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety into only one of the three levels.
The Group measures its available-for-sale investments at fair value refer to Note 14 for more detailed information in respect of the fair value measurement.
SHARE CAPITAL Ordinary shares are classified as equity and are stated at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUST Consideration paid received for the purchase sale of shares subsequently put in the Employee Benefit Trust is recognised directly in equity.
The cost of treasury shares held is presented as a separate reserve the Employee Benefit Trust reserve.
Any excess of the consideration received on the sale of treasury shares over the weighted average cost of the shares sold is credited to retained earnings.
SHARE BUY BACK The Group cannot hold treasury shares under the Groups memorandum and article of association and therefore the shares are cancelled after the buy back.
CONVERTIBLE BOND The proceeds received on issue of the Groups convertible bond are allocated into their liability and equity components.
The amount initially attributed to the debt component equals the discounted cash flows using a market rate of interest that would be payable on a similar debt instrument that does not include an option to convert.
Subsequently, the debt component is accounted for as a financial liability measured at amortised cost until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bond, where the option meets the definition of an equity instrument.
The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option and is recognised in the Convertible bond option reserve within shareholders equity.

NOTE 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED LONG TERM LIABILITIES Long term liabilities are those liabilities that are due for repayment or settlement in more than twelve months from balance sheet date.
PROVISIONS Provisions, which are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount, are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, if it is probable that an outflow of funds will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
LEASES Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are not transferred to the Group an operating lease, the total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised as a reduction of the rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS Non-controlling interest is recognised at the present ownership instruments proportionate share in the recognised amounts of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
The total comprehensive income of non-wholly owned subsidiaries is attributed to owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests in proportion to their relative ownership interests.
ADJUSTED RESULTS The Directors believe that in order to best represent the trading performance and results of the Group, the reported numbers should exclude certain non-cash and one-off items including the below.
Management regularly uses the adjusted financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate the business and make operating decisions.
These adjusted measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods.
Furthermore, compensation of the executives is based in part on the performance of the business based on these adjusted measures.
Accordingly, these are the key performance metrics used by the Board when assessing the Groups financial performance.
Such exclusions include: Material non-cash items, e. g. amortisation of intangibles on acquisition, change in fair value of available-for-sale investments in the income statement and Employee Share Option Plan expenses.
Management regularly monitors the operating cash conversion to adjusted EBITDA.
These items are excluded to better analyse the underlying cash transactions of the business.
Material one-off items, e. g. gain on sale of investment in associates, professional services cost related to acquisitions and other exceptional projects.
In the last few years the Group has acquired new businesses on a regular basis, however, the costs incurred due to these acquisitions are not considered to be an ongoing trading cost and usually cannot be changed or influenced by management.
Underlying adjusted results excludes the following items in order to present a more accurate like for like comparison over the comparable period: The impact of acquisitions made in the period or in the comparable period: and Specific material agreements, adjustments to previous years or currency fluctuations affecting the results in the period and the comparable period.
As these are non-GAAP measures, they should not be considered as replacements for IFRS measures.
The Groups definition of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
A full reconciliation of adjustments is included in Note 5.
123 PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS The preparation of financial information in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial information and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The areas requiring the use of estimates and critical judgments that may potentially have a significant impact on the Groups earnings and financial position are detailed below.
ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill, intangible assets not yet in use and indefinite life assets have suffered any impairment.
The Group is required to test other intangibles if events of changes in circumstances indicated that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows.
Such estimates are based on managements experience of the business, but actual outcomes may vary.
More details including carrying values are included in Note 12.
Amortisation of development costs and other intangible assets and the useful life of property, plant and equipment Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are amortised or depreciated over their useful lives.
Useful lives are based on managements estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness.
Changes to estimates can result in significant variations in the amounts charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in specific periods.
More details including carrying values are included in Notes 11 and 12.
Compliance risk Legal, regulatory and taxation Legal proceedings and contingent liabilities Legal proceedings and contingent liabilities Management regularly monitors the key risks affecting the Group, including the regulatory environment in which the Group operates.
A provision will be made where there is a present obligation from a past event, a transfer of economic benefits is probable and the amount of costs of the transfer can be estimated reliably.
In instances where the criteria are not met, a contingent liability may be disclosed in the notes to the financial information.
More details are included in Note 32.
Income taxes The Group is subject to income tax in jurisdictions in which its companies are incorporated and registered and judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes.
The Group is basing its tax provisions on current and enacted but not yet implemented tax rules and practices, together with advice received from professional advisers, and believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open enquiry years based on its assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law.
The Group constantly monitors changes in legislation and update its accruals accordingly.
The principal risks relating to the Groups tax liabilities, and the sustainability of the underlying effective tax rate, arise from domestic and international tax laws and practices in the e-commerce environment continuing to evolve, including the corporate tax rates in jurisdictions where the Group has a significant asset or people presence.
More details are included in Note 8.
Regulatory The Groups subsidiaries, Safecap investments Limited, Magansale Trading Limited, CFH Clearing Limited and TradeTech Alpha Limited, are regulated by either the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission or the Financial Conduct Authority.
The regulatory environment is regularly changing and imposes significant demands of the resources of the subsidiaries.
As the subsidiaries activities expand, offering new products and penetrating new markets, these regulatory demands will inevitably increase.
The increasing complexity of the Groups operations require training and recruitment be tailored to meet these regulatory demands and the costs of compliance are expected to increase.
In addition to the above, the regulated subsidiaries manage their capital resources on the basis of capital adequacy requirements as prescribed by each of the regulators, together with their own assessments of other business risks and sensitivities which may impact the business.
Capital adequacy requirements are monitored on a real-time basis, including a buffer which is deemed sufficient by management to ensure that capital requirements are not breached at any time.
124 PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONT.
NOTE 3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS CONTINUED Structured agreements For all arrangements structured in separate vehicles the Group must assess the substance of the arrangement in determining whether it meets the definition to be classified as an associate or joint venture.
Factors the Group must consider include: Structure Legal form Contractual agreement Other facts and circumstances.
Upon consideration of these factors, the Group has determined that all of its arrangements structured through separate vehicles give it significant influence but not joint control rights to the net assets and are therefore classified as associates.
Share-based payments The Group has a share-based remuneration scheme for employees.
The fair value of share options is estimated by using the Black-Scholes and Binomial models, on the date of grant based on certain assumptions.
Those assumptions are described in Note 10 and include, among others, the dividend growth rate, expected share price volatility, expected life of the options and number of options expected to vest.
Determination of fair value of intangible assets acquired on business combinations The fair value of the intangible assets acquired is based on the discounted cash flows expected to be derived from the use of the asset.
Further information in relation to the determination of fair value of intangible assets acquired is given in Notes 26 and 27.
Determination of the fair value of contingent consideration and redemption liability The fair value of contingent consideration and redemption liability is based on the probability of expected cash flow outcomes and the assessment of present values using appropriate discount rates.
Recognition of put call options over non-controlling interest is based on consideration of the ownership risks and rewards of the shares relating to the option to determine whether the equity is attributable to the non-controlling interest or the parent.
Further information in relation to the determination of the fair value of contingent consideration is given in Notes 26 and 27.
Provision for loss from onerous contracts Management considers the requirement for a creation of a provision from a loss-making contract by forecasting the cash flow outcomes in the remain period of the contract.
The assessment of the cash flow outcomes includes the probability of future changes in commercial terms and the steps taking to mitigate the issues encountered with the contract.
NOTE 4 SEGMENT INFORMATION The Groups reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services.
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the management team including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer.
The operating segments identified are: Gaming B2B: including Casino, Services, Sport, Bingo, Poker and Other Gaming B2C Financial: including B2C and B2B CFD The Group-wide profit measures are adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net profit see Note 5.
Management believes the adjusted profit measures represent more closely the underlying trading performance of the business.
No other differences exist between the basis of preparation of the performance measures used by management and the figures in the Group financial information.
In 2017 following the growth in the business to customer B2C segment and due to the fundamental difference in its margin profiles, the Group has changed the internal and external reporting and split out from the gaming segment the B2C element.
There is no allocation of operating expenses, profit measures, assets and liabilities to individual products within the gaming segment, as allocation would be arbitrary.
In 2017, there were two licensees 2016: Two licensees who individually accounted for more than 10% of the total gaming revenue and the total revenue of the Group.
Aggregate revenue from these licensees totalled 280.6 million 2016: 255.4 million.

NOTE 12 INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED In accordance with IAS 36, the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its intangible assets, including goodwill.
Goodwill is allocated to thirteen 2016: eleven cash generating units CGU.
Following the restructure of the Sports division, the previous CGUs of Mobenga, Geneity, BGT and other acquisitions were combined to form the Sports CGU.
Also, Quickspin and other gaming studios were combined with the Casino product in accordance with IAS 36.
Management determines which of those CGUs are significant in relation to the total carrying value of goodwill as follows: Carrying value exceeds 10% of total goodwill: or Acquisition during the year: or Contingent consideration exists at the balance sheet date.
Based on the above criteria in respect of the goodwill, management has concluded that the following are significant: Markets, with a carrying value of $265.3 million, 221.5 million 2016: $265.3 million, 252.3 million : Services, with a carrying value of 95.2 million 2016: 100.0 million : Sport, with a carrying value of 132.5 million 2016: 126.1 million, BGT 88.3 million : Casino product, with a carrying value of 81.8 million 2016: current presentation 67.1 million, previous presentation 34.0 million, Quickspin 26.8 million, Other acquisitions 6.3 million : and Tradetech Alpha, with a carrying value of 63.5 million 2016: 0.9 million.
The recoverable amounts of all the CGUs have been determined from value in use calculations based on cash flow projections from formally approved budgets covering one year period to 31 December 2018 in addition to 2-3 years forecasts.
Beyond this period, management has applied an annual growth rate of between 2% and 5% based on the underlying economic environment in which the CGU operates.
Management has applied discount rates to the cash flow projections between 10.53% and 24.53% 2016: between 11.9% and 13.9%.
In 2017 the results of the review indicated that there was an impairment of goodwill of the 1 CGU in a total amount of 7.8 million 2016: 12.3 million which has been charged to the income statement.
The Directors sensitivity analysis does not result in an impairment charge of any other CGU and, given the level of headroom in value in use they show, the Directors do not envisage reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions would be sufficient to cause an impairment at this time.
Management has also reviewed the key assumptions and forecasts for the customer lists, brands and affiliates, applying the above same key assumptions.
The results of the reviews indicated there was no impairment of the intangible assets at 31 December 2017.
