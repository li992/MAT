Goodwill and intangible assets Accounting policy Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identi able net assets and contingent liabilities of the acquired subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisitions of associates is included in investments in associates.
Goodwill included in intangible assets is assessed at each balance sheet date for impairment and carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Detailed calculations are performed based on discounting expected pre-tax cash ows of the relevant cash generating units CGUs and discounting these at an appropriate discount rate, the determination of which requires the exercise of judgement.
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
CGUs represent the lowest level within the Group which generate separate cash in ows and at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
These are equal to or smaller than the Groups reportable segments as set out in note 2 as the Group views its reportable segments on a global basis.
The major CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are set out in the CGU table page 253.
Signifi cant accounting estimates and judgements The carrying amount of goodwill is based on the extent of judgements including the basis of assumptions and forecasts used for determining cash ows for CGUs, headroom availability, and sensitivities of the forecasts to reasonably possible changes in assumptions.
The Group undertakes an annual assessment to evaluate whether the carrying value of goodwill on balance sheet is impaired.
The estimation of future cash ows and the level to which they are discounted is inherently uncertain and requires signi cant judgement and subject to potential change over time.
Acquired intangibles At the date of acquisition of a subsidiary or associate, intangible assets which are deemed separable and which arise from contractual or other legal rights are capitalised and included within the net identi able assets acquired.
These intangible assets are initially measured at fair value, which re ects market expectations of the probability that the future economic bene ts embodied in the asset will ow to the entity, and are amortised on the basis of their expected useful lives 4 to 16 years.
At each balance sheet date, these assets are assessed for indicators of impairment.
In the event that an assets carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount, the asset is written down immediately.
Computer software Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the speci c software.
Direct costs of the development of separately identi able internally generated software are capitalised where it is probable that future economic bene ts attributable to the asset will ow from its use internally generated software.
These costs include salaries and wages, materials, service providers and contractors, and directly attributable overheads.
Costs incurred in the ongoing maintenance of software are expensed immediately when incurred.
Internally generated software is amortised over a three-year time period.

Goodwill CGU structure In 2017, the Group realigned its CGUs in line with its management structure and goodwill has been reallocated accordingly.
When considering the generation of independent cash in ows and appropriate level of management, Corporate Finance, Private Banking and Transaction Banking are managed on a global basis, while Retail Banking and Commercial Banking activities are managed on a country basis.
Comparatives have been amended to re ect the new structure of the CGUs.
Testing of goodwill for impairment An annual assessment is made as to whether the current carrying value of goodwill is impaired.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated at the date of acquisition to a CGU.
Goodwill is considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of the relevant CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
Indicators of impairment include changes in the economic performance and outlook of the region including geopolitical changes, changes in market value of regional investments, large credit defaults and strategic decisions to exit certain regions.
The recoverable amounts for all the CGUs were measured based on value-in-use ViU.
The calculation of ViU for each CGU is calculated using five-year cash ow projections and an estimated terminal value based on a perpetuity value after year five.
The cash ow projections are based on forecasts approved by management up to 2022.
The perpetuity terminal value amount is calculated using year five cash ows using long-term GDP growth rates.
All cash ows are discounted using pre-tax discount rates which re ect market rates appropriate to the CGU.
At 31 December 2017, all CGUs had recoverable amounts that exceed the carrying amounts, with the exception of the Taiwan CGU, where, primarily as a result of a one per cent increase in the discount rate, the carrying amount exceeded the recoverable value and therefore an impairment charge of $320 million has been recognised.
The goodwill allocated to each CGU and key assumptions used in determining the recoverable amounts are set out below and are solely estimates for the purposes of assessing impairment of acquired goodwill.
