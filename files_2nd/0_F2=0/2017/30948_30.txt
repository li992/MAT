Pension Plans Risk Analysis Asset volatility Plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields.
If plan assets were to underperform this yield, this would create a deficit.
All the funded plans hold a proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform bonds in the long term, but which are also likely to experience greater price volatility and therefore risk in the short term.
As plans mature, the Groups strategy is to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets whose risk profile is a better match for the liabilities.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in bond yields has the effect of increasing plan liabilities, although this is partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans bond holdings.
Inflation risk The Groups pension obligations in Canada, the UK and Germany are inflation linked.
Caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plans against above normal inflation.
The US pension obligations are not inflation indexed.
The majority of the plan assets are not directly inflation indexed, meaning that an increase in inflation will tend to increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the plans obligations are to provide benefits for the life of each retired member and his her spouse, so increases in life expectancy result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
The investments of the funded plans are managed within an asset-liability matching framework that has been developed to achieve long-term investments that align with the obligations of the plans.
One objective is to match assets to the pension obligations by investing in annuities and long-term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due in the appropriate currency.
The plans actively monitor how the duration and the expected yield of the investments match the expected cash outflows arising from the pension obligations.
The processes used to manage the risks have not changed from previous years.
Investments are diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
A large portion of assets consist of bonds and equities, although the plans also hold investment funds and liability driven investments.
Equities have been shown to offer the best returns over the long term with an acceptable level of risk.

These intangible assets enable the Company to develop new products to meet the evolving business needs as well as competitively produce its existing products.
The fair value of rental properties and property, plant and equipment acquired was based on the consideration of their highest and best use in the market.
A combination of sales comparison and cost approaches were used in determining the fair value of rental property.
The fair values of property, plant, and equipment, other than rental properties, were based on the consideration that unless otherwise identified, they will continue to be used as is and as part of the ongoing business.
