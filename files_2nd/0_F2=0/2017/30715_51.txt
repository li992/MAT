Indefinite life brands comprise a portfolio of Consumer Healthcare products primarily acquired with the acquisitions of Sterling Winthrop, Inc. in 1994, Block Drug Company, Inc. in 2001, CNS, Inc. in 2006 and the Novartis Consumer Healthcare business in 2015, together with a number of pharmaceutical brands from the acquisition of Stiefel Laboratories, Inc. in 2009.
The book values of the major brands are as follows: 2017 2016 m m Voltaren 2,716 2,847 Otrivin 1,380 1,447 Fenistil 648 680 Theraflu 441 462 Panadol 386 354 Sensodyne 265 243 Lamisil 289 304 Breathe Right 236 199 Stiefel trade name 228 211 Excedrin 185 194 Physiogel 166 166 Polident 112 103 Others 1,686 2,035 8,738 9,245 Each of these brands is considered to have an indefinite life, given the strength and durability of the brand and the level of marketing support.
The brands are in relatively similar stable and profitable market sectors, with similar risk profiles, and their size, diversification and market shares mean that the risk of market-related factors causing a reduction in the lives of the brands is considered to be relatively low.
The Group is not aware of any material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which could limit their useful lives.
Accordingly, they are not amortised.
Each brand is tested annually for impairment and other amortised intangible assets are tested when indicators of impairment arise.
This testing applies a fair value less costs of disposal methodology, generally using post-tax cash flow forecasts with a terminal value calculation and a discount rate equal to the Group post-tax WACC of 7%, adjusted where appropriate for specific country and currency risks.
This valuation methodology uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data, and therefore this valuation technique is classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The main assumptions include future sales price and volume growth, product contribution, the future expenditure required to maintain the products marketability and registration in the relevant jurisdictions and exchange rates.
These assumptions are based on past experience and are reviewed as part of managements budgeting and strategic planning cycle for changes in market conditions and sales erosion through competition.
The terminal growth rates applied of between nil% and 5% are managements estimates of future long-term average growth rates of the relevant markets.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of these intangible assets.
