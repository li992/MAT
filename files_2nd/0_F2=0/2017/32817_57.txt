The group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral or other security where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
The group measures credit risk on a fair value basis.
The groups credit risk is concentrated on one entity, the refiner Asahi, but the group has good credit checks on customers and none of the trade receivables from the customers has been past due.
Also, the cash balances held in Australian dollars are held with a financial institution with a high credit rating.
The gross carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of collateral or other security obtained.
h Fair value The carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the financial statements represents their respective fair values, principally as a consequence of the short term maturity thereof.
