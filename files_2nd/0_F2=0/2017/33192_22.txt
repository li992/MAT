2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are as follows: Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, including International Accounting Standards IAS and Interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, endorsed for use by companies listed on an EU regulated market.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for available for sale investments and derivative financial instruments, which have been measured at fair value.
The Group has changed its operating segments in the year to reflect a change in the way that the business is managed and reported internally.
Social games is now presented in Casino, having previously been reported in Emerging Offerings.
The comparative segment results for the year ended 31 December 2016 have been restated to reflect this change, as described in note 3.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars because that is the currency the Group primarily operates in.
All values are rounded to the closest million except when otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements comply with the Gibraltar Companies Act 2014.
The significant accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements in the prior year have been applied consistently in these consolidated financial statements, with the exception of the amendments to accounting standards effective for the annual periods beginning on 1 January 2017.
These are described in more detail on the next page.
The following amendments to International Financial Reporting Standards, issued by the IASB and adopted by the EU, were effective from 1 January 2017 and have been adopted by the Group during the year with no significant impact on the Parent company or on the consolidated results or financial position: Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: Disclosure initiative.

COM 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued The following new standards, issued by the IASB and adopted by the EU have not been adopted by the Group as they were not effective for the year: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments that replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IFRS 9 brings together all three aspects of the accounting for financial instruments project: classification and measurement of financial assets, introduces a new expected credit loss model for the impairment of financial assets and new guidance on the application of hedge accounting.
IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The Group has analysed the financial instruments and concluded that there is no significant impact on its statement of financial position, income statement and statement of changes in equity will arise as a result of IFRS 9 implementation.
IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers - IFRS 15 presents new requirements for the recognition of revenue, replacing IAS 18 Revenue and other existing revenue related standards and interpretations.
The new standard establishes a control-based revenue recognition model and provides additional guidance in many areas not covered in detail under existing IFRSs, including how to account for arrangements with multiple performance obligations, variable pricing, customer refund rights, supplier repurchase options, and other common complexities.
IFRS 15 is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
We have completed a detailed review of all B2B contracts and the results of our review indicate that IFRS 15 is not expected to result in any significant change to the timing of revenue or profit recognition on service provision contracts.
This assessment reflects, amongst other matters, that the Groups contracting arrangements meet the requirements set out in IFRS 15 to satisfy performance obligations and recognise revenue when the transaction occurred.
The review also indicates that the new standard is not expected to introduce any significant change to the Groups revenue recognition policy in relation to B2B Revenue including the assessment whether the Group is acting as principal or an agent in the relevant contracts.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 presents new requirements for the lessees recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases, replacing IAS 17 Leases.
The standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases of over 12 months unless the underlying asset has a low value.
The new standard applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The Group considers that the adoption of this standard will likely result in interest expense on the lease liability and depreciation expense on the right-of-use asset on the income statement and an increase in the non-current assets representing right-of-use assets and a corresponding increase in liabilities, both current and non-current, on the balance sheet of the Group.
The Group will continue to assess the impact in the 2018 financial year.
For details in respect of existing operating leases see note 23.
The following relevant interpretations and amendments to existing standards issued by the IASB, have not been adopted by the Group as they were either not effective for the year or not yet endorsed for use in the EU.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of these interpretations and amendments will have on the presentation of, and recognition in, Parent Company or consolidated results or financial position in future periods: Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRIC Interpretation 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle: Clarification in IAS 28 that measuring investees at fair value through profit or loss is an  choice effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
Amendments to IAS 28 Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 Cycle issued on 12 December 2017 effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
IFRIC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
Amendments to IAS 19: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 95 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS as adopted by the EU requires the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect the application of policies and reported amounts.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Included in this note are accounting policies which cover areas that the Directors consider require estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the future.
These policies, together with references to the related notes to the financial statements, which include further commentary on the nature of the estimates and judgements made, can be found below: Revenue The Group applies judgement in determining whether it is acting as a principal or an agent where it provides services to business partners through its business to business unit.
In making these judgements the Group considers, by examining each contract with its business partners, which party has the primary responsibility for providing the services and is exposed to the majority of the risks and rewards associated with providing the services, as well as if it has latitude in establishing prices, either directly or indirectly.
This is described in further detail in the revenue accounting policy set out below.
Taxation Due to the international nature of the Group and the complexity of tax legislation in the jurisdictions in which it operates, the Group applies judgement in estimating the likely outcome of tax matters and the resultant provision for income taxes.
However, in 2015 and early 2016 the Group reached agreement on a number of tax matters with tax authorities in the key jurisdictions from which it operates.
These agreements materially reduce the level of judgement to be made in preparing the financial statements.
There were no changes to these agreements during the year.
The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are appropriate.
For further information see note 8.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which the goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
For further information see note 11.
Internally generated intangible assets Costs relating to internally generated intangible assets are capitalised if the criteria for recognition as assets are met.
The initial capitalisation of costs is based on managements judgement that technological and economic feasibility criteria are met.
In making this judgement, management considers the progress made in each development project and its latest forecasts for each project.
Other expenditure is charged to the consolidated income statement in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Provisions, contingent liabilities and regulatory matters The Group makes a number of judgements in respect of the accounting for and disclosure of expenses and contingent liabilities for regulatory matters, including gaming duties.
These are described in further detail in note 26.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The subsidiaries are companies controlled by 888 Holdings Public Limited Company.
Control exists where the Company has power over an entity: exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with an entity: and the ability to use its power over an entity to affect the amount of its returns.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the Parent gained control until such time as control ceases.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements using the purchase method of accounting.
On the date of the acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values and any excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Parent Company and using consistent accounting policies.

COM 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Revenue Revenue is recognised provided that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the transactions occurred after deduction of certain promotional bonuses granted to customers and VAT, and after adding the fees and charges applied to customer accounts, and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
Revenue consists of income from online activities and income generated from foreign exchange commissions on customer deposit and withdrawals and account fees, which is allocated to each reporting segment.
Revenue from online activities comprises: Casino and Bingo Casino and Bingo online gaming revenue is represented by the difference between the amounts of bets placed by customers less amounts won, adjusted for the fair value of certain promotional bonuses granted to customers and the value of loyalty points accrued.
Social games revenue represents the Groups share from the sale of virtual goods to customers playing the Groups games.
Poker Poker online gaming revenue represents the commission charged from each poker hand in ring games and entry fees for participation in Poker tournaments less the fair value of certain promotional bonuses and the value of loyalty points accrued.
In Poker tournaments certain promotional costs are accounted for, and entry fee revenue is recognised when the tournament has concluded.
Sport Sport online gaming revenue comprises bets placed less pay-outs to customers, adjusted for the fair value of open betting positions.
B2B Revenue from B2B is mainly comprised of services provided to business partners and brand licensing on third-party platforms.
For services provided to business partners through its B2B unit, the Group considers whether for each customer it is acting as a principal or as an agent by considering which party has the primary responsibility for providing the services and is exposed to the majority of the risks and rewards associated with providing the services, as well as if it has latitude in establishing prices, either directly or indirectly: Where the Group is considered to be the principal, income is recognised as the gross revenue generated from use of the Groups platform in online gaming activities with the partners share of the revenue charged to marketing expenses.
In other cases income is recognised as the Group share of the net revenue generated from use of the Groups platform.
B2B also includes fees from the provision of certain gaming related services to partners.
Customer advances received are treated as deferred income within current liabilities and released as they are earned.
Revenue derived from brand licensing on third-party platforms represents the Groups net revenue share from that activity.
888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 97 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Operating expenses Operating expenses consists primarily of staff costs, payment service providers commissions, chargebacks, commission and royalties payable to third parties, all of which are recognised on an accruals basis, and depreciation and amortisation.
Administrative expenses Administrative expenses consist primarily of staff costs and corporate professional expenses, both of which are recognised on an accruals basis.
Exceptional charges and adjusted performance measures The Group classifies and presents certain items of income and expense as Exceptional charges.
The Group presents adjusted performance measures which differ from statutory measures due to exclusion of Exceptional charges and certain non-cash items as the Group considers that it allows a better reflection of the underlying financial performance of the Group.
These measures are described as adjusted and are used by management to measure and monitor the Groups underlying financial performance.
Non-cash items that are excluded from adjusted performance measures of underlying financial performance include share benefit charge and share of post-tax loss of equity accounted joint ventures and associates.
The Group also seeks to present a measure of underlying performance which is not impacted by Exceptional charges.
The Group considers any non-recurring items of income and expense for classification as exceptional by virtue of their nature and size.
The items classified as exceptional and excluded from the adjusted measures are described in further detail in note 5.
Foreign currency Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant company are translated into that functional currency using year-end spot foreign exchange rates.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange rate differences on foreign currency transactions are included in financial income or financial expenses in the consolidated income statement, as appropriate.
The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from US$ are translated into the presentation currency at foreign exchange rates as set out below.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as a component of other comprehensive income.
i assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: and ii income and expenses for each income statement are translated at an average exchange rate unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions.
Taxation The tax expense represents tax payable for the year based on currently applicable tax rates.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet differs from its tax base.
They are accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the difference can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities assets are settled recovered.

COM 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately consist mainly of software licences and domain names and are capitalised at cost.
Those acquired as part of a business combination are recognised separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably.
These intangible assets are amortised over the useful life of the assets, which for software licences is between one and five years and for domain names is five years.
Internally generated intangible assets Expenditure incurred on development activities of gaming platform is capitalised only when the expenditure will lead to new or substantially improved products or processes, the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
All other development expenditure is expensed.
Subsequent expenditure on intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which it relates.
The Group estimates the useful life of these assets as between three and five years, except for certain licence costs which are amortised over either the life of the licence, or up to 20 years, whichever is the shorter period.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration in a business combination over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Consideration comprises the fair value of any assets transferred, liabilities assumed and equity instruments issued.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated income statement and not subsequently reversed.
Where the fair values of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of consideration paid, the excess is credited in full to the consolidated income statement on the acquisition.
Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are charged or credited to the consolidated income statement.
In addition, the direct costs of acquisition are charged immediately to the consolidated income statement.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation.
Assets are assessed at each balance sheet date for indicators of impairment.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of the assets less their estimated residual values over their expected useful lives.
The annual depreciation rates are as follows: IT equipment 33% Office furniture and equipment 7-15% Motor vehicles 15% Leasehold improvements Over the shorter of the term of the lease or useful lives Impairment of non-financial assets Impairment tests on goodwill are undertaken annually and where applicable an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount being the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, the asset is written down accordingly through the consolidated income statement.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the assets cash generating unit i. e. the smallest group of assets to which the asset belongs for which there are separately identifiable and largely independent cash inflows.
888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 99 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Investment in equity accounted joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are those entities over whose relevant activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic, financial and operating decisions.
Associates are those businesses in which the Group has a long-term interest and is able to exercise significant influence over the financial and operational policies but does not have control or joint control over those policies.
Joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognised initially at cost.
The Groups share of post-acquisition profits and losses is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except that losses in excess of the Groups investment in the joint ventures and associates are not recognised unless there is an obligation to make good those losses.
Profits and losses arising on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures or associates are recognised only to the extent of unrelated investors interests in the joint ventures and associates.
The investors share in the profits and losses of the investment resulting from these transactions is eliminated against the carrying value of the investment.
Any premium paid above the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is capitalised and included in the carrying amount of the investment.
Where there is objective evidence that the investment has been impaired the carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment in the same way as other non-financial assets, and any charge or reversal of previous impairments is taken to the consolidated income statement.
Where amounts paid for an investment in joint venture and associates are in excess of the Groups share of the fair value of net assets acquired, the excess is recognised as negative goodwill and released to the consolidated income statement immediately.
The Groups share of additional equity contributions from other joint venture partners is taken to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost and principally comprise amounts due from credit card companies and from ePayment companies.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when there is objective evidence that the full amount may not be collected.
Fair value measurement The Group measures certain financial instruments, including derivatives and available for sale investments, at fair value at each balance sheet date.
The fair value related disclosures are included in notes 24 and 25.
Fair value is the price that would be received or paid in an orderly transaction between market participants at a particular date, either in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for that asset or liability accessible to the Group.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
The fair value measurement hierarchy is based on the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
The inputs are categorised into three levels, with the highest level level 1 given to inputs for which there are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest level level 3 given to unobservable inputs.
Level 2 inputs are directly or indirectly observable inputs other than quoted prices.
Derivative financial instruments From time to time the Group enters into contracts for derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge operational risks associated with foreign exchange rates.
Such derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and are carried in the consolidated balance sheet as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and balances with banks.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
They include short-term deposits originally purchased with maturities of three months or less.

COM 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Equity Equity issued by the Company is recorded as the proceeds received from the issue of shares, net of direct issue costs.
Treasury shares Own equity instruments that are reacquired treasury shares are recognised at cost and deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in the share premium.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Liabilities to customers Liabilities to customers comprise the amounts that are credited to customers bankroll the Groups electronic wallet, including provision for bonuses granted by the Group, less fees and charges applied to customer accounts, along with full progressive provision for jackpots.
These amounts are repayable in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases wherever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present or constructive obligation as a result of a past event from which it is probable that it will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reasonably estimated.
Dividends Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when declared by the Board of Directors and paid.
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Equity-settled share benefit charges Where the Company grants its employees or contractors shares or options, the cost of those awards, recognised in the consolidated income statement over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity, is measured with reference to the fair value at the date of grant.
Market performance conditions are taken into account in determining the fair value at the date of grant.
Non-market performance conditions, including service conditions, are taken into account by adjusting the number of instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of instruments that eventually vest.
Severance pay schemes The Group operates two severance pay schemes: Defined benefit severance pay scheme The Group operates a defined benefit severance pay scheme pursuant to the Severance Pay Law in Israel.
Under this scheme Group employees are entitled to severance pay upon redundancy or retirement.
The liability for termination of employment is measured using the projected unit credit method.
Severance pay scheme surpluses and deficits are measured as: the fair value of plan assets at the reporting date: less plan liabilities calculated using the projected unit credit method, discounted to its present value using yields available for the appropriate government bonds that have maturity dates appropriate to the terms of the liabilities.
Remeasurements of the net severance pay scheme assets and liabilities, including actuarial gains and losses on the scheme liabilities due to changes in assumptions or experience within the scheme and any differences between the interest income and the actual return on assets, are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Defined contribution severance pay scheme In 2017 the Group introduced defined contribution plan pursuant to section 14 to the Severance Pay Law.
Under this scheme the Group pays fixed monthly contributions.
Payments to defined contribution plans are charged as an expense as they fall due.

888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 105 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 6 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS continued Severance pay scheme Israel The Group has a defined contribution plan pursuant to section 14 to the Severance Pay Law under which the Group pays fixed contributions and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient amounts to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service at the date of their departure.
The Group recognised an expense in respect of contribution to the defined contribution plan during the year of US$0.3 million 2016: nil.
The Groups employees in Israel, which are not subject to section 14 to the Severance Pay Law, are eligible to receive certain benefits from the Group in specific circumstances on leaving the Group.
As such, the Group operates a defined benefit severance pay plan which requires contributions to be made to separately administrated funds.
The current service cost and the present value of the defined benefit obligation are measured using the projected unit credit method.
The following table summarises the employee benefits figures as included in the consolidated financial statements: 2017 2016 US$ million US$ million Included in the balance sheet: Severance pay scheme liability within trade and other payables 3.3 1.6 Included in the income statement: Current service costs within operating expenses 2.0 1.8 Current service costs within research and development 1.8 1.7 Current service costs within administrative expenses 0.8 0.7 Included in the statement of comprehensive income: Remeasurement of severance pay scheme liability 1.4 0.5 Movement in severance pay scheme liability: 2017 2016 Severance pay scheme assets US$ million US$ million At beginning of year 18.8 16.0 Interest income 0.9 0.8 Contributions by the Group 4.3 5.6 Benefits paid 3.8 3.0 Return on assets less interest income already recorded 0.2 0.7 Exchange differences 2.1 0.1 At end of year 22.5 18.8 2017 2016 Severance pay plan liabilities US$ million US$ million At beginning of year 20.4 18.5 Interest expense 0.9 0.8 Current service costs 4.6 4.3 Benefits paid 3.9 3.2 Actuarial gain on past experience 0.3 0.3 Actuarial loss on changes in financial assumptions 1.2 0.1 Exchange differences 2.3 0.2 At end of year 25.8 20.4 As at 31 December 2017 the net accounting deficit of defined benefit severance pay plan was US$3.3 million 2016: US$1.6 million.
The Scheme is backed by substantial assets amounting to US$22.5 million at 31 December 2017 2016: US$18.8 million.
The net accounting deficit of defined benefit severance plan is a result of two elements: Potential liability to pay further contributions to employees who will be made redundant, if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all benefits relating to employee service at the date of their departure.
Volatility of Israeli government bond rates may have substantial impact in absolute terms on the net liability.
A decrease in the discount rate by 0.25% per annum i. e. 3.87% to 3.62% would increase the plan liabilities by US$0.6 million.
The impact of the severance deficit on the level of distributable reserves is monitored on an on-going basis.
Monitoring enables planning for any potential adverse volatility and helps the Group to assess the likely impact on distributable reserves.

Set out below are details in respect of the significant jurisdictions where the Group operates and the factors that influenced the current and deferred taxation in those jurisdictions: Gibraltar Gibraltar companies are subject to a corporate tax rate of 10%.
Gibraltar corporate tax expenses for the year are significantly lower compared to 2016, as a result of lower profit before tax caused by Exceptional charges as described in note 5.
Israel The domestic corporate tax rate in Israel in 2017 is 24% 2016: 25%.
From 1 January 2018 the rate has been reduced to 23%.

9 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to Ordinary Shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share The weighted average number of shares for diluted earnings per share takes into account all potentially dilutive equity instruments granted, which are not included in the number of shares for basic earnings per share.
Certain equity instruments have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their conditions of being issued were not deemed to satisfy the performance conditions at the end of the performance period or it will not be advantageous for holders to exercise them into shares, in the case of options.
The number of equity instruments included in the diluted EPS calculation consist of 8,840,298 Ordinary Shares 2016: 7,688,394 and 49,353 market-value options 2016: 101,447.

Analysis of goodwill by cash generating units Bingo online Total business Other goodwill US$ million US$ million US$ million Carrying value at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017 125.1 0.3 125.4 Impairment In accordance with IAS 36 and the Groups stated accounting policy, an impairment test is carried out annually on the carrying amounts of goodwill and a review for indicators of impairment is carried out for other non-current assets.
Where an impairment test was carried out, the carrying value is compared to the recoverable amount of the asset or the cash generating unit.
In each case, the recoverable amount was the value in use of the assets, which was determined by discounting the future cash flows of the relevant asset or cash generating unit to their present value.
Goodwill Bingo online business Goodwill and intangible assets associated with the Bingo online business unit arose following the acquisition of the Bingo online business of Globalcom Limited during 2007 and the acquisition of the Wink bingo business in 2009.
The income streams generated from the Bingo online business, comprising the B2C Bingo cash generating unit and the B2B cash generating unit, have been considered together as the risks and rewards associated with those income streams are deemed to be sufficiently similar.
Key assumptions and inputs used Cash flow projections have been prepared for a five-year period, following which a long-term growth rate has been assumed.
Underlying growth rates, as shown in the table below, have been applied to revenue and are based on past experience, including the results in 2017 and 2016 and projections of future changes in the UK online bingo gaming market.
B2B contracts that will not be renewed were projected accordingly.
Key assumptions in preparing these cash flow projections include moderate growth in revenue, a stable level of costs per customer acquisition and the expectation that the Group will continue to operate and be subject to gaming duties including incremental UK remote gaming duty which commenced in H2 2017 aimed to tax charge on all freeplays in its core jurisdictions.
The pre-tax discount rate that is considered by the Directors to be appropriate is the Groups specific Weighted Average Cost of Capital, adjusted for tax, which is considered to be appropriate for the online Bingo cash generating units.

3 The underlying growth rate for years 2 to 5 was calculated excluding the effect of certain B2B contracts, which will not be renewed.
4 Management recognises that a change in GBP US$ currency rate can have a significant impact on available headroom.
A reduction by 10% in the GBP US$ currency rate would result in decrease of available headroom by 51%, a reduction by 20% in GBP US$ currency rate would result in impairment.
The Directors have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes to key assumptions that would lead to impairment in the Bingo goodwill and intangible assets.

AAPN has a 100% owned subsidiary, AAPN New Jersey LLC AAPN NJ, which has a B2C gaming offering in New Jersey.
AGN LLC AGN, the entity which contracted with a Las Vegas casino licensee in connection with the operation of a B2C gaming offering in Nevada, is 100% owned by the Group.
However, the Group considers that due to the manner in which AGN was operated under the contractual arrangements in the JVA, it was regarded as a joint venture.
During 2016 AGN surrendered its Nevada licence and ceased operation and winded down as of 31 December 2017.
AAPN has been equity accounted for, reflecting the Groups effective 47% interest in their consolidated results and assets.

COM 21 SHARE BENEFIT CHARGES Equity-settled share benefit charges As at 31 December 2017 the Group has equity-settled employee shares and share options granted under two equity-settled employee share incentive plans the 888 All-Employee Share Plan AEP, which expired according to its terms in August 2015, and the 888 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2015 LTIP which was adopted at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 29 September 2015.
The 888 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2015 is open to employees including Executive Directors and full-time consultants of the Group, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Awards under this scheme will vest in instalments over a fixed period of at least three years subject to the relevant individuals remaining in service.
Certain of these awards are subject to additional performance conditions imposed by the Remuneration Committee at the dates of grant, further details of which are given in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 63 to 76.
In addition, on 8 May 2017, the Board adopted a Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP in order to allow the Company to comply with the requirement contained in its Remuneration Policy pursuant to which any annual bonus payment made to an Executive Director in excess of 100% of such Executive Directors annual salary is deferred into equity awards of the Company in the form of nil cost options or share awards.
Details of equity-settled shares and share options granted as part of the AEP, the LTIP and the DSBP are set out below: Share options granted 2017 2016 Weighted Weighted average average exercise exercise price Number price Number Outstanding at the beginning of the year 1.27 259,981 1.35 908,224 Market value options lapsed during the year 1.15 6,410 1.70 112,285 Market value options exercised during the year 1.28 155,603 1.31 535,958 1,2, 3 Outstanding at the end of the year 1.26 97,968 1.27 259,981 1 Of the total number of options outstanding at 31 December 2017.

These grants were made on 28 June 2017 to the CEO 130,914 Shares and CFO 80,777 Shares, with the shares vesting in equal tranches on 28 June 2018, 2019 and 2020.
Ordinary Shares granted for future vesting are valued at the share price at grant date, which the Group considers approximates to the fair value.
On 29-30 June 2017 the Group purchased 211,691 shares on the open market at an average price of 255.31 per share, all of which were recognised as treasury shares as of 31 December 2017.

Further details of performance conditions that have to be satisfied on these awards are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 63 to 76.
The EPS growth target is taken into account when determining the number of shares expected to vest at each reporting date, and the TSR target is taken into account when calculating the fair value of the share grant.

The restrictions on the shares during the vesting period, primarily relating to non-receipt of dividends, are considered to have an immaterial effect on the share option charge.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, a charge to the consolidated income statement in respect of any shares or options granted under the above schemes is recognised and spread over the vesting period of the shares or options based on the fair value of the shares or options at the grant date, adjusted for changes in vesting conditions at each balance sheet date.
These charges have no cash impact.

888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 119 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 24 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Group is exposed through its operations to risks that arise from use of its financial instruments.
Policies and procedures for managing these risks are set by the Board following recommendations from the Chief Financial Officer.
The Board reviews the effectiveness of these procedures and, if required, approves specific policies and procedures in order to mitigate these risks.
The main financial instruments used by the Group, on which financial risk arises, are as follows: Cash and cash equivalents: Trade and other receivables: Trade and other payables: Customer deposits: Available for sale financial investments: Detailed analysis of these financial instruments is as follows: 2017 2016 Financial assets US$ million US$ million 1 Trade and other receivables note 16 39.2 31.4 Cash and cash equivalents note 15 179.6 172.6 Available for sale investment note 13 0.2 0.2 219.0 204.2 1 Excludes prepayments and non-current other receivables.

COM 24 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Capital The capital employed by the Group is composed of equity attributable to shareholders.
The primary objective of the Group is maximising shareholders value, which, from the capital perspective, is achieved by maintaining the capital structure most suited to the Groups size, strategy and underlying business risk.
There are no demands or restrictions on the Groups capital.
The main financial risk areas are as follows: Credit risk Trade receivables The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to trade receivables, most of which are due from the Groups payment service providers PSP.
These are third-party companies that facilitate deposits and withdrawals of funds to and from customers virtual wallets with the Group.
These are mainly intermediaries that transact on behalf of credit card companies.
The risk is that a PSP would fail to discharge its obligation with regard to the balance owed to the Group.
The Group reduces this credit risk by: Monitoring balances with PSPs on a regular basis.
Arranging for the shortest possible cash settlement intervals.
Replacing rolling reserve requirements, where they exist, with a Letter of Credit by a reputable financial institution.
Ensuring a new PSP is only contracted following various due diligence and Know Your Customer procedures.
Ensuring policies are in place to reduce dependency on any specific PSP and as a limit to any concentration of risk.
The Group considers that based on the factors above and on extensive past experience, the PSP receivables are of good credit quality and there is a low level of potential bad debt as at year-end amounting to US$0.5 million arising from a PSP failing to discharge its obligation 2016: US$0.5 million.
This has been charged to the consolidated income statement.
An additional credit risk the Group faces relates to customers disputing charges made to their credit cards chargebacks or any other funding method they have used in respect of the services provided by the Group.
Customers may fail to fulfil their obligation to pay, which will result in funds not being collected.
These chargebacks and uncollected deposits, when occurring, will be deducted at source by the PSPs from any amount due to the Group.
As such the Group provides for these eventualities by way of an impairment provision based on analysis of past transactions.
This provision is set off against trade receivables and at 31 December 2017 was US$1.4 million 2016: US$1.4 million.
The Groups in-house Fraud and Risk Management department carefully monitors deposits and withdrawals by following prevention and verification procedures using internally developed bespoke systems integrated with commercially available third-party measures.
Cash and cash equivalents The Group controls its cash position from its Gibraltar headquarters.
Subsidiaries in its other main locations maintain minimal cash balances as required for their operations.
Cash settlement proceeds from PSPs, as described above, are paid into bank accounts controlled by the Treasury function in Gibraltar.
The Group holds the majority of its funds with highly reputable financial institutions and will not hold funds with financial institutions with a low credit rating save for limited balances for specific operational needs.
The Group maintains its cash reserves in highly liquid deposits and regularly monitors interest rates in order to maximise yield.
Customer funds Customer funds are matched by customer liabilities and progressive prize pools of an equal value.
Restricted short-term deposits Restricted short-term deposits are short-term deposits held by banks primarily to support guarantees in respect of regulated markets licence requirements.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is the amount of financial assets presented above, totalling US$219.0 million 2016: US$204.2 million.
888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 121 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 24 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk exists where the Group might encounter difficulties in meeting its financial obligations as they become due.
The Group monitors its liquidity in order to ensure that sufficient liquid resources are available to allow it to meet its obligations.
The following table details the contractual maturity analysis of the Groups financial liabilities: 2017 Between 3 months More than On demand In 3 months and 1 year 1 year Total US$ million US$ million US$ million US$ million US$ million 1 Trade and other payables 11.2 68.7 13.9 93.8 Customer deposits 71.7 71.7 82.9 68.7 13.9 165.5 1 Excludes taxes payable.

The Groups financial risk arising from exchange rate fluctuations is mainly attributed to: Mismatches between customer deposits, which are predominantly denominated in US$, and the net receipts from customers, which are settled in the currency of the customers choice and of which Pounds Sterling GBP and Euros EUR are the most significant.
Mismatches between reported revenue, which is mainly generated in US$ the Groups reporting currency and the functional currency of the majority of its subsidiaries, and a significant portion of deposits settled in local currencies.
Expenses, the majority of which are denominated in foreign currencies including Pounds Sterling GBP, Euros EUR and New Israeli Shekels ILS.
The Group continually monitors the foreign currency risk and takes steps, where practical, to ensure that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level.
This includes the use of foreign exchange forward contracts designed to fix the economic impact of known liabilities when considered appropriate.
At 31 December 2017 the Group does not have any open foreign exchange forward contracts.

The Groups policy is to invest surplus funds in low risk money market funds and in interest bearing bank accounts.
The Group arranges for excess funds to be placed in these interest bearing accounts with its principal bankers in order to maximise availability of funds for investments.
Downside interest rate risk is minimal as the Group has no floating rates borrowings.
Given current low interest rates, a 0.5% downward movement in bank interest rates would not have a significant impact on finance income for the year.
However, a 0.5% increase in interest rates would, based on the year end deposits, increase annual profits by US$0.35 million.
888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 123 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 25 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS At 31 December 2017 and 2016, the Groups available for sale investment is measured at fair value level 2.
For the remaining financial assets and liabilities, the Group considers that the book value approximates to fair value.
There were no changes in valuation techniques or transfers between categories in the period.
26 PROVISIONS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND REGULATORY ISSUES a The Group operates in numerous jurisdictions.
Accordingly, and on the basis of tax advice obtained, the Group is filing tax returns, providing for and paying all taxes and duties it believes are due based on local tax laws and transfer pricing agreements and tax advice obtained.
The Group is also periodically subject to audits and assessments by local taxing authorities.
Other than as provided in the Group financial statements, the Board is unable to quantify reliably any exposure for additional taxes, if any, that may arise from the final settlement of such assessments and considers it unlikely that any further liability will arise.
b There are uncertainties as to whether any VAT is due in respect of certain services provided by the Group to customers in Germany prior to 2015.
These uncertainties are in respect of the determination of the place of supply of some or all of the services provided by the Group prior to 2015 and, insofar as the place of supply and the customers location is determined to be Germany, whether a possible imposition of VAT on relevant services would be lawful.
There are also uncertainties surrounding any tax base to be applied and any retrospective period in the event that it is ultimately determined that VAT is due on any relevant services.
Historically, on the basis of legal advice received, the Board considered that cash outflow in respect of VAT on these services rendered to customers in Germany was not probable.
In the current period, in response to an inquiry from the tax authorities in Germany about services provided prior to 2015, the Group provided information, in order to fulfil its statutory assistance and information obligations, to enable the appropriate tax authorities to form their own view regarding the likelihood of a VAT liability.
The Group obtained a thorough legal assessment and considered the tax position in respect of each service supplied and has taken a cautious approach by recording a provision of US$45.3 million 39.6 million Euro in 2017 consolidated income statement 2016: nil in respect of some of these services, based on its estimate of probable amounts due given the uncertainties outlined above.
Discussions with the relevant tax authorities are on-going.
For other services, the Group considers that it has strong arguments to support the position that the payment of VAT is not probable due to the significant uncertainties as outlined above related to these services.
On this basis, no amounts have been recorded in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
However, it remains possible that there is a cash outflow in respect of these services.
The Group has estimated that the VAT which may be payable in respect of these items is up to US$18.5 million.
This position reflects the Groups estimate of the likely amounts and probability of any related outflows.
However, the Board has reserved its position and all legal rights, based on legal advice received.
c As part of the Boards ongoing regulatory compliance and operational risk assessment process, it continues to monitor legal and regulatory developments, and their potential impact on the business, and continues to take appropriate advice in respect of these developments.
Given the nature of the legal and regulatory landscape of the industry, from time to time the Group has received notices, communications and legal actions from a small number of regulatory authorities and other parties in respect of its activities.
The Group has taken legal advice as to the manner in which it should respond and the likelihood of success of such actions.
Based on this advice and the nature of the actions, for the majority of these matters the Board is unable to quantify reliably the outflow of funds that may result, if any.
For matters where an outflow of funds is probable and can be measured reliably, amounts have been recognised in the financial statements.
Except for the UKGC matter further described in note 5 these amounts are not material at 31 December 2017.
