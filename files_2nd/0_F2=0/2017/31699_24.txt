SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Accounting policies 1.1 Basis of preparation SSP Group plc the Company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and equity-account the Groups interest in associates.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Companys functional currency.
All information is given to the nearest 0.1m.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except in respect of the derivative financial instruments that are stated at their fair value.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financialstatements.
1.2 Going concern These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The Board has reviewed the Groups trading forecasts for the next 12 months.
These forecasts, which include detailed cash flow projections, comprise assumptions as to sales and profit performance by segment and by month, and take account of the normal seasonality profile of the business.
As a result, the Directors are confident that the assumptions underlying their forecasts are reasonable and that the Group will be able to operate within its banking covenants and available liquidity headroom.
Notwithstanding the above, however, there remains a risk that a downturn in the global economy could result in passenger numbers and consumer spending in the travel market that are worse than the Board is currently envisaging.
As a result, the Directors have also reviewed forecasts that include sensitivities that make allowance for this risk.
Should such a scenario arise, the Directors are confident they have adequate liquidity and covenant headroom to ensure that the Group can meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeablefuture.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare these financial statements on a going concern basis.
In addition, in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the prospects and viability of the Group over a longer period than the 12 months required by the Going Concern provision.
Further details of this assessment are provided on page22 of the Strategic report.
1.3 Basis of consolidation The financial statements of the Group consolidate the results of the Company and its subsidiary entities, together with the Groups attributable share of the results of associates.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits and losses arising from intragroup transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control is the power to direct the relevant activities of the subsidiary that significantly affect the subsidiarys return so as to have rights to the variable return from its activities.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
Associates and jointly controlled entities An associate is an undertaking in which the Group has a long-term equity interest and over which it has the power to exercise significant influence.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost including transaction costs.
The Groups interest in the net assets of associates is reported as an investment on the consolidated balance sheet and its interest in their results is included in the consolidated income statement below the Groups operating profit.
The Groups investment in associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of equity-accounted investees, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of the Groups investment is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.
Investments in associates are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The impairment review compares the net carrying value with the recoverable amount, where the recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use calculated as the present value of the Groups share of the associates future cash flows and its fair value less costs to sell.
67 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
Accounting policies continued 1.4 Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement, except for differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation that is effective, or qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the Groups presentation currency, Sterling, at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve or non-controlling interest, as appropriate.
When a foreign operation is disposed of, such that control, joint control or significant influence is lost, the entire accumulated amount in the foreign currency translation reserve, net of amounts previously attributed to non-controlling interests, is recycled to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while still retaining control, the relevant proportion of the accumulated amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests.
When the Group disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while still retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is recycled to the income statement.
Exchange differences arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised directly in equity in the translation reserve.
Foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised directly in equity, in the translation reserve, to the extent that the hedge is effective.
When the hedged part of a net investment is disposed of, the associated cumulative amount in equity is recycled to the income statement as an adjustment to the profit or loss on disposal.
1.5 Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: a they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group: and b where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
1.6 Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Other financial assets Other financial assets comprise long-term cash deposits with a maturity of more than three months on inception and money market funds that are not readily convertible to cash.
These are held on the balance sheet at amortised cost.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
68 SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.7 Derivative financial instruments and hedging Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the cash flow hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in equity are recycled into the income statement in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss, i. e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding two policy statements, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
Fair value hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair value that is attributable to the risk being hedged even if it is normally carried at cost or amortised cost and any gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised immediately in the income statement even if those gains would normally be recognised directly in reserves.
1.8 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases.
Leased assets acquired by way of a finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold land and buildings the life of the lease Plant and machinery 3 to 13 years Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 3 to 13 years 1.9 Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date at which control is transferred to the Group.
The consideration transferred in the acquisition is measured at fair value as are the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired is accounted for asgoodwill.
Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Non-controlling interests arising from acquisition are accounted for based on the proportionate share of the fair value of identifiable net assets.
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests share of subsequent changes in equity.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Where the Group recognises a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary, based on the rights the non-controlling interest have to their share of the returns of such subsidiaries, the Group recognises obligations to acquire additional shares in these subsidiary undertakings as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet at the present value of the estimated exercise price of the forward contract.
The present value of the forward contracts is estimated based on expected earnings in Board-approved forecasts and the choice of a suitable discount rate.
Upon initial recognition a corresponding entry is made to other equity.
For subsequent changes in the measurement of the liability the corresponding entry is made to the consolidated income statement.
69 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
Accounting policies continued 1.10 Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and, therefore, no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.
The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.
Any difference between the price paid or received and the amount by which non-controlling interests are adjusted is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent company.
1.11 Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units CGUs and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Other intangible assets Indefinite-life intangible assets relate to brands recognised on acquisition of the SSP business in 2006.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Other intangible assets, consisting mainly of brands, franchise agreements and software, that are acquired purchased by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairmentlosses.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets between nine and 14 years unless such lives are indefinite.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
1.12 Inventories Inventories comprise goods purchased for resale and consumable stores and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costis calculated using the first in first out method.
1.13 Impairment excluding inventories and deferred tax assets Financial assets including receivables A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired.
A financial asset is impaired with a charge to the income statement if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event has had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset, which can be estimated reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the assets original effective interest rate.
Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount.
When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.
Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Groups non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each period at the same time.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets.
Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment is tested reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit group of units on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
70 SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.14 Employee benefits Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting the amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets.
The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in a potential asset for the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of the economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements.
Remeasurements of the net defined liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets excluding interest and the effect of the asset ceiling if any, excluding interest, are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.
Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined plans are recognised in the income statement.
When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.
Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the employing company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered byemployees.
Short-term benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under a short-term cash bonus if the employing company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimatedreliably.
Share-based payments Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.
The fair value excludes the effect of service and non-market-based vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves, based on the Groups estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of service and nonmarket-based vesting conditions.
The impact of changes to the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
1.15 Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate rate.
1.16 Segment information Segment information is provided based on the geographical segments that are reviewed by the chief operating decision-maker.
In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 8 Operational segments, the Groups chief operating decision-maker is the Board of Directors.
The operating segments are aggregated if they meet certain criteria.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment, as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated items comprise mainly head office expenses, finance income, finance charges and income tax.
No disclosure is made for net assets liabilities as these are not reported by segment to the chief operating decision-maker.
1.17 Revenue Revenue represents amounts for retail goods and catering services supplied to third party customers predominantly passengers excluding discounts, value-added tax and similar sales taxes.
Sale of goods Revenue is recognised at the point of sale of food, beverage and retail goods.
Provision of catering services Revenue is recognised in the period in which services are provided.
1.18 Supplier income The Group enters into agreements with suppliers to benefit from promotional activity and volume growth.
Supplier incentives, rebates and discounts are recognised within cost of sales as they are earned.
71 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
Accounting policies continued 1.19 Underlying items Underlying items are those that, in managements judgement, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence, in order to draw the attention of the reader and to show the underlying business performance of the Group more accurately.
Such items are included within the income statement caption to which they relate, and are separately disclosed either in the notes to the consolidated financial statements or on the face of the consolidated income statement.
1.20 Lease payments Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Contingent rent which is dependent on variable factors, such as unit sales, is recognised in the period in which it is incurred.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of theliability.
1.21 Finance income and expense Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income and net foreign exchange gains.
Finance expense comprises interest payable, finance charges on shares classified as liabilities, finance lease charges recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method, the unwinding of the discount on provisions, and net foreign exchange losses that are recognised in the income statement.
Interest income and interest expense are recognised in the income statement as they accrue, using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entitys right to receive payment is established.
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.
1.22 Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
No provision is made for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available, against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
1.23 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous year.
The following standards, issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU, have not yet been adopted and unless otherwise stated are not expected to have a material impact on the Group: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces IAS 39 Financial instruments Recognition and Measurement.
The standard effective for the year ending 30 September 2019 covers the classification, measurement, impairment and fide-recognition of financial assets and liabilities and provides new hedge accounting requirements.
The Group continues to assess the impact this standard would have on its consolidated results and financial position.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective for the year ending 30 September 2019 is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer.
The standard provides a single, principles-based five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers to determine whether, how much and when revenue is recognised.
IFRS 15 replaces the separate models for goods, services and construction contracts under IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IAS 18 Revenue.
The Group continues to assess the impact of the new standard, but based on a preliminary assessment, the Group believes that IFRS 15 will not have a significant impact on the timing and recognition of revenue.
72 SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IFRS 16 Leases effective for the year ending 30 September 2020 requires lessees to recognise operating leases on the Groups balance sheet, unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value.
The standard, which replaces IAS 17 Leases, will give rise to the recognition of an asset representing the right-of-use of the leased item and a related liability being the future lease payment obligations.
Costs currently classified as operating lease costs will be reclassified and split between the depreciation of the asset, on a straight-line basis, and interest on the lease liability.
This reclassification will increase EBITDA with corresponding increases in the depreciation charge and interest expense.
Interest expense will also be higher in the early stages of a lease and reduce over the term.
IFRS 16 can either be applied on a fully retrospective basis, which will require the restatement of comparative prior periods, or the cumulative retrospective impact can be applied as an adjustment to equity on the date of adoption of the standard.
The Group is reviewing the standard in more detail to ensure it prepares itself for inception and expects that IFRS 16 will have a material impact on the Groups consolidated results and associated impact on both assets and liabilities.
Significant accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgements and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Theestimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Goodwill and intangible assets The Group recognises goodwill and intangible assets that have arisen through acquisitions.
These assets are subject to impairment reviews to ensure that the assets are not carried above their recoverable amounts.
For goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, reviews are performed annually.
For other intangible assets, reviews are performed if events or circumstances indicate that this isnecessary.
The recoverable amounts of CGUs or groups of CGUs have been determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions consistent with the most up-to-date budgets and plans that have been formally approved by the Board.
The key assumptions used for the value in use calculations are set out in note 11 to these financial statements.
Current and deferred tax The Group is required to determine the corporate tax provision in each of the many jurisdictions in which it operates.
During the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate determination is uncertain.
As a result the Group recognises tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due.
The recognition of tax benefits and assessment of provisions against tax benefits requires management judgement.
In particular the Group is routinely subject to tax audits in many jurisdictions, which by their nature are often complex and can take several years to resolve.
Provisions are based on managements interpretation of country specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement, and have been calculated using the single best estimate of likely outcome approach.
Management takes advice from in-house tax specialists and professional tax advisors, and uses previous experience to inform its judgements.
To the extent that the outcome differs from the estimates made, tax adjustments may be required infuture periods.
The evaluation of recoverability of deferred tax assets requires judgements to be made regarding the availability of future taxable income.
Management therefore recognises deferred tax assets only where it believes it is probable that such assets will be realised, taking account of current levels of profitability and forecasts prepared for budgets and the Groups Medium Term Plan as referred to in the viability statement in the risk management section of the Strategic report.
73 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3.
Segmental reporting SSP operates in the food and beverage travel sector, mainly at airports and railway stations.
Management monitors the performance and strategic priorities of the business from a geographic perspective, and in this regard has identified the following four key reportable segments: the UK, Continental Europe, North America and the Rest of the World RoW.
The UKincludes operations in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland: Continental Europe includes operations in the Nordic countries, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Spain: North America includes operations in the United States and Canada: and RoW includes operations in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific and India.
These segments comprise countries which are at similar stages of development and demonstrate similar economic characteristics.
The Groups management assesses the performance of the operating segments based on revenue and underlying operating profit.
Interest income and expenditure are not allocated to segments, as they are managed by a central treasury function, which oversees the debt and liquidity position of the Group.
The non-attributable segment comprises costs associated with the Groups head office function and depreciation of central assets.
Revenue is measured in a manner consistent with that in the income statement.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the result for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the result for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year adjusted by potentially dilutive outstanding share options.

80 SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets The Group tests annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indicators that goodwill might be impaired.
This did not result in any impairment in the year 2016: nil.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these calculations are long-term growth rates and pre-tax discount rates and cash flow forecasts from the most recent financial budgets and three-year medium-term plan approved by management.
The cash flow forecast period is five years, which is based on managements budgets and three-year plan, a further year of assumed growth, followed by a final year showing a terminal value based on expectations of growth thereafter.
The key assumptions for these calculations are shown below: 2017 2016 Growth Discount Growth Discount 1 1 rate rate rate rate UK and Ireland 2.0% 7.2% 2.0% 6.6% Rail Gourmet 2.3% 7.1% 2.3% 6.5% France, Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg 2.3% 6.6% 2.3% 6.1% Germany, Switzerland and Austria 2.3% to 3.0% 6.6% to 7.2% 2.3% to 3.0% 6.0% to 6.2% Spain 2.3% 9.0% 2.3% 7.3% Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland 3.0% 6.7% to 7.2% 3.0% 6.2% to 6.9% North America 2.0% 6.5% 2.0% 5.8% Eastern Europe and Middle East 5.0% 12.2% 5.0% 11.1% Asia Pacific 5.0% 9.2% 5.0% 7.6% 1 The discount rates presented are post-tax discount rates.
The values applied to the key assumptions in the value in use calculations are derived from a combination of internal and external factors, based on past experience together with managements future expectations about business performance.
The pre-tax discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks relating to the country in which the CGU operates.
Sensitivity analysis Whilst management believe the assumptions are realistic, it is possible that an impairment would be identified if any of the above sensitivities were changed significantly.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on each of these key assumptions with the other variables held constant.
For each CGU, an increase of 0.5% in the discount rate or a decrease of 0.5% in the growth rate would not result in the carrying value for any CGU or any group of CGUs exceeding its recoverable amount.
Investments in associates The Group uses the equity accounting method to account for its associates, the carrying value of which was 6.8m as at 30 September 2017 2016: 9.3m.

12.4m of the Groups unrecognised deferred tax assets relate to the UK, with the balance relating to unrecognised deferred tax assets in overseas jurisdictions, mainly the US and certain countries in Europe.
The largest proportion of the unrecognised deferred tax assets relate to brought forward losses in territories where operations have been making tax losses for some time.
Profitability forecasts are reviewed carefully and used as the basis for considering the recognition of deferred tax assets although initial recognition of a deferred tax asset is not made until an entity is making taxable profits.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates based on the current repatriation policy of the Group and the fact that, given the current tax regimes in the countries in which the Group operates, no withholding or other tax should arise should the Group choose to remit the earnings of those subsidiaries, or should associates choosetoremit their earnings.
As such, no deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of undistributed earnings.

Post-employment benefit obligations Group The Group operates a number of post-employment benefit schemes including both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.
In respect of the defined contribution schemes, amounts paid during the year were 11.1m 2016: 9.0m across the Group.
There are no contributions outstanding at the balance sheet date.
The principal defined contribution scheme is called the SSP Group Pension Scheme.
The Group operates a combination of funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes across Europe, the respective net plan liabilities of which are presented below: 2017 2016 m m Funded schemes see a below 3.5 8.4 Unfunded schemes see b below 10.4 10.8 13.9 19.2 These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
The plans are administered by pension funds that are legally separate from the Group and are required to act in the best interests of the plan participants.
The Group expects to pay 1.0m in contributions to its defined benefit plans in 2018.
As at 30September 2017, the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation was 18.2 years 2016: 19.9 years.
Information disclosed below is aggregated by funded and unfunded schemes.
a Funded schemes The Group operates funded schemes in the UK and Norway.
In the UK, the Group participates in the Railways Pension Scheme RPS via the Rail Gourmet UK Limited Shared Cost Section RG section, which is a final salary scheme and provides benefits linked to salary at retirement or earlier date of leaving service.
The RG section covers permanent managerial, administrative and operational staff of Rail Gourmet UK Limited and is closed to new entrants.
The RG scheme was subject to its last full actuarial valuation by a qualified actuary as at 31 December 2016.
These results have been used by a qualified independent actuary in the valuation of the scheme as at 30 September 2017 for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The amounts shown for the prior year were based on a valuation of the scheme for the purposes of IAS 19 as prepared by an independent actuary using the full actuarial valuation as at 31 December 2013.
In 2016, it was agreed with the Trustees of the RPS that, from 1 January 2016, the employing company contributions would be 18.3% ofpensionable pay with members paying 12.2%.
In addition, it was agreed that from 1 January 2016 the employing company would make monthly lump sum contributions of 2,700.
At the most recent funding valuation of the RG scheme as at 31 December 2016 showed a funding level of 103.6%.
Accordingly the contributions that are being paid by the employing company are in respect of future service of current members.

Financial instruments continued Bank loans Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date.
Bank loans are categorised as level 2 financial liabilities, whereby inputs which are used in the valuation of these financial liabilities and have a significant effect on the fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Finance lease liabilities Fair value is based on the present value of the future lease payments, discounted at the rate implicit in the lease.
Other non-derivative financial instruments excluding bank loans Due to the short-term nature of non-derivative financial instruments excluding bank loans, the fair value is approximate to the carryingvalue.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments relate to interest rate swaps and are valued using relevant yield curves and exchange rates as at the balance sheet date.
Fair value hierarchy All derivative financial liabilities are categorised as level 2 under which the fair value is measured using the inputs other than quoted prices observable for the liability, either directly or indirectly.
c Credit risk The Groups concentration of credit risk in relation to trade receivables is not considered material.
The balances relate to a number of customers for whom there is no recent history of default.

In this regard, the treasury function is mandated by the Board to manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs.
The function has clear policies and operating parameters, and its activities are regularly reviewed by the Board to ensure compliance.
The function does not operate as a profit centre and speculative transactions are not permitted.
Financial instruments, including derivatives, are used on occasion to manage the main financial risks arising during the course of business.
These risks are liquidity risk and market risk and are discussed further below.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective in managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it can meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due.
Inorder to achieve this, the treasury department maintains an appropriate level of funds and facilities to meet each years planned fundingrequirement.

These are discussed further below.
Currency risk Although the functional currency of the Group is Sterling, the Groups operating cash flows are transacted in a number of different currencies.
The Groups policy in managing this financial currency risk is to use foreign currency denominated borrowings to ensure that interest costs arise in currencies that reflect the operating cash flows, thereby minimising net cash flows in foreign currencies.
As the mix of foreign currency cash flows generated by the business changes over time, there may be a requirement to restructure borrowings via financial instruments or other treasury products to maintain this hedge.
The Board reviews financial currency risk at least once a year.
The currency profile of the cash balances of the Group at 30 September 2017 was as follows: 2017 2016 Cash at bank and in hand m m Sterling 51.2 82.0 Other currencies 126.9 73.8 178.1 155.8 The Group applies hedge accounting to cover the risk of foreign exchange differences arising between the functional currency of the foreign operation and the Groups functional currency, i. e. Sterling.
The designated exchange risk is the spot foreign exchange risk because the hedging instruments are not derivatives, but foreign currency-denominated bank loans.
The fair value of the bank loans used as hedging instruments was 285.3m as at 30 September 2017 2016: 304.0m.
There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement arising from hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
No sensitivity analysis is provided in respect of currency risk as the Groups currency exposure mainly relates to translation risk as discussed above.
95 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 24.
Financial instruments continued e Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk The Group has entered into a series of interest rate swaps in order to hedge its interest rate exposure from its variable rate term loan facilities.
The impact of all of these transactions is reflected in the table below.
The interest rate and currency profile of the Groups bank loans at 30 September 2017, after taking into account interest rate swaps and before adjustment for unamortised bank fees of 3.6m 2016: 5.0m, was as follows: Floating-rate liabilities Fixed-rate liabilities Total 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m m m m m Currency Sterling 45.4 43.2 136.3 129.5 181.7 172.7 Euro 40.3 47.9 121.0 143.4 161.3 191.3 US Dollar 7.7 8.5 23.1 25.5 30.8 34.0 Swedish Krona 7.6 7.9 22.7 23.9 30.3 31.8 Norwegian Krone 10.6 11.7 31.9 35.2 42.5 46.9 India Rupee 5.5 0.3 5.8 117.1 119.2 335.3 357.5 452.4 476.7 Interest rate swaps All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating-rate interest amounts for fixed interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges to reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount accumulated in equity is reclassified to the income statement over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt affect the income statement.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps was 9.0m as at 30 September 2017 2016: 14.2m.
In 2017, credit of 1.2m 2016: debit of 6.7m was recognised in other comprehensive income representing the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps in the year.
There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement in eitheryear.
In 2017, a credit of 4.0m 2016: credit of 2.7m in other comprehensive income arose on the reclassification of the cumulative changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps to the income statement see note 7.
Sensitivity analysis A change of 50 basis points in interest rates at the balance sheet date would have increased decreased equity by the amounts in the table below.
This is driven by changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments.
At 30 September 2017, these were in fully effective hedge relationships and the movement would have had no impact on the income statement.
This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and has been applied to risk exposures existing at that date.
In addition, all other variables, in particular, foreign currency rates, have been assumed to remain constant.
2017 2016 m m Equity Increase 2.9 4.9 Decrease 2.9 5.0 f Capital management The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development.
The Groups capital is represented by the share capital and reserves as set out in note 21, retained earnings, and net debt see below.
The funding requirements of the Group are met by a mix of medium-term borrowings, short-term borrowings under its RCF and available cash as detailed in the table below.
During the year, the Group continued to monitor covenant compliance and has passed comfortably the requirements in its borrowing facilities.
As part of its banking arrangement, the Group has to comply with the financial covenants relating to Net Debt Cover and Interest Cover.
As at 30 September 2017, the Group had a leverage of 1.1x underlying LTM last 12 months EBITDA 2016: 1.6x.

The acquisition provides an entry point for the Group into the Indian market and the Group expects to benefit from TFS established strong local presence.
By virtue of the agreement with the other shareholders, the Group has control over TFS relevant activities including establishing budgets and operating plans, appointment of key management personnel and ongoing review of performance and reporting procedures and as such is consolidating TFS and its group companies.

The Board believe that the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of the net identifiable assets is best considered as goodwill on acquisition representing relationships with airports, extensive knowledge of the Indian travel catering market and future operating synergies.
Included in the 12 month period to 30 September 2017 is revenue of 65.2m and an operating profit of 12.9m in respect of TFS.
If the acquisition of TFS had been made at the beginning of the financial year, the estimated contribution to the results of the Group for the year ended 30 September 2017 would have been 78.0m to revenue and 15.1m to operating profit.
Obligation to acquire additional share of subsidiary undertaking The consideration payable for the additional 16% is based on a multiple of TFS 2018 Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation EBITDA and has been valued with reference to most recent financial statements and internal budgets and forecasts, discounted with a suitable discount rate and subject to a cap of 21.4m undiscounted at 30 September 2017 exchange rates.
The discount rate is pre-tax and reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and a specific risk premium relevant to the TFS business.
This discount rate is considered to be equivalent to the rate a market participant would use.
On acquisition, the Group recognised a financial liability of 18.9m in respect of its obligation to acquire a further 16% of TFS in 2018.
As at 30 September 2017 the financial liability was 20.9m.
This reflects the TFS updated assumptions on the forecasted 2018 EBITDA due to the business exceeding expectations compared to the time of the original acquisition, adjustments for the subsequent foreign exchange revaluation and the unwind of discounting.
Post balance sheet event On 17 October 2017 the Group completed an amend and extend of its existing debt facilities to: extend the final maturity date by two years from July 2020 to July 2022: reduce the margin on the debt and the Revolving Credit Facility by 25 basis points: and increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility by 100m to 150m.
