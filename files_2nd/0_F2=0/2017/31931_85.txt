The carrying value of deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities principally arising on the acquisition of Sky Deutschland was 296 million as at 30 June 2017 2016: 243 million.
The majority of the deferred tax asset relates to tax losses in the German and Austrian businesses, which can be carried forward indefinitely.
The Directors have concluded that it is probable that there will be sufficient future taxable profits against which the German and Austrian losses can be utilised, taking into account the Groups latest available four-year forecast, which was considered by the Companys Board of Directors, and extrapolated beyond the forecast period as disclosed in note 9.
The forecast shows that the Group will continue to benefit from the utilisation of the tax losses beyond the initial four-year forecasting period.
For further details regarding this judgement, please refer to the Groups critical accounting policies and the use of judgement and estimates section, contained in note 1.

At 30 June 2017, a deferred tax asset of 232 million 2016: 258 million has not been recognised in respect of capital losses related to the Groups former investment in KirchPayTV, on the basis that utilisation of these temporary differences is not probable.
At 30 June 2017, the Group also has capital losses with a tax value estimated to be 3 million 2016: 4 million including impairment of a football club and other investments, which have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset, on the basis that it is not probable that they will be utilised.
