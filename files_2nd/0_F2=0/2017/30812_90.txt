Additional disclosures Non-GAAP measures To supplement the presentation of the Groups results of operations and financial condition in accordance with IFRS, we also present several non-GAAP measures used by management to monitor the Groups performance.
The Groups management regularly reviews the measures used to assess and present the financial performance of the Group and, as relevant, its geographic segments.
Changes to non-GAAP measures in 2017 Due to the significant impact of the acquisition of Reynolds American, several of the non-GAAP measures are now presented on an organic basis: see Results on an organic basis below for further details.
Furthermore, in 2017, the Group has added an additional measure of Adjusted revenue, as items in revenue have met the Groups definition of an adjusting item following the acquisitions of certain tobacco assets of Bulgartabac andFDS, completed in 2017.
See Adjusted revenue below for further details.
The Group has ceased to report on free cash flow in 2017, presenting instead adjusted cash generated from operations and the operating cash flow conversion ratio, which are reviewed by management in its assessment of the Groups financial position and are metrics used for certain remuneration schemes.
Results on an organic basis Definition the performance of the business before inclusion of acquired entities.
The acquisition of Reynolds American, Bulgartabac, Winnington and Fabrika Duhana Sarajevo have impacted the Groups results in 2017.
BAT management reviews certain of its results, including volume, revenue, profit from operations, and non-GAAP measures including adjusted revenue and adjusted profit from operations, prior to the impact of acquisitions.
Although the Group does not believe that these measures are a substitute for IFRS measures, the Group does believe that such results excluding the impact of acquisitions provide additional useful information to investors regarding the underlying performance of the business on a comparable basis.
Accordingly, the organic financial measures appearing in this document should be read in conjunction with the Groups results as reported under IFRS.
We also present the growth in organic adjusted operating margin in 2017 compared to adjusted operating margin in 2016: 2017 organic adjusted operating margin represents the ratio of profit from operations before adjusting items and the impact of 2017 acquisitions to revenue before adjusting items and the impact of 2017 acquisitions.
Please see the following reconciliations of revenue to adjusted revenue and profit from operations to adjusted profit from operations.
Adjusted revenue Definition revenue before the impact of adjusting items.
To supplement BATs revenue presented in accordance with IFRS, the Group management board, as the chief operating decision maker, reviews adjusted revenue to evaluate the underlying business performance of the Group and its geographic segments.
The Group management board defines adjusted revenue as revenue before the impact of adjusting items, specifically the excise on bought-in goods that the Group will acquire and sell, for a limited period, will be recorded in accordance with IFRS as a cost of sale and within revenue, with a dilutive effect on operating margin.
Once the short-term arrangements cease, the goods will be manufactured by the Group, and the excise, in accordance with Group policy, will not be included in cost of sales or revenue leading to a reduction in revenue and improvement in operating margin that does not represent the underlying performance of the Group.
As such, the excise on bought-in goods meets the Groups definition of an adjusting item, as defined in note 1 in the Notes on the Accounts.
The Group management board also believes that adjusted revenue provides information that enables investors to better compare the Groups business performance across periods.
Adjusted revenue has limitations as an analytical tool.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure to adjusted revenue is revenue.
It is not a presentation made in accordance with IFRS, is not a measure of financial condition or liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to revenue as determined in accordance with IFRS.
Adjusted revenue is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
As a result, you should not consider this performance measure in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, BATs results as determined in accordance with IFRS.
The table below reconciles the Groups revenue to adjusted revenue for the periods presented, and to adjusted revenue at constant rates based on a retranslation of adjusted revenue for each year at the previous years exchange rates.
Refer to note 2 in the Notes on the Accounts for further discussion of the segmental results and for the reconciliation of adjusted revenue at current and constant rates of exchange to segmental revenue and to Group revenue for the year for the years ended 31 December 2017, 2016 and 2015.

To supplement BATs results from operations presented in accordance with IFRS, the Group management board, as the chief operating decision maker, reviews adjusted profit from operations to evaluate the underlying business performance of the Group and its geographic segments, to allocate resources to the overall business and to communicate financial performance to investors.
The Group also presents adjusted operating margin, which is defined as adjusted profit from operations as a percentage of adjusted revenue, as defined above.
Adjusted profit from operations and adjusted operating margin are not measures defined by IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure to adjusted profit from operations is profit from operations.
Adjusting items, as identified in accordance with the Groups accounting policies, represent certain items of income and expense which the Group considers distinctive based on their size, nature or incidence.
In identifying and quantifying adjusting items, the Group consistently applies a policy that defines criteria that are required to be met for an item to be classified as adjusting and provides details of items that are specifically excluded from being classified as adjusting items.
Adjusting items in profit from operations include restructuring and integration costs, amortisation of trademarks and similar intangibles, the fair value movement in stock on acquisition, a gain on deemed partial disposal of a trademark, and certain litigation.
The definition of adjusting items is explained within note 1in the Notes on the Accounts.
The Group management board believes that these additional measures are useful to investors, and are used by the Group management board as described above, because they exclude the impact of adjusting items in profit from operations, which have less bearing on the routine operating activities of the Group, thereby enhancing users understanding of underlying business performance.
The Group management board also believes that adjusted profit from operations provides information that enables investors to better compare the Groups business performance across periods.
Additionally, the Group management board believes that similar measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies comparable to the Group, many of which present an adjusted operating profit-related performance measure when reporting their results.
Adjusted profit from operations and adjusted operating margin have limitations as analytical tools.
They are not presentations made in accordance with IFRS, are not measures of financial condition or liquidity and should not be considered as alternatives to profit for the year, profit from operations or operating margin as determined in accordance with IFRS.
Adjusted profit from operations and adjusted operating margin are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
As a result, you should not consider these performance measures in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, BATs results of operations as determined in accordance with IFRS.
The table below reconciles the Groups profit from operations to adjusted profit from operations, and to adjusted profit from operations at constant rates based on a retranslation of adjusted profit from operations for each year, at the previous years exchange rates, and presents adjusted operating margin for the periods presented.
Refer to note 2 to the Groups consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the segmental results and for the reconciliation of adjusted profit from operations at current and constant rates of exchange to segmental profit from operations and to Group profit for the year for the years ended 31 December 2017, 2016 and 2015.

BAT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2017 219 Additional disclosures Non-GAAP measures continued Adjusted share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures Definition share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures before the impact of adjusting items.
To supplement BATs performance presented in accordance with IFRS, the Groups share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures is also presented before adjusting items as defined in note 1 to the Groups financial statements.
The Group management board believes that adjusted share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures provides information that enables investors to better compare the Groups business performance across periods.
The Group management board uses adjusted share of post-tax results from associates and joint ventures as part of the total assessment of the underlying performance of all the Groups business interests.
Adjusted share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures has limitations as an analytical tool.
It is not a presentation made in accordance with IFRS, is not a measure of financial condition or liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to the Groups share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures as determined in accordance with IFRS.
Adjusted share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
As a result, you should not consider this performance measure in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, BATs results of operations as determined in accordance with IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure to adjusted share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures is share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures.
A reconciliation is provided on page 125 within note 5 in the Notes on the Accounts.
Underlying tax rate Definition Tax rate incurred before the impact of adjusting items and to adjust for the inclusion of the Groups share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures within the Groups pre-tax results.
BAT management monitors the Groups underlying tax rate to assess the tax rate applicable to the Groups underlying operations, excluding the Groups share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures in BATs pre-tax results and adjusting items as defined in note 1 in the Notes on the Accounts.
Underlying tax rate is not a measure defined by IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure to underlying tax rate is the effective tax rate based upon profit before tax.
The Group management board believes that this additional measure is useful to investors, and is used by BAT management as described above, because it excludes the contribution from the Groups associates, recognised after tax but within the Groups pre-tax profits, and adjusting items, thereby enhancing users understanding of underlying business performance.
Underlying tax rate has limitations as an analytical tool.
It is not a presentation made in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to the effective tax rate as determined in accordance with IFRS.
Underlying tax rate is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
As a result, you should not consider this measure in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, the Groups effective tax rate as determined in accordance with IFRS.
The table below reconciles the Groups effective tax rate as determined in accordance with IFRS with underlying tax rate for the periods presented.

BAT management monitors adjusted diluted earnings per share, a measure which removes the impact of adjusting items, as defined in note 1 to the Groups consolidated financial statements, from diluted earnings per share.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share is used by management within the Groups incentive schemes, as reported within the remuneration report beginning on page 75 and reported in note 7 to the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The Group management board believes that this additional measure is useful to investors, and is used by BAT management as described above, as an indicator of diluted earnings per share before adjusting items.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be used in isolation from, or as a substitute for, diluted earnings per share as determined in accordance with IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure to adjusted diluted earnings per share is diluted earnings per share and a reconciliation is provided in note 7 in the Notes on the Accounts.
The definition of adjusting items is provided in note 1 in the Notes on the Accounts.
220 BAT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Results on a Constant Translational Currency Basis Movements in foreign exchange rates have impacted the Groups financial results.
The Group management board reviews certain of its results, @ including adjusted revenue, adjusted profit from operations, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted cash generated from operations, at constant rates of exchange.
The Group calculates these financial measures at constant rates of exchange based on a retranslation, at prior year exchange rates, of the current year results of the Group and, where applicable, its geographic segments.
The Group does not adjust for the normal transactional gains and losses in operations that are generated by exchange movements.
Although the Group does not believe that these measures are a substitute for IFRS measures, the Group management board does believe that such results excluding the impact of currency fluctuations year-on-year provide additional useful information to investors regarding the Groups operating performance on a local currency basis.
Accordingly, the constant rates of exchange financial measures appearing in the discussion of the Group results of operations beginning on page 33 should be read in conjunction with the information provided in note 2 in the Notes on the Accounts.
In 2017, 2016 and 2015, results were affected by translational exchange rate movements.
In 2017, at the prevailing exchange rates, adjusted @ revenue increased by 35.8%, adjusted profit from operations increased by 45.9% and adjusted cash generated from operations increased by 5.4% versus 2016.
At constant rates of exchange, adjusted revenue would have increased by 30.7%, adjusted profit from operations would @ have increased by 39.9% and adjusted cash generated from operations would have increased by 0.3%.
This higher growth rate at prevailing exchange rates reflects the translational benefit as a results on the relative weakness of the pound sterling.
In 2016, at the prevailing exchange @ rates, adjusted revenue increased by 12.6%, adjusted profit from operations increased by 9.8% and adjusted cash generated from operations fell by 7.5% versus 2015.
At constant rates of exchange, adjusted revenue would have increased by 6.9%, adjusted profit from operations @ would have increased by 4.1% and adjusted cash generated from operations would have fallen by 13.4%.
This higher growth rate at prevailing exchange rates reflects the translational benefit as a result of the relative weakness of the pound sterling.
In 2017, 2016 and 2015, adjusted diluted earnings per share was affected by translational exchange rate movements.
In 2017, the adjusted diluted earnings per share of 284.4p, an increase of 14.9%, would, when translated at 2016 exchange rates, have been 272.1p, an increase of 9.9%.
In 2016, the adjusted diluted earnings per share of 247.5p, an increase of 18.8%, would, when translated at 2015 exchange rates, have been 230.0p, an increase of 10.4%.
This higher growth rate, in 2017 and 2016, at prevailing exchange rates, reflects the translational benefit as a result of the relative weakness of the pound sterling.
In 2015, adjusted diluted earnings per share of 208.4p, an increase of 0.1%, would, when translated at 2014 exchange rates, have been 229.1p, an increase of 10.1%.
This lower growth rate, in 2015, at prevailing exchange rates reflects the negative translational effect as a result of the relative strength of the pound sterling.
@ Operating cash flow conversion ratio Definition net cash generated from operating activities before the impact of adjusting items, trading loan to a third party, pension shortfall funding, taxes paid, and after net capital expenditure and dividends from associates, as a proportion of adjusted profit from operations.
Operating cash flow conversion ratio is a measure of operating cash flow which is used within the Groups incentive schemes as reported within the remuneration report beginning on page 75.
Operating cash flow conversion ratio has limitations as an analytical tool.
It is not a presentation made in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to measures of liquidity or financial position as determined in accordance with IFRS.
Operating cash flow conversion ratio is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
As a result, you should not consider this measure in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, the Groups results of operations or cash flows as determined in accordance with IFRS.

Adjusted cash generated from operations is a measure of cash flow which is used by management to monitor the Groups financial position and is used within the Groups incentive schemes as reported within the remuneration report beginning on page 75.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure to adjusted cash generated from operations is net cash generated from operating activities.
The Group management board believes that this additional measure is useful to investors, and is used by BAT management as described above, because it excludes the impact of adjusting items on cash, includes the impact of capital expenditure given this is a core component of the underlying performance of the Group, the impact of financing or dividends received from associates which do not form part of the underlying performance of the Groups day-to-day operations.
This measure is presented as it enhances users understanding of underlying business performance.
The definition of adjusting items is provided in note 1 to the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Adjusted cash generated from operations is not a measure defined by IFRS and has limitations as an analytical tool.
