Fidessa group plc 67 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Fidessa group plc Fidessa or the Company is a company incorporated in England and Wales.
The financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 16th February 2018.
The consolidated financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Fidessas business activities and position in its market are described in the Overview, Business Model and Strategy, Market Review, Outlook and Risks and Uncertainties sections of the Strategic Report.
The financial position, cash flows and liquidity position are described in the Finance Review and the notes to the financial statements.
In addition, the notes to the financial statements include Fidessas objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives and its exposures to credit and liquidity risk.
Having reviewed the future plans and projections for the business, the principal risks that could impact on Fidessas liquidity and solvency over the next 12 months and its current financial position, the Board believes that Fidessa is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
Therefore, the Board has a reasonable expectation that Fidessa has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report.
For this reason, it continues to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS or IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
1 Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis with the exception of financial instruments which are stated in accordance with IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The following standards and amendments have been adopted for the first time in these financial statements, none of which had an impact on the consolidated or Companys financial statements: IAS7 Disclosure Initiative amendments.
IAS12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses amendments.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently in the consolidated and Company financial statements to all periods presented.
2 Significant accounting policies a Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Fidessa group plc and its subsidiaries.
There are no associates or joint ventures.
Subsidiaries are entities where the parent company has control over when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred until the date on which control ceases.
Intra-group balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Fidessa group plc 68 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued b Foreign currency i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
ii Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to sterling at rates approximating the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in the translation reserve.
Exchange gains and losses arising on the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are recognised in the translation reserve.
On disposal of a foreign entity the cumulative translation differences are recycled to the income statement and recognised as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
iii K ey foreign exchange rates The key foreign exchange rates used in the preparation of these financial statements are: 2017 2016 % change Currency Closing Average Closing Average Closing Average United States dollar 1.35 1.29 1.24 1.37 9% 5% Japanese yen 152.39 144.84 144.12 146.98 6% 1% With the exception of sterling, no currency other than those listed above comprised more than 5% of Group revenue.
c Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred at the acquisition date over the net recognised amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that are incurred in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
For acquisitions prior to 1st January 2010, transaction costs that were incurred in connection with a business combination were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
d Revenue Revenue represents the fair value for consideration received or receivable from customers for software services or product and related manpower, net of discounts and sales related taxes.
Revenue is only recognised where there is persuasive evidence that a contract exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is considered probable.
Fidessa group plc 69 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2 Significant accounting policies continued Recurring revenue is derived from the provision of software either as a hosted service or as a product.
Hosted services are charged on a subscription basis and the revenue is recognised pro-rata over the period that the service is provided.
Software products are provided as a rental licence with associated maintenance upgrades, updates, bug fixes and support and revenue is recognised pro-rata over the period of the licence.
Non-recurring revenue is the provision of manpower services for deployment, consultancy, reconfiguration support and training, in all cases being entirely related to Fidessas software services and products.
When the non-recurring items are chargeable on time and materials terms the relevant revenue is recognised as the work is performed.
When the non-recurring items are chargeable on fixed price terms the relevant revenue is recognised over the duration of the work in accordance with the estimated percentage complete, based on the anticipated number of days of effort for the deployment.
Full allowance is made for all known or expected losses.
Recurring and non-recurring services can be separately identified from the contracts and the fair value determined respectively.
Revenue arising from the provision of communications lines and market data which is sold as a part of the hosted service or rental licence and maintenance agreement, is recognised pro-rata over the period of the service.
Deferred revenue represents amounts invoiced to customers for services not yet supplied or rental periods not yet elapsed.
Accrued revenue represents amounts recognised as revenue for services provided that are to be invoiced in a future period.
e Share-based payments A number of equity-settled share plans are operated.
The fair value of the awards is recognised as an employee expense over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value of the awards is measured using a Black-Scholes model or binomial model simulation model, taking into account the terms and conditions of the awards.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards that vest except where forfeiture is only due to the share price not achieving the threshold for vesting.
f Post-employment benefits Certain subsidiaries operate defined contribution pension schemes for their employees.
Pension costs are charged to the income statement as they arise.
g Interest receivable Interest receivable on interest-bearing financial assets is recognised on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method.
The effective interest rate used reflects the anticipated cash flows to be received.
h Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences reverse based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Fidessa group plc 70 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
The Group has adopted the research and development expenditure credit regime RDEC.
As a result, research and development tax credits previously reported within the income tax expense are replaced by above the line research and development grants.
The grants are shown as deferred income as they are earned and are subsequently credited to income as a reduction in operating expenses over the period that the related development costs are amortised.
A corresponding other receivable is recognised at the time the grant is earned and will subsequently be offset against tax payable.
i Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment.
The cost is the purchase price of the goods received.
Purchased software that is integral to the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Furniture and equipment 3 5 years Leasehold improvements 5 10 years or remainder of lease if shorter Long leasehold buildings 25 years Computer equipment 3 5 years During the year the estimated useful economic lives for computer equipment and the fide minimis limit for capitalising property, plant and equipment have been reviewed and revised.
The updated useful economic lives are disclosed above and this change has been reflected within the charge for depreciation in 2017.
The impact of this change is an increase in operating costs of 393,000 in the year.
j Intangible assets Research and product development Expenditure on research into areas such as potential new technologies, methodologies and architectures is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Product development relates to the design, programming and testing of new and enhanced inter-related features in the product suite and the support and issue resolution of features already in the product suite.
There is a regular programme of releases that form part of a continual process of enhancements to and expansion of the overall product suite.
Product development expenditure relating to new and enhanced features is capitalised as an intangible asset so long as it is probable that the development will provide economic benefits, considering its commercial and technological feasibility, and resources are expected to be available for the development to complete.
The expenditure capitalised is the direct labour cost and it is managed and controlled centrally.
Product development expenditure relating to the support and issue resolution of features already in the product suite is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Capitalised product development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
Product development costs that have been capitalised are amortised on a straight-line basis over three years from the time that they are released and available for use.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the interest in identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired in a business combination.
Goodwill is stated at the amount recognised on acquisition less accumulated impairment.
Fidessa group plc 71 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2 Significant accounting policies continued Acquisition intangibles Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition and amortised over their estimated useful economic life.
Their carrying value is the fair value at acquisition less cumulative amortisation and impairments.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside of goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights.
The estimated useful lives of the intangible assets are as follows: Customer relationships 10 years Other intangible assets Other purchased intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairments.
The cost is the purchase price of the asset.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Software purchased for internal use is amortised over two years.
k Impairment of assets All non-current assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, except for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill which are reviewed annually.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount which is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units that are no larger than an operating segment for the purposes of impairment testing.
The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill relates is estimated and the carrying amount is tested annually for impairment or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
In an impairment test, the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit or asset is estimated to determine the extent of an impairment.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.
An impairment is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount.
In determining a cash generating units or assets value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the cash generating unit or asset that have not already been included in the estimate of future cash flows.
Except for goodwill impairments, a review is made at each reporting date of any previous impairment losses to assess whether they no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated and any previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to assess the recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased, subject to a limit of the assets net book value had no previous impairment loss been recognised.
Such reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Future depreciation or amortisation is then adjusted to allocate the assets revised carrying amount over its remaining useful economic life.
Impairments to goodwill cannot be reversed.
l Leased assets Where an operating lease is entered into the rentals are charged as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Fidessa group plc 72 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued m Investments and financial instruments Investments in subsidiary companies, which are all unquoted equity investments, are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
A financial instrument is recognised if Fidessa becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A financial asset is derecognised when contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or if the financial asset is transferred to another party without retaining control or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset.
A financial liability is derecognised when obligations specified in the contract expire or are discharged or cancelled.
Where financial guarantee contracts are created to guarantee the indebtedness of subsidiaries, they are considered to be insurance arrangements and are accounted for as such.
In this respect, the guarantee contract is treated as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that a payment will be required under the guarantee.
n Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently stated at amortised cost, their carrying value being reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
o Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
p Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently stated at amortised cost.
q Employee share trusts The trusts and share plan trustees, which purchase and hold shares in connection with employee share plans, are included in the financial statements and presented as a deduction from equity.
Any consideration paid or received by them for the purchase or sale of the shares is shown as a movement in equity.
r Provisions and contingent liabilities A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when a present legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material the provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows.
No provision is recognised when it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle an obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability and instead a contingent liability is disclosed.
3 Recent accounting developments At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards and amendments were issued but not yet mandatory and early adoption has not been applied.
IFRS15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
IFRS2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions amendments.
IFRS10 and IAS258 Sale of Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture amendments.
IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration.
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments.
Fidessa group plc 73 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 3 Recent accounting developments continued With the exception of IFRS15 and IFRS16 it is considered that the above standards and amendments will not have a significant effect on the consolidated or Company results or net assets.
The expected impact of IFRS15 is discussed further in note 4.
IFRS16 was published in January 2016 and will become effective in January 2019.
IFRS16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees.
A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.
There are optional exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low value items.
Lessor accounting remains similar to the current standard.
The Group has started to assess the potential impact of the adoption of IFRS16 on its consolidated financial statements.
4 Implementation of IFRS15 Revenue from contracts with customers IFRS15 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1st January 2018.
The Group will adopt IFRS15 for the first time in the year ending 31st December 2018 and will adopt the modified retrospective transition method with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard reflected as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of 1st January 2018.
Comparative prior periods will not be adjusted.
Accounting for revenue Revenue earned from contracts with customers will be recognised based on a five-step model which requires the transaction price for each identified contract to be apportioned to separate performance obligations arising under the contract and recognised either when the performance obligation in the contract has been performed point in time recognition or over time as control of the performance obligation is transferred to the customer.
Overall, the Group expects that adoption of IFRS15 will reduce brought forward retained earnings at January 1st 2018 by approximately 6,000,000.
This adjustment to brought forward retained earnings will unwind over a number of years.
Deployment revenue Deployment revenue is currently recognised on an estimated percentage of completion as the work is performed.
When identifying performance obligations, IFRS15 focuses on whether the customer can benefit from the service on its own.
The Group has assessed that deployment revenue is not a separate performance obligation and as such will be combined with the hosted service or rental licence with maintenance fee revenue and recognised over the term of the contract with the customer.
This will result in the Group recognising deployment revenue later and over a longer period, than under the current policy.
Revenue arising from deployment recognised in 2017 is 10,241,000.
Accounting for costs Costs incurred to implement software for customers are currently expensed as incurred.
Under IFRS15, contract fulfilment costs will be recognised as an expense consistent with the transfer of the related goods or services to the customer and will be amortised over the life of the initial term of the contract.
Balance sheet In addition to the impact on the consolidated income statement, the Group expects changes to the consolidated balance sheet, in particular, due to the deferral of deployment revenue, recognition of contract assets and the impact on retained earnings from the initial adoption of IFRS15.
Fidessa group plc 74 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 4 Implementation of IFRS15 Revenue from contracts with customers continued Key judgements: Rental licences and upgrades Recurring revenue is derived from the provision of software either as a hosted service or as a product.
Software products are provided as a rental licence, including the right to regular upgrades.
Under IFRS15, judgement is required when assessing whether the rental licence is a separate performance obligation from the provision of upgrades to the customer.
The Group has assessed that the ongoing updates and upgrades to the software are fundamental to the value of the software and that without these updates the value of the software will substantially deteriorate over time.
Therefore, the rental licence and the updates and upgrades will be combined as one performance obligation and revenue will be recognised over the life of the licence as the service is delivered.
Principal vs agent for data and connectivity In addition to software, the Group provides communications lines from Fidessa data centres to customer sites and from customers to exchange venues: and static and live market data where a third party is involved in the provision of services to a customer.
In assessing whether the Group is the principal or agent for the provision of these services, IFRS15 focuses on the transfer of control.
IFRS 15 determines an entity is the principal in a transaction if it obtains control of the specified goods or service before they are transferred to the customer.
The data and connectivity services are highly interrelated and integrated with the software, whether as a hosted service or a rental licence with updates and upgrades.
As such, the Group has assessed that the provision of these services forms part of a single performance obligation which is managed and provided through the Fidessa software and services and for which Fidessa is the principal.
Term for recognition of implementation revenue and fulfilment costs Judgement is required to determine the recognition period for deployment revenue and fulfilment costs.
IFRS15 requires that fulfilment costs are amortised on a systematic basis consistent with the pattern of the transfer of the goods or services to which the asset relates.
Deployments of Fidessas software and services are tailored to individual customer needs and upon renewal services are often amended to reflect the ongoing requirements of our customers business.
Accordingly, the Group has assessed that it is appropriate to recognise both the deployment revenue and fulfilment costs on a straight-line basis over the life of the term of the contract.
5 Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions take account of the circumstances and facts at the period end, historical experience of similar situations and other factors that are believed to be reasonable and relevant, the results for which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.
Actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.
The principal estimates and judgements are summarised below.
This summary is not a list of all uncertainties, estimates and judgements encountered and others could arise that cause a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets or liabilities.
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations which are dealt with separately below, that the directors have made in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Fidessa group plc 75 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 5 Accounting estimates and judgements continued a Product development expenditure Fidessa invests on a continual basis in the development of new and enhanced features in the product suite.
Therefore, judgement is required in determining the practice for capitalising development costs.
Judgement is required in assessing whether the development costs meet the criteria for capitalisation and in determining that amounts capitalised continue to be supported by future net cash flows.
These estimates and judgements have been applied consistently year to year.
The accounting policy for research and product development is in note 2j and the carrying value of product development capitalised and the amounts capitalised and amortised in the year are detailed in note 14.
The following are the estimates and assumptions that the directors have made that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
b Revenue Fidessas recurring revenue model means that the majority of revenue is recognised on a systematic basis over the life of the licence.
However, at any time there is likely to be a limited number of deployments and contract amendments underway where there is uncertainty over the value of revenue to recognise or defer.
In these situations a range of factors relevant to the situation are considered in order to determine the value of revenue recognised or deferred.
These factors typically include the contractual terms, delivery progress and anticipated remaining effort required, technical complexity and risk, uncertainties still to be resolved and the customers circumstances.
c Income taxes Fidessa operates internationally and therefore spans a number of tax jurisdictions.
In recognising income tax assets and liabilities estimates have to be made of the likely outcome of decisions by tax authorities on transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain and on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The circumstances to which the estimates and judgements apply and their application has been consistent year to year.
In determining the level of accruals and provisions to be recognised in respect of any potential exposures for various tax liabilities, the directors make estimates of the level of taxes payable, particularly in relation to transfer pricing, non-deductible items and outcomes of tax disputes.
The tax obligations, if audited by the tax authorities at a future date, may differ as a result of alternative interpretations.
These differences may also impact the level of accruals and provisions recognised.
d Fair values IFRSs require many assets, liabilities and expenses to be recognised at fair value.
This includes intangible assets note 14 and share-based payments note 20.
Where open market values are not available the fair values are estimates and therefore subject to assumptions and a wide range of interpretation.
e Impairment of goodwill The determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired requires a calculation to be made of the value in use of the cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated and this calculation to be compared to the carrying value of the cash generating unit.
The value in use calculation includes estimates of the future financial performance of the cash generating unit, the discount rate to apply to projected future cash flows, long-term operating margins and long-term growth rates note 14.
Variations in these estimates could result in a material variance in the value in use resulting from the calculation.
Fidessa group plc 76 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 5 Accounting estimates and judgements continued f Expected useful lives The carrying value of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment and the respective amortisation and depreciation of these assets is affected by the assumptions made in determining the expected useful lives of the assets.
A judgement has been made of the useful life of each category of asset and this judgement has been applied consistently year to year.
The amortisation and depreciation periods are detailed in notes 2i and 2j and the carrying value of the assets along with the amounts capitalised, amortised and depreciated in the year are detailed in notes 13 and 14.
6 Segment reporting Fidessa is structured into two business units: Sell-side and Buy-side.
The Sell-side business unit provides solutions and tools to support the trading of cash equities and derivatives globally.
The solutions are scalable from the largest to the smallest operations in the sector.
The Buy-side business unit provides the systems to cover every stage of the investment process for all asset classes.
The systems are used by the largest investment managers in the world, as well as some of the boutique and hedge funds.
Both business units leverage the connectivity and market data infrastructure.
The Operating Board monitors the performance of the business units and the overall group.
It monitors operating profit adjusted to exclude amortisation of acquired intangibles, product development capitalisation and amortisation and research and development expenditure credits, which is not an IFRS measure.
Finance income and assets and liabilities are not reported by business unit.
No single customer accounts for more than 5% of revenue.
Recurring revenue reflects the periodic fees for software and related services that is charged on a rental or subscription basis.
Non-recurring revenue comprises the consultancy fees for implementation, configuration and ongoing support activity.

The effective tax rate is higher than the UKs headline tax rate due to the geographic mix of countries in which Fidessa operates.
Several of these countries have headline tax rates that are greater than that in the UK, the two resulting in the greatest variance for Fidessa being the US and Japan.
The US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on 22nd December 2017, reducing the statutory rate of US federal corporate income tax from 35% to 21% with effect from 1st January 2018.
The US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is expected to positively impact Fidessas future after tax earnings, primarily because of the reduced tax rate.
Fidessa group plc 81 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 10 Income tax expense continued The value of Fidessas US deferred tax assets has reduced by 1,749,000 in 2017 as a result of the reduced statutory rate of US federal corporate income tax rate: this is included in the change in tax rates movement in the reconciliation of effective tax rate.
The revaluation has resulted in a one-off charge of 1,749,000 to Group profit after tax, representing a one-off 3.4% increase to the effective tax rate.
The primary influences on Fidessas effective tax rate are changes in headline tax rates and tax disallowances or incentives in the countries operated in.
This is reflected by the correlation between Fidessas effective tax rate and the UK headline tax rate since 2010.
Excluding the reduction in the value of the US deferred tax assets in 2017, the effective tax rate has decreased from 30.1% in 2010 to 25.2% in 2017, and in the same period the UK headline tax rate has fallen from 28.0% to 19.25%.
These are expected to continue to be the primary influences on the effective tax rate into the future.
Fidessa continues to recognise certain provisions and accruals in respect of tax which involve a degree of estimation and uncertainty, including those related to transfer pricing, when the tax treatment cannot finally be determined until accepted by the relevant tax authority.
Adjustments relating to prior year provisions and accruals arise from the resolution of specific uncertainties and the remaining risks are appropriately reflected in the recognised provisions and accruals.
The UK government has reduced the UK corporation tax rate to 19% with effect from 1st April 2017 and to 17% with effect from 1st April 2020.

Annual impairment tests are conducted on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the estimated recoverable amount of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
Value in use calculations are used to estimate the recoverable amount of cash generating units.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are the discount rate applied, future growth rate of the revenue and the operating margin.
These take into account the existing customer base and expected revenue commitments from it, anticipated additional sales to existing and new customers, planned expansion of the product and service offerings to the marketplace and the specific market trends that are currently seen and those expected in the future.
The whole of the goodwill carrying value is allocated to the Buy-side business unit and arose from the acquisition of LatentZero in 2007.
It resulted from the value of the assembled workforce, the synergistic nature of the acquisition due to the long-term cross-selling opportunities between the buy-side and sell-side clients, potential cost savings, the expected future growth and the acceleration of operations into the buy-side.
A cash flow forecast is prepared for the following year which is extended to subsequent years based on the estimated growth rate which reflects a reasonable future rate for the business after considering recent trading experience, the benefits of the recurring revenue model, assessing the market opportunities and threats and the potential expansion of the addressable market.
The cash flow forecast is discounted by the discount rate which is arrived at after estimating the general risk premium and the specific risk premium for the cash generating unit, current gilt rates and the businesss beta factor.
The value in use calculation, for the purposes of the impairment review, used the anticipated results from the detailed forecast for the first year followed by 2.5% 2016: 4% per annum growth in 2019 and 2020 and 4% 2016: 4% for the next seven years and concluded with a terminal growth rate of 2.5% 2016: 2%.
The terminal growth rate is based on a forecast inflation assumption for the UK and US.
The expected useful life is materially greater than ten years and the growth rates applied are considered to reflect a likely average long-term growth rate for the products and services in the addressable market.
The break-even terminal growth rate is 0.7%.
A discount rate of 10.1% pre-tax 2016: 9.5% was applied to the cash flow forecast.
The discount rate included increased estimates of the general and specific risk premiums, an increase in the beta factor and a fall in gilt rates.
The value in use calculation resulted in an estimated recoverable amount that was 36% 2016: 40% greater than the carrying value and exceeded it by 19.5 million 2016: 21.6 million.
Revised calculations of the estimated recoverable amount were undertaken to consider sensitivities for a higher discount rate, to reflect forecasting uncertainty associated with the medium term growth rates.
The higher discount rate sensitivity calculation showed a break-even discount rate of 12.9%.
The results of these sensitivity calculations supported the conclusion that the goodwill had not been impaired.

Fidessa has unrecognised tax losses of 2,769,000 2016: 1,545,000 arising in subsidiaries that are at early stage development.
The tax losses may be available for use by offset against future taxable profits in the subsidiaries in which the losses arise.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these tax losses as the availability and timing of future profits in these subsidiaries cannot be determined with sufficient certainty.
There are temporary differences which arise in relation to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
Since Fidessa is able to control dividend distributions from these companies it is unlikely that further UK tax on repatriation of these earnings will be payable in the foreseeable future.
Consequently no deferred tax liability has been provided.

Fidessa group plc 89 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 17 Share capital and reserves continued Merger reserve The merger reserve arises from the acquisition of LatentZero Limited in 2007.
The merger reserve represents the excess of the fair value over the nominal value of shares issued to acquire at least 90% equity interest in an acquiree company.
A purchaser company acquiring at least 90% equity interest in an acquiree company under an arrangement which provides for the allotment of equity shares by the purchaser in return for the equity interest in the acquiree must apply Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.
When applicable, the section requires that the premium on the issue of equity shares by the purchaser company be disregarded.
Accordingly, a premium was not recorded on the shares issued but a merger reserve was recognised in the consolidated balance sheet.
Cumulative translation adjustment The cumulative translation adjustment comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations.

Fidessa group plc 91 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 20 Share-based payments Fidessa has share plans whereby employees are granted awards over ordinary shares that are subject to the vesting terms of each plan.
The PSP, DABP and MSPP were approved by shareholders at the 2011 Annual General Meeting.
Each plan was approved by 99% of the votes cast and no votes were withheld.
The MSPP and, in the UK, the award of matching shares under the SIP were implemented in 2012 and are relevant to the majority of employees.
The first award under the DABP was made in 2012 and the first award under the PSP was made in 2014.
These plans replaced the CSOP, EGRIP and SBP from which the last awards were in 2010.
The final awards from the CSOP expired in 2017.
Performance Share Plan PSP This is structured as a grant of conditional shares with a zero exercise price.
The maximum for an employee in any year are awards over shares with a total market value of 500,000.
The vesting period is four years from the date of grant.
The plan has a performance condition based on adjusted basis earnings per share.
In 2017 the adjustment for PSP performance purposes amounted to 3,507,000 2016: 584,000 and the adjusted basic earnings per share was 102.1p 2016: 95.0p.
Adjustments totalling 3,507,000 in 2017 included: 1,560,000 in respect of one-off costs associated with the relocation of the main US office to New Jersey, net of tax at the US headline rate of 40%, 1,749,000 in respect of the write off of US Deferred Tax assets following the enactment of US tax reforms in December 2017 and 198,000 of amortisation of acquisition intangibles, net of tax.
The adjustment in 2016 related entirely to amortisation of acquisition intangibles.
The awards vest based on the satisfaction of an earnings per share growth performance condition, which requires the cumulative four year adjusted basic earnings per share to be greater than the equivalent total achieved by applying the annual growth rates in the table below to the base earnings per share year preceding date of grant.
At the lower threshold, 25% of an award vests with a straight-line scale to 100% vesting at the higher threshold.
Compound annual growth in EPS % of award vesting Less than 8% 0% 8% 25% Between 8% and 15% Between 25% and 100% Greater than 15% 100% In addition to the earnings per share based performance condition, in the event that the total shareholder return is below that of the FTSE techMARK Index over the performance period, the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to scale back awards if it feels the level of vesting based on the earnings per share performance is, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, inappropriate.
The awards have to be called for by an employee normally within three years of vesting, thereby giving a maximum seven years life from grant.
However, in some jurisdictions the awards have to be exercised on vesting.
The shares can be satisfied by either new issue or market purchases.
A clawback provision applies to the plan for reasons of financial misstatement.
The PSP allows early vesting where a participants employment ceases due to death, injury, disability, the participants employer no longer being part of the Fidessa group or the Remuneration Committee so decides due to a reason similar in nature to those stated.
Pro-rating rules apply to restrict the number of shares in early vesting situations.
The duration of the plan is 10 years from approval at the 2011 Annual General Meeting and a mid-term review took place in 2016.
Fidessa group plc 92 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 20 Share-based payments continued Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DABP Under Part A of this plan, participants receive a proportion of their annual bonus in the form of deferred shares instead of cash.
Under Part B of this plan, participants are only eligible to receive a one-off conditional award to acquire shares on or shortly following their joining Fidessa.
The market value of shares over which a Part B award is granted may not exceed 200% of annual salary.
The shares vest to the employee after three years subject to continued employment with Fidessa through the period and, in the case of Part B, subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions applied by the Remuneration Committee.
The DABP allows early vesting where a participants employment ceases due to death, injury, disability, the participants employer no longer being part of the Fidessa group or the Remuneration Committee so decides due to a reason similar in nature to those stated.
Share Incentive Plan SIP The plan is only available to participants who are resident in the UK for tax purposes due to the tax incentives associated with the SIP.
Relevant employees are able to purchase up to 125 per month.
Trust purchases of shares take place once a month and after three years an equal number of matching free shares are applied so long as there is continued employment throughout.
In the event that a participant ceases to be a Fidessa employee prior to the third anniversary of each purchase the matching shares that have not yet reached their third anniversary of purchase are forfeited.
Monthly Share Purchase Plan MSPP The MSPP follows principles similar to the UK tax approved SIP and applies to the majority of employees across multiple countries.
The MSPP operates alongside the SIP in the UK with the MSPP being used for any higher levels of monthly purchase.
Employees are able to purchase up to a set value of shares each month into a trust.
Trust purchases of shares take place once a month and in September of the third calendar year following the employees contribution an equal number of matching free shares are applied so long as there has been continued employment throughout.
The MSPP allows early vesting where a participants employment ceases due to death, injury, disability, the participants employer no longer being part of the Fidessa group or the Board so decides due to a reason similar in nature to those stated.
Company Share Option Plan 2006 CSOP This plan was introduced in 2006 and the last grant was made in 2010.
Market price share options granted under this plan are subject to a performance condition that requires the cumulative four year adjusted diluted earnings per share to be greater than the equivalent total achieved by applying an annual growth rate of 5% to the adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year preceding grant.
Fidessa group plc 93 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 20 Share-based payments continued Dilution limits The total permitted dilution across the PSP, DABP, MSPP and SIP is 10% in the 10 years commencing 6th May 2011 or 7% in the first five years of operation of these plans.
In addition, the potential dilution from awards granted in a calendar year cannot exceed 1.6%.
As at 31st December 2017 the maximum potential dilution from awards granted across these plans to date is 2.87%.
Fair values and awards outstanding All share plan awards are over ordinary shares.
The fair value of awards is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The expense is recognised equally over the time from grant until vesting.
For share awards under the DABP, MSPP, SIP and PSP the fair value has been measured using a Black-Scholes model.
The expected volatility was based on the historic volatility adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility.
The inputs to and output from the model are listed below: Granted Granted Granted Granted Granted Granted DABP in 2012 in 2013 in 2014 in 2015 in 2016 in 2017 Fair value 1645p 1941p 2517p 1934p 2333p 2573p to 2303p Share price at grant 1645p 1941p 2517p 1934p 2333p 2573p to 2303p Expected volatility 30% 28% 28% 28% 31% 35% Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Expected dividends per annum 3.8% 4.6% 4.6% 4.5% 4.0% 3.8% Granted Granted Granted Granted Granted Granted MSPP in 2012 in 2013 in 2014 in 2015 in 2016 in 2017 Fair value 1176p 1356p 1823p 1585p 1551p 1841p to 1505p to 1952p to 2283p to 2071p to 2286p to 2217p Share price at grant 1305p 1554p 2088p 1801p 1824p 2108p to 1719p to 2160p to 2660p to 2435p to 2563p to 2588p Expected volatility 30% 28% 28% 28% 31% 36% Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Expected dividends per annum 3.8% 4.6% 4.6% 4.5% 4.0% 3.8% Granted Granted Granted Granted Granted Granted SIP in 2012 in 2013 in 2014 in 2015 in 2016 in 2017 Fair value 1330p 1587p 2089p 1791p 1876p 2133p to 1664p to 2262p to 2590p to 2405p to 2490p to 2617p Share price at grant 1330p 1587p 2089p 1791p 1876p 2133p to 1664p to 2262p to 2590p to 2405p to 2490p to 2617p Expected volatility 30% 28% 28% 28% 31% 36% Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Expected dividends per annum 3.8% 4.6% 4.6% 4.5% 4.0% 3.8% Fidessa group plc 94 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 20 Share-based payments continued Granted Granted PSP in 2014 in 2016 Fair value 1940p 1921p to 2126p Share price at grant 2555p 2415p Expected volatility 28% 31% Expected life 4-6 years 4-6 years Expected dividends per annum 4.6% 4.0% Awards under the CSOP subsisting at 31st December 2017 were: Options Options Vested at 1st at 31st at 31st January Exercised Expired December Exercise December Remaining Grant year 2017 in year in year 2017 price p 2017 life 2010 80,397 79,897 500 1421p 0 years For CSOP options exercised in 2017 the weighted average share price at the time of exercise was 2288p 2016: 2402p.

The total remuneration of the directors was 1,682,000 2016: 1,766,000.
The remuneration of directors and other members of key management during the year was as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 Short-term employee benefits 5,716 5,622 Post-employment benefits 38 47 Equity compensation benefits 701 402 Total remuneration of directors and key management 6,455 6,071 22 Financial risk management The use of financial instruments is managed under policies and procedures approved by the Board.
These policies are designed to reduce the financial risks being faced, which primarily relate to credit, interest, liquidity and currency risks, and arise in the normal course of business.
Credit risk Financial instruments which potentially expose Fidessa to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
The largest customer accounts for less than 5% of revenue and the 10 largest customers account for less than 30% of revenue.
Cash equivalents are deposited only with major financial institutions that satisfy certain credit criteria as specified in Fidessas treasury policy.
The policy limits the maximum deposit with a counterparty and the maximum duration of a deposit.
The trade receivables as at 31st December are aged as in the table below.
2017 2016 000 000 Not due 55,660 49,097 Not more than three months past due 12,481 12,954 More than three months but not more than six months past due 227 2,346 More than six months past due 1,805 2,350 Total trade receivables 70,173 66,747 Fidessa group plc 97 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 22 Financial risk management continued Material trade receivable balances relate to sales transactions with financial institutions.
Credit to customers is provided in the normal course of business and the amount that appears in the balance sheet is net of an allowance for specific doubtful receivables, the allowance generally being due to concerns regarding a customers solvency or the age of a receivable.
Allowances are made when the settlement of a receivable becomes doubtful and the potential exposure is not covered by a related amount in deferred revenue.
The movement in the allowance for doubtful receivables is in the table below.
2017 2016 000 000 Allowance for doubtful receivables at 1st January 1,348 1,089 Exchange adjustment 106 212 Allowances utilised in the period 712 376 New allowances made in the period 424 423 Allowance for doubtful receivables at 31st December 954 1,348 Liquidity risk The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities.

Interest receivable and payable Fidessa holds net funds and hence its interest risks are associated with short-term cash deposits.
The overall objective with respect to these deposits is to maintain a balance between security of the funds, accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return.
In practice, this means that deposits are unlikely to be made with a maturity date greater than three months.
All deposits are at current market rates.
There are no borrowings due to the cash reserves and strong cash generation of the business.
Fidessa group plc 98 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22 Financial risk management continued Foreign currency risk Fidessa operates internationally and is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and on the translation of the balance sheet and income statement of foreign operations into sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the United States dollar and the Japanese yen.
Revenue is split 59% in US dollars, 27% in sterling, 5% in yen and 9% in other currencies.
The trade debtor currency exposure is consistent with the split of revenue by currency.
In managing currency risks the aim is to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the cash inflows and outflows in a foreign currency.
There are both cash inflows and outflows in these currencies that create a high level of natural hedge.
Hedging contracts have not been entered into for cash positions denominated in foreign currencies.
Over the longer term, permanent changes in foreign exchange would have an impact on consolidation of foreign subsidiaries earnings.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in the value of sterling against other currencies would have decreased the profit before tax by approximately 795,000 for the year ended 31st December 2017 2016: 747,000.
Capital management The Board monitors the total equity, distributable reserves and the cash and cash equivalents balance in considering its retained capital along with when and how a return of capital to shareholders is appropriate.
A strong capital base is maintained so as to provide employee, customer, market, investor and creditor confidence in the business and to ensure that it continues to operate as a going concern.
Fidessa has strong cash generation due to being consistently profitable and non-acquisitive in nature.
The annual dividends paid during 2017 represented 47.0% 2016: 42.9% of the profit for the year attributable to shareholders.
This provides a reasonable return to shareholders whilst also providing funds for potential acquisitions and replenishing the cash balance.
However, in the absence of acquisitions, Fidessa has a track record of returning the additional cash to shareholders in the form of special dividends.
Fair values Unless otherwise disclosed, there is no significant difference between the carrying values shown in the balance sheet and the fair values of the financial instruments.
For current trade and other receivables and payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the amortised cost is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Fidessa does not have any derivative financial instruments and therefore no analysis is required in respect of financial instruments not measured at fair value.
Fidessa group plc 99 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 23 Operating leases At 31st December the outstanding commitments under non-cancellable operating leases were as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 Less than one year 20,069 19,976 Between one and five years 56,456 54,228 More than five years 56,447 68,408 Total commitment under operating leases 132,972 142,612 Office space and data centre facilities are leased under operating leases.
