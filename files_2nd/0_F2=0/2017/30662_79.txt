Structured entities Accounting policy A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity.
Contractual arrangements determine the rights and therefore relevant activities of the structured entity.
Structured entities are generally created to achieve a narrow and well-fide ned objective with restrictions around their activities.
Structured entities are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between the Group and the structured entity indicates the Group has power over the contractual relevant activities of the structured entity, is exposed to variable returns, and can use that power to affect the variable return exposure.
In determining whether to consolidate a structured entity to which assets have been transferred, the Group takes into account its ability to direct the relevant activities of the structured entity.
These relevant activities are generally evidenced through a unilateral right to liquidate the structured entity, investment in a substantial proportion of the securities issued by the structured entity or where the Group holds speci c subordinate securities that embody certain controlling rights.
The Group may further consider relevant activities embedded within contractual arrangements such as call options which give the practical ability to direct entity, special relationships between the structured entity and investors, and if a single investor has a large exposure to variable returns of the structured entity.
Signifi cant accounting judgement Signi cant judgement is required in determining control over structured entities.
The purpose and design of the entity is considered, along with a determination of what the relevant activities are of the entity and who directs these.
Further judgements are made around which investor is exposed to, and absorbs the variable returns of the structured entity.
The Group will have to weigh up all of these facts to consider whether the Group, or another involved party, is acting as a principal in its own right or as an agent on behalf of others.
Judgement is further required in the ongoing assessment of control over structured entities, speci cally if market conditions have an effect on the variable return exposure of different investors.
The Group has involvement with both consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities, which may be established by the Group as a sponsor or by a third party.
Interests in consolidated structured entities: A structured entity is consolidated into the Groups financial statements where the Group controls the structured entity, as per the determination in the accounting policy above.

Structured entities continued The following table presents the Groups interests in consolidated structured entities: 2017 2016 $million $million Aircraft and ship leasing 5,494 5,623 Structured and Principal finance 2,534 2,809 1 Total 8,028 8,432 1 The Groups disclosure of its interests in consolidated structured entities as at 31 December 2016 has increased by $1.3 billion previously disclosed as $7.2 billion following a review of the population.
These interests have historically been included within the Groups results but not separately disclosed as relating to structured entities Interests in unconsolidated structured entities: Unconsolidated structured entities are all structured entities that are not controlled by the Group.
The Group enters into transactions with unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of business to facilitate customer transactions and for speci c investment opportunities.
An interest in a structured entity is contractual or non-contractual involvement which creates variability of the returns of the Group arising from the performance of the structured entity.
The table below presents the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities recognised in the financial statements relating to variable interests held in unconsolidated structured entities, the maximum exposure to loss relating to those interests and the total assets of the structured entities.
Maximum exposure to loss is primarily limited to the carrying amount of the Groups on-balance sheet exposure to the structured entity.
For derivatives, the maximum exposure to loss represents the on-balance sheet valuation and not the notional amount.
For commitments and guarantees, the maximum exposure to loss is the notional amount of potential future losses.

These interests have historically been included within the Groups results, but not separately disclosed as relating to structured entities The main types of activities for which the Group utilises unconsolidated structured entities cover synthetic credit default swaps for managed investment funds including specialised Principal finance funds, portfolio management purposes, structured finance and asset backed securities.
These are detailed as follows: Principal finance fund: The Groups exposure to Principal finance funds represents committed or invested capital in unleveraged investment funds, primarily investing in pan-Asian infrastructure, real estate and private equity Structured finance: Structured finance comprises interests in transactions that the Group or, more usually, a customer has structured, using one or more structured entities, which provide bene cial arrangements for customers.
The Groups exposure primarily represents the provision of funding to these structures as a financial intermediary, for which it receives a lenders return.
The transactions largely relate to the provision of aircraft leasing and ship finance 279
