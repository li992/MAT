Taxation Accounting policy Income tax payable on pro ts is based on the applicable tax law in each jurisdiction and is recognised as an expense in the period in which pro ts arise.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted as at the balance sheet date, and that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable pro t will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Where permitted deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset on an entity basis and not by component of deferred taxation.
Current and deferred tax relating to items which are charged or credited directly to equity, is credited or charged directly to equity and is subsequently recognised in the income statement together with the current or deferred gain or loss.
Signifi cant accounting estimates and judgements Determining the Groups tax charge for the year involves estimation and judgement, which includes an interpretation of local tax laws and an assessment of whether the tax authorities will accept the position taken.
These judgements take account of external advice where appropriate, and the Groups view on settling with tax authorities The Group provides for current tax liabilities at the best estimate of the amount that is expected to be paid to the tax authorities where an out ow is probable.
In making its estimates the Group assumes that the tax authorities will examine all the amounts reported to them and have full knowledge of all relevant information The recoverability of the Groups deferred tax assets is based on managements judgement of the availability of future taxable pro ts against which the deferred tax assets will be utilised The following table provides analysis of taxation charge in the year: 2017 2016 $million $million The charge for tax based upon the pro t for the year comprises: Current tax: United Kingdom corporation tax at 19.25 per cent 2016: 20 per cent : Current tax charge on income for the year 10 Adjustments in respect of prior years including double tax relief 1 74 Foreign tax: Current tax charge on income for the year 977 786 Adjustments in respect of prior years 13 84 965 806 Deferred tax: Origination reversal of temporary differences 156 136 Adjustments in respect of prior years 26 70 182 206 Tax on pro ts on ordinary activities 1,147 600 1 Effective tax rate 47.5% nm Tax on pro ts on ordinary activities excluding the impact of US Tax Reform 927 600 1 Effective tax rate excluding the impact of US Tax Reform 38.4% nm 1 Not meaningful as the tax charge is greater than pro t before tax Standard Chartered 222 Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Directors report Risk review and capital review FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Supplementary information 10.
Taxation continued The US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, effective from 1 January 2018, reduces the US corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent and introduces a Base Erosion and Anti Abuse Tax.

The evaluation of uncertain tax positions involves an interpretation of local tax laws which could be subject to challenge by a tax authority, and an assessment of whether the tax authorities will accept the position taken.
The Group does not currently consider that the assumptions or judgements made in assessing tax liabilities have a signi cant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next financial year.
