We also instructed our complete and further adjustments had been identified.

including the associated control deficiencies that were identified, isset out on pages 148 and 149.
Taking the above into account, consistent with our original audit plan, we instructed our component audit team in Italy Our audit focussed on evaluating the impact on the financial to perform a full scope audit on the reporting units complete statements and addressing the risk of similar issues in other financial information, and evaluated the component teams work.
In addition, we performed a significant level of oversight, with senior members of the group engagement team spending time in Italy during the planning, execution and completion phases of the component audit.
As part of these oversight activities, we were involved in the component audit teams risk assessment to identify significant risks of material misstatement, evaluated the appropriateness of the audit procedures to be performed by the component team to respond to the identified significant risks, reviewed certain working papers of the component audit team to evaluate the work performed and held regular meetings with our component audit team and with local, Global Services and Group management to consider the component teams audit work and findings.
Our component team in Italy also specifically tested the prior year revisions and the specific items recorded.
As a result of our work, we satisfied ourselves that the adjustments posted by management following the investigation are materially appropriate.
We also considered the appropriateness of the disclosures made by management in the financial statements, in particular in note 1 and determined that they provided an adequate explanation of the issue and the results of managements investigation.
How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls including those performed at the groups shared service centres, and the industry.
The group comprises a number of reporting units, in both the UK and overseas, which relate to the geographic markets in which the group operates.
The groups accounting process is structured around a finance function in each of the reporting units who are supported by one of the groups shared service centres.
The reporting units are responsible for their own accounting records and controls and report to the head office finance team in London through an integrated consolidation system.
In establishing the overall approach to the group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at reporting units by us, as the group engagement team, or component auditors from other PwC network firms operating under our instruction including PwC UK for EE.
Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.
Forthree reporting units the main BT UK trading company British Telecommunications plc, EE and Italy an audit of the complete financial information was performed.
These accounted for over 80% of the groups revenue and the groups profit before tax.
Infour reporting units Germany, Ireland, Spain and the US specific audit procedures on revenue and related balance sheet accounts wereperformed.
These accounted for 7% of the Groups revenue.
In one reporting unit based in the UK specific audit procedures on certain operating costs and related balance sheet accounts were performed.
This, together with additional procedures performed on centralised functions and at the group level on the consolidation and other areas of significant judgement including tax and goodwill, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.
160 BT Group plc Annual Report 2017 THE STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION The group engagement team performed the audit of British Telecommunications plc.
The group engagement team also performed the work on the US reporting unit and the UK reporting unit.
For EE, the group engagement team met regularly with the audit team, who are UK based, and attended meetings with management, including the year end clearance meeting.
As explained in the area of focus Irregular accounting practices in BT Italia above, the group engagement team was heavily involved in oversight of the work performed on the Italy reporting unit.
Senior members of the group engagement team also visited Spain, Germany and Ireland and communicated with our teams on a regular basis.
We also reviewed certain component auditor working papers and participated in the audit clearance meetings for Spain, Germany and Ireland by conference call.
In addition, the group engagement team visited the shared service centres relevant to those reporting units in scope for the group audit.
Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Overall group materiality 130m 2015 16: 130m How we determined it Approximately 4% of profit before tax.
Rationale for benchmark We consider that profit before tax is the primary measure used by the shareholders in assessing the performance of applied the group.
In our view, using profit before tax ensures that where certain specific items are recurring in nature our audit work is performed to the lower materiality level that results from using a reported profit before tax measure rather than an adjusted profit before tax measure.
In 2015 16 and previous years we used profit before tax as the benchmark, but used an average of profit before tax for the then current year and the previous 3 years.
The acquisition of EE significantly changed the composition of the group and in light of this we changed the period from the historical approach of using a four year average of profit before tax to now using only the current years profit before tax.
Component materiality For each reporting unit in our audit scope, we allocated a materiality that was less than overall Group materiality.
For British Telecommunications plc and EE, the materiality allocated to these units was 110m and 100m respectively.
For all other reporting units the materiality allocated was between 10m and 20m.
We agreed with the Audit & Risk Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 10m 2015 16: 5m as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors statement, set out on pages 146 and 147, in relation to going concern.
We have nothing to report having performed our review.
Under ISAs UK & Ireland we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the directors statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.
As noted in the directors statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The going concern basis presumes that the group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed.
As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Other required reporting Consistency of other information and compliance with applicable requirements Companies Act 2006 reporting In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: the information given in the Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements: and the Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we are required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors.

Segment information The definition of our operating and reportable segments is provided on page 177.
What has changed in our segment information?
From 1 April 2016, the group has been reorganised and the reporting segments have been changed.
This was in addition to the revision disclosed in note 1 for our Italian business.

What are our internal revenue and costs?
Most of our internal trading relates to Openreach and arises on rentals, and any associated connection or migration charges, of the UK access lines and other network products to the customer-facing lines of business.
This occurs both directly, and also indirectly, through TSO which is included within the Other segment.
Wholesale and Ventures internal revenue arises from EE for mobile ethernet access and TSO for transmission planning services.
Internal revenue in Business and Public Sector relates primarily to the use of BT Irelands network by other lines of business.
Internal revenue arising in Consumer relates primarily to employee broadband and wi-fi services, while internal revenue in Global Services relates primarily to conferencing services.
Intra-group revenue generated from the sale of regulated products and services is based on market price.
Intra-group revenue from the sale of other products and services is agreed between the relevant lines of business and therefore line of business profitability may be impacted by transfer pricing levels.
The tables below show internal revenue and costs recorded by each line of line of business.

Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate elements that have value to a customer on a standalone basis, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contract.
Total contract consideration is allocated between the separate elements based on their fair value.
We apply judgement in both identifying separate elements and allocating consideration between them.
Sales of bundled offers in our mobile businesses frequently include a handset and a telecommunications service contract.
There is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the telecommunications service to be delivered and this represents the revenue recognised in respect of the services delivered.
The residual value of the bundled offer therefore represents the revenue in respect of the handset.
For offers that cannot be separated into identifiable elements, revenues are recognised in full over the life of the contract.
The main example is connection to a service where this does not represent a separately identifiable transaction from the subscription.

How do we determine our geographic information?
The UK is our country of domicile and we generate the majority of our revenue from external customers in the UK.
The geographic analysis of revenue is based on the country of origin in which the customer is invoiced.
The geographic analysis of non-current assets, which exclude derivative financial instruments, investments and deferred tax assets, is based on the location of the assets.

In addition, the group capitalised software development costs of 457m 2015 16: 399m, 2014 15: 421m.
Why is the treatment of our subscriber and retention costs a critical judgement?
Subscriber acquisition and retention costs are recognised as an expense within other operating costs for the period in which they are incurred.
If subscriber acquisition and retention costs are paid in advance they are recognised as prepayments provided the amounts are able to be measured reliably and are expected to be recoverable.
In some cases, contractual clauses with retailers provide for profit-sharing based on the recognised and paid revenue.
In these cases we recognise an expense when the revenue is earned from the customer and a corresponding liability to pay that retailer.
In some cases we need to exercise judgement in assessing whether we have an upfront obligation based on the contractual terms.

During the year, we also reviewed the carrying value of the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet of our Italian business including reassessing the recoverability of trade and other receivables and reconsidering other exposures, principally sales taxes.
We took into account any changes in facts or circumstances since 31 March 2016 in determining whether there was a need to change an estimate and whether additional exposures had arisen in the current year.
This exercise required a level of judgement, in many cases taking a more cautious view based on our current understanding of circumstances in the business.
We have set out in note 17 details of estimates we make in accounting for the recoverability of trade and other receivables.
We have made estimates for the potential other exposures, principally sales taxes, which represent the groups best estimate of the amount that may be required to settle the obligation and are included within other payables as set out in note 18.
The total impact of 245m is presented within specific items given the size and one-off nature.
We have also incurred fees in relation to the investigation of 15m which have been included in specific items.
Regulatory matters Weve recognised 479m 2015 16: nil, 2014 15: revenue of 53m of net costs in relation to regulatory matters.

A fine of 42m has been imposed and weve also agreed to compensate Communication Providers.
The precise amount of these compensation payments will be determined from discussion with the affected parties and is currently estimated at 300m.
188 BT Group plc Annual Report 2017 Annual Report 2017 BT Group plc 189 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 8.
Specific items continued Ladder pricing agreements In 2016 17 we recognised revenue and costs of 8m 2015 16: 203m and in 2014 15: 128m revenue being the prior year impacts of ladder pricing agreements with the other UK mobile operators.
This was following a Supreme Court judgment in July 2014 which overturned a Court of Appeal judgment made in July 2012.
The Court of Appeals ruling had disallowed our ladder pricing policy relating to 0800, 0845 and 0870 calls from mobile phones terminating on our network.
Other regulatory matters Weve also re-assessed our regulatory risk provision in light of recent regulatory decisions by Ofcom and by the Competition Appeal Tribunal CAT.
As a result weve increased our net provision by 137m 2015 16: nil for the year.
In 2014 15 the CAT handed down judgment on various appeals brought against a December 2012 Ofcom determination on the pricing of certain Ethernet products.
Ofcom had determined that BT had overcharged for certain services between 1 April 2006 and 31 March 2011 and required BT to make repayments.
The CAT judged that BT should also pay interest on these amounts.
Together with a review of our regulatory risk position in relation to other historical matters, we recognised a specific item charge of 75m in 2014 15.
EE fair value adjustment In 2015 16 we recognised a fair value adjustment on the acquisition of EE which reduced the amount of deferred income in relation to its prepaid subscriber base by 70m with no cash impact.
The step down reflects the difference between the amount recorded by EE on acquisition and the fair value calculated based on the incremental cost that a market participant would incur to take on the liability plus a reasonable profit margin.
This amount was released as a reduction to revenue in the period between acquisition and 31 March 2016, reflecting the period over which EE provided the related service.
EE acquisition and integration costs We incurred 215m 2015 16: 116m, 2014 15: 19m of acquisition and integration related costs for EE.
This includes a 62m 2015 16: nil, 2014 15: nil amortisation charge relating to the write-off of IT assets as we integrate the EE and BT IT infrastructure.

Taxation Current and deferred income tax What critical judgements and estimates do we make in accounting for taxation?
We pay tax in accordance with the laws of the countries where we do business.
In some areas these laws arent clear, and it can take many years to agree an outcome with a tax authority or through litigation.
We estimate our tax on country-by-country and issue-by-issue bases.
Our key uncertainties are whether EEs tax losses will be available to us, whether our intra-group trading model will be accepted by a particular tax authority and whether intra-group payments are subject to withholding taxes.
We provide for the most likely outcome where an outflow is probable, but the agreed amount can differ materially from our estimates.
Approximately 80% by value of the provisions are under active tax authority examination and are therefore likely to be re-estimated or resolved in the coming 12 months.
281m 2015 16: 278m is included in current tax liabilities in relation to these uncertainties.
Under a downside case an additional amount of 372m could be required, of which 273m would relate to EE losses.
This amount is not provided as we dont consider this outcome to be probable.
Deciding whether to recognise deferred tax assets is judgemental.
We only recognise them when we believe it is probable that they can be recovered.
In making this judgement we consider evidence such as historical financial performance, future financial plans and trends, the duration of existing customer contracts and whether our intra-group pricing model has been agreed by the relevant tax authority.
The value of the groups income tax assets and liabilities is disclosed on the Group balance sheet on page 167.
The value of the groups deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the deferred tax asset recognised in respect of EE Limiteds historical tax losses, is disclosed below.

The majority of the deferred tax assets and liabilities noted above are anticipated to be realised after more than 12 months.
Weve recognised a deferred tax asset at 31 March 2017 of 172m in respect of EE Limiteds historical tax losses.
We expect to be able to utilise these against future taxable profits in EE Limited.
If EE Limiteds business were subject to a major change in the nature or conduct of trade on or before 5 February 2018, these losses would be forfeited and a current tax liability of 273m would be created.
Based on our current plans, we do not expect a major change to arise.
Deferred tax balances for which there is a right of offset within the same jurisdiction are presented net on the face of the group balance sheet as permitted by IAS 12, with the exception of deferred tax related to our pension schemes which is disclosed within deferred tax assets.
What factors affect our future tax charges?
The rate of UK corporation tax changed from 20% to 19% on 1 April 2017 and will change to 17% on 1 April 2020.
As deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods of the reversal, deferred tax balances at 31 March 2017 have been calculated at the rate at which the relevant balance is expected to be recovered or settled.
This reduction in rate has been recognised as a deferred tax credit specific item of 63m in the income statement note 8 and as a deferred tax expense in reserves.

Taxation continued What are our unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences?
At 31 March 2017 we had operating losses and other temporary differences carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to 4.5bn 2015 16: 4.1bn.
Our other temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions.
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arose.
Asummary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below: At 31 March 2017 m Expiry Restricted losses Europe 19 20182026 Americas 220 20212036 Total restricted losses 239 Unrestricted operating losses 3,961 No expiry Other temporary differences 173 No expiry Total 4,373 At 31 March 2017 we had UK capital losses carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to 17.0bn 2015 16: 17.0bn.
These losses have no expiry date, but we consider the future utilisation of these losses to be remote.
At 31 March 2017 the undistributed earnings of non-UK subsidiaries were 3.5bn 2015 16: 3.3bn.
No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of these unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of any dividends from subsidiaries and hence any tax consequences that may arise.
Under current tax rules, tax of 26.2m 2015 16: 23.1m would arise if these earnings were to be repatriated to the UK.
On 29 March 2017, the UK Government notified the EU of its intention to withdraw membership from the EU.
Depending on the outcome of negotiations we could cease to benefit from the EU Parent Subsidiary directive on dividends paid by our EU subsidiaries.
In this event, additional tax of up to 17.7m could arise if the undistributed earnings of EU subsidiaries of 619m were to be repatriated to the UK.
Earnings per share How are earnings per share calculated?
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue after deducting the own shares held by employee share ownership trusts and treasury shares.
In calculating the diluted earnings per share, share options outstanding and other potential shares have been taken into account where the impact of these is dilutive.
Options over 27m shares 2015 16: 15m shares, 2014 15: 13m shares were excluded from the calculation of the total diluted number of shares as the impact of these is antidilutive.
Year ended 31 March 2017 2016 2015 Basic weighted average number of shares millions 9,938 8,619 8,056 Dilutive shares from share options millions 27 58 80 Dilutive shares from executive share awards millions 29 37 55 Diluted weighted average number of shares millions 9,994 8,714 8,191 Basic earnings per share 19.2p 28.5p 25.5p Diluted earnings per share 19.1p 28.2p 25.1p The earnings per share calculations are based on profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company which excludes non-controlling interests.
Profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company was 1,908m 2015 16: 2,466m, 2014 15: 2,057m and profit after tax attributable to non-controlling interests was 1m 2015 16: 7m, 2014 15: nil.
Profit attributable to non-controlling interests is not presented separately in the financial statements as it is not material.

Dividends What dividends have been paid and proposed for the year?
The Board recommends that a final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2017 of 10.55p per share will be paid to shareholders on 4 September 2017, taking the full year proposed dividend in respect of 2016 17 to 15.4p 2015 16: 14.0p, 2014 15: 12.4p which amounts to approximately 1,532m 2015 16: 1,324m, 2014 15: 1,028m.
This final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and therefore the liability of approximately 1,050m 2015 16: 954m, 2014 15: 712m has not been included in these financial statements.
The proposed dividend will be payable to all shareholders on the Register of Members on 11 August 2017.
The value of 1,436m 2015 16: 1,078m, 2014 15: 925m for the final and interim dividends is disclosed in our statement of changes in equity.
This value may differ from the amount shown for equity dividends paid in the group cash flow statement, which represents the actual cash paid in relation to dividend cheques that have been presented over the course of the financial year.
See note 14. b Includes a 62m 2015 16: nil specific item amortisation charge relating to the write-off of internally developed software as we integrate the EE and BT IT infrastructure.

Intangible assets continued Goodwill Goodwill recognised in a business combination does not generate cash flows independently of other assets or groups of assets.
As a result, the recoverable amount, being the value in use, is determined at a cash generating unit CGU level.
How do we determine our CGUs?
The determination of our CGUs is judgemental.
The identification of CGUs involves an assessment of whether the asset or group of assets generate largely independent cash inflows.
This involves consideration of how our core assets are operated and whether these generate independent revenue streams.
Our CGUs are deemed to be Consumer, EE, Business and Public Sector, Global Services and Wholesale and Ventures which are the same units we report in our segmental reporting.
For impairment purposes goodwill is tested at the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and cannot be larger than our operating segments.
We test goodwill at the CGU level.
What other critical estimates and assumptions have we made?
During the year we re-allocated goodwill among our CGUs based on the relative fair value of the business transferred to reflect our new line of business structure effective as of 1 April 2016.
We estimated the relative fair values on a discounted cash flow basis using the three-year financial plans effective at the time of the re-organisation.
The assumptions used were set in the same way as those used in our value in use calculations as set out below.
Our value in use calculations require estimates in relation to uncertain items, including managements expectations of future revenue growth, operating costs, profit margins, operating cash flows, and the discount rate for each CGU.
Future cash flows used in the value in use calculations are based on our latest Board approved three-year financial plans.
Expectations about future growth reflect the expectations of growth in the markets to which the CGU relates.
The future cash flows are discounted using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.
The discount rate used in each CGU is adjusted for the risk specific to the asset, including the countries in which cash flow will be generated, for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.
The group is required to test goodwill acquired in a business combination annually for impairment.
This was carried out as at 31 March 2017.
The carrying value of goodwill and the key assumptions used in performing the annual impairment assessment and sensitivities are disclosed below.
How have we carried out our goodwill impairment review?
We perform an annual goodwill impairment review, based on our CGUs.
From 1 April 2016, we re-organised our lines of business resulting in the change of the CGUs that have associated goodwill.
Weve now allocated goodwill to Consumer, EE, Business and Public Sector, Global Services and Wholesale and Ventures.
Previously no goodwill was allocated to Wholesale and Ventures.
In addition to this new CGU, to which goodwill has been allocated, there have been changes to the amount allocated to the other CGUs as a result of the re-organisation.
These CGUs represent the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets, and to which goodwill is allocated.
Goodwill is allocated to these CGUs as follows: Business and Public Global Wholesale Consumer EE Sector Services and Ventures Total m m m m m m At 31 March 2015 80 220 1,096 1,396 Acquisitions note 14 1,103 4,917 439 6,459 Exchange differences 3 49 52 At 31 March 2016 1,183 4,917 662 1,145 7,907 Re-organisation 2,149 1,921 709 937 Exchange differences 10 135 145 Acquisitions and disposals 23 5 18 At 31 March 2017 1,183 2,768 2,570 571 942 8,034 How do we calculate the recoverable amount?
The value in use of each CGU is determined using cash flow projections derived from financial plans approved by the Board covering a three-year period.
They reflect managements expectations of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash flows, based on past experience and future expectations of business performance.
The value in use calculation includes a fourth year estimate of cash flows which is held flat from the last year assumed in the financial plans approved by the Board.
Cash flows beyond the fourth-year period have been extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates.

Intangible assets continued What discount rate have we used?
The pre-tax discount rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are derived from our post-tax weighted average cost of capital.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the groups weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data.
The pre-tax discount rate used in performing the value in use calculation in 2016 17 was 8.6% 2015 16: 8.8%.
Weve used the same discount rate for all CGUs except Global Services where we have used 9.0% reflecting higher risk in some of the countries in which Global Services operates.
What growth rates have we used?
The perpetuity growth rates are determined based on the forecast market growth rates of the regions in which the CGU operates, and they reflect an assessment of the long-term growth prospects of that market.
The growth rates have been benchmarked against external data for the relevant markets.
None of the growth rates applied exceed the expected long-term average growth rates for those markets or sectors.
The perpetuity growth rate for Global Services was 2.4% 2015 16: 2.3% and 2.0% 2015 16: 2.0% for Business and Public Sector, Consumer and EE and 2.0% 2015 16: nil for Wholesale and Ventures.
What sensitivities have we applied?
There is significant headroom in Business and Public Sector, Consumer, Wholesale and Ventures and EE.
No reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed the recoverable amount.
For Global Services, the value in use exceeds the carrying value of the CGU by approximately 594m 2015 16: 6,900m.
Any of thefollowing changes in assumptions would cause the recoverable amount for the CGU to equal its carrying amount: r eduction in the perpetuity growth rate from the 2.4% assumption applied to a revised assumption of no growth: an incr ease in the discount rate from the 9.0% assumption applied to a revised assumption of 11%: and shor tfalls in trading performance against forecast resulting in operating cash flows decreasing by 27% each year and in perpetuity.

Property, plant and equipment What critical estimates have we made for property plant and equipment?
The plant and equipment in our networks is long-lived with cables and switching equipment operating for over ten years and underground ducts being used for decades.
We also develop software for use in IT systems and platforms that support the products and services provided to our customers.
Our annual depreciation and amortisation charge is sensitive to the estimated service life we allocate to each type of asset.
If an asset life is extended this would reduce the annual depreciation or amortisation charge: reducing a life would increase the charge.
Asset lives are assessed annually and changed when necessary to reflect our current thinking on technological change, network investment plans including the groups fibre rollout programme, prospective economic utilisation and the physical condition of the assets concerned.
Changes to the service lives of assets implemented in the year had no significant impact on our results for the year ended 31 March 2017.
The carrying values of software, property, plant and equipment are disclosed below and in note 12.
The useful lives applied to the principal categories of assets are disclosed on pages 178 and 179.
The depreciation expense on those assets in 2016 17 was 10m 2015 16: 10m, comprising land and buildings of 3m 2015 16: 4m and network infrastructure of 7m 2015 16: 6m.

Included within this is 179m 2015 16: 128m, being the groups share of assets owned by its joint operation MBNL.
Within network infrastructure are assets with a net book value of 8.0bn which have useful economic lives of more than 18 years.
Government grants relating to Broadband Delivery UK BDUK contracts The group receives government grants in relation to the BDUK programme and other rural superfast broadband contracts.
Where weve achieved certain service levels, or delivered the network more efficiently than anticipated, weve an obligation to either re-invest or repay grant funding.
Where this is the case, we assess and defer the income with a corresponding increase in capital expenditure.
What estimates and critical judgements have we made in accounting for our BDUK contracts?
Assessing the timing of whether and when we change the estimated take-up assumption is judgemental as it involves considering information which is not always observable.
Our consideration on whether and when to change the base case assumption is dependent on our expectation of the long term take-up trend.
Our assessment of how much grant income to defer includes consideration of the difference between the take-up percentage agreed with the local authority and the likelihood of actual take-up.
The value of the government grants deferred is disclosed in note 18.
We receive grant funding mainly under the BDUK programme which reduces the capital expenditure incurred by Openreach.
Under the terms of the programme, we have a potential obligation to either re-invest or repay grant funding depending on factors including the level of take-up achieved.
In the current year we had a net grant deferral of 28m 2015 16: 109m net grant funding mainly related to our activity on the BDUK programme.
Our base case assumption for take-up in BDUK areas has been increased to 39% following our review of the level of customer take-up.
14. Business combinations All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired.
What critical judgements do we apply in accounting for business combinations?
We exercise judgement in allocating the purchase consideration to acquired assets and liabilities.
We also take into account future integration and our plan on how goodwill will be monitored post acquisition.
Assessing how much of the estimated synergies are buyer or market specific is also judgemental as it requires us to determine what a market participant could reasonably achieve, which is inherently judgemental.
Buyer specific synergies support the goodwill amount recognised while market specific synergies are factored into the fair value measurement of the acquired assets and liabilities.
We also exercise judgement in identifying all of the intangible assets we have acquired.
We initially measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination, with limited exceptions, at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The fair value of an asset or liability represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
In determining the fair value of the intangible assets acquired for EE we generally used risk-adjusted future cash flows discounted using discount rates specific to the asset.
In determining the cash flows, we have used a combination of historical data and estimates regarding revenue growth, profit margins and operating cash flows.
Tangible assets were valued by estimating current cost to purchase or replace the assets.
We used independent valuers to assist in the valuation for EE.
We didnt make any material acquisitions in the year ended 31 March 2017.
We have however revisited the provisional fair values ascribed to our acquisition of EE which took place on 29 January 2016.
This acquisition resulted in us acquiring the entire share capital of EE Limited EE from Deutsche Telekom and Orange.
The total purchase consideration amounted to 10,971m with a goodwill value of 6,430m after considering the provisional fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired of 4,541m.
During the year, weve received a purchase consideration refund from the previous owners of 20m following the finalisation of the audit of the completion balance sheet and have also finalised our reassessment of the provisional fair values within the measurement period.
This resulted in a revision to previously recognised brand, customer relationship and prepaid assets which decreased by 15m.
Our reassessment also led to a 14m decrease in receivables and an 198 BT Group plc Annual Report 2017 Annual Report 2017 BT Group plc 199 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 14. Business combinations continued increase in provisions related to unfavourable contracts in the amount of 20m.
The net impact of the adjustment including the deferred tax effect resulted in an increase of 29m in goodwill with no material impact on the income statement for the period ended 31 March 2016.
In the prior year, we provisionally paid 3,464m of cash and issued 1,595m of new shares valued at 7,507m using the opening share price of 470.7p per share on 29 January 2016, being the date of acquisition of EE and the date when the shares were admitted to trading.
The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
For the acquisition of EE this amounted to 6,430m.
The fair values ascribed and the resulting goodwill were recognised on a provisional basis which the group had one year from the acquisition date to re-measure.
As discussed above we completed this in 2016 17 resulting in an increase of 29m in goodwill.

Weve exercised judgement in assessing when the transition or transformation phase of a contract ends.
This influences the timing of recognition of revenue and costs which are deferred until the transition or transformation phase ends unless these elements of a contract have standalone value.
Judgements are also required in assessing the lifetime profitability of a contract when determining whether we have an onerous contract liability.
Where we have an onerous contract liability this would be classified in provisions.

Trade and other receivables continued How do we estimate and recognise contract losses?
We estimate and recognise immediately the entire estimated loss for a contract when we have evidence that the contract is unprofitable.
Also if these estimates indicate that any contract will be less profitable than previously forecast, contract assets may have to be written down to the extent they are no longer considered to be fully recoverable.
We perform ongoing profitability reviews of our contracts in order to determine whether the latest estimates are appropriate.
Key factors reviewed include: Transaction volumes or other inputs affecting future revenues which can vary depending on customer requirements, plans, market position and other factors such as general economic conditions.
Our ability to achieve key contract milestones connected with the transition, development, transformation and deployment phases for customer contracts.
The status of commercial relations with customers and the implication for future revenue and cost projections.
Our estimates of future staff and third-party costs and the degree to which cost savings and efficiencies are deliverable.

How do we assess recoverability of our receivables?
We provide services to consumer and business customers, mainly on credit terms.
We know that certain debts due to us will not be paid through the default of a small number of our customers.
Judgements are required in assessing the recoverability of trade receivables and whether a provision for doubtful debts may be required.
In estimating a provision for doubtful debts we consider historical experience alongside other factors such as the current state of the economy and particular industry issues.
The value of the provision for doubtful debts is disclosed above.
Trade receivables are continuously monitored and allowances applied against trade receivables consist of both specific impairments and collective impairments based on our historical loss experiences for the relevant aged c ategory as well as taking into account general economic conditions.
Historical loss experience allowances are calculated by line of busine ss in order to reflect the specific nature of the customers relevant to that line of business.

Provisions Provisions and contingent liabilities As disclosed below, our provisions principally relate to obligations arising from property rationalisation programmes, restructuring programmes, asset retirement obligations, network assets, insurance claims, litigation and regulatory risks.
What critical judgements have we made in accounting for provisions?
We exercise judgement in determining the timing and quantum of all provisions to be recognised.
Our assessment includes consideration of whether we have a present obligation, whether payment is probable and if so whether the amount can be estimated reliably.
As part of this assessment, we also assess the likelihood of contingent liabilities occurring in the future which are not recognised as liabilities on our balance sheet.
By their nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur.
We assess the likelihood that a potential claim or liability will arise and also quantify the possible range of financial outcomes.
Weve disclosed our assessment of contingent liabilities in note30.
Under our property rationalisation programmes weve identified a number of surplus properties.
Although efforts are being made to sublet this space, this is not always possible.
Estimates have been made of the cost of vacant possession and of any shortfall arising from any potential sub-lease income being lower than the lease costs.
Any such shortfall is recognised as a provision.
Restructuring programmes involve estimation of the direct cost necessary for the restructuring and exclude items that are associated with ongoing activities.
Asset retirement obligations involve an estimate of the cost to dismantle equipment and restore sites upon vacation and the timing of the event.
The provision represents the groups best estimate of the amount that may be required to settle the obligation.
Network asset provisions represent our future operational costs and vacant site rentals arising from obligations relating to network share agreements.
Costs are expected to be incurred over a period of up to 20 years.
Our regulatory provision represents our best estimate of the cost to settle our present obligation in relation to historical regulatory matters.
Included within the increase for the year is a 300m charge in relation to estimated compensation payments to other Communication Providers as a result of Ofcoms March 2017 findings on historical practices on Deemed Consent by Openreach.
The precise amount of the compensation payments will result from discussions with the affected parties.
A related fine of 42m has been imposed and is recognised as a payable rather than as a provision.
The fine and associated compensation payments totalling 342m are treated as a specific item charge in this years income statement.
The remaining provision reflects managements estimates of regulatory risks across a range of issues, including price and service issues.
These increased by 126m, also treated as specific items, resulting from our re-assessment of these other regulatory risks and in light of the regulatory decisions by Ofcom and by the Competition Appeal Tribunal.
Refer to note 8 for further information on specific items.
In respect of claims, litigation and regulatory risks, the group provides for anticipated costs where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reasonable estimate can be made of the likely outcome.
The prices at which certain services are charged are regulated and may be subject to retrospective adjustment by regulators.
Estimates are used in assessing the likely value of the regulatory risk.
For all risks, the ultimate liability may vary from the amounts provided and will be dependent upon the eventual outcome of any settlement.
The estimates are discounted using a rate that reflects the passage of time and risk specific to the liability.
An estimate is also required in assessing the timing of when a provision is recognised.
The outcome of our estimate of the provisions is disclosed below.

Retirement benefit plans Background to BTs pension plans The group has both defined benefit and defined contribution retirement benefit plans.
The groups main plans are in the UK and the largest by membership is the BT Pension Scheme BTPS which is a defined benefit plan that was closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001.
After that date new entrants to BT in the UK have been able to join a defined contribution plan, currently the BT Retirement Saving Scheme BTRSS, a contract-based arrangement.
EE operates the EE Pension Scheme EEPS, which has a defined benefit section that was closed to future benefit accrual in 2014 and a defined contribution section which is open to new joiners.
How do they impact BTs financial statements?

Included within trade and other payables in the group balance sheet is 15m 2015 16: 10m in respect of contributions payable to defined contribution plans.
What is IFRIC 14 and how does it impact BT?
For some pension schemes, IFRIC 14 potentially: limits the surplus in a pension scheme that can be recognised on the balance sheet: and or requires additional pension liabilities to be recognised where scheduled future deficit contributions are greater than the unadjusted accounting deficit.
BT is not required to limit any pensions surplus or recognise additional pensions liabilities in individual plans as economic benefits are available in the form of either future refunds or reductions to future contributions.
In any event, for both the BTPS and the EEPS, the net present value using the IAS 19 discount rate of scheduled future deficit contributions agreed with the schemes trustee are less than the accounting deficit at 31 March 2017, and therefore IFRIC 14 would have no effect on the figures disclosed.
In 2015, the International Accounting Standards Board IASB published an Exposure Draft setting out proposed changes to IFRIC 14.
We understand there have been subsequent discussions around further changes by the IFRS Interpretations Committee and a revised version of IFRIC 14 is expected to be published in 2017.

Thisincludes both financial assumptions, which are based on market conditions at the year end, and demographic assumptions such as life expectancy.
b The ac tuarial loss or gain arising from experience adjustments on defined benefit liabilities represents the impact on the liabilities of differences between actual experience during the year compared with the assumptions made at the start of the year.
Such differences might arise, for example, from members choosing different benefit options at retirement, actual salary increases being different from those assumed or actual benefit increases being different to the pension increase assumption.
206 BT Group plc Annual Report 2017 THE STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 20.
Retirement benefit plans continued How do we value our retirement benefit plans?
Valuation methodology The IAS 19 liabilities are measured as the present value of the estimated future benefit cash flows to be paid by each scheme, calculated using the projected unit credit method.
These calculations are performed for the group by professionally qualified independent actuaries.
The expected future benefit payments are based on a number of assumptions including future inflation, retirement ages, benefit options chosen and life expectancy and are therefore inherently uncertain.
Actual benefit payments in a given year may be higher or lower, for example if members retire sooner or later than assumed, or take a greater or lesser cash lump sum at retirement than assumed.
What are our critical judgements, estimates and assumptions?
The accounting cost of these benefits and the present value of our pension liabilities involve judgements about uncertain events including the life expectancy of the members, the salary progression of our current employees, price inflation and the discount rate used to calculate the net present value of the future pension payments.
We use estimates for all of these uncertain events in determining the pension costs and liabilities in our financial statements.
Our assumptions reflect historical experience and our judgement regarding future expectations.
We also estimate the fair value of some of our pension assets which are made up of quoted and unquoted investments.
The latter require more judgement as their values are not directly observable.
The assumptions used in valuing unquoted investments are affected by current market conditions and trends which could result in changes in fair value after the measurement date.
How do we value the assets?
Under IAS 19, plan assets must be valued at the bid market value at the balance sheet date.
For the main asset categories: Securities list ed on recognised stock exchanges are valued at closing bid prices.
P roperties are valued on the basis of open market value.
Bonds ar e measured using a combination of broker quotes and pricing models making assumptions for credit risk, market risk and market yield curves.
P ooled investment vehicles are valued at fair value which is typically the Net Asset Value provided by the investment manager.
C ertain unlisted investments are valued using a model based valuation such as a discounted cash flow.
The v alue of the longevity insurance contract held by the BTPS is measured by discounting the projected cash flows payable under the contract projected by an actuary, consistent with the terms of the contract.
Overview and governance of the BTPS What is the profile of the BTPS?
At 31 March 2017 there were 296,000 members of the BTPS.
Members belong to one of three sections depending upon the date they first joined the BTPS.

Annual Report 2017 BT Group plc 207 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 20.
Retirement benefit plans continued The estimated duration of the BTPS liabilities, which is an indicator of the weighted average term of the liabilities, is around 16.5 years although the benefits payable by the BTPS are expected to be paid over more than 70 years.
Whilst benefit payments are expected to increase over the earlier years, the value of the liabilities is expected to reduce.
The chart below illustrates the estimated benefits payable from the BTPS forecast using the IAS 19 assumptions.
What are the benefits under the BTPS?
Benefits earned for pensionable service prior to 1 April 2009 are based upon a members final salary and a normal pensionable age of 60.
Since 1 April 2009, when changes to member benefits and contribution rates were introduced, Section B and C active members have accrued benefits based upon a career average re-valued earnings CARE basis and a normal pensionable age of 65.
On a CARE basis benefits are built up based upon earnings in each year and the benefit accrued for each year is increased by the lower of inflation or the individuals actual pay increase in each year to retirement.
Under the Scheme rules the determination of the rate of inflation for statutory minimum rates of revaluation and indexation for the majority of benefits is based upon either the Retail Prices Index RPI or the Consumer Prices Index CPI which apply to each category of member as shown below.

BTPS assets Asset allocation The allocation of assets between different classes of investment is reviewed regularly and is a key factor in the Trustees investment policy.
The allocations set reflect the Trustees views on the appropriate balance to be struck between seeking returns and incurring risk, and on the extent to which the assets should be distributed to match liabilities.
Current market conditions and trends are regularly assessed which may lead to adjustments in the asset allocation.
The fair value of the assets of the BTPS analysed by asset category are shown below.

Annual Report 2017 BT Group plc 209 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 20.
Retirement benefit plans continued IAS 19 assumptions The table below summarises the approach used to set the key IAS 19 assumptions for the BTPS.
Approach to set the assumption Discount rate IAS 19 requires that the discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the reporting date on high quality corporate bonds.
The currency and term of these should be consistent with the currency and estimated term of the pension obligations.
The assumption is calculated by applying the projected BTPS benefit cash flows to a corporate bond yield curve constructed based on the yield on AA-rated corporate bonds.
In setting the yield curve, judgement is required on the selection of appropriate bonds to be included in the universe and the approach used to then derive the yield curve.
RPI inflation The approach to set the RPI inflation assumption has been revised at 31 March 2017 to use the entire inflation curve, weighted by projected BTPS benefit cash flows, and making an adjustment for an inflation risk premium to reflect the extra premium paid by investors for inflation protection, currently 20bps.
CPI inflation CPI is assessed at a margin below RPI taking into account market forecasts and independent estimates of the expected difference.
Salary increases Long-term salary increases for BTPS members are assumed to be equal to CPI inflation.
Pension increases Benefits are assumed to increase in line with the RPI or CPI inflation assumptions, based on the relevant index for increasing benefits, as prescribed by the rules of the BTPS and summarised above.
Longevity The longevity assumption takes into account: the actual mortality experience of the BTPS pensioners, based on a formal review conducted at the last triennial valuation: and future improvements in longevity based on a model published by UK actuarial professions Continuous Mortality Investigation using the CMI 2013 Mortality Projections model with a 1.25% per year longterm improvement parameter.
The key financial assumptions used to measure the liabilities of the BTPS are shown below.
a Nominal rates per year Real rates per year 2015 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 At 31 March % % % % % % Rate used to discount liabilities 2.40 3.30 3.25 0.78 0.44 0.39 Inflation increase in RPI 3.20 2.85 2.85 b c c b c c Inflation increase in CPI 2.00 1.65 1.65 1.2 1.2 1.2 a The real rate is calculated relative to RPI inflation.
b Assumed to be 0.5% higher until 31 March 2019. c Assumed to be 0.2% higher until 31 March 2017.
The BTPS represents over 97% of the groups retirement benefit obligation.
While the financial assumptions may vary for each plan, the nominal financial assumptions weighted by liabilities across all plans are equal to the figures shown in the table above to the nearest 0.05%.
Based on the IAS 19 longevity assumptions, the forecast life expectancies for BTPS members aged 60 are as follows: 2017 2016 Number of Number of At 31 March years years Male in lower pay bracket 26.2 26.1 Male in medium pay bracket 27.5 27.4 Male in higher pay bracket 28.9 28.8 Female in lower pay bracket 28.9 28.8 Female in higher pay bracket 29.2 29.1 Average improvement for a member retiring at age 60 in 10 years time 1.0 1.0 210 BT Group plc Annual Report 2017 THE STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 20.
Retirement benefit plans continued Risks underlying the assumptions The BTPS faces similar risks to other UK DB schemes: things like future low investment returns, high inflation, longer life expectancy and regulatory changes may all mean the BTPS becomes more of a financial burden.
Further details are set out on page 49.
Changes in external factors, such as interest rates, can have an impact on the IAS 19 assumptions, impacting the measurement of BTPS liabilities.
These factors can also impact the Scheme assets.
The BTPS hedges some of these risks, including longevity and currency using financial instruments and insurance contracts.
Some of the key financial risks, and mitigations, for the BTPS are set out in the table below.
Changes in bond yields A fall in yields on AA-rated corporate bonds, used to set the IAS 19 discount rate, will lead to an increase in the IAS 19 liabilities.
The BTPSs assets include corporate bonds, government bonds and interest rate derivatives which are expected to partly offset the impact of movements in the discount rate.
However, yields on these assets may diverge compared to the discount rate in some scenarios.
Changes in inflation A significant proportion of the benefits paid to members are currently increased in line with RPI or CPI expectations inflation.
An increase in long-term inflation expectations will lead to an increase in the IAS 19 liabilities.
The BTPSs assets include index-linked government bonds and inflation derivatives which are expected to partly offset the impact of movements in inflation expectations.
Changes in life expectancy An increase in the life expectancy of members will result in benefits being paid out for longer, leading to an increase in the BTPS liabilities.
The BTPS holds a longevity insurance contract which covers around 25% of the BTPSs total exposure to improvements in longevity, providing long-term protection and income to the BTPS in the event that members live longer than currently expected.
Other risks include volatile asset returns ie where asset returns differ from the discount rate and changes in regulation which impact the measurement of the liabilities or value of the assets.
BTs independent actuary has assessed the potential negative impact of the key risks that might occur no more than once in every 20 years.
The impact shown under each scenario assumes this is the only change in assumptions in practice a combination of changes to assumptions could arise.
Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure BTPS liabilities bn 10 8 6 4 2 0 1 percentage point 0.9 percentage point 1.35 year increase a b fall in discount rate increase to ination rate to life expectancy Increase in liabilities Increase in deficit a Scenario assumes a 1 percentage point fall in the yields on both government and corporate bonds.
b Assuming RPI, CPI, pension increases and salary increases all increase by 0.9 percentage points.
The sensitivity of the deficit allows for both the change in the liabilities and the assumed change in the assets.
For example, the increase in the deficit under the life expectancy scenario incorporates the expected movement in the value of the insurance contract held to hedge longevity risk.
The sensitivities have been prepared using a similar approach as 2015 16 which involves calculating the liabilities and deficit using the alternative assumptions stated.

Retirement benefit plans continued BTPS funding Triennial funding valuation The triennial valuation is carried out for the Trustee by a professionally qualified independent actuary.
Thepurpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that the BTPS has sufficient funds available to meet future benefit payments.
The latest funding valuation was performed as at 30 June 2014.
The next funding valuation will have an effective date of no later than 30 June 2017.
The valuation methodology for funding purposes, which is based on prudent assumptions, is broadly as follows: assets are valued at market value at the valuation date: and liabilities are measured on an actuarial funding basis using the projected unit credit method and discounted to their present value.
The results of the two most recent triennial valuations are shown below.
June June 2014 2011 valuation valuation bn bn BTPS liabilities 47.2 40.8 Market value of BTPS assets 40.2 36.9 Funding deficit 7.0 3.9 Percentage of accrued benefits covered by BTPS assets at valuation date 85.2% 90.4% Percentage of accrued benefits on a solvency basis covered by the BTPS assets at the valuation date 63.0% 66.0% The funding deficit increased to 7.0bn at 30 June 2014.
While deficit contribution payments totalling 2.65bn and investment returns of 5.8% per year since the 2011 valuation contributed to higher assets at the 2014 valuation date, the low interest rate environment resulted in a higher value being placed on the BTPSs liabilities which more than offset the increase in the BTPSs assets.
Key assumptions funding valuation These valuations were determined using the following prudent long-term assumptions.
a Nominal rates per year Real rates per year June June June June 2014 2011 2014 2011 valuation valuation valuation valuation % % % % Average single equivalent discount rate 4.5 5.2 1.0 2.0 Average long-term increase in RPI 3.5 3.2 Average long-term increase in CPI 2.5 2.2 1.0 1.0 a The real rate is calculated relative to RPI inflation and is shown as a comparator.
The discount rate at 30 June 2014 was derived from prudent return expectations above a yield curve based on gilt and swap rates.
The discount rate reflects views of future returns at the valuation date.
This gives a prudent discount rate of 2.1% per year above the yield curve initially, trending down to 0.6% per year above the curve in the long-term.
The assumption is equivalent to using a flat discount rate of 4.5% per year.
The average life expectancy assumptions at the 2014 valuation date, for members 60 years of age, are as follows.
June June 2014 2011 Number of years from 30 June 2014 assumptions assumptions Male in lower pay bracket 26.1 26.3 Male in medium pay bracket 27.5 28.1 Male in high pay bracket 29.0 Female in lower pay bracket 28.9 28.7 Female in high pay bracket 29.2 Average improvement for a member retiring at age 60 in 10 years time 1.3 1.2 212 BT Group plc Annual Report 2017 THE STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 20.

In January 2015, the 2014 triennial funding valuation was finalised, agreed with the Trustee and certified by the Scheme Actuary.
The funding deficit at 30 June 2014 was 7.0bn.
Under the associated recovery plan BT made payments of 875m in March 2015, 625m in April 2015 and 250m in March 2016.
BT is scheduled to make future deficit payments in line with the table below.
Year to 31 March 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Deficit contribution m 688 699 711 724 670 670 670 495 495 495 495 495 289 The ordinary contribution rate to meet the benefits of current employed members is: 16.0% of pensionable salaries including employee contributions from 1 April 2015 through to 30 June 2017: and 16.9% of pensionable salaries from 1 July 2017.
This will be reviewed as part of the 2017 triennial valuation.
Based on the 2014 funding valuation agreement, the group expects to make contributions of approximately 850m to the BTPS in 2017 18, comprising ordinary contributions of approximately 162m and deficitcontributions of 688m.
This will be reviewed as part of the 2017 funding valuation.
Other protections The 2014 funding agreement with the Trustee included additional features for BT to provide support to the BTPS.
These include: Feature Detail Shareholder In the event that shareholder distributions exceed an agreed threshold, BT will provide matching payments to the BTPS.
The distributions threshold allows for 15% per year dividend per share growth plus 300m per year of share buybacks on a cumulative basis.
BT will consult with the Trustee if it considers share buybacks in excess of 300m per year or making a special dividend.
These provisions apply from 29 January 2015 until 31 March 2019, or until the finalisation of the next valuation if earlier.
Material In the event that BT generates net cash proceeds greater than 1bn from disposals net of acquisitions in any 12-month period corporate events ending 30 June, BT will make additional contributions to the BTPS equal to one third of those net cash proceeds.
BT will consult with the Trustee if: it considers making acquisitions with a total cost of more than 1bn in any 12-month period: or it considers making disposals of more than 1bn: or it considers making a Class 1 transaction acquisition or disposal which will have a material impact on the BTPS: or it becomes aware it is likely to be subject to a takeover offer.
BT will advise the Trustee should there be other material corporate events which would materially impact BTs covenant to the BTPS.
Negative pledge A negative pledge that future creditors will not be granted superior security to the BTPS in excess of a 1.5bn threshold, to cover both British Telecommunications plc and BT Group plc.
This provision applies until the deficit reduces to below 2.0bn at any subsequent funding valuation.
Annual Report 2017 BT Group plc 213 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 20.
Retirement benefit plans continued In the highly unlikely event that the group were to become insolvent there are additional protections of BTPS members benefits: Feature Detail Crown The Crown Guarantee was granted by the Government when the group was privatised in 1984 and would only come into Guarantee effect upon the insolvency of BT.
The Trustee brought court proceedings to clarify the scope and extent of the Crown Guarantee.
The Court of Appeal judgment on 16 July 2014 established that: the Crown Guarantee covers BTs funding obligation in relation to the benefits of members of the BTPS who joined post-privatisation as well as those who joined pre-privatisation subject to certain exceptions : the funding obligation to which the Crown Guarantee relates is measured with reference to BTs obligation to pay deficit contributions under the rules of the BTPS.
The Crown Guarantee is not taken into account for the purposes of the actuarial valuation of the BTPS and is an entirely separate matter, only being relevant in the highly unlikely event that BT became insolvent.
Pension The Pension Protection Fund PPF may take over the BTPS and pay benefits not covered by the Crown Guarantee to Protection Fund members.
PPF There are limits on the amounts paid by the PPF and the PPF would not provide exactly the same benefits as those provided under the BTPS Rules.
Other benefit plans In addition to the BTPS, the group maintains benefit plans around the world with a focus on these being appropriate for the local market and culture.
EE Pension Scheme EEPS The EEPS is the second largest defined benefit plan sponsored by the group with defined benefit liabilities of around 1bn.
The EEPS also has a defined contribution section with around 11,000 active members.
The defined benefit sections assets are invested across a number of asset classes including global equities 27%, property 19%, an absolute return portfolio 27% and a liability driven investment portfolio 27%.
The triennial valuation of the defined benefit section was performed as at 31 December 2015, and agreed in March 2017.
This showed a funding deficit of 141m.
To meet the deficit, the group will contribute: c1.667m each month until March 2018 inclusive : and 1.875m each month thereafter until November 2020.
The next funding valuation will have an effective date of no later than 31 December 2018.
Other schemes The BT Retirement Saving Scheme BTRSS is the largest defined contribution scheme maintained by the group with around 32,500 active members.
In the year to 31 March 2017, the group contributed 139m to the BTRSS.

Share-based payments What share incentive arrangements do we have?
Our plans include savings-related share option plans for employees and those of participating subsidiaries, further share option plans for selected employees and a stock purchase plan for employees in the US.
We also have several share plans for executives.
All share-based payment plans are equity-settled.
Details of these plans and an analysis of the total charge by type of award is set out below.

This price is usually set at a 20% discount to the market price for five-year plans and 10% for three-year plans.
The options must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract, otherwise they lapse.
Similar plans operate for our overseas employees.
Incentive Share Plan ISP Under the ISP, participants are only entitled to these shares in full at the end of a three-year period if the company has met the relevant predetermined corporate performance measures and if the participants are still employed by the group.
For ISP awards granted in 2016 17, 2015 16 and 2014 15: 40% of each award is linked to a total shareholder return TSR target for a comparator group of companies from the beginning of the relevant performance period: 40% is linked to a three-year cumulative free cash flow measure, and 20% to growth in underlying revenue excluding transit.
Deferred Bonus Plan DBP Under the DBP, awards are granted annually to selected employees.
Shares in the company are transferred to participants at the end of three years if they continue to be employed by the group throughout that period.
Under the terms of the ISP and DBP, dividends or dividend equivalents earned on shares during the conditional periods are reinvested incompany shares for the potential benefit of the participants.

Awards under the ISP are valued using Monte Carlo simulations.
TSRs are generated for BT and the comparator group at the end of the three-year performance period, using each companys volatility and the cross correlation between pairs of stocks.
Volatility has been determined by reference to BTs historical volatility which is expected to reflect the BT share price in the future.
An expected life of three months after vesting date is assumed for Employee Saveshare options.
For all other awards the expected life is equal to the vesting period.
The risk-free interest rate is based on the UK gilt curve in effect at the time of the grant, for the expected life of the option or award.
The fair values for the DBP were determined using the market price of the shares at the grant date.

The remaining balance of 2m 2015 16: 7m, 2014 15: 9m was held in escrow accounts, or in commercial arrangements akin to escrow.
The classification of the items noted above represents a change in our definition of restricted cash.
We previously included in our definition cash held in countries where capital or exchange controls imposed local compliance obligations upon the group.
Upon further review, we have concluded these controls do not necessarily restrict access providing these obligations are satisfied.
We now also include cash balances held in arrangements akin to escrow as well as balances physically held in escrow accounts.
We have updated the comparative balances to reflect this change by reducing reported restricted cash by 50m in 2015 16 and 61m in 2014 15.
Cash equivalents are classified as loans and receivables and are held on the group balance sheet at amortised cost which equates to fair value.
Loans and other borrowings Whats our capital management policy?
The objective of our capital management policy is to target an overall level of debt consistent with our credit rating target while investing in the business, supporting the pension scheme and paying progressive dividends.
In order to meet this objective, we may issue or repay debt, issue new shares, repurchase shares, or adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders.
Wemanage the capital structure and make adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the group.
The Board regularly reviews the capital structure.
No changes were made to these objectives and processes during 2016 17, 2015 16 or 2014 15.
For details of share issues and repurchases in the year see note 21.
Our capital structure consists of net debt and shareholders equity.
The analysis below summarises the components which we manage as capital.
218 BT Group plc Annual Report 2017 THE STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 25.
Loans and other borrowings continued Net debt Net debt consists of loans and other borrowings both current and non-current, less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
Loansand other borrowings are measured at the net proceeds raised, adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt.
For the purpose of this measure, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to Sterling at swapped rates where hedged.
Net debt is considered to be an alternative performance measure as it is not defined in IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure is the aggregate of loans and other borrowings currentand non-current, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
A reconciliation from the most directly comparable IFRS measure to net debt is given below.
b The in terest rate payable on this bond attracts an additional 0.25% for a downgrade by one credit rating by either Moodys or S&P to the groups senior unsecured debt below A3 A respectively.
In addition, if Moodys or S&P subsequently increase the ratings then the interest rate will be decreased by 0.25% for each rating category upgrade by each rating agency.
In no event will the interest rate be reduced below the minimum rate reflected in the above table.
Annual Report 2017 BT Group plc 219 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25.
Loans and other borrowings continued Unless previously designated in a fair value hedge relationship, all loans and other borrowings are carried on our balance sheet at amortised cost and in the table on page 219.
The fair value of our bonds and other long-term borrowings is estimated on the basis of quoted market prices, based on the same or similar issues where they exist.
Where the same or similar issues do not exist, the fair value is estimated based on the calculation of future cash flows using blended discount rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
The carrying amount of other loans and bank overdrafts equates to fair value due to the short maturity of these items.
The interest rates payable on loans and borrowings disclosed above reflect the coupons on the underlying issued loans and borrowings and not the interest rates achieved through applying associated cross-currency and interest rate swaps in hedge arrangements.
Loans and other borrowings are analysed as follows: 2017 2016 2015 At 31 March m m m Current liabilities Listed bonds 1,539 2,013 1,422 Finance leases 15 8 13 Bank loans 352 Syndicated loan facilities 619 a Other loans and bank overdrafts 726 1,096 879 Total current liabilities 2,632 3,736 2,314 Non-current liabilities Listed bonds 9,866 10,444 7,642 Finance leases 214 225 219 Bank loans 354 Other loans 1 2 1 Total non-current liabilities 10,081 11,025 7,862 Total 12,713 14,761 10,176 a Includes collateral received on swaps of 702m 2015 16: 553m, 2014 15: 437m.
The carrying values disclosed in the above table reflect balances at amortised cost adjusted for accrued interest and fair value adjustments to the relevant loans or borrowings.
These do not reflect the final principal repayments that will arise after taking account of the relevant derivatives in hedging relationships which are reflected in the table below.

Financial instruments and risk management We issue or hold financial instruments mainly to finance our operations: to finance corporate transactions such as dividends, share buybacks and acquisitions: for the temporary investment of short-term funds: and to manage currency and interest rate risks.
In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade receivables and payables arise directly from operations.
How do we manage financial risk?
Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks: market risk including interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk, credit risk and liquidityrisk.
Treasury operation We have a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to manage liquidity and funding requirements as well as our exposure to associated financial and market risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.
Treasury policy Treasury policy is set by the Board.
Group treasury activities are subject to a set of controls appropriate for the magnitude of borrowing, investments and group-wide exposures.
The Board has delegated authority to operate these policies to a series of panels responsible for the management of key treasury risks and operations.
Appointment to and removal from the key panels requires approval from two of the following: the chairman, the chief executive or the group finance director.
There has been no change in the nature of our risk profile between 31March 2017 and the date of approval of these financial statements.
How do we manage interest rate risk?
Management policy Interest rate risk arises primarily from our long-term borrowings.
Interest cash flow risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates, partially offset by cash held at variable rates.
Fair value interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at fixed rates.
Our policy, as set by the Board, is to ensure that at least 70% of ongoing net debt is at fixed rates.
Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operation while long-term interest rate management decisions require further approval by the group finance director, director of treasury and risk management or the group treasurer who each have been delegated such authority from the Board.
Hedging strategy In order to manage our interest rate profile, we have entered into cross-currency and interest rate swap agreements to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are fixed.
The duration of the swap agreements matches the duration of the debt instruments.
The majority of the groups long-term borrowings are subject to fixed Sterling interest rates after applying the impact of these hedging instruments.
How do we manage foreign exchange risk?
Management policy Foreign currency hedging activities protect the group from the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect future net cash flows.
The Boards policy for foreign exchange risk management defines the types of transactions typically covered, including significant operational, funding and currency interest exposures, and the period over which cover should extend for each type of transaction.
The Board has delegated short-term foreign exchange management to the treasury operation and long-term foreign exchange management decisions require further approval from the group finance director, director of treasury and risk management or the group treasurer.
Hedging strategy A significant proportion of our external revenue and costs arise within the UK and are denominated in Sterling.
Our non-UK operations generally trade and are funded in their functional currency which limits their exposure to foreign exchange volatility.
We enter into forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency, capital purchases, purchase and sale commitments, interest expense and foreign currency investments.
The commitments hedged are principally denominated in US Dollar, Euro and Asia Pacific region currencies.
As a result, our exposure to foreign currency arises mainly on non-UK subsidiary investments and on residual currency trading flows.
We use cross-currency swaps to swap foreign currency borrowings into Sterling.

Sensitivity analysis The income statement and shareholders equity are exposed to volatility arising from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
To demonstrate this volatility, management have concluded that the following are reasonable benchmarks for performing sensitivity analysis: for interest, a 1% increase in interest rates and parallel shift in yield curves across Sterling, US Dollar and Euro currencies: and for foreign exchange, a 10% strengthening weakening in Sterling against other currencies.
The impact of a 1% change in interest rates on the groups annual net finance expense was insignificant in 2016 17, 2015 16 and 2014 15.
The impact on equity, before tax, of a 1% increase in interest rates is as detailed below: 2017 2016 2015 m m m Increase Increase Increase At 31 March reduce reduce reduce Sterling interest rates 554 626 428 US Dollar interest rates 348 374 400 Euro interest rates 229 263 34 A 1% decrease in interest rates would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction.
Our exposure to foreign exchange volatility in the income statement, after hedging, and within shareholders equity excluding translation exposures was insignificant in 2016 17, 2015 16 and 2014 15. Credit ratings We continue to target a BBB Baa1 credit rating over the medium term.
We regularly review the liquidity of the group and our funding strategy takes account of medium-term requirements.
These include the pension deficit and shareholder distribution.
Our December 2030 bond contains covenants which require us to pay higher rates of interest since our credit ratings fell below A3 in the case of Moodys or A in the case of Standard & Poors S&P.
Additional interest of 0.25% per year accrues for each ratings category downgrade by each agency below those levels effective from the next coupon date following a downgrade.
Based on the total notional value of debt outstanding of 2.1bn at 31 March 2017, our finance expense would increase decrease by approximately 11m a year if the groups credit rating were to be downgraded upgraded, respectively, by one credit rating category by both agencies.
Our credit ratings were as detailed below: 2017 2016 2015 At 31 March Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Rating agency Moodys Baa1 Negative Baa2 Positive Baa2 Positive Standard & Poors BBB Negative BBB Positive BBB Stable How do we manage liquidity risk?
Management policy We maintain liquidity by entering into short and long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements, determined using short and long-term cash forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12-month period.
On at least an annual basis the Board reviews and approves the long-term funding requirements of the group and on an ongoing basis considers any related matters.
We manage refinancing risk by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any specified period and having appropriate strategies in place to manage refinancing needs as they arise.
The maturity profile of our loans and borrowings at 31 March 2017 is disclosed in note 25.
We have term debt maturities of 1.8bn in 2017 18.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Our treasury operation reviews and manages our short-term requirements within the parameters of the policies set by theBoard.
We hold cash, cash equivalents and current investments in order to manage short-term liquidity requirements.
At 31 March 2017 we had undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 2.1bn 2015 16: 1.5bn, 2014 15: 1.5bn maturing in September 2021.
We also have an undrawn 364-day revolving bridge facility of 1.5bn maturing in March 2018, with the option to renew to March 2019.
The bridge facility contains mandatory prepayment and cancellation clauses in certain circumstances, such as the issuance of public debt securities.

How do we manage credit risk?
Management policy Our exposure to credit risk arises from financial assets transacted by the treasury operation primarily derivatives, investments, cash and cash equivalents and from trading-related receivables.
For treasury-related balances, the Boards defined policy restricts exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits based on the credit quality as defined by Moodys and S&P.
The minimum credit ratings permitted with counterparties in respect of new transactions are A3 A for long-term and P1 A1 for short-term investments.
If counterparties in respect of existing transactions fall below the permitted criteria we will take action where appropriate.
The treasury operation continuously reviews the limits applied to counterparties and will adjust the limit according to the nature and credit standing of the counterparty, and in response to market conditions, up to the maximum allowable limit set by the Board.
Operational management policy Our credit policy for trading-related financial assets is applied and managed by each of the lines of business to ensure compliance.
The policy requires that the creditworthiness and financial strength of customers are assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis.
Payment terms are set in accordance with industry standards.
Where appropriate, we may minimise risks by requesting securities such as deposits, guarantees and letters of credit.
We take proactive steps including constantly reviewing credit ratings of counterparties to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on trading-related financial assets.

The credit quality and credit concentration of cash equivalents, current asset investments and derivative financial assets are detailed in the tables below.
Where the opinion of Moodys and S&P differ, the lower rating is used.
The concentration of credit risk for our trading balances is provided in note 17, which analyses outstanding balances by line of business.
Where multiple transactions are undertaken with a single financial counterparty or group of related counterparties, we enter into netting arrangements to reduce our exposure to credit risk by making use of standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA documentation.
We have also entered into credit support agreements with certain swap counterparties whereby, on a daily and weekly basis, the fair value position on notional 1,742m of long dated cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps is collateralised.
The related net cash inflow during the year was 100m 2015 16: 79m, 2014 15: 297m.

Financial instruments and risk management continued All derivative financial instruments are categorised at Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in note 23, with the exception of a derivative energy contract which is classified at Level 3.
The energy derivative was renegotiated during the year and has been designated as a cash flow hedge.
On initial recognition of this contract a loss of 8m was deferred.
The fair value of the energy derivative at 31 March 2017 was a liability of 8m 31 March 2016: nil, 2014 15: asset of 14m.
It has been valued using assumptions on volumes, inflation and energy prices.
Hedging activities Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they meet the criteria for designation as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
Cash flow hedges Instruments designated in a cash flow hedge include interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps hedging Euroand US Dollar-denominated borrowings.
Forward currency contracts are taken out to hedge step-up interest on currency denominated borrowings relating to the groups 2030 US Dollar bond.
The hedged cash flows will affect the groups income statement as interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term of the borrowings seenote 25.
We hedge forecast foreign currency purchases, principally denominated in US Dollar, Euro and Asia Pacific currencies 12 months forward, with certain specific transactions hedged further forward.
The related cash flows are recognised in the income statement over this period.
All cash flow hedges were effective in the period.
See note 28 for details of the movements in the cash flow reserve.
Fair value hedges Gains and losses arising on fair value hedges are disclosed in note 26.
Other derivatives Our policy is not to use derivatives for speculative purposes.
However, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
Derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classified as held for trading and held at fair value through profit or loss under IAS 39.

Compensation of key management personnel is disclosed in note 5.
Amounts paid to the groups retirement benefit plans are set out in note 20.
Financial commitments and contingent liabilities Financial commitments were as follows: 2017 2016 At 31 March m m Capital commitments 889 922 Other commitments 367 481 Device purchase commitments 423 260 TV programme rights commitments 2,644 2,026 Total 4,323 3,689 TV programme rights commitments, mainly relating to football broadcast rights, are those for which the licence period has not yet started.
Future minimum operating lease payments were as follows: a 2017 2016 m m Payable in the year ending 31 March: 2017 642 2018 650 614 2019 610 564 2020 558 517 2021 532 493 2022 505 453 Thereafter 4,305 4,188 Total future minimum operating lease payments 7,160 7,471 a We have revised prior year information to be on a consistent basis.
Operating lease commitments were mainly in respect of land and buildings which arose from a sale and operating leaseback transaction in 2001.
Leases have an average term of 15 years 2015 16: 16 years and rentals are fixed for an average of 15 years 2015 16: 16 years.
Other than as disclosed below, there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees at 31 March 2017 other than those arising in the ordinary course of the groups business and on these no material losses are anticipated.
Weve insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of our operations.
Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.
Commitments and guarantees BDUK Under the Broadband Delivery UK programme, grants received by the group may be subject to reinvestment or repayment to the customer depending on the level of take-up.
Telefnica UK Limited leases Weve provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by Telefnica UK Limited formerly O2 UK Limited prior to the demerger of mmO2 from BT on 19 November 2001. mmO2 plc now part of the Telefnica Group has given BT a counter indemnity for these guarantees.
There is no exposure in the event of credit default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations.
The guarantee lasts until Telefnica UK Limited has discharged all its obligations.
Legal proceedings The group is involved in various legal proceedings, including actual or threatened litigation, government or regulatory investigations.
However, save as disclosed below, the group does not currently believe that there are any legal proceedings, government or regulatory investigations that may have a material adverse impact on the operations or financial condition of the group.
In respect of each of the claims below, the nature and progression of such proceedings and investigations can make it difficult to predict the impact they will have on the group.
There are many reasons why we cannot make these assessments with certainty, including, among others, that they are in early stages, no damages or remedies have been specified, and or the often slow pace of litigation.
228 BT Group plc Annual Report 2017 Annual Report 2017 BT Group plc 229 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 30.
Financial commitments and contingent liabilities continued Italian business Following the groups announcement with respect to our investigation into our Italian business in January 2017, three purported securities class action complaints were filed against the company and certain current and former officers in United States courts.
All three actions are purportedly brought on behalf of purchasers of BT Group ADRs between May 2012 or May 2013 and January 2017.
The actions allege that the company made materially false and or misleading statements between 2012 and 2016 regarding its internal controls, ethics and corporate governance, and financial outlook in its submissions to and filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and other public disclosure.
Plaintiffs counsel have filed motions to appoint lead plaintiff and lead counsel, and decisions on these motions have not yet been made.
We intend to defend these claims vigorously.
The issues in Italy have also resulted in engagement with certain of our regulators and other authorities in the UK and elsewhere.
As would be expected, we are cooperating fully with these bodies including the Italian authorities.
Phones 4U In December 2016, the administrators of Phones 4U Limited P4U started legal proceedings in the High Court in the United Kingdom against EE, claiming 66m in payments under a retail trading agreement, which relate to a revenue share for certain customers prior to P4Us insolvency.
We are contesting these claims and have brought counter-claims against P4U, including damages arising from P4U ceasing trading.
The administrators have also indicated an intention to start separate High Court proceedings, alleging that EE and other mobile network operators colluded to procure P4Us insolvency.
We also dispute these allegations vigorously.
Hutchison 3G Limited In May 2016, Hutchison 3G Limited H3G brought legal proceedings in the High Court in the United Kingdom against EE, alleging breach of contract relating to alleged delays in the roll out of certain free carrier coverage to H3G.
H3G is entitled to this free carrier coverage under arrangements agreed following the merger of Orange and T-Mobile, predecessors of EE.
The litigation is also at a relatively early stage and we are contesting the claims.
H3G claims damages relating to loss of business of 167m, although we dispute that there is a basis for the claim and the substantiation of the claimed damages.
Brazilian tax claims The Brazilian state tax authorities have made tax demands against certain Brazilian subsidiaries relating to the Tax on Distribution of Goods and Services ICMS, an indirect tax imposed on the provision of telecommunications services in Brazil.
The state tax authorities are seeking to impose ICMS on revenues earned on activities that the company does not consider as being part of the provision of telecommunications services, such as equipment rental and managed services.
We have disputed the basis on which ICMS is imposed and the rate which the tax authorities are seeking to apply.
We are currently contesting 35 cases, eight of which are pending appeal to the Sao Paulo Court of Appeal: and the judicial process is likely to take many years.
The current potential total of the claims is 232m.
We are vigorously contesting these tax demands.
Regulatory matters In respect of regulatory risks, the group provides for anticipated costs where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reasonable estimate can be made of the likely outcome.
The ultimate liability may vary from the amounts provided and will be dependent upon the eventual outcome of any settlement.
We hold provisions for regulatory risks of 479m at 31 March 2017.
These provisions cover the following issues: Deemed Consent Deemed Consent is an agreed process between Openreach and its Communications Provider CP customers, which allows Openreach to halt the installation and reschedule the delivery date for providing dedicated business services known as Ethernet in a number of specific circumstances where it is beyond its control.
Ofcom found that Openreach had breached its contractual and regulatory obligations by inadequately and retrospectively applying Deemed Consent to reduce compensation payments to CPs between January 2013 and December 2014.
We hold a provision of 300m for Deemed Consent relating to estimated compensation payments to CPs resulting from Ofcoms deemed consent investigation.
The precise amount will result from discussions with affected parties, and could result in lower or higher payments than the 300m provided.
We also hold 42m within trade payables being the Ofcom fine in relation to their investigation into Ethernet deemed consent, and is therefore certain.
Court of Appeal judgment on Ethernet Dispute On 20 December 2012, Ofcom made determinations resolving disputes between BT and five communications providers C&W Worldwide, Sky, TalkTalk, Virgin Media, and Verizon concerning BTs charges for certain Ethernet services.
The Determinations found that BT had overcharged C&W Worldwide, Sky, TalkTalk, Virgin Media, and Verizon for certain Ethernet services for varying periods from April 2006 to March 2011.
All parties appealed the determinations to the Competition Appeal Tribunal CAT, which largely confirmed Ofcoms assessment of overcharging, and ordered BT to pay interest on the amounts overcharged.
BT and TalkTalk appealed the CATs judgment to the Court of Appeal, the hearing took place in March 2017.
230 BT Group plc Annual Report 2017 Annual Report 2017 BT Group plc 231 THE STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 30.
Financial commitments and contingent liabilities continued On 4 May 2017, the Court of Appeal handed down its judgment, dismissing TalkTalks appeal that Ofcom should have used a different cost standard in assessing cost orientation, which would have resulted in higher repayments to CPs.
The Court of Appeal also dismissed BTs appeal which would have reduced the repayments.
This confirmed our view that no additional amounts were payable in relation to TalkTalks appeal.
Both BT and TalkTalk may appeal the Court of Appeal judgment to the Supreme Court.
Other regulatory matters The remaining provision reflects managements estimates of regulatory risks across a range of issues, including price and service issues.
The precise outcome of each matter depends on whether it becomes an active issue, and the extent to which negotiation or regulatory decision will result in financial settlement.

Investments Total Cost m At 1 April 2015 10,686 Additions 11,029 Disposals 10,971 At 31 March 2016 10,744 Additions 57 At 31 March 2017 10,801 On 29 January 2016, the company acquired the entire share capital of EE Limited EE from T-Mobile Holdings Ltd, which is owned by Deutsche Telekom A. G. DT, and Orange Telecommunications Group Ltd Orange, in exchange for the issue of 1,595m Consideration Shares and 3,464m cash.
The value of the Consideration Shares and cash allotted to DT and Orange at Completion was 10,971m.
Subsequently on 29 January 2016 the company sold its entire investment in EE to its wholly owned subsidiary, British Telecommunications plc, at fair value in exchange for an intercompany loan.
Included within additions is 57m 2015 16: 58m of capital contributions in respect of share-based payments.
The company held a 100% investment in BT Group Investments Limited, a company registered in England and Wales, throughout 2016 17 and 2015 16.
Merger reserve On 29 January 2016, the company issued 1,594,900,429 ordinary shares of 5p at 470.7p per share resulting in a total of 80m being credited to Share capital.
These shares were used as part consideration for the acquisition of EE, which completed on 29 January 2016 note 2 above and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
As a result of this transaction, a merger reserve was created of 7,424m, net of 3m issue costs.
The acquisition of EE was structured by way of a share-for-share exchange and cash.
This transaction fell within the provisions of section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 merger relief such that no share premium was recorded in respect of the shares issued.
The company chose to record its investment in EE at fair value and therefore recorded a merger reserve equal to the value of the share premium which would have been recorded had section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 not been applicable ie equal to the difference between the fair value of EE and the aggregate nominal value of the shares issued.
This merger reserve was initially considered unrealised on the basis that it was represented by the investment in EE which is not considered to be qualifying consideration in accordance with Tech 02 10 Guidance on the determination of realised profits and losses in the context of distributions under the Companies Act 2006.
Immediately following the acquisition of EE, the company transferred its investment in EE to its wholly owned subsidiary British Telecommunications plc in exchange for an intercompany loan.
To the extent the loan is settled in qualifying consideration, the related proportion of the merger reserve is considered realised.
Hence the merger reserve is an unrealised profit until it is realised by the settlement of the intercompany loan by qualifying consideration.
During 2016 17 1,775m 2015 16: nil of merger reserve was transferred to realised profit following the settlement of an intercompany loan by qualifying consideration.
Other information Dividends The Board recommends that a final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2017 of 10.55p per share will be paid to shareholders on 4 September 2017, taking the full year proposed dividend in respect of 2016 17 to 15.4p 2015 16: 14.0p, 2014 15: 12.4p which amounts to approximately 1,532m 2015 16: 1,324m, 2014 15: 1,028m.
Employees The chairman, the executive directors and the group general counsel & company secretary of BTGroup plc were the only employees of the company during 2016 17 and 2015 16.
The costs relating to qualifying services provided to the companys principal subsidiary, British Telecommunications plc, are recharged to that company.

PB BT Group plc Annual Report 2017 Annual Report 2017 BT Group plc 251 Alternative performance measures Introduction We assess the performance of the group using a variety of alternative performance measures.
We principally discuss the groups results on an adjusted basis.
The rationale for using adjusted measures is explained below.
Results on an adjusted basis are presented before specific items.
Certain comparatives have been revised, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
We also explain financial performance using measures that are not defined under IFRS and are therefore termed non-GAAP measures.
Thenon-GAAP measures we use are: the trend in underlying revenue excluding transit adjusted for the acquisition of EE, and in underlying operating costs excluding transit adjusted for the acquisition of EE, as well as in EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and underlying EBITDA adjusted for the acquisition of EE: normalised free cash flow: and net debt.
A reconciliation from these non-GAAP measures to the nearest measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is presented below.
The alternative performance measures we use may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Specific items The groups income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results before specific items.
The directors believe that presentation of the groups results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the groups financial performance, as specific items are identified by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.
This presentation is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Operating Committee and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the group.
In determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.
Examples of charges or credits meeting the above definition and which have been presented as specific items in the current and or prior years include acquisitions disposals of businesses and investments, regulatory settlements, historical insurance or litigation claims, business restructuring programmes, asset impairment charges, property rationalisation programmes, net interest on pensions and the settlement of multiple tax years.
Specific items are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
Trends in underlying revenue and underlying operating costs excluding transit adjusted for the acquisition of EE Underlying revenue and underlying operating costs excluding transit adjusted for the acquisition of EE are measures which seek to reflect the underlying performance of the group that will contribute to long-term sustainable profitable growth.
Assuch they exclude the impact of acquisitions or disposals, foreign exchange movements and specific items.
We exclude transit from the trends as transit traffic is low-margin and isaffected by reductions in mobile termination rates.
Given the significance of the EE acquisition to the group, in 2016 17 we are calculating underlying revenue excluding transit adjusted for the acquisition of EE and underlying operating costs excluding transit adjusted for the acquisition of EE, as though EE had been part of the group from 1 April 2015.
This is different from how we usually adjust for acquisitions.
A reconciliation from the increase in reported revenue and in reported operating costs, the most directly comparable IFRS measures, to the movement in underlying revenue and increase in underlying operating costs excluding transit adjusted for the acquisition of EE, are set out below.

252 BT Group plc Annual Report 2017 Annual Report 2017 BT Group plc 253 THE STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION EBITDA In addition to measuring financial performance of the group and lines of business based on operating profit, we also measure performance based on EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and underlying EBITDA adjusted for the acquisition of EE.
EBITDA is defined as the group profit or loss before depreciation, amortisation, net finance expense and taxation.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before specific items.
EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate the operating financial performance of companies, particularly in the telecommunications sector.
We consider EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and underlying EBITDA adjusted for the acquisition of EE to be useful measures of our operating performance because they approximate the underlying operating cash flow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation.
EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not direct measures of our liquidity, which is shown by our cash flow statement, and need to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.
Trends in underlying EBITDA adjusted for the acquisition of EE is a measure which seeks to reflect the underlying performance of the group that will contribute to long-term sustainable profitable growth.
As such they exclude the impact of acquisitions or disposals, foreign exchange movements and specific items.
Given the significance of the EE acquisition to the group in 2016 17 we are calculating underlying EBITDA adjusted for the acquisition of EE, as though EE had been part of the group from 1 April 2015.
A reconciliation from group operating profit, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to group EBITDA and adjusted group EBITDA and a reconciliation of the trends in EBITDA adjusted for the acquisition of EE is provided below.
Areconciliation between operating profit and adjusted EBITDA for our lines of business is set out in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

c Includes EEs historical financial information as though it had been part of the group from 1 April 2015.
Earnings per share We also measure financial performance based on adjusted earnings per share, which excludes specific items.
Basic and adjusted earnings per share, and the per share impact of specific items, are as follows: 2017 2016 2015 Pence Pence Pence Year ended 31 March per share m per share m per share m a Basic earnings per share profit 19.2 1,908 28.5 2,466 25.5 2,057 b Specific items 9.7 961 3.3 278 5.1 406 Adjusted basic earnings per share profit 28.9 2,869 31.8 2,744 30.6 2,463 a The stated profit is the component of total profit which is attributable to equity shareholders excluding non-controlling interests.
