For the Thermal sub-segment the cost of carbon emissions is added to direct fuel costs before dividing by the generated volume.
EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and is calculated by subtracting total operating costs from revenue.
DA is depreciation and amortisation.
EBIT is earnings before interest and tax, and is calculated by subtracting total operating costs, depreciation and amortisation from total revenue.
Supply EBIT margin is a profit margin expressed as a percentage and calculated by dividing EBIT by total revenue and multiplying by 100 for the Supply segment.
Supply PAT is profit after tax but before interest and is calculated by subtracting Group adjusted tax from EBIT for the Supply segment.
Supply PAT margin is a profit margin expressed as a percentage and calculated by dividing Supply PAT by total revenue and multiplying by 100 for the Supply segment.
Volume for Supply is supplier volumes at the meter point i. e. net of losses : Generation volume is the volume of power that can actually be sold in the wholesale market i. e. generation volumes after losses up to the point where power is received under the Balancing and Settlement Code but before subsequent losses.
Average customer numbers sites are calculated by adding average monthly customer numbers sites as defined in the basis of preparation and dividing by 12.

indd 209 16 03 2018 15:50 Financial Statements | Ofgem Consolidated Segmental Statement Financial Statements | Ofgem Consolidated Segmental Statement Ofgem Consolidated Segmental Statement continued BASIS OF PREPARATION The following notes provide a summary of the basis of preparation of the 2017 submission.
The Ofgem CSS segments our Supply and Generation activities and provides a measure of profitability, weighted average cost of fuel, and volumes, in order to increase energy market transparency for consumers and other stakeholders.
These statements have been prepared by the Directors of Centrica plc and its Licensees in accordance with Standard Condition 16B of the Electricity Generation Licences and Standard Condition 19A of the Electricity and Gas Supply Licences and the basis of preparation.
Throughout the basis of preparation the first paragraph number relates to the generation licence and the second to the supply licence conditions respectively.
The financial data provided has been taken from the relevant licensees and affiliates financial information for the year ended 31 December 2017, included in the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 which have been prepared under IFRS as adopted by the EU in accordance with paragraph 3 19A.
The CSS has been prepared on a going concern basis, as described in the Directors Report and note 24 b in the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017.
For the Generation segment, we have included the financial results from all activities that relate to our generation licences with the exception of held for sale activities in relation to renewables up to disposal in February 2017.
For clarity the following judgements have been made: where a sub-segment for example Nuclear or Thermal has undertaken trades to optimise the result of their underlying generation for example through our Energy Marketing & Trading business, the net revenue and result from these trades has been included in the CSS sub-segment as they are considered to be related to our generation licences: the Group has a long-term tolling contract in respect of the Spalding power station, but does not specifically hold the generation licence.
This arrangement provides the Group with the right to nominate 100% of the plant capacity in return for a mix of capacity payments and operating payments.
We do not own the power station and the Group does not control the physical dispatch of the asset.
This contractual arrangement has been accounted for as a finance lease under IFRS and therefore the financial result and volume has been included in the Thermal sub-segment, within the Generation segment: Brigg and Roosecote power stations had their licences revoked on 2 July 2015 at their request because they no longer required an electricity generation licence and are now exempt.
Whilst we do not specifically hold a generation licence for these power stations, the financial results from these businesses have been included in the Thermal sub-segment and hence within the Generation segment: the Group has a 20% equity interest in Lake Acquisitions Limited, which owns eight nuclear power stations through its indirect investment in EDF Energy Nuclear Generation Limited.
Although we do not specifically hold a generation licence for any of the nuclear stations, our gross share of the financial result from this business including any contractual arrangements has been included in the Nuclear sub-segment and hence within the Generation segment: and where power is purchased from third parties for example from wind farms, power stations or other bilateral arrangements and we do not have an equity interest in, or a finance leasing arrangement from an IFRS perspective over the assets that generate this power, the result related to these activities is excluded from the Generation segment.
In all cases, the Generation segment reports direct fuel costs and generation volumes on a consistent basis if the purchase cost is a direct fuel cost, then the electricity generated is reported in volume.
Domestic Supply represents the revenue and associated costs in supplying gas and electricity to residential customers in the UK.
Non-Domestic Supply represents the revenue and associated costs in supplying gas and electricity to business customers in the UK.
As a voluntary disclosure, to aid comparability, a summarised 2016 CSS with margins has been included within the report.
Revenues Revenues, costs and profits of the Licensees have been defined below and prepared in compliance with the Groups accounting policies as detailed in notes 2, 3 and S2 of the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017, except for joint ventures and associates which are presented gross in accordance with paragraph 4 a 19A.
Revenue from sales of electricity and gas for the Supply segment is recognised on the basis of gas and electricity supplied during the year to both domestic and non-domestic customers.
Revenue from sales of electricity and gas includes an assessment of energy supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end unread.
For the respective Supply segments this means electricity and gas sales.
Revenue for domestic supply is after deducting dual fuel discounts where applicable, with the discount split evenly between electricity and gas.
Government mandated social tariffs and discounts, such as the Warm Home Discount, and other social discounts, have also been deducted from Domestic Supply revenues directly, charged specifically to each fuel.
Revenue from sales of electricity for the Generation segment is recognised on the basis of power supplied during the year.
Power purchases and sales entered into to optimise the performance of each of the power Generation segments are presented net within revenue.

indd 210 16 03 2018 15:50 BASIS OF PREPARATION The financial risks and rewards of owning and using the Groups power stations reside entirely in the reported Generation segment.
Other respective segmental revenues not related to the sale of gas or power have been separately disclosed.
Other revenues include: 90.8 million 2016: 81.0 million in Domestic Electricity Supply and 81.0 million 2016: 77.6 million in Domestic Gas Supply primarily relating to New Housing Connections and smart meter installations: 26.8 million 2016: 24.7 million in Thermal principally relating to Supplementary Balancing Reserve SBR, Short Term Operating Reserve STOR and Triad revenue: and 11.0 million 2016: 6.0 million revenue in Nuclear not directly related to energy sales, such as capacity market income and provision of miscellaneous services to other nuclear facilities.
Direct fuel costs Direct fuel costs for both Generation and Supply include electricity, gas, nuclear fuel and imbalance costs.
Energy supply to Domestic and Non-Domestic energy customers is procured at a market referenced price, through a combination of bilateral, OTC and exchange-based trades contracts see table below.
Where energy is procured from within the Group it is also at a market referenced price on an OTC basis.
The market referenced prices used are those prevailing at the time of procurement, which may differ from the price prevailing at the time of supply.
Domestic and Non-Domestic fixed price products are hedged based upon anticipated demand at the start of the contract period.
The majority of the gas and power for Non-Domestic energy and Domestic energy tariff products is purchased in advance see table below.
The exact Domestic and Non-Domestic purchasing patterns vary in response to the outlook for commodity markets and commercial factors.
The Generation segment purchases gas and sells all of its energy at market referenced prices.
Gas for CCGTs is procured at market referenced prices through a combination of OTC and exchange based trades contracts.
The cost to the power stations will reflect market referenced prices at the time of procurement, and so may differ from the price prevailing at the time of physical supply.
How we procure electricity, gas and carbon: Long form bilateral Individually negotiated contracts with non-standardised terms and conditions which may relate to size, duration contracts bilateral or flexibility.
Pricing is predominantly indexed to published market referenced prices, adjusted for transfer of risks, cost of carry and administration.
Over-the-counter OTC Broker supported market of standardised products, predominantly performed via screen-based trading.
These transactions are between two parties, leaving both parties exposed to the others default with no necessary intermediation of any exchange.
An internal OTC price may be provided where market liquidity prevents external trading, with prices that are reflective of market conditions at the time of execution.
Exchange Regulated electronic platform notably ICE, APX, and N2EX where standardised products are traded on exchange through the intermediary of the clearing house which becomes the counterparty to the trade.
Membership of a clearing house is required which entails posting of cash or collateral as margin.
WACOF WACOE WACOG For Generation this represents the weighted average input cost of gas, carbon and nuclear fuel, shown as MWh, used by the Generation business.
Gas for CCGTs is procured at market referenced prices through a combination of OTC and exchange-based trades contracts.
For Supply this covers the wholesale energy cost, the energy element of reconciliation by difference RBD costs and balancing and shaping costs incurred by the Supply licensees.
Again, gas and electricity is procured at market referenced prices through a combination of bilateral, OTC and exchange-based trades contracts.
The cost for the Supply business will reflect market referenced prices at the time of procurement, and so may differ from the price prevailing at the time of physical supply.
Where gas is procured using predominantly indexed bilateral contracts, the fuel cost is then allocated between Domestic and Non-Domestic Supply using annually updated fixed percentages based on the historical split of tariff book volumes.
Gas and Electricity balancing costs are allocated between Domestic and Non-Domestic Supply based on their respective volumes multiplied by an appropriate industry referenced price for example APX or SAP.
For electricity Supply the weighted average cost of electricity is shown as MWh.
For gas Supply, the weighted average cost of gas is shown as p th.
Direct costs Direct costs for Supply and Generation are broken down into network costs, environmental and social obligation costs and other direct costs.
Network costs for Supply and Generation include transportation costs, BSUOS and the transport element of RBD costs.
Supply transportation costs include transportation and LNG costs, including 38.4 million incurred by Gas Domestic Supply in 2017, which enables the segment to secure supply by giving the ability to bring gas into the UK from overseas 2016: 40.8 million.
Environmental and social obligation costs for Domestic Supply include ROCs, FIT and ECO.
Non-Domestic Supply includes the cost of LECs, ROCs and FIT.
Within the Domestic and Non-Domestic segments, the costs of LECs, FIT and ROCs are included within Electricity, and ECO is allocated between Electricity and Gas based on the relevant legislation.
Environmental and social obligation costs for the Generation segment relate to EU ETS carbon emission costs and carbon tax.
Other direct costs for Generation include employee and maintenance costs.

indd 211 16 03 2018 15:50 Financial Statements | Ofgem Consolidated Segmental Statement Financial Statements | Ofgem Consolidated Segmental Statement Ofgem Consolidated Segmental Statement continued BASIS OF PREPARATION Other direct costs for Supply include brokers costs and sales commissions when the costs have given rise directly to revenue, that is, producing a sale.
They also include Elexon and Xoserve market participation and wider Smart metering programme costs.
Indirect costs Indirect costs for Supply and Generation include operating costs such as sales and marketing, bad debt costs, costs to serve, IT, HR, finance, property, staffing and billing and metering costs including smart meter costs.
Indirect costs for the Generation, Domestic and Non-Domestic Supply segments including corporate and business unit recharges are allocated based on relevant drivers, which include turnover, headcount, operating profit, net book value of fixed assets and proportionate use benefit.
For Supply, indirect costs including corporate recharges but excluding bad debt costs are primarily allocated between Electricity and Gas on the basis of customer numbers Domestic and sites Non-Domestic.
Bad debt costs are allocated between Electricity and Gas on the basis of actual bad debt cost by individual contract in the billing system Domestic and on the basis of revenues Non-Domestic.
Other For Supply, depreciation and amortisation is allocated between Electricity and Gas on the basis of customer numbers Domestic and sites Non-Domestic.
For the purposes of Supply PAT, tax is allocated between Gas and Electricity within both Domestic and Non-Domestic Supply based on their relative proportions of EBIT.
Note 4 c of the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 provides details of the adjusted operating profit after tax of the relevant operating segments.
For the Domestic Supply segment, customer numbers are stated based on the number of district meter point reference numbers MPRNs and meter point administration numbers MPANs in our billing system for gas and electricity respectively, where it shows an active point of delivery and a meter installation.
As a result, our customer numbers do not include those meter points where a meter may recently have been installed but the associated industry registration process has yet to complete, as the meter information will not be present in our billing system.
For the Non-Domestic Supply segment, sites are based on the number of distinct MPRNs and MPANs in our billing system for gas and electricity respectively.
Transfer pricing for electricity, gas and generation licensees in accordance with paragraph 4 d 19A.
4 d There are no specific energy supply agreements between the Generation and Supply segments.
The Group continues to ensure transfer pricing methodologies are appropriate and up to date.
In order to meet this requirement, the Group ensured all transfer pricing and cost allocation methodologies were internally reviewed, updated and collated in a central repository.
Internal Audit performed a limited procedures review of the documentation in January 2018 to give comfort over compliance with the Ofgem guidelines.
Treatment of joint ventures and associates The share of results of joint ventures and associates for the year ended 31 December 2017 principally arises from the Groups interests in the entities listed on page 206, with the exception of our investment in Lincs Wind Farm Limited, which was classified as held for sale in the period to disposal.
Under paragraph 5 of the Conditions, the information provided in the CSS includes our gross share of revenues, costs, profits and volumes of joint ventures and associates.
In preparing the CSS, joint ventures and associates which hold a UK generation licence or exemption are accounted for as follows: our proportionate share of revenues of joint ventures and associates has been included within revenue: our proportionate share of the profit before tax of joint ventures and associates has been included within EBIT and EBITDA: and our proportionate share of the generation volumes of joint ventures and associates has been included within the generation volumes.
For each of the above items, our share of the income and expenses of the joint ventures or associates has been combined line-by-line within the relevant item of the CSS.
The Supply segment has investments in associates but because the investees businesses do not relate to the sale of gas and electricity, the share of result revenue of 0.1 million 2016: 0.7 million, EBIT loss of 0.1 million 2016: 0.5 million loss has been included net within indirect costs rather than gross, on a line-by-line basis.
Exceptional items and certain re-measurements Mark-to-market adjustments, profits or losses on disposal, restructuring costs, impairment charges and impairment write-backs that have been identified in the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 are excluded from the CSS.
