Strategic report Governance IFRS financial statements Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 42 Financial guarantees and options continued Guaranteed death and maturity benefits In France, the Group has also sold unit-linked policies where the death and or maturity benefit is guaranteed to be at least equal to the premiums paid.
The reserve held in the Groups consolidated statement of financial position at the end of 2017 for this guarantee is 20 million 2016: 59 million.
The reserve is calculated on a prudent basis and is in excess of the economic liability.
At the end of 2017, total sums at risk for these contracts were 28 million 2016: 38 million out of total unit-linked funds of 19 billion 2016: 19 billion.
The decrease is mainly due to the sale of Antarius during the year.
It is estimated that this liability would increase by 28 million 2016: 51 million if yields were to decrease by 1% per annum and by 6 million 2016: 10 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2017 levels.
For interest rate sensitivities if the resulting interest rates are negative, a floor of zero is not applied.
These figures do not reflect our ability to review the tariff for this option.
ii Italy Guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values The Group has written contracts containing guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values in Italy.
Traditional profitsharing products receive an appropriate share of the investment return, assessed on a book value basis, subject to a guaranteed minimum annual return of up to 4% on existing business, while on new business the maximum guaranteed rate is lower.
Liabilities are generally taken as the face value of the contract plus, if required, an explicit provision for guarantees calculated in accordance with local regulations.
At 31 December 2017 total liabilities were 21 billion 2016: 18 billion, with a further provision of 48 million 2016: 47 million for guarantees.
Liabilities are most sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates.
It is estimated that provisions for guarantees would need to decrease by 1 million 2016: 5 million decrease if interest rates fell by 1% from the end of 2017 values.
For the interest rate sensitivities, if the resulting interest rates are negative, a floor of zero is not applied.
In the local valuation there is no allowance for stochastic modelling of guarantees and options.
d Sensitivity In providing these guarantees and options, the Groups capital position is sensitive to fluctuations in financial variables including foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, real estate prices and equity prices.
Interest rate guaranteed returns, such as those available on GAOs, are sensitive to interest rates falling below the guaranteed level.
Other guarantees, such as maturity value guarantees and guarantees in relation to minimum rates of return, are sensitive to fluctuations in the investment return below the level assumed when the guarantee was made.

The movement during 2017 includes 14,353 million of reinsurance assets UK Life being reclassified as collective investments in unit-linked funds following a restructure of a reinsurance treaty.
2 Change in assets does not reconcile with values in Note 40 a ii due to the inclusion of reinsurance assets classified as non-participating investment contracts, where, for such contracts, deposit accounting is applied on the income statement.
3 The movement during 2016 relates to the recognition of a reinsurance asset following disposal of a closed book of offshore bonds business.
The movement during 2017 primarily relates to Antarius in France.
The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of reinsurance assets and mainly relates to business in the UK, with corresponding movements in gross insurance contract liabilities.
For participating businesses, a movement in reinsurance assets is generally offset by a corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus and does not impact profit.
Where assumption changes do impact profit, these are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 44, together with the impact of movements in related liabilities and other non-financial assets.
