indd 119 04 09 2017 14:01:08 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Accounting Policies Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of its registered office is 24 Cheshire Avenue, Cheshire Business Park, Lostock Gralam, Northwich, England.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below, these have been applied consistently in all years presented.
a Statement of Compliance These consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC as adopted by the European Union, and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with FRS 101 and they are separately presented on pages 160 to 168. b Basis of Preparation The Groups business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 8 to 61.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
Refer to the Corporate Governance Report on page 72 for details.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand, or rounded to the nearest million in the commentary to the notes.
They are prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except where IFRS require an alternative treatment.
The principal variations relate to derivative financial instruments, cash settled share-based transactions, contingent consideration and assets and liabilities acquired through business combinations that are stated at fair value.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of accounting estimates and for management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
These judgements and estimates are based on historical experience and managements best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions under review and the actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.
Areas involving a high degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are, where necessary, disclosed separately.
In the preparation of the financial statements, comparative amounts have been restated to reflect the hindsight adjustments made on the provisional Putney and Brovel acquisition accounting adjustments.
Hindsight adjustments have been made to goodwill, intangibles, deferred tax, receivables and payables.
Critical Judgements in Applying the Groups Accounting Policies and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, the Directors have made the following judgements and estimates that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty which may cause a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are also discussed below.
i Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets The Group determines whether goodwill and indefinite life assets are impaired at least on an annual basis or whenever there is an indication of impairment.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which they are allocated.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
Further detail on the assumptions used in determining value in use calculations is provided in note 14. ii Valuation of Intangible Assets Product rights, commercial relationships and brand intangibles that are acquired by the Group as part of a business combination are stated at fair value at the date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Fair value at the date of acquisition reflects managements judgement of the fair value of the individual intangible asset calculated by reference to the net present value of future benefits accruing to the Group from the utilisation of the asset, discounted at an appropriate discount rate.
Other intangible assets acquired by the Group are stated at cost, which might include future milestone and royalty payments.
The measurement of these reflect managements best estimate as to future performance, discounted at an appropriate rate.
iii Taxation The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon future taxable income and the expected recoverability of the balance.
The estimate will include assumptions regarding future income streams of the Group and the future movement in corporation tax rates in the respective jurisdictions.
In respect of uncertain tax positions, where an outflow of funds is believed to be probable and a reliable estimate of the outcome of the dispute can be made, management provides for its best estimate of the liability.
The estimate of liabilities in respect of current taxation depends on estimates and judgements in respect of whether or not, and the extent to which, items of income and expenditure will be taxable.
iv Non-underlying Items The Group presents a number of non-GAAP measures.
This is to allow investors to understand the underlying performance of the Group, excluding items associated with areas such as acquisition and disposal related expenses and income including amortisation and impairment on acquired intangibles, fair value uplift of inventory acquired, and the reversal of fair value and other movements on deferred and contingent consideration, the profit and related expenses on disposal of discontinued operations, debt refinancing including any loss on extinguishment of debt, impairment of investments and rationalisations.
Judgement is associated with the classification of these items.
The costs incurred in making acquisitions and their integration are deemed to be non-underlying as they dont relate to the sales and profit from ongoing trading activities.

com slugline Dechra Annual Report 2017 - Back.
Accounting Policies continued v Business Combinations Deferred and contingent consideration and assets and liabilities acquired through business combinations are recorded initially at fair value.
Those fair values are based on risk-adjusted future cash flows discounted using appropriate interest rates.
The assumptions relating to future cash flows and discount rates are based on future forecasts and therefore are inherently judgemental.
Adoption of New and Revised Standards There are no new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations mandatory for the first time for the year ended 30 June 2017, which have had a material impact on the financial statements.
New Standards and Interpretations not yet Adopted There are a number of new standards and amendments to existing standards currently in issue but not yet effective, including three significant standards: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers: and IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 are now expected to be effective for the year ended 30 June 2019, with IFRS 16 expected to be effective for the year ended 30 June 2020.
It is not currently practicable to quantify their effect.
There are no other new standards, amendments to existing standards or interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
c Basis of Consolidation Subsidiary Undertakings Subsidiary undertakings are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They cease to be consolidated from the date that the Group no longer has control.
All subsidiary undertakings have been consolidated.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of shareholders earnings and equity attributable to third party shareholders.
The financial statements of all subsidiary undertakings are prepared to the same reporting date as the Company, with the exception of Genera Pharma d. o. o. and Dechra-Brovel S. A. fide C. V. which both prepare local financial statements to 31 December each year, in line with local tax authority regulations.
Associates Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investors share of the change in net assets of the investee after the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets identified as part of the notional purchase price allocation are amortised over the useful life of each asset, with the Groups share recognised as a charge in the income statement.
The Groups share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment.
Distributions received from an associate reduce the carrying amount of the investment.
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired.
If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to share of profit loss of associates in the income statement.
Gains and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Group and its associate are recognised in the Groups financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investors interests in the associates.
Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
d Foreign Currency Translation i Functional and Presentational Currency The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Groups presentational currency, and are rounded to the nearest thousand, except where it is deemed relevant to disclose the amounts to the nearest million.
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
ii Foreign Currency Translation Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, with the exception of differences on transactions that are subject to effective cash flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.

indd 121 04 09 2017 14:01:08 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued iii Foreign Operations The income and expenses are translated to Sterling at the average rate for the period being reported.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to Sterling at the closing rate at the reporting date.
Foreign currency differences on all translations are recognised in other comprehensive income in the foreign currency translation reserve, a separate component of equity.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
On disposal of a foreign entity, accumulated exchange differences previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.
e Accounting for Financial Assets and Liabilities, Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: held for trading financial assets, available for sale financial assets, and loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the assets are held.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date for financial assets other than those held at fair value through the income statement.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Gains and losses both realised and unrealised arising from changes in the value of financial assets held at fair value through the income statement are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets needs to be impaired.
Held for Trading and Available for Sale Financial Assets This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading or available for sale and those designated at fair value through the income statement at inception.
A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or if so designated by management.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are also categorised as held for trading.
Held for trading financial assets are recognised and subsequently carried at fair value.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risks.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date.
Cash Flow Hedges Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income remains there until the forecast transaction occurs.
Net Investment Hedge For hedges of net investments in foreign operations, where the hedge is effective movements are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Ineffectiveness is recognised in the income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.
Trade Receivables Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently stated at amortised cost less appropriate allowances for amounts which are expected to be non-recoverable.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement in operating expenses.
Trade and Other Payables Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Borrowings and Borrowing Costs Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has a right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
122 Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017 www.
Accounting Policies continued f Property, Plant and Equipment Owned Assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Leased Assets Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Assets acquired by finance leases are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until the date the assets become available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: freehold buildings 25 years short leasehold buildings period of lease plant and fixtures 3 to 15 years motor vehicles 4 years The residual value, where significant, is reassessed annually.
g Intangible Assets Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred before 1 July 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the separable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Acquisitions after this date fall under the provisions of Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations 2009.
For these acquisitions, transaction costs, other than share and debt issue costs, are expensed as incurred and subsequent adjustments to the fair value of consideration payable are recognised in the income statement.
Contingent consideration is measured at fair value based on an estimate of the expected future payments.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is not amortised but is allocated to cash generating units and is tested annually for impairment.
Research and Development Costs Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense is incurred.
The Group is also engaged in development activity with a view to bringing new pharmaceutical products to market.
Due to the strict regulatory process involved, there is inherent uncertainty as to the technical feasibility of development projects often until regulatory approval is achieved, with the possibility of failure even at a late stage.
The Group considers that this uncertainty means that the criteria for capitalisation are not met unless it is highly probable that regulatory approval will be achieved and the project is commercially viable.
Internally generated costs of development are capitalised, once the criteria are met, in the consolidated statement of financial position unless those costs cannot be measured reliably or it is not probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group, in which case the relevant costs are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
Where development costs are capitalised, the expenditure includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Acquired Intangible Assets Intangible assets recognised as a result of a business combination are stated at fair value at the date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost including future milestone and royalty payments as applicable less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and other intangibles is recognised in the income statement as an expense is incurred.
Subsequent Expenditure Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates or extends the asset life.
All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.

indd 123 04 09 2017 14:01:08 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued g Intangible Assets Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite or is otherwise stated below.
Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are systematically tested for impairment at each consolidated statement of financial position date.
Intangible assets are amortised from the date that they are available for use.
Assets in the course of construction are not amortised until the date the assets become available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: software 5 to 7 years capitalised development costs 5 to 10 years or period of patent patent rights period of patent marketing authorisations indefinite life or period of marketing authorisation product rights 10 to 15 years commercial relationships 7 years brand 3 to 10 years acquired capitalised development costs 10 to 15 years pharmacological process 10 years The pharmacological process is amortised on a reducing balance method at a rate of 20% over a 10 year life based on the expected profile of future cash flows.
The amortisation of the intangible assets are classified as an administrative expense because they relate to the right to sell and distribute the product.
Within the acquired intangibles the product rights encompass market authorisations, and the capitalised development costs encompass product authorisations subject to regulatory approval.
The pharmacological process is classified as a research and development expense as it relates to the process of taking a product through to registration.
h Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is determined on the first-in, first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity.
i Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
j Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed at each consolidated statement of financial position date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
For goodwill, assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each consolidated statement of financial position date and when there is an indication that the asset is impaired.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash generating units group of units, and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the units group of units on a pro-rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Accounting Policies continued k Dividends Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are approved by the Companys shareholders or, in the case of an interim dividend, when the dividend is paid.
l Employee Benefits Pensions The Group operates a stakeholder personal pension scheme for certain employees.
Obligations for contributions are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Dechra Veterinary Products SAS and Dechra Veterinary Products BV participate in state-run pension arrangements.
These are not considered to be material to the Group financial statements and are accounted for as defined contribution schemes, with contributions being recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
The Group sponsors defined benefit arrangements in certain countries, the most material being a defined benefit pension plan in the Netherlands.
This is a funded career average pay arrangement, where pensionable salary is subject to a cap.
The arrangement is funded through an insurance contract.
The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The liability discount rate is the yield at the Statement of Financial Position date using AA rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
All actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the Groups obligation in respect of a scheme are recognised immediately in reserves and reported in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Share-based Payment Transactions The Group operates a number of equity settled share-based payment programmes that allow employees to acquire shares in the Company.
The Group also operates a Long Term Incentive Plan for Directors and Senior Executives.
The fair value of shares or options granted is recognised as an employee expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis in the income statement with a corresponding movement to equity reserves.
Fair values are determined by use of an appropriate pricing model and by reference to the fair value of the options granted.
The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
At each consolidated statement of financial position date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest.
The impact of the revisions of original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves, over the remaining vesting period.
The fair values of grants under the Long Term Incentive Plan have been determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model, as performed by a qualified third party valuation expert.
The fair values of options granted under all other share option schemes have been determined using the BlackScholes option pricing model, as performed by a qualified third party valuation expert.
When the options are exercised, the company issues new shares.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium.
National Insurance contributions payable by the Company on the intrinsic value of share-based payments at the date of exercise are treated as cash settled awards and revalued to market price at each consolidated statement of financial position date.
Bonus and Commission Payments The Group operates sales incentives schemes for certain employees and third party sales representatives in particular territories.
The related bonuses and commissions are accrued in line with the related sales revenues.

indd 125 04 09 2017 14:01:08 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued m Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognised in the income statement when goods are supplied to external customers against orders and, title and risk of loss are passed to the customer.
As sales arrangements differ from time to time for example by customer and by territory, each arrangement is reviewed to ensure that revenue is recognised when title and risk has passed in full to the customer.
This review and the corresponding recognition of revenue encompasses a number of factors which include, but are not limited to the following: reviewing delivery arrangements and whether the buyer has accepted title we recognise the revenue at the point at which full title has passed: and or where distribution arrangements are in place, recognising when the goods pass to the third party customer for example by reviewing insurance arrangements and recognising revenue at the point at which title has passed.
Rebates, deductions and discounts are provided for in the same period as the related sales are recorded, and are recognised when reliable estimates can be made of relevant deductions and all relevant obligations have been fulfilled, such that the earnings process is regarded as being complete.
We estimate the quantity and value of goods which may ultimately be returned at the point of sale.
Our return accruals are based on actual experience over the preceding 12 months for established products.
For newly launched products, we use rates based on our experience with similar products or a predetermined percentage.
Revenue from third party manufacturing consists principally of the production of goods to customer specification together with the provision of technical services.
Revenues from third party manufacturing are recognised upon completion of the work order, either the completion and agreed delivery of the product, or upon full provision of the service.
Revenue represents net invoice value after the deduction of discounts and allowances given and accruals for estimated future rebates and returns.
The methodology and assumptions used to estimate rebates and returns are monitored and adjusted regularly in light of contractual and legal obligations, historical trends, past experience and projected market conditions.
Market conditions are evaluated using wholesaler and other third party analysis, and internally generated information.
Value added tax and other sales taxes are excluded from revenue.
n Leases Operating Leases Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement evenly over the period of the lease, as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Finance Leases Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability using the effective interest rate method.
o Net Financing Costs Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings, unwinding of discount on provisions, interest receivable on funds invested, gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement see accounting policy e and gains or losses on the retranslation of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues.
The Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset.
The interest expense component of finance lease payments is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
p Provisions Provisions for legal claims, environmental remediation, deferred rent and advanced grants for property, plant and equipment are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required on settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole.
A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
126 Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017 www.
Accounting Policies continued r Basis of Charge for Taxation Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.
Current and deferred taxes are recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to a business combination or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the consolidated statement of financial position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the consolidated statement of financial position liability method and represents the tax payable or recoverable on most temporary differences which arise between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes the tax base.
Temporary differences are not provided on: goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and do not arise from a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, and is based upon tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the consolidated statement of financial position date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is not probable that the related tax benefit will be realised against future taxable profits.
The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each consolidated statement of financial position date.
In calculating any such liability a risk based approach is applied which takes into account, as appropriate, the probability that the Group would be able to obtain compensatory adjustments under international tax treaties.
The estimated annual benefit of global intellectual property and innovation incentives is accounted for within current and deferred tax.
Current and deferred tax credits received in respect of share-based payments are recognised in the income statement to the extent that they do not exceed the standard rate of taxation on the income statement charge for share-based payments.
Credits in excess of the standard rate of taxation are recognised directly in equity.
s Earnings per Share The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share EPS data for its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for the effects of all potential dilutive ordinary shares, which comprise share options granted to employees.
The Group has also chosen to present an alternative EPS measure, with profit adjusted for non-underlying items.
A reconciliation of this alternative measure to the statutory measure required by IFRSs is given in notes 4 and 5.
Operating Segments The Group has three reportable segments, as discussed below, which are based on information provided to the Board of Directors, which is deemed to be the Groups chief operating decision maker.
Several operating segments which have similar economic characteristics have been aggregated into the reporting segments.
In undertaking this aggregation the assessment determined that the aggregated segments have similar products, production processes, customers and overall regulatory environment.
The European Pharmaceuticals Segment comprises Dechra Veterinary Products EU, Apex Laboratories Pty Limited Apex, Genera and Dechra Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing.
This Segment operates internationally and manufactures and markets Companion Animal, Equine and Food producing Animal Products.
This Segment also includes third party manufacturing and other non-core activities sales.

Deferred tax has been calculated using these rates based on the timing of when each individual deferred tax balance is expected to reverse in the future.
To the extent that more deferred tax reverses after 1 April 2020 than expected then the impact will be a greater reduction on the net deferred tax liability.
The Groups future tax charge, and its effective tax rate could be affected by several factors including the impact of the implementation of the OECDs Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS actions.

The carrying value at 30 June 2017 was 0.3 million with a remaining amortisation period of 1.5 years.
The rights to Equidone, which was launched in the US during 2011, has a carrying value of 0.4 million with a remaining amortisation period of 4 years.
The in-licensed products within EU and Canada acquired in 2016 had a carrying value of 0.7 million and 0.4 million respectively, with remaining amortisation periods of 3.5 years and 8.5 years respectively.
During the year, 0.3 million was added to patent rights for new in-licenced products within EU, with a remaining amortisation period of 4.5 years.
0.8 million of the marketing authorisations relate to the Vetivex range of products.
Ownership of the marketing authorisations rests with the Group in perpetuity.
There are not believed to be any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit their useful lives.
Vetivex is an established range of products which are relatively simple in nature and there are a limited number of players in the market.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is appropriate that the marketing authorisations are treated as having indefinite lives for accounting purposes.
Goodwill is allocated across cash generating units that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Key assumptions made in this respect are given in note 14.

Impairment Reviews Goodwill and indefinite life assets are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indications that amounts might be impaired.
The impairment tests involve determining the recoverable amount of the relevant asset or cash generating unit, which corresponds to the higher of the fair value less costs to sell or its value in use.
In the Groups case, the recoverable amount is based on the value in use calculations.
Acquired intangible assets that are being amortised are reviewed for indicators of impairment annually, and in the event that impairment indicators exist, a full value in use calculation is performed.
Despite the current year sales growth, given the previous sales decline of our FAP products, the impairment indicator assessment for FAP assets was given particular attention.
A review was performed to ensure that the individual products capitalised are reflective of the sales growth in the period and that no impairment indicators exist.
No impairment was recognised on these assets.
Value in use calculations are performed by forecasting the future cash flows attributable to the asset being tested or the relevant cash generating unit in respect of goodwill.
The forecast cash flows are discounted at an appropriate rate as described below.
The cash flow forecasts are derived as follows: The latest available Board-approved business plan for the first two years: The business plan is extrapolated by applying a growth rate of between 0% and 3% 2016: 3% per annum in years three and four: and Thereafter, a terminal value is calculated based on year four cash flows, and assuming a long term growth rate of 0% 2016: 0%.
The projections covered a period of four years as we believe this to be the most appropriate timescale over which to review and consider annual performances before applying a fixed terminal value.
Value in use calculations were performed at 30 June 2017 for the following assets: 2017 Goodwill Indefinite Pre-tax carrying life assets Total discount value carrying value value rate Cash generating unit 000 000 000 % Dechra Veterinary Products EU 72,307 957 73,264 11.7 Dechra Veterinary Products NA 53,596 53,596 14.5 Dechra Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Skipton 2,231 2,231 13.2 128,134 957 129,091 2016 Goodwill carrying Indefinite Pre-tax value life assets Total discount restated carrying value value rate Cash generating unit 000 000 000 % Dechra Veterinary Products EU 54,510 853 55,363 12.3 Dechra Veterinary Products NA 56,438 56,438 13.5 Dechra Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Skipton 2,231 2,231 11.1 113,179 853 114,032 Key Assumptions The key assumptions implicit in the impairment review are those regarding the Board-approved business plan, medium and long term growth rates and the discount rate.
The Board-approved business plan incorporates a number of key input assumptions, most notably regarding market growth expectations, the competitive and legislative environments, lifecycle management, selling prices, product margins and direct costs.
The assumptions applied in the business plan are based on past experience and the Groups expectation of future market changes and, where applicable, are consistent with external sources of information.
The medium and long term growth rates of 2-3% and 0% respectively reflect a cautious estimate of expected future growth in the Groups markets, are no higher than those implicit in the Groups strategic planning process, and do not exceed the long term growth rates in the countries in which each CGU operates.
The pre-tax discount rates have been estimated using a market participant rate, which is adjusted after consideration of market information, and risk adjusted dependent upon the specific circumstances of each asset or cash generating unit.
Sensitivity Analysis We have performed sensitivity analyses around the key assumptions and have concluded that no reasonable changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to be less than the carrying value.
An increase in the pre-tax discount rate of 10% and a reduction in the growth rate to nil would still not result in the requirement for an impairment provision.

The funding has been recognised at amortised cost and is being utilised over the life of the property, plant and equipment.
On the acquisition of Genera, the Group acquired a fair value provision to address existing legal and environmental compliance.
A provision is recognised at the present value of the costs to be incurred for the remediation of the manufacturing site.
Employee Benefit Obligations The Group sponsors defined benefit arrangements in certain countries, the most material being a defined benefit pension plan in the Netherlands.
The arrangement is financed through an insurance contract.
The other defined benefit pension arrangements operated by the Company are unfunded: Jubilee awards of 182,000 2016: 187,000 for employees in the Netherlands are recognised within other payables in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 30 June 2017.
The pension cost relating to the defined benefit pension arrangement in the Netherlands is assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The major actuarial assumptions used by the actuary were: 2017 2016 Discount rate 2.10% 1.50% Inflation assumption 1.80% 1.80% Salary growth 2.30% 2.30% Rate of increase in accrued pensions of active members 0.80% 1.00% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 0.00% 0.00% Rate of increase in pensions in deferment 0.00% 0.00% In valuing the liabilities of the pension scheme at 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2016, mortality assumptions have been made as indicated below.
The mortality assumption follows the Prognosetafel AG2016 2016: Prognosetafel AG2014 mortality tables with an experience adjustment in line with the ES-P2 tables as published by the Dutch Alliance of Insurers.
Assumed life expectations on retirement age Male Female Retiring today age 67 19.6 21.8 Retiring in 20 years age 47 21.9 24.2 The assumptions used by the Group are the best estimates chosen by the Directors from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

Employee Benefit Obligations continued Scheme Assets The Groups defined benefit pension scheme in the Netherlands is financed through an insurance contract.
Under this contract, a market price for the assets in respect of this insurance contract is not available.
In accordance with IAS 19 for such insurance policies, an asset value has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows.
The discount rate used for this calculation reflects the risk associated with the scheme assets and the maturity or expected disposal date of those assets.
The fair value of the schemes assets is as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 Total fair value of assets 14,898 13,639 Actual return on scheme assets 230 194 Discount rate used to value assets 2.10% 1.50% The long term rate of return on pension plan assets is determined by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over the strategic asset allocation as at the year end.
This rate of return is then adjusted for any expected profit sharing based on market related returns on notional loans.
The schemes assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments or any property occupied by or other assets used by the Group.
The employer has a contract with the insurance company  to cover the committed pension benefits.
The employer contributions expected to be paid into the scheme for the next financial period amount to 680,069 2016: 630,000.
History of Amounts in the Current Period 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 000 000 000 000 000 Present value of funded defined benefit obligations 17,907 17,360 7,210 5,927 4,722 Fair value of scheme assets 14,898 13,639 5,899 4,857 3,726 Deficit in the scheme 3,009 3,721 1,311 1,070 996 The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to change in the weighted principal assumptions is: Impact on defined benefit obligation Change in assumption Increase in assumption Decrease in assumption Discount rate 0.25% Decrease by 6.8% Increase by 7.4% Salary growth rate 0.25% Increase by 0.7% Decrease by 0.7% Inflation rate 0.25% Increase by 0.2% Decrease by 0.3% Increase by 1 year Decrease by 1 year in assumption in assumption Life expectancy Increase by 2.7% Decrease by 2.7% The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of financial position.

Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures The Groups financial instruments comprise cash deposits, bank loans and overdrafts, finance lease obligations, derivatives used for hedging purposes and trade receivables and payables.
Treasury Policy The Group reports in Sterling and pays dividends out of Sterling profits.
The role of the Groups treasury activities is to manage and monitor the Groups external and internal funding requirements and financial risks in support of the Groups corporate activities.
The Board of Directors has approved a policy which governs all treasury activities.
The Group uses a variety of financial instruments, including derivatives, to finance its operations and to manage market risks from these operations.
Derivatives, principally comprising forward foreign currency contracts, foreign currency options and interest rate swaps, are used to hedge against changes in foreign currencies and interest rates.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are also used in the management of foreign currency risk.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and the Groups treasury policy specifically prohibits such activity.
All transactions in financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities, not for speculation.
Capital Management The capital structure of the Group consists of net borrowings and shareholders equity.
At 30 June 2017, net borrowing was 120.0 million 2016: net borrowing was 116.6 million, whilst shareholders equity was 302.6 million 2016: 276.6 million.
The Group maintains a strong capital base so as to maintain investors, creditors and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Group manages its capital structure to maintain a prudent balance between debt and equity that allows sufficient headroom to finance the Groups product development programme and appropriate acquisitions.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
The Group operates globally, primarily through subsidiary companies established in the markets in which the Group trades.
The Groups operating subsidiaries are generally cash generative and none are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
There are financial covenants associated with the Groups borrowings, which are interest cover, and net debt to underlying EBITDA.
The Group complied with these covenants in 2017 and 2016.
Operating cash flow is used to fund investment in the development of new products as well as to make the routine outflows of capital expenditure, tax, dividends and repayment of maturing debt.
The Groups policy is to maintain borrowing facilities centrally which are then used to finance the Groups operating subsidiaries, either by way of equity investments or loans.
Financial Risk Management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: liquidity risk market risk credit risk This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, and the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not have sufficient funds to meet liabilities as they fall due.
Cash flows and covenants of the Group are monitored quarterly.
These are reviewed to ensure sufficient financial headroom exists for at least a 12 month period.
The Group manages its funding requirements through the following lines of credit: 205.0 million multi-currency revolving credit facility: 4.7 million bank loans: and various finance leases.
The Groups revised borrowing facilities at 30 June 2017 are detailed in note 21.
Refer to note 35 for events after the reporting period for changes in the facility.

Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures continued Market Risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates or interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holding of financial instruments.
Interest Rate Risk Management The majority of the Groups borrowings bear interest at floating rates linked to base rate or LIBOR and are consequently exposed to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group has hedged interest rate risk on a proportion of its revolving credit facility by means of an interest rate swap arrangement whereby the Groups exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR is fixed at a rate of 1.8% on the revolving credit facility.
The amount of the revolving credit outstanding at 30 June 2017 was 176.8 million at the year end exchange rates 2016: 151.6 million.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management Foreign currency transaction exposure arising on normal trade flows is not hedged.
The Group matches receipts and payments in the relevant foreign currencies as far as possible.
To this end, bank accounts are maintained for all the major currencies in which the Group trades.
Translational exposure in converting the income statements of foreign subsidiaries into the Groups presentational currency of Sterling is not hedged.
The Group hedges selectively expected currency cash flows outside normal trading activities.
During the previous year the Group designated a US dollar loan of $120.0 million, as a net investment hedge of US dollar net assets.
Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be 65.2 million 2016: 67.4 million, which is the total carrying value of the Groups financial assets excluding cash and cash equivalents.
Cash is only deposited with highly rated banks in line with our treasury policy.
The Group offers trade credit to customers in the normal course of business.
Trade and bank references are obtained prior to extending credit.
Our principal customers are pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors.
The failure of a large wholesaler could have a material adverse impact on the Groups financial results.
The largest customer of the Group sits within the NA Pharmaceuticals segment and accounted for approximately 15.4% of gross trade receivables at 30 June 2017 2016: 11.8%.
This customer accounted for 18.5% 2016: 14.5% of total Group revenues.
One other customers accounted for more than 10% of total Group revenues 2016: none.
Receivables are written off when management considers the debt to be no longer recoverable.
Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities The following table presents the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2016.
The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: Cash and cash equivalents approximated to the carrying amount.
Forward exchange contracts based on market price and exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Available for sale financial instruments based on the market rates at year end.
Derivatives Interest rate swaps based upon the amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the instrument at the balance sheet date, being the market price of the instrument.
Receivables and payables approximated to the carrying amount.
Bank loans and overdrafts based upon discounted cash flows using discount rates based upon facility rates renegotiated at the year end.
Finance lease obligations based upon discounted cash flows using discount rates based upon the Groups cost of borrowing at the balance sheet date.

Foreign Currency Risk The Group has significant cash flows and net financial assets and liabilities in Danish Krone, US Dollar and Euro.
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits of non-Sterling businesses.
The Group is hedging certain foreign currency translations through the designation of a US dollar loan as a net investment hedge of US dollar net assets.
The following table shows the impact on the Groups profit after taxation of a 10% appreciation of Sterling against each of these currencies compared to the rates prevailing at the year end date.
In this analysis, only financial assets and liabilities held on the balances sheet at the year end are assessed and are only considered sensitive to foreign exchange rates where they are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.
There is no impact on other equity reserves.

Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures continued The sensitivities above represent the Directors view of reasonably possible changes in each risk variable, not worst case scenarios or stress tests.
The outputs from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the impact of the effect of changes in market risks assuming that the specified changes occur at the year end and are applied to the risk exposures at that date.
Accordingly, they show the impact on profitability and the balance sheet from such movements.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimates due to commercial actions taken to mitigate any potential losses from such rate movements, to the interaction of more than one sensitivity occurring and to further developments in global financial markets.
As such, this table should not be considered as a projection of likely future gains and losses.

Share-based Payments During the year, the Company operated the Unapproved Share Option Scheme, the Approved Share Option Scheme, the Long Term Incentive Plan and the Save As You Earn SAYE Share Option Scheme as described below: Unapproved and Approved Share Option Schemes Under these Schemes, options are granted to certain Executives and employees of the Group excluding Executive Directors to purchase shares in the Company at a price fixed at the average market value over the three days prior to the date of grant.
For the options to vest, there must be an increase in earnings per share of at least 12% above the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index RPI over a three year period.
Once vested, options must be exercised within ten years of the date of grant.
Long Term Incentive Plan Vesting is dependent on two performance conditions which must be satisfied over a three year performance period commencing from the start of the financial year within which the award is granted.
50% of the award will vest dependent on the Companys TSR performance against an appropriate comparator group.
50% of the award will vest subject to a performance condition based on annual earnings per share targets.
Each of the TSR and EPS elements is subject to an additional ROCE underpin.
Unless the Companys ROCE is 10% or more in the final year of the performance period, the award will lapse in full.
SAYE Option Scheme This scheme is open to all UK employees.
Participants save a fixed amount of up to 500 per month for either three or five years and are then able to use these savings to buy shares in the Company at a price fixed at a 20% discount to the market value at the start of the savings period.
Prior to 16 October 2012, participants were able to save for a seven year period.
The SAYE options must ordinarily be exercised within six months of the completion of the relevant savings period.
The exercise of these options is not subject to any performance criteria.

Acquisitions continued The goodwill of 9.9 million arising from the acquisition consists of technical expertise of the assembled workforce, access to the Australasian and Asia Pacific regions to continue geographical expansion, and future sales expected to be achieved through the registration of Dechra products in these countries.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Acquisition related costs included in operating expenses amounted to 1.6 million.
Apexs results are reported within the EU Pharmaceuticals Segment.
Apex contributed 7.1 million revenue and 1.1 million to the Groups pre-tax profit for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
If the acquisition of Apex had been completed on the first date of the financial year, the contribution to Group revenues for the period would have been 9.9 million and the Group pre-tax profit would have been 2.1 million.
Prior Year Acquisitions In the prior year the Group acquired Putney and Brovel.
The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired have been reconsidered as part of the hindsight period.
In relation to Putney, there was a reduction in provisions of 0.4 million to true-up the position at acquisition.
Intangible assets were reduced by 0.8 million to reflect an agreement that at the point of acquisition was not required due to the existence of other supplier relationships.
Hindsight adjustments have also been made in respect of deferred tax assets on losses 2.9 million, inventory 0.2 million, R&D credits 0.6 million, intangibles 0.3 million and receivables 0.3 million.
In relation to Brovel, there was a reduction in receivables 0.1 million and an increase in payables of 0.1 million following a true-up of the final working capital position.
A deferred tax asset of 0.3 million has been recognised following a detailed assessment of the recoverability of these assets.
Following the acquisition of Genera in October 2015, the disclosure of the final fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired have been included in the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2016.
