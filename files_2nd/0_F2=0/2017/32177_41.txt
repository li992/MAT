The table below is prepared in accordance with Companies Act requirements, which is consistent with both the IFRS and the Investment basis.

Tax is charged or credited in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt within equity.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
This may differ from the profit included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
To enable the tax charge to be based on the profit for the year, deferred tax is provided in full on temporary timing differences, atthe rates of tax expected to apply when these differences crystallise.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences can be set off.
All deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets, where appropriate, in accordance with the provisions of IAS 12.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
The main rate of UK corporation tax is to be reduced from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017, and further to 17% from 1 April 2020.
These changes will affect future UK corporate taxes payable and the rate at which deferred tax assets are expected to reverse.

An approved investment trust company is a UK investment company which is required to meet certain conditions set out in the UK tax rules to obtain and maintain its tax status.
This approval allows certain investment profits of the Company, broadly its capital profits, to be exempt from tax in the UK.
Approved investment trust companies are particularly suited for investment vehicles as their tax status allows them to ensure that their shareholders do not suffer double taxation of their returns.
Including a net tax charge of nil 2016: 2 million credit in the fair valued entities, the Group recognised a total tax credit of 3 million 2016: nil under the Investment basis.

It is uncertain that the Group will generate sufficient or relevant taxable profits in the foreseeable future to utilise these amounts and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using an expected rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19% 2016: 19%.

The Group will pay a base dividend of 16 pence per share and an additional final dividend which is based on cash realisations, the investment pipeline and the balance sheet at year end.
The Group will only pay an additional final dividend if gross debt is less than 1 billion and gearing is less than 20%, to maintain its conservative approach.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017 119 Audited financial statements Not es to the accounts co ntinued 9 Dividends continued The distribution policy covers the Groups total annual dividend, which is split between a base dividend 16 pence per share and anadditional dividend.
The dividend can be paid out of either the capital reserve or the revenue reserve subject to the investment trust rules which state that at least 85% of revenue must be distributed by the Company.
10 Investment portfolio Accounting policy: Investments are recognised and fide-recognised on the date when their purchase or sale is subject to a relevant contract and the associated risks and rewards have been transferred.
The Group manages its investments with a view to proting from the receipt of investment income and capital appreciation from changes in the fair value of investments.
All investments are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration given and are subsequently measured at fair value, in accordance with the Groups valuation policies.
Quoted investments are designated at fair value through profit and loss and subsequently carried in the Consolidated statement of financial position at fair value.
Fair value is measured using the closing bid price at the reporting date, where the investment isquoted on an active stock market.
Unquoted investments, including both equity and loans are designated at fair value through profit and loss and are subsequently carried in the Consolidated statement of financial position at fair value.
Fair value is determined in line with 3is valuation policy, which is compliant with the fair value guidelines under IFRS and the International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEV Valuation Guidelines, details of which are available in Portfolio valuation an explanation on pages 158 and 159.
Interest bearing loans accrue interest which is either settled in cash or capitalised on a regular basis and included as part of the principal loan balance.
The capitalisation of accrued interest is treated as part of investment additions during the year.
If the fair value of an investment is assessed to be below the principal value of the loan the Group recognises a fair value reduction against any interest income accrued from the date of the assessment going forward.
Capitalisation at nil value is the term used to describe the capitalisation of accrued interest which has been fully provided for.
These transactions are disclosed as additions toportfolio cost with an equal reduction made where loan notes have nil value.
In accordance with IFRS 10, the proportion of the investment portfolio held by the Groups unconsolidated subsidiaries is presented as part of the fair value of investment entity subsidiaries, along with the fair value of their other assets and liabilities.
A reconciliation of the fair value of Investments in investment entities is included in Note 11.

The holding period of 3is investment portfolio is on average greater than one year.
For this reason the portfolio is classied asnon-current.
It is not possible to identify with certainty investments that will be sold within one year.
Additions from continuing operations include 11 million 2016: 35 million in capitalised interest received by way of loan notes, of which 10 million 2016: 13 million has been written down in the period to nil, as well as cash advanced to Debt Management warehouses.

Other movements and net cash movements include the effects of foreign exchange and 19 million which relates to cash returned 2016: 38 million from Debt Management warehouses.
Quoted investments are classied as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy and unquoted investments are classied as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, see Note 12 for details.
11 Investments in investment entity subsidiaries Accounting policy: Investments in investment entity subsidiaries are accounted for as financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss.
These entities are typically limited partnerships and other intermediate investment holding structures which hold the Groups interests in investments in portfolio companies Investment Entity Holding Companies.
The fair value can increase or reduce fromeither cash ows to from the investment entities or valuation movements in line with the Groups valuation policy.
Substantially all of these entities meet the denition of a Fund under the IPEV guidelines and the fair value and unit of account of these entities is their net asset values.
There were no adjustments to the subsidiaries net asset values in the year.
We determine that in the ordinary course of business, the net asset values of an investment entity subsidiary are considered to be the most appropriate to determine fair value.
At each reporting period, we consider whether any additional fair value adjustments need to be made to the net asset values of the investment entity subsidiaries.
These adjustments may be required to reect market participants considerations about fair value that may include, but are not limited to, liquidity and the portfolio effect of holding multiple investments within the investment entity subsidiary.
There was no particular circumstance to indicate that a fair value adjustment was required and after due consideration we concluded that the net asset values were the most appropriate reection of fair value at 31 March 2017.

Further information regarding the valuation of unquoted equity instruments and debt instruments can be found in the section Portfolio valuation an explanation on pages 158 and 159.
The tables below show the classication of financial instruments held at fair value into the valuation hierarchy at 31 March 2017: Group Group Group Group Group Group Group Group 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 2016 2016 2016 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m m m m m Assets Quoted investments 390 390 297 297 Unquoted investments 1,316 1,316 1,243 1,243 Investment in investment entity subsidiaries 3,483 3,483 2,680 2,680 Total 390 4,799 5,189 297 3,923 4,220 The above disclosure only relates to the investment portfolio and the investments in our investment entity subsidiaries.
The underlying portfolio is valued under the same methodology as directly held investments, with any other assets or liabilities within investment entity subsidiaries fair valued in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
Note 11 details the Directors considerations about the fair value of the underlying investment entity subsidiaries.
Movements in the directly held investment portfolio categorised as Level 3 during the year: Group Group Company Company 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m m m Opening book value 1,243 1,272 1,103 1,082 Additions from continuing operations 213 164 228 95 of which loan notes with nil value 10 13 10 13 Additions from discontinued operations 70 18 Disposals, repayments and write-offs from continuing operations 292 166 288 165 Disposals, repayments and write-offs from discontinued operations 191 24 1 Fair value movement from continuing operations 224 72 218 98 Fair value movement from discontinued operations 3 Other movements and net cash movements from continuing operations 75 86 69 6 Other movements and net cash movements from discontinued operations 19 19 Closing book value 1,316 1,243 1,295 1,103 1 All fair value movements relate to assets held at the end of the period.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017 123 Audited financial statements Not es to the accounts co ntinued 12 Fair values of assets and liabilities continued Other movements include the effects of foreign exchange.
On a continuing basis, unquoted investments valued using Level 3 inputs also had the following impact on the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income: realised losses over value on disposal of investment of 26 million 2016: 10 million realised profit, dividend income of 24 million 2016: 46 million and foreign exchange gains of 63 million 2016: 40 million.
Level 3 inputs are sensitive to assumptions made when ascertaining fair value as described in the Portfolio valuation an explanation section.
On an IFRS basis, of assets held at 31 March 2017, classied as Level 3, 33% 31 March 2016: 28% were valued using a multiple of earnings and the remaining 67% 31 March 2016: 72% were valued using alternative valuation methodologies.
Assets move between Level 1 and Level 3 primarily due to an increase or decrease in observable market activity related to an input which is primarily when an unquoted equity investment lists on a quoted market exchange.
Valuation multiple The valuation multiple is the main assumption applied to a multiple of earnings based valuation.
The multiple is derived from comparable listed companies or relevant market transaction multiples.
Companies in the same industry and geography and, where possible, with a similar business model and prole are selected and then adjusted for factors including liquidity risk, growth potential and relative performance.
They are also adjusted to represent our longer term view of performance through the cycle or our exit assumptions.
The value weighted average earnings multiple used when valuing the portfolio at 31 March 2017 was 10.23x 2016: 9.83x.
If the multiple used to value each unquoted investment valued on an earnings multiple basis as at 31 March 2017 decreased by 5%, the investment portfolio would decrease by 18 million 31 March 2016: 19 million or 1% 31 March 2016: 1%.
If the same sensitivity was applied to the underlying portfolio held by investment entities, this would have a negative impact of 224 million 31 March 2016: 173 million or 6% 31 March 2016: 6%.
If the multiple increased by 5% then the investment portfolio would increase by 16 million 31 March 2016: 19 million or 1% 31 March 2016: 1%.
If the same sensitivity was applied to the underlying portfolio held by investment entities, this would have a positive impact of 215 million 31 March 2016: 172 million or 5% 31 March 2016: 6%.
Alternative valuation methodologies There are a number of alternative investment valuation methodologies used by the Group, for reasons specic to individual assets.
The details of such valuation methodologies, and the inputs that are used, are given in the Portfolio valuation an explanation section on pages 158 and 159.
Each methodology is used for a proportion of assets by value, and at year end the following techniques were used under an IFRS basis: 41% DCF 31 March 2016: 30%, 4% broker quotes 31 March 2016: 18%, 2% imminent sale 31 March 2016: 11%, 10% industry metric 31 March 2016: 10% and 10% other 31 March 2016: 3%.
If the value of all of the investments valued under alternative methodologies moved by 5%, this would have an impact on the investment portfolio of 44 million 31 March 2016: 45 million or 3% 31 March 2016: 3%.
If the same sensitivity was applied to the underlying portfolio held by investment entities, this would have an impact of 7 million 31 March 2016: 9 million or 0.2% 31 March 2016: 0.3%.
124 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017 Financial review, Riskand Corporate Audited financial Portfolio and Overview Private Equity Infrastructure Corporate responsibility Governance statements otherinformation 13 Carried interest and performance fees Accounting policy: Carried interest and performance fees receivable The Group earns a share of profits carried interest and performance fees receivable from funds which it manages on behalf of third parties.
These profits are earned when the funds meet certain performance conditions.
Carried interest and performance fees receivable include amounts receivable from Private Equity and Infrastructure.
Each scheme is separately reviewed at the balance sheet date, and an accrual for carried interest receivable is made once the performance conditions would be achieved if the remaining assets in that fund were realised at fair value.
Fair value of the assets is determined using the Groups valuation methodology and is measured at the balance sheet date.
Anaccrual is made equal to the Groups share of profits in excess of the performance conditions, taking into account the cash already returned to fund investors and the fair value of assets remaining in the fund.
The performance fee receivable from 3iN is based on 3iNs most recently published NAV subject to a performance hurdle and a high water mark.
Carried interest and performance fees payable The Group offers investment executives the opportunity to participate in the returns from investments subject to certain performance conditions.
Carried interest and performance fees payable is the term used for amounts payable to executives onthese investment-related transactions.
A variety of asset pooling arrangements are in place so that executives may have an interest in one or more carried interest plans.
Carried interest payable is accrued if its performance conditions, measured at the balance sheet date, would be achieved if the remaining assets in that plan were realised at fair value.
An accrual is made equal to the executives share of profits in excess of the performance conditions in place in the carried interest plan, discounted to reect the likely actual cash payment date, which may bematerially later than the time of the accrual.
The Infrastructure performance fee is accrued when the Group becomes contractually liable to make payments to the team.
Under IFRS 10, where carried interest payable reduces the fair value of an investment entity subsidiary, that movement is recorded through Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries.
At 31 March 2017, an additional 538 million of carried interest payable was recognised in the Consolidated statement of financial position of these investment entity subsidiaries 31 March 2016: 299 million.

The Plan isapproved by HMRC for tax purposes and is operated separately from the Group and managed by an independent set of Trustees, whose appointment and powers are determined by the Plans documentation.
Membership of the Plan has not been offered to new employees joining 3i since 1 April 2006.
The Plan was closed to the future accrual of benets by members with effect from 5 April 2011, although the final salary link is maintained on existing accruals.
Members of the Plan have been invited to join the Groups dened contribution plan with effect from 6 April 2011.
The dened benefit plan is a funded scheme, the assets of which are independent of the Companys nances and are administered by the Trustees.
The Trustees are responsible for managing and investing the Plans assets and for monitoring the Plans funding position.
As the Plan is now closed to future accrual, measures have been taken to fide-risk the Plan through changes to its investment policy.
The valuation of the Plan has been updated on an IAS 19 basis by an independent qualied actuary as at 31 March 2017.
Employees in Germany and Spain are entitled to a pension based on their length of service.
3i Deutschland GmbH and the Germanand Spanish branches of 3i Europe plc contribute to individual investment policies for their employees and have agreed toindemnify any shortfall on an employees investment policy should it arise.
The total value of these investment policies intended to cover pension liabilities is 1 million 31 March 2016: 1 million and the future liability calculated by German and Spanish actuaries is 23million 2016: 21million.
The amounts recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year and othercomprehensive income for these schemes are a 1 million expense 2016: 1 million expense and a nil gain 2016: 2 million gain, respectively.

The asset restriction relates to tax that would be deducted at source in respect of a refund of the Plan surplus.
The amounts recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in respect of the Plan are as follows: 2017 2016 m m Included in interest payable Interest income on net dened benefit asset 3 3 Included in other income Reduction in past service cost 6 Included in other comprehensive income Re-measurement loss 30 12 Asset restriction 8 4 Total re-measurement loss and asset restriction 22 8 Total 13 5 The total re-measurement loss recognised in other comprehensive income is 22 million 2016: 6 million loss.

The fair value of the Plans assets at the balance sheet date is as follows: 2017 2016 m m Equities 237 204 Corporate bonds 150 174 Gilts 474 594 Annuity contract 182 Other 12 20 1,055 992 The Plans assets are predominantly invested with Legal and General Investment Management in quoted and liquid funds.
The annuity contract is provided by Pension Insurance Corporation as a result of a buy-in transaction completed by the 3i Pension Plan Trustees during the year.
The buy-in, which is a bulk annuity purchase, reduces member longevity risk for those pensioners covered while improving investment returns over the assets used to fund the purchase.
This contract provides an exact match for the member benets insured and covers two in five pensioners.
The fair value of the insurance policy is calculated using the same assumptions and methodology as used to calculate the value of the pension liability as at 31 March 2017.
The Plans assets do not include any of the Groups own equity instruments nor any property in use by the Group.
Changes in the asset restriction were as follows: 2017 2016 m m Opening asset restriction 71 73 Interest on asset restriction 2 2 Re-measurements 8 4 Closing asset restriction 65 71 The principal assumptions made by the actuaries and used for the purpose of the year end valuation of the Plan were as follows: 2017 2016 Discount rate 2.5% 3.5% Expected rate of salary increases 5.8% 5.7% Expected rate of pension increases 0% to 3.4% 3.2% to 3.4% Retail Price Index RPI ination 3.3% 3.2% Consumer Price Index CPI ination 2.3% 2.2% In addition, it is assumed that members exchange 25% of pension for lump sum at retirement on the conversion terms in place at 31March 2017 with an allowance for the terms to increase in future.
The duration of the Plans dened benefit obligation at the accounting date was around 22 years.
The post-retirement mortality assumption used to value the benefit obligation at 31 March 2017 is 80% of the S1NA Light tables allowing for improvements from 2003 in line with the CMI 2012 core projections with a long-term annual rate of improvement of 1.5% unchanged from 31 March 2016.
The life expectancy of a male member reaching age 60 in 2037 31 March 2016: 2036 is projected tobe 33.7 31 March 2016: 33.6 years compared to 31.4 31 March 2016: 31.3 years for someone reaching 60 in 2017.
134 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017 Financial review, Riskand Corporate Audited financial Portfolio and Overview Private Equity Infrastructure Corporate responsibility Governance statements otherinformation 26 Retirement benets continued The sensitivity of the dened benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is: Impact on retirement benefit surplus Change in assumption 2017 2016 Discount rate Decrease by 0.1% Decrease by 10 million Decrease by 10 million Retail Price Index RPI ination Increase by 0.1% Decrease by 7 million Decrease by 7 million Life expectancy Increase by 1 year Decrease by 13 million Decrease by 15 million The above sensitivity analysis is based on changing one assumption whilst all others remain constant.
In practice this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Through its dened benefit plan the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Asset volatility A fall in the value of the Plans assets may reduce the value of the dened benefit surplus and could affect the future funding requirements.
To reduce the volatility of the Plans assets, the Trustees have implemented an investment strategy that reduces the Plans equity holdings by switching them to bonds over time.
The Plans assets are also diversied across different asset classes and during FY2017 it purchased an annuity contract that is an exact match for a proportion of the Plans liabilities.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the Plans IAS 19 dened benefit obligation.
However, the Plan holds a proportion of its assets in corporate bonds and so any increase in the dened benefit obligation would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Plans assets.
Ination risk The Plans dened benefit obligations are linked to ination, and higher ination will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of the Plans assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with ination, meaning that an increase in ination could reduce or eliminate the dened benefit surplus.
Life expectancy The Plans obligations are to provide benets for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the Plans dened benefit obligation.
As the Plan was closed to future accrual of benets by members with effect from 5 April 2011, the Group ceased to make regular contributions to the Plan in the year to 31 March 2012.
The results of the triennial actuarial funding valuation as at 30 June 2013 showed that the Plan had an actuarial surplus of 1 million at 30 June 2013 and as a result the Group was not required to make contributions to the Plan in respect of that valuation.
The contingent asset arrangement entered into during FY2013, details of which are provided in Note 25, remains in place.
The next triennial actuarial funding valuation exercise, based on the financial position of the Plan as at 30 June 2016 commenced during FY2017.
The exercise is required to be completed by 30 September 2017.
During the early part of FY2017 the Group nalised its programme, launched in the prior year, to offer the Plans members exibility inhow they take their pension benets.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017 135 Audited financial statements Not es to the accounts co ntinued 27 Share-based payments Accounting policy: The Group has equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment transactions with certain employees.
Equity-settled schemes are measured at fair value at the date of grant, which is then recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the period that employees provide services, generally the period between the start of performance period and the vesting date of the shares.
The number of share awards expected to vest takes into account the likelihood that performance and services conditions included in the terms of the award will be met.
Fair value is measured by use of an appropriate model which takes into account the exercise price of the option if any, the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option and any other relevant factors.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of 3i Group plc.
The charge is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reect the actual number of forfeitures, cancellations and leavers during the year.
The movement in cumulative charges since the previous balance sheet is recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Liabilities arising from cash-settled share-based payment transactions are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period.
They are fair valued at each reporting date.
The cost of cash-settled share-based payment transactions is adjusted for the forfeitures of the participants rights that no longer meet the plan requirements as well asfor early vesting.
Share-based payments are in certain circumstances made in lieu of annual cash bonuses or carried interest payments.
The cost ofthe share-based payments is allocated either to operating expenses bonuses or carried interest depending on the original driver of the award.
Executive Director Long-Term Incentives are allocated to operating expenses.
The total cost recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income is shown below: 2017 2016 m m 1,2 Share awards included as operating expenses 11 10 1 Share awards included as carried interest 7 5 Cash-settled share awards included within discontinued operations 2 3 Cash-settled share awards 5 4 25 19 1 Credited to equity.
2 For the year ended 31 March 2017, 7 million is shown in Note 5 2016: 8 million and is net of a 4 million release from the bonus accrual.
3 Recognised in operating expenses and or carried interest.
The features of the Groups share schemes for Executive Directors are described in the Report of the Board on Directors remuneration on pages 88 and 90.
To ensure that employees interests are aligned with shareholders, a significant amount of variable compensation paid to higher earning employees is deferred into shares that vest over a number of years.
For legal, regulatory or practical reasons certain participants may be granted phantom awards under these schemes, which are intended to replicate the financial effects of a share award without entitling the participant to acquire shares.
The carrying amount of liabilities arising from share-based payment transactions at 31 March 2017 is 6 million 31 March 2016: 4 million.
For the share-based awards granted during the year, the weighted average fair value of those options at 31 March 2017 was 436 pence 31 March 2016: 457 pence.
The main assumptions for the valuation of certain share-based awards with market conditions attached comprised: Expected Share price Exercise Expected option life Dividend Risk free Valuation methodology at issue price volatility in years yield interest rate Binomial and Monte Carlo models 548p 26% 3 0.10% Black Scholes 555p 31% 0.54 4.0% 1.08% Expected volatility was determined by reviewing share price volatility for the expected life of each option up to the date of grant.

28 Financial risk management Introduction A review of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Risk section on pages 44 to 53.
This Note provides further detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to the Risk section where applicable, and includes quantitative data on specic financial risks.
The Group is a highly selective investor and each investment is subject to an individual risk assessment through an investment approval process.
The Groups Investment Committee is part of the overall risk management framework set out in the Risk section.
The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group and both the Group and the Company share the same financial risks.
Financial risks Concentration risk 3i seeks to diversify risk through significant dispersion of investments by geography, economic sector, asset class and size as well asthrough the maturity prole of its investment portfolio.
Although 3i does not set maximum limits for asset allocation, it does have a maximum exposure limit for the cost of new investments.
This is detailed in the Investment policy on page 95 in the Corporate Governance section.
Quantitative data regarding the concentration risk of the portfolio across geographies can be found in the Segmental analysis in Note 1 and in the 20 large investments table on pages 156 and 157. Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk on its unquoted investments, derivatives, cash and deposits.
The Groups cash and deposits are held with a variety of counterparties with 85% of the Groups surplus cash held on demand in AAA rated money market funds and 4%held in deposit accounts with an initial notice period of greater than 90 days.
The balance is held on short-term deposit with banks with a credit rating of Aor higher.
The credit quality of unquoted investments, which are held at fair value and include debt and equity elements, is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
The credit risk relating to these assets is based on their enterprise value and is reected through fair value movements.
Further detail can be found in the Price risk market uctuations disclosure in this Note and the sensitivity disclosure to changes in the valuation assumptions is provided in the valuation section of Note 12.
Liquidity risk The liquidity outlook is monitored monthly by management and regularly by the Board in the context of periodic strategic reviews of the balance sheet.
The new investment pipeline and forecast realisations are closely monitored and assessed against our vintage control policy.
These are noted in the risk mitigation section on pages 51 and 53 of the Risk section.
The table on the next page analyses the maturity of the Groups gross contractual liabilities.

Market risk The valuation of the Groups investment portfolio is largely dependent on the underlying trading performance of the companies within the portfolio but the valuation and other items in the financial statements can also be affected by interest rate, currency and quoted market uctuations.
The Groups sensitivity to these items is set out below.
i Interest rate risk On the liability side, the direct impact of a movement in interest rates is limited to any drawings under the committed multi-currency facility as the Groups outstanding debt is xed rate.
The sensitivities below arise principally from changes in interest receivable on cash and deposit.
An increase of 100 basis points, based on the closing balance sheet position over a 12-month period, would lead to an approximateincrease in total comprehensive income of 10 million 2016: 10 million increase for the Group and 9 million income 2016: 9million for the Company.
In addition, the Group and Company have indirect exposure to interest rates through changes tothe financial performance and valuation of portfolio companies and valuation of residual debt management investments caused byinterest rate uctuations.
ii Currency risk The Groups net assets in euro, US dollar, Danish krone, Indian rupee and all other currencies combined are shown in the table below.
This sensitivity analysis is performed based on the sensitivity of the Groups net assets to movements in foreign currency exchange rates assuming a 10% movement in exchange rates against sterling.
The sensitivity of the Company to foreign exchange risk is not materially different from the Group.
138 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017 Financial review, Riskand Corporate Audited financial Portfolio and Overview Private Equity Infrastructure Corporate responsibility Governance statements otherinformation 28 Financial risk management continued The Group considers currency risk on specic investment and realisation transactions and has reduced hedging on a consolidated basis over time.

The Investment Committees role in risk management is discussed further in the Risk section.
A 15% change in the fair value of those investments would have the following direct impact on the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income: Investment in investment Quoted Unquoted entity investment investment subsidiaries Total Group m m m m At 31 March 2017 59 197 522 778 At 31 March 2016 45 186 402 633 Quoted Unquoted investment investment Total Company m m m At 31 March 2017 59 194 253 At 31 March 2016 45 165 210 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017 139 Audited financial statements Not es to the accounts co ntinued 29 Related parties and interests in other entities The Group has various related parties stemming from relationships with limited partnerships managed by the Group, its investment portfolio including unconsolidated subsidiaries, its advisory arrangements and its key management personnel.

The Group has exposure to a number of unconsolidated structured entities as a result of its investment activities across its Private Equity and Infrastructure business lines.
These structured entities fall into two categories, namely CLOs and closed end limited partnerships Private Equity and Infrastructure funds.
The nature, purpose and activities of these entities are detailed below along with the nature of risks associated with these entities and the maximum exposure to loss.
CLO structured entities The Group used to manage CLO vehicles as part of its Debt Management business.
These funds predominantly invested in senior secured loans and are nanced by investors seeking credit rated, structured, investment returns.
The Group, as the then manager, invested into the equity tranche of these funds and has retained the stakes that were not sold to Investcorp.
These positions are held at fair value.
The risk and maximum exposure to loss arising from the Groups involvement with these entities are summarised below: Carrying amount Maximum Assets Liabilities Net loss exposure Balance sheet line item of asset or liability m m m m Unquoted investments 49 4949 Total 49 4949 At 31 March 2016, the carrying amount of assets and maximum loss exposure of unquoted investments was 154 million.
The carrying amount of liabilities was nil.
The Group earned distributions of 31 million 2016: 31 million and fee income of 21 million 2016: 33 million during the year from CLO structured entities.
This includes continuing and discontinued operations.
Closed-end limited partnerships The Group manages a number of closed-end limited partnerships, which are primarily Private Equity or Infrastructure focused, in return for a management fee.
The purpose of these partnerships is to invest in Private Equity or Infrastructure investments for capital appreciation.
Limited Partners, which in some cases may include the Group, finance these entities by committing capital to them and cash is drawn down or distributed for nancing investment activity.
The Groups attributable stakes in these entities are held at fair value, fees receivable are recognised on an accruals basis and carried interest is accrued when relevant performance hurdles are met.

30 Subsidiaries and related undertakings IFRS 10 deems control, as opposed to equity ownership, as the key factor when determining what meets the denition of a subsidiary.
If a group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee, then under IFRS 10 ithascontrol.
This is inconsistent with the UKs Companies Act 2006, where voting rights being greater than 50% is the key factor whenidentifying subsidiaries.
Under IFRS 10, 30 of the Groups portfolio company investments are considered to be accounting subsidiaries.
As the Group applies the investment entity exception available under IFRS 10, these investee companies are classied as investment entity subsidiaries.
The Companies Act 2006 requires disclosure of certain information about the Groups related undertakings.
