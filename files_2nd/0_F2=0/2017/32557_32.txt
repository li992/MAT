Financial Statements 181 Notes to the Company financial statements 1 Basis of preparation The parent companys financial statements are prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards, in particular Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101 and the Companies Act 2006.
FRS 101 sets out a reduced disclosure framework for a qualifying entity as defined in the Standard, which addresses the financial reporting requirements and disclosure exemptions in the individual financial statements of qualifying entities that otherwise apply the recognition measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
These are the first financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance with FRS 101.
The Companys transition date to FRS 101 is 13 March 2016.
FRS 101 sets out amendments to IFRS as adopted by the European Union that are necessary to achieve compliance with the Companies Act and related regulations.
These amendments had no impact on the Statement of Comprehensive Income, Balance Sheet or Statement of Changes in Equity for the Company for the year ended 11 March 2017.
The financial year represents the 52 weeks to 11 March 2017 prior financial year 52 weeks to 12 March 2016.
The disclosure exemptions adopted by the Company in accordance with FRS 101 are as follows: The requirements of IAS 7 to present a cash flow statement.
The requirements of paragraph 17 of IAS 24, Related Party Transactions, to disclose information related to key management personnel, and the requirements of IAS 24 to disclose related party transactions between two or more members of a group for wholly owned subsidiaries.
The requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 to disclose information assessing the possible impact of new standards issued but which are not yet effective.
The requirements of IFRS 7 and IFRS 13 for disclosure of financial instruments and fair values.
The financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest million unless otherwise stated.
They have been prepared on the going concern basis under the historical cost convention, except for derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale financial assets that have been measured at fair value.
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and not presented an Income Statement nor a Statement of Comprehensive Income for the Company alone.

They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Subsequent to initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs, these assets are recorded at fair value at each period end with the movements recognised in other comprehensive income until derecognition or impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recycled to the income statement.
Dividends on AFS equity instruments are recognised in the income statement when the entitys right to receive payment is established.
Interest on AFS debt instruments is recognised using the effective interest method.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences, except to the extent where it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit.
It is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures except where the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
