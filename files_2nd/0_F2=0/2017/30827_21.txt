FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Year ended 31 December 2017 1.
Corporate information KAZ Minerals PLC the Company is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales.
The Companys registered office is 6th Floor, Cardinal Place, 100 Victoria Street, London SW1E 5JL, United Kingdom.
The Group comprises the Company and its consolidated divisions as set out below.
The Group operates in the natural resources industry through five divisions, the principal activities of which during 2017 were: Primary country Operating division Principal activity of operations Bozshakol Mining and processing of copper and other metals Kazakhstan Aktogay Mining and processing of copper and other metals Kazakhstan 1 East Region Mining and processing of copper and other metals Kazakhstan 1 Bozymchak Mining and processing of copper and gold Kyrgyzstan Mining Projects Development of metal deposits and processing facilities Kazakhstan 1 The East Region and Bozymchak are separate divisions but have been combined for segmental reporting purposes.
The legal names of the constituent companies within the above divisions are shown in note 36 m. 2.
Basis of preparation The financial statements set out on pages 103 to 167 have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with IFRSs as adopted by the EU.
The Company has taken the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not published the Companys income statement and related notes.
a Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to impact its future growth and operating performance, are set out in the Operating review on pages 27 to 33.
The financial performance and position of the Group, its cash flows and available debt facilities are described in the Financial review on pages 34 to 42.
In addition, note 31 to the financial statements sets out the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital structure, liquidity position and financial risks arising from exposures to commodity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange and counterparties.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate committed borrowing facilities and working capital funds.
The Board monitors the net debt level and liquidity position of the Group taking into consideration the expected outlook of the Groups financial position, cash flows, future capital expenditure and debt service requirements.
At 31 December 2017, the Groups net debt was $2,056 million with total debt of $3,877 million, and gross liquid funds of $1,821 million.
The gross debt consisted of: $1,524 million of the CDB-Bozshakol and Bozymchak facilities, which amortises over the period to 2025: $1,455 million of the CDB-Aktogay US dollar and Chinese yuan facilities, which amortise over the period to 2029, with repayments increasing from March 2018: $600 million of the PXF facility which amortises over the period from July 2018 to June 2021: and $298 million of the DBK facility, which amortises during the period from June 2018 to June 2025.
The Board has considered the Groups cash flow forecasts for the period to 31 March 2019, the outlook for commodity prices, production levels from the Groups operations, its future capital requirements, including the planned expansion of Aktogay, the deferred capital payments to NFC and the principal repayments due under the Groups debt facilities.
The Board is satisfied that the Groups forecasts, taking into account reasonably possible downside scenarios, show that the Group has adequate liquidity to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.
b Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments which have been measured at fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars $ and all financial information has been rounded to the nearest million dollars $ million except where otherwise indicated.
c Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements set out the Groups financial position as at 31 December 2017 and the Groups financial performance for the year ended 31 December 2017.
102 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2017 114 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Subsidiaries are those enterprises controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to direct those activities of an enterprise that most significantly affect the returns the Group earns from its involvement with the enterprise.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in the income statement.
The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset.
In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
This treatment may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recycled through the income statement.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intragroup transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Refer to note 36 m for a list of all the Companys subsidiaries.
d Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC of the IASB, as adopted by the European Union EU, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. e Adoption of new standards and interpretations The following accounting standards, amendments and interpretations, which had no significant impact on these financial statements, became effective in the current reporting period as adopted by the European Union through the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group EFRAG : IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows requires disclosure of changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including changes in cash flows and non-cash changes, such as foreign exchange gains or losses.
This is reflected in note 30 to the consolidated financial statements.
IAS 12 Income Taxes with regards to the recognition of deferred tax assets relating to unrealised losses on debt instruments measured at fair value.
The amendment is a narrow-scope amendment and provides further guidance on the recognition of deferred tax assets including tax losses.
f New standards and interpretations not yet adopted The key new standards, interpretations and amendments, as issued by the IASB are expected to be adopted by the Group once they are effective for application in the EU.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: the IASB effective date is 1 January 2018 and has been endorsed by the EU.
Given the nature of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities, the adoption of the standard does not have a material impact on the recognition and measurement of the Groups financial assets and liabilities nor on the financial position or performance of the Group.
The standard will result in changes in presentation in some disclosures of the Groups financial instruments.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: the standard was issued in 2014 followed by Clarifications to IFRS Revenue from Contracts with Customers in April 2016, both with IASB effective dates of 1 January 2018 and endorsed by the EU.
The Group has reviewed its customer contracts in place at 31 December 2017, to consider the impact of the standard.
In particular, the Group assessed its delivery performance obligations subsequent to the recognition of sales at that date, which were found to be minimal.
The Group also considered the recognition of revenue still subject to final volume adjustments.
The provisionally invoiced sales volumes, on which initial sales recognition is determined, have historically been subject to only minor subsequent volume adjustments such that the variable consideration limitation would be satisfied.
The new standard also provides guidance on the accounting for provisionally priced contracts which applies to most of the Groups sales arrangements although there is no change to the measurement and recognition of revenue compared to the current accounting for provisionally priced contracts.
The impact of the new standard on contracts in place at the year end was not material.
The new standard will require additional qualitative disclosures which will be included in the Groups 2018 financial statements.
IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments: amendments issued in June 2016 effective from 2018 and yet to be endorsed by the EU.
The amendments provide clarification on the classification and measurement of share-based payments.
The standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts: amendments issued in September 2016 effective from 2018 and endorsed by the EU.
The amendments provide entities that issue insurance contracts within the scope of IFRS 4 with two options when applying IFRS 9 in conjunction with IFRS 4.
This standard is not expected to have an impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements due to the nature of its operations.
IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance considerations: issued in December 2016 and effective from 1 January 2018, is yet to be endorsed by the EU.
The interpretation clarified the accounting for the receipt or payment of advance consideration in a foreign currency and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
IAS 40 Investment Property: amendment issued in December 2016 and effective from 1 January 2018, is yet to be endorsed by the EU.
The amendment provides clarity on the transfer to or from investment property and is not expected to impact the Groups consolidated financial statements given the nature of its operations.
com 115 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Year ended 31 December 2017 2.
Basis of preparation continued f New standards and interpretations not yet adopted continued IFRS 16 Leases: the standard was issued in January 2016 with an IASB effective date of 1 January 2019 and has been endorsed by the EU.
The standard changes how operating leases will be recognised, measured, and disclosed by lessees.
The Group will be assessing the full impact of IFRS 16 in 2018 on its financial position and reporting of performance to determine its impact.
Under the new standard, leases currently classified as operating, where material, may be recognised on the balance sheet.
The new standard does not apply to leases for the exploration or use of natural resources.
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments: issued in June 2017 and effective from 1 January 2019, is yet to be endorsed by the EU.
The interpretation provides additional guidance in the determination of taxable profit tax loss, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments under IAS 12.
The Group will assess the impact of the interpretation during 2018.
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts: the standard was issued in May 2017 with an IASB effective date of 1 January 2021 and is yet to be endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 17 will replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and applies to all types of insurance contracts i. e. life, non-life, direct insurance and reinsurance, regardless of the type of entities that issue them, as well as to certain guarantees and financial instruments with discretionary participation features.
Improvements to IFRSs: There are a number of amendments to certain standards following the 2015-2017 annual improvements project which have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
These changes are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The Group has not early adopted any new standards or interpretations.
g Comparative information Where a change in the presentation format of the consolidated financial statements has been made during the year, comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
Figures may have been restated to conform with the current basis of understanding.
Significant accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the course of preparing these financial statements, the Directors make necessary judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Judgements are based on the Directors best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances having regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements.
Estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions applied are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following are the critical judgements and the key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty concerning the future which the Directors believe are likely to have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
However, the Directors do not expect a significant risk of a material change to the carrying value of non-current inventory, decommissioning and site restoration liabilities and taxes, including deferred taxes, over the next twelve months arising from changes in estimates.
Achievement of commercial production Once an operation reaches the operating level intended by management and regarded to be commercial, capitalisation of development costs including borrowing costs ceases, the depreciation of capitalised costs begins and the revenues and operational costs are recorded in the income statement and not capitalised to the balance sheet.
Significant judgement is required to determine when the Groups assets achieve commercial production, including completion of a reasonable period of commissioning, consistent achievement of operational results at a pre-determined level of expected capacity and indications exist that this level will continue, mineral recoveries are at or approaching expected levels and the transfer of the operation from project personnel to operational personnel.
For the Bozshakol operation, commercial production of the clay plant was determined to have been achieved on 1 July 2017.
In making this assessment, the Directors considered the performance of the plant of at least 60% of its design capacity for a three month period, which is broadly consistent with industry practice.
Revenues, production costs and interest incurred on borrowings to finance the project were recognised in the income statement and depreciation of its asset base commenced from that date.
The Bozshakol sulphide plant achieved commercial production on 27 October 2016.
The Aktogay sulphide plant achieved commercial production from 1 October 2017 after consistent production of at least 60% of its design capacity over a three month period.
Revenues, production costs and interest incurred on borrowings to finance the project were recognised in the income statement with the commencement of depreciation of its assets from that date.
The Aktogay oxide plant achieved commercial production on 1 July 2016.
104 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2017 116 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Impairment of assets The Directors review the carrying value of the Groups assets to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment such that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable.
The assessment of whether an indicator of impairment or reversal thereof has arisen requires considerable judgement, taking account of future operational and financial plans, commodity prices, market demand and the competitive environment.
For exploration and evaluation assets held by the Group, indicators of impairment can include: a the right to explore in a specific area has expired and is not expected to be renewed b significant expenditure for further exploration or evaluation activities is not being planned c exploration and evaluation of mineral resources have not led to the discovery or confirmation of commercially viable resource, or d that sufficient data exists to indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered in full from development or sale.
Where such indicators exist, the carrying value of the assets of a cash generating unit or exploration and evaluation asset is compared with the recoverable amount of those assets, that is, the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use, which is typically determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows.
The preparation of discounted future cash flows includes management estimates of commodity prices, market demand and supply, future operating costs, economic and regulatory environments, capital expenditure requirements, long-term mine plans and other factors.
Any subsequent changes to cash flows due to changes in the factors listed above could impact the recoverable amount of the assets.
An assessment of the key external and internal factors, including changes to equity analyst and managements medium and long-term commodity price expectations, exchange rates, cash costs and production expectations affecting the Group and its cash generating units CGUs at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 did not identify any indicators of impairment or reversal thereof.
The Groups CGUs are aligned to the operating divisions as described in note 1.
In assessing commodity prices for indicators of impairment, consideration was given to a range of equity analyst long-term copper prices with a median price of around $6,500 t. Non-current inventories Mining activities that may result in the stockpiling of ore which is not expected to be processed within 12 months of the balance sheet date and is considered to fall outside of the normal operating cycle of the operation is classified as a non-current asset.
The classification of stockpiled ore between non-current and current assets is based on judgements as to the expected timing of processing and on future production plans.
The stockpiled ore is reflected at the lower of cost or net realisable value, with net realisable value subject to estimates of further processing, delivery costs and future commodity prices.
Commodity prices applied in assessing the net realisable value fall within the range of equity analyst commodity price expectations.
Determination of ore reserves and useful lives of property, plant and equipment Ore reserves are estimates of the amount of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the Groups mining properties.
In order to estimate reserves, assumptions are required about a range of geological, technical and economic factors, including quantities, grades, production techniques, recovery rates, production costs, transport costs, commodity demand, commodity prices and exchange rates.
The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled and reviewed by independent competent persons as defined in accordance with the JORC Code.
In assessing the life of a mine for accounting purposes, ore reserves are taken into account where there is a high degree of confidence of economic extraction.
Since the economic assumptions used to estimate reserves change from period to period, and as additional geological data is generated during the course of operations, estimates of reserves may change from period to period.
Changes in reported reserves may affect the Groups financial results and financial position in a number of ways, including the following: asset recoverable amounts may be affected due to changes in estimated future cash flows: deferral of stripping costs which are determined using a waste to ore stripping ratio: depreciation, depletion and amortisation charged in the income statement may change where such charges are determined by the unit of production basis, or where the useful economic lives of assets change: decommissioning, site restoration and environmental provisions may change where changes in estimated reserves affect expectations about the timing or cost of these activities: and the carrying value of deferred tax assets may change due to changes in estimates of the likely recovery of tax benefits.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves, and assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available.
Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, production costs or recovery rates may change the economic status of reserves and may ultimately result in reserves being revised.
For property, plant and equipment depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, the appropriateness of the assets useful economic life is reviewed at least annually and any changes could affect prospective depreciation rates and asset carrying values.
Decommissioning and site restoration costs The Directors use judgement and experience in determining the expected timing and closure and decommissioning methods, which can vary in response to changes to relevant legal requirements and technologies.
The ultimate cost of decommissioning and rehabilitation is uncertain and cost estimates can also vary in response to many factors including the emergence of new restoration techniques and costs of materials and labour.
The expected timing and extent of expenditure can also change in response to changes in ore reserve estimates, processing levels and even commodity prices while future costs are discounted using expected discount rates.
As such, there could be significant adjustments to the current provisions which would affect the future financial performance of the Group.
com 117 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Year ended 31 December 2017 3.
Significant accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued Taxes The Directors make judgements in relation to the recognition of various taxes levied on the Group, which are both payable and recoverable.
Judgement applies particularly to corporate income taxes, transfer pricing, VAT and outcomes of tax disputes, if any, that would affect recognition of tax liabilities and deferred tax assets.
Judgement over recognition also applies to taxes which are recoverable by the Group, principally VAT paid, in assessing its future recoverability and the timing of such recovery.
In making judgements related to taxes, the Directors believe that the tax positions it adopts are in line with the applicable legislation and reflect the probable outcome.
Estimates are made to determine the amount of taxes payable or recoverable, including deferred tax assets.
The tax obligations and receivables, upon audit by the tax authorities at a future date, may differ as a result of differing interpretations.
These interpretations may impact the expected timing and quantum of taxes payable and recoverable and are discussed further in note 32.
Segment information Information provided to the Groups Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and the assessment of segmental performance is prepared in accordance with the management and operational structure of the Group.
For management and operational purposes, the Group is organised into a number of businesses as shown below, according to the nature of their operations, end-products and services rendered.
Each of these business units represents an operating segment in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
On the grounds of materiality, the East Region and Bozymchak segments have been presented on a combined basis for the year ended 31 December 2017 and the comparative information has been restated accordingly.
The Groups operating segments are: Bozshakol The Bozshakol open pit, sulphide concentrator and clay plant located in the Pavlodar region of Kazakhstan and the associated international sales and marketing activities managed out of the UK.
The sulphide concentrator, which sells copper concentrate with gold content as a by-product, was commissioned in February 2016 and achieved commercial production on 27 October 2016 with its revenues and costs being recognised in the income statement from that date.
The clay plant, which was commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2016 and which achieved commercial production on 1 July 2017, is included in the Bozshakol operating segment due to the sharing of infrastructure and mining pit, its relative small size and to reflect the Groups management structure.
The clay plants pre-commercial revenues and costs were recorded against property, plant and equipment until it achieved commercial production from when depreciation of the asset base commenced and interest associated with borrowings used to finance the construction of the plant was expensed.
Aktogay The Aktogay open pit, sulphide concentrator and oxide plant located in the east of Kazakhstan and the associated international sales and marketing activities managed out of the UK.
The sulphide concentrator was commissioned in the final quarter of 2016 and achieved commercial production on 1 October 2017 with its revenues and costs being recognised in the income statement from that date.
Until commercial production was achieved, the revenues and operating costs of the sulphide concentrator were recorded against property, plant and equipment.
The oxide operation, which sells copper cathodes, reached commercial production on 1 July 2016 with its revenues and costs being recognised in the income statement from that date.
The oxide plant is included in the Aktogay operating segment due to the sharing of infrastructure, its relative small size and to reflect the Groups management structure.
East Region and Bozymchak The East Region and Bozymchak are reflected as one operating segment and consists of Vostoktsvetmet LLC East Region, whose principal activity is the mining and processing of copper and other metals which are produced as by-products from three underground mines and concentrators located in the eastern region of Kazakhstan: and KAZ Minerals Bozymchak LLC Bozymchak a copper-gold open pit mine and concentrator located in western Kyrgyzstan and the associated international sales and marketing activities managed out of the UK.
In the current period, Bozymchak did not satisfy the quantitative requirements of IFRS 8 Operating Segments for disclosure as a separate segment and was combined with the East Region operations, given their similar economic characteristics: similar concentrate production processes and as their combined output is toll processed at the Balkhash smelter and subsequently sold to the Groups customers.
In 2016, Bozymchak was reflected as a separate segment.
The comparative disclosures have been restated to reflect the East Region and Bozymchak as a combined segment.
Mining Projects The Groups project companies, who are responsible for the assessment and development of metal deposits and processing facilities.
The segment includes the Koksay mineral deposit.
Managing and measuring operating segments The key performance measure of the operating segments is EBITDA excluding special items, which is defined as earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, depletion, amortisation, mineral extraction tax and royalties, as adjusted for special items.
Special items are those items which are non-recurring or variable in nature and which do not impact the underlying trading performance of the business see note 7.
EBITDA excluding special items is a key non-IFRS measure that the Directors use internally to assess the performance of the Groups segments and is viewed as relevant to capital intensive industries with long life assets.
The Directors also believe that this measure closely reflects the operating cash generative capacity and therefore the trading performance of the business as a whole.
Special items are excluded to enhance comparability of EBITDA excluding special items from period to period.
The Groups Treasury department manages the Groups borrowings and monitors finance income and finance costs at the Group level on a net basis rather than on a gross basis at an operating segment level.
Segmental information is also provided in respect of revenues, by destination and by product.
Segmental information relating to employees is provided in note 8.

2 MET and royalties have been excluded from the key financial indicator of EBITDA.
The Directors believe that MET and royalties are a substitute for a tax on profits, hence their exclusion provides an informed measure of the operational performance of the Group.
The MET incurred at the Bozshakol clay and Aktogay sulphide plants during the pre-commercial production stage of $3 million 2016: $25 million sulphide plant and $22 million 2016: $9 million oxide plant respectively has been capitalised to property, plant and equipment.
MET incurred on stockpiled clay ore at Bozshakol and included within non-current inventories was $32 million 2016: $33 million.
3 The impairment of $16 million arises from the decision not to continue with the smelter study and reflects cost incurred to date.
These costs were incurred in the Mining Projects segment and disclosed in the Corporate Services segment to reflect the write off to the income statement.
4 Depreciation, depletion and amortisation and MET and royalties exclude the costs associated with inventories on the balance sheet.

114 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2017 126 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Effective tax rate The effective tax rate was 23% 2016: 20%.
Tax charges are affected by the mix of profits and tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
The impact of unrecognised tax losses and non-deductible items, which may include impairment losses, increases the Groups overall effective tax rate.
The following factors impacted the effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2017: Unrecognised tax losses Deferred tax assets have not been recognised on available tax losses at Bozymchak, as the entity is subject to a CIT rate of 0% following the introduction of a tax on gold revenues.
As such, the prior period tax losses will not be available for use from November 2017.
In the UK, unrecognised tax losses in 2017 arise from the application of the interest limitation rules which has restricted the amount of interest deductible in the UK.
The restricted interest was not recognised as a deferred tax asset given the uncertainty over its full utilisation in future years.
In 2016, deferred tax assets were not recognised on tax losses at Bozymchak, given the five year statute of limitations and as it was uncertain whether it would generate sufficient taxable profits after capital allowances to utilise these losses, and in the United Kingdom, given limitations on the carry forward of Group losses.
Other non-deductible expenses Non-deductible items mainly comprise of impairment losses arising from the write off of assets in the East Region and the smelter feasibility study costs and from certain social community investments.
The 2016 non-deductible expenses mainly comprise of supplier replaced equipment treated as gains for tax purposes and social community investments and contributions, which are not generally deductible and impairment charges and provisions recognised against various assets most notably in the East Region operations.

Accumulated tax losses and other deductible temporary differences which were also unrecognised prior to the change in the legislation, cannot be utilised to offset the tax on gold revenues in the future.
ii United Kingdom Certain companies in the UK have tax losses and unutilised interest expenses that can be carried forward and used against future taxable profits and interest income.
There is no time restriction over the utilisation of tax losses and deferred interest.
Where there is sufficient certainty that a taxable profit will arise in these companies against which the losses, or interest income can be offset, deferred tax assets are recognised.
d Unrecognised deferred tax liability The gross temporary differences in respect of the undistributed reserves of the Groups Kazakhstan subsidiaries, as shown in their statutory accounts prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and translated at the historical rate where relevant, are as follows: $ million 2017 2016 1 Undistributed reserves of subsidiaries subject to withholding tax on distribution 4,902 4,548 1 The reserves are presented at historical exchange rates.

Provision for closure and site restoration $ million 2017 2016 At 1 January 57 9 1 Arising during the year 5 47 Unwinding of discount 4 1 Net exchange adjustment 1 At 31 December 67 57 1 In 2017, the amounts capitalised to property, plant and equipment and mining assets were $6 million and $nil respectively 2016: capitalised $25 million and $17 million with a $1 million reduction in the provision recognised in the income statement 2016: $5 million recognised as an expense.
The costs of decommissioning and reclamation of mines and processing facilities within the Group are based on the current obligations under Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan legislation governing closure and rehabilitation.
The provision represents the discounted values of the estimated costs to decommission and reclaim the mines based on the current estimated life of mine of each deposit.
The present value of these provisions has been calculated using discount rates of 6.7% in Kazakhstan 2016: 7.6% and 8.2% in Kyrgyzstan 2016: 9.1%.
The liability usually becomes payable after the end of the useful life of each mine which ranges from three years to around 50 years.
Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning and reclamation alternatives, the levels of discount and inflation rates and the estimated timing of closure and decommissioning.
The increase in the provision in 2017 arose mainly from changes in discount and inflation rate assumptions while the increase in 2016 was largely the result of a review of the closure and site restoration obligation undertaken at the East Region operations and is attributed to the impact of increased operations and updates to forecast cost estimates.

Under these terms, $300 million scheduled for payment in 2016 and 2017, was deferred for settlement in the first half of 2018, with $250 million becoming payable shortly after 31 December 2017 and $50 million shortly after 30 June 2018.
The extended credit terms arising from the agreement were discounted using a rate of US$ LIBOR plus 4.2% on the estimated cost of services.
The discount rate applied is in line with the CBD Aktogay facility.
The unwinding of the interest was charged to property, plant and equipment as a borrowing cost see note 11 until the date the sulphide plant reached commercial production, after which it was charged to the income statement within finance costs.
At 31 December 2017, the full liability, discounted to its present value, was recognised as current due to its expected settlement in 2018.
$250 million of the payable to NFC was settled in January 2018. b Payments for licences for mining assets In accordance with its contracts for subsoil use, the Group is liable to repay the costs of geological information provided by the Government of Kazakhstan for licenced deposits.
Some of these obligations are payable in tenge while others are payable in US dollars, depending on the terms of each subsoil use contract.
The total amount payable by the Group is discounted to its present value using a discount rate of 7.6% for tenge 2016: 7.6% and 4.0% 2016: 4.0% for US dollar obligations.
Under the subsoil use agreements, the historical cost payments amortise over a ten year period and commence with first production.

Financial risk management The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk.
These risks arise from exposures that occur in the normal course of business and are managed by the Groups Treasury department in close cooperation with the Groups business divisions under oversight of a Treasury Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer.
The responsibilities of the Treasury Committee include the monitoring of financial risks, management of the Groups cash resources, debt funding programmes and capital structure, approval of treasury counterparties and relevant transaction limits, and oversight of all significant treasury activities undertaken by the Group.
The Treasury department operates as a service centre to the business divisions of the Group and not as a profit centre.
A Group Treasury Policy has been approved by the Board and is periodically updated to reflect developments in the financial markets and the financial exposures facing the Group.
The Treasury Policy covers specific areas of financial risk management, in particular liquidity risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk.
The Groups Treasury Committee and the Groups Internal Audit department monitor compliance with the Treasury Policy on a regular basis.
The Groups Treasury department prepares monthly treasury reports for senior management which monitor all major financial exposures and treasury activities undertaken by the Group.
In addition, a treasury report is prepared for each Board meeting which includes a summary of the credit markets and their impact on the implementation of the Groups strategy, progress on the Groups financing initiatives and the significant financial exposures faced by the Group.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and one derivative used for risk management purposes.
The Groups borrowings, surplus liquidity and derivative financial instrument are controlled and managed centrally by the Groups Treasury department.
Liquidity retained within Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan is only held for working capital purposes.
The Groups accounting policies with regard to financial instruments are detailed in note 35 u. a Derivatives, financial instruments and risk management The Group periodically uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and exchange rates.
The Groups philosophy is generally not to hedge its core revenue streams.
In periods of significant market volatility or uncertainty, the Group may use derivative instruments as a means of reducing volatility on its operating cash flows.
Limits on the size and type of any derivative hedge transaction are laid down by the Board and subject to strict internal controls.

Financial risk management continued b Categories and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities by categories are as follows: $ million Notes 2017 2016 Loans and receivables: 1 Long-term bank deposits 17 2 2 2 Trade and other receivables 20 132 105 Current investments 21 Cash and cash equivalents 22 1,821 1,108 1,955 1,215 Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit and loss: 3 Derivative instrument 28 9 21 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost: 4 Borrowings 24 3,877 3,777 Other liabilities 27 307 294 5 Trade and other payables 28 190 219 4,383 4,311 1 Long-term bank deposits reflect amounts in escrow accounts with financial institutions in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan as required by the Groups restoration obligations.
2 Trade and other receivables includes $12 million 2016: $2 million arising from marked to market adjustments on provisionally priced contracts at the year end.
These are measured according to quoted forward prices in a market that is not considered active, which is a level 2 valuation method within the fair value hierarchy.
3 Derivative financial instruments, representing a cross currency swap and interest rate swap, are measured according to inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the derivative financial instrument, either directly or indirectly, which is a level 2 valuation method within the fair value hierarchy.
4 The fair value of borrowings are estimated at $3,934 million 2016: $3,842 million.
5 Excludes payments received in advance, other taxes payable and MET and royalties payable that are not regarded as financial instruments.
The fair values of each category of financial asset and liability are not materially different from their carrying values as presented, except for borrowings as described in note 4 to the table.
c Foreign exchange risk The Group has transactional currency exposures.
Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by a Group company in currencies other than that companys functional currency.
The functional currency of the Kazakh entities within the Group is the Kazakhstan tenge, the Bozymchak project in Kyrgyzstan is the Kyrgyz som and KAZ Minerals Services Limited the UK sterling.
The Company, the Groups main financing, holding companies and sales entity have a US dollar functional currency.
The functional currency of the Groups intermediary project financing companies used to fund the Kazakhstan based Bozshakol and Aktogay projects, is the tenge.
The currencies giving rise to this foreign currency risk are primarily the US dollar, the CNY and the ruble.
Exchange gains and losses arise principally from bank deposits, trade and other receivables, certain intercompany funding balances that exist within the Group and trade and other payables.
Where possible, the Group attempts to conduct its business, maintain its monetary assets and seeks to source corporate debt capital in US dollars to minimise its exposure to other currencies.
The Group retains surplus cash balances in US dollars for capital expenditure, acquisitions, servicing of debt and returns to shareholders.
Working capital balances are maintained in a mix of US dollars and local currencies depending on the short-term requirements of the business.
Whilst there is a strong correlation between many mining input costs and the US dollar, a significant portion of the business operating costs are denominated in local currencies, particularly the Kazakhstan tenge.
Rates of exchange for these currencies relative to the US dollar could fluctuate significantly and may materially impact the profitability of the underlying operations and the net assets of the Group.
The Group generally does not enter into hedging positions in respect of its exposure to foreign currency risk.
From time to time, acquisitions and capital investments may expose the Group to movements in other currencies and the Group will consider hedging such exposures on a case-by-case basis.
To protect the Group from currency risks arising on the CDB Aktogay CNY denominated debt, the Group has entered into a CNY US$ cross currency swap.
This derivative instrument provides a hedge against movements in the CNY exchange rate against the US dollar and also swaps the interest basis from a CNY interest rate into a US$ LIBOR interest basis.
This derivative is measured at fair value with the fair value adjustment recorded in profit and loss.

This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in exchange rates over the course of a period of time.
In addition, the analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
A 10% strengthening of the US dollar against the following currencies at 31 December would have changed profit after tax by the amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2016: www.

d Commodity price risk The Groups revenues and earnings are directly impacted by fluctuations in the prices of the commodities it produces.
The Groups principal commodities copper, zinc, gold and silver are priced via reference to global metal exchanges, upon which pricing is derived from global demand and supply and influenced by macroeconomic considerations and financial investment cash flows.
The pricing of the Groups principal commodities may also include a pre-determined margin or discount depending on the terms of sales contracts.
Commodity prices, particularly those derived from global metal exchanges, may fluctuate significantly and may have a material impact on the Groups financial results.
Management closely monitors the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices on the business and uses conservative pricing assumptions and sensitivity analysis for its forecasting and investment appraisals.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the impact of commodity prices has been determined based on the balances of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2017.
This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in commodity prices over the course of a period of time.
A 10% increase decrease in commodity prices after the period end would impact the Groups provisionally priced sales volumes and increase decrease profit after tax by the amounts shown below.

Changes in interest rates primarily impact borrowings by changing their future cash flows floating rate debt or their fair value fixed rate debt and deposits.
The Groups interest rate management policy is generally to borrow and invest at floating rates of interest.
In some circumstances, an element of fixed rate funding may be considered appropriate.
Fixed rate hedging using interest rate swaps may be undertaken during periods where the Groups exposure to movements in short-term interest rates is more significant, or in periods when interest rates are perceived to be below long-term historical levels.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had an outstanding cross currency and interest rate swap on the CDB Aktogay facility of $9 million 2016: $21 million.
At 31 December 2017 and 2016, all borrowings were at floating rates.
The exposure of the Groups financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows: At 31 December 2017 Non-interest $ million Floating rate Fixed rate bearing Total Financial assets Long-term bank deposits 2 2 Trade and other receivables 132 132 Cash and cash equivalents 1,131 660 30 1,821 Total financial assets 1,131 662 162 1,955 Financial liabilities Borrowings 3,877 3,877 Other liabilities 307 307 1 Trade and other payables 199 199 Total financial liabilities 3,877 307 199 4,383 At 31 December 2016 Non-interest $ million Floating rate Fixed rate bearing Total Financial assets Long-term bank deposits 2 2 Trade and other receivables 105 105 Cash and cash equivalents 184 906 18 1,108 Total financial assets 184 908 123 1,215 Financial liabilities Borrowings 3,777 3,777 Other liabilities 294 294 1 Trade and other payables 240 240 Total financial liabilities 3,777 294 240 4,311 1 Trade and other payables exclude payments received in advance, other taxes payable and MET and royalties payable that are not regarded as financial instruments.
The interest charged on floating rate financial liabilities is based on the relevant benchmark rate such as LIBOR.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the impact of interest rates has been determined based on the balances of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2017.
This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in interest rates or outstanding borrowings over the course of a period of time.
The effect on profit after tax of a 1% movement in US$ LIBOR rates, based on the year-end net debt position and with all other variables held constant, is estimated to be $17 million 2016: $28 million.
f Credit risk Exposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Groups ordinary course of business and is applicable to all financial assets and commitments due from third parties.
The Group has adopted policies and procedures to control and monitor these exposures to minimise the risk of loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties.
The maximum exposure with respect to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset on the balance sheet.
Credit risk relating to trade receivables Sale of metal to customers are made either on receipt of cash prior to delivery and transfer of title of goods, cash on delivery and transfer of title of goods or through letters of credit which are received from the customers bank.
Credit risk on trade receivables is believed to be largely limited.
The Group does however monitor the credit quality of its significant customers on an ongoing basis and receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are considered of good credit quality.
com 141 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Year ended 31 December 2017 31.
Financial risk management continued f Credit risk continued Cash is received prior to delivery and transfer of title of the goods for sales to European customers.
Sales to Chinese customers are predominantly made under letters of credit which are obtained prior to delivery and transfer of title of the goods.
For sales made to Chinese customers without letters of credit, cash is received prior to delivery and transfer of title of the goods.
Sales to European and Chinese customers are subject to provisional pricing and then final pricing adjustments.
The Group is therefore exposed to the residual final pricing adjustment for each sales transaction although such amounts are not considered material in the context of the Groups overall revenues.
East Region may at times provide certain social services to municipal authorities in the communities in which it operates as part of its contractual obligations under its subsoil licences.
For most receivable balances due from municipal authorities, if any, full provision is usually recognised in light of past payment history.
At 31 December 2017, 4 2016: 10 customers accounted for 90% 2016: 94% of the trade and other receivables balance.
By 14 February 2018, 75% 17 February 2017: 86% of year-end balances due from these customers had been received in full.

Credit risk arising from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Groups Treasury Committee in accordance with a Board approved Treasury Policy.
The Groups cash management policies emphasise security and liquidity ahead of investment return.
Investments of cash and deposits are made only with approved counterparties of high credit worthiness and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty.
Exposures are measured against maximum credit limits assigned to each approved counterparty to ensure credit risk is effectively managed.
The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate any financial loss through potential counterparty failure.
In order to manage counterparty and liquidity risk, surplus funds within the Group are held predominantly in the UK and funds remaining in Kazakhstan are utilised mainly for working capital purposes.
The Group must maintain a level of cash and deposits in Kazakhstan with local branches of international financial institutions and well established local Kazakhstan banks.
The surplus funds in the UK are held primarily with major European and US financial institutions with minimum ratings of Standard & Poors Aand Moodys A3 and AAA rated liquidity funds.
These limits are reviewed on a regular basis to take account of developments in financial markets and updated accordingly.
130 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2017 142 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS No material exposure is considered to exist by virtue of the possible non-performance of the counterparties to derivative financial instruments.

Management regularly reviews the funding requirements of the Group in selecting appropriate maturities for its liquid cash investments.
The Groups policy is to centralise debt and surplus cash balances to the maximum extent possible.

Financial risk management continued h Capital management The over-riding objectives of the Groups capital management policy are to safeguard and support the business as a going concern through the commodity cycle, to maximise returns to shareholders either through dividends or share buy-backs and benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure in order to reduce the Groups cost of capital.
At 31 December 2017, total capital employed which comprises equity holders funds, non-controlling interests and borrowings of the Group amounted to $4,875 million, compared to $4,313 million at 31 December 2016.
Total capital employed is the measure of capital that is used by the Directors in managing capital.
At 31 December 2017, the Group is in a net debt position of $2,056 million 2016: $2,669 million.
The Group does not have a target debt equity ratio, but has determined a maximum debt capacity based on a ratio of long-term normalised EBITDA which the Board believes establishes a sustainable level of gearing through the commodity cycle.
This ratio is reviewed in conjunction with market conditions and prevailing commodity prices in order to ensure an efficient capital structure that is balanced against the risks of carrying excessive leverage.
The Group manages net debt to ensure that it does not exceed two times normalised EBITDA through the commodity cycle with flexibility to allow for up to two and a half times during periods of major capital investment, where normalised EBITDA excludes special items.
Following the Restructuring and during the development and ramp up of the Groups major projects, when a higher net debt to EBITDA ratio was expected, the Group suspended this internal ratio.
Included within the debt facilities are financial covenants related to maximum borrowing levels of the Group determined by reference to net debt to EBITDA and debt to equity ratios, minimum tangible net worth of individual Group entities and consolidated gross assets to gross liabilities ratios, for which compliance certificates are produced.
All financial covenants were fully complied with during the year and up to the date of approval of the financial statements.
Commitments and contingencies a Legal claims In the ordinary course of business, the Group is subject to legal actions and complaints.
The Directors believe that the ultimate liability, if any, arising from such actions or complaints will not have a materially adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Group.
As of 31 December 2017 and 2016, the Group was not involved in any significant legal proceedings, including arbitration, which may crystallise a financial loss for the Group.
b Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan taxation contingencies i Inherent uncertainties in interpreting tax legislation The Group is subject to uncertainties relating to the determination of its tax liabilities and the timing of recovery of tax refunds.
Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan tax legislation and practice are in a state of continuous development and, therefore, are subject to varying interpretations and changes which may be applied retrospectively.
The Directors interpretation of tax legislation as applied to the transactions and activities of the Group may not coincide with that of the tax authorities.
As a result, the tax authorities may challenge transactions and the Group may be assessed with additional taxes, penalties and fines or refused refunds, which could have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial performance or position.
ii Tax audits Historical tax years relating to various companies within the Group remain open for inspection during a future tax audit.
Consequently, the tax figures recorded in the financial statements for these years may be subject to change.
The tax authorities in Kazakhstan are able to raise additional tax assessments for five years after the end of the relevant tax period in respect of all taxes, except for excess profits tax.
In respect of excess profits tax, they are able to raise additional tax assessments for five years after the expiration of the terms of the relevant subsoil contract.
In Kyrgyzstan, tax authorities are able to raise additional tax assessments for a period of six years after the end of the relevant tax period.
iii Transfer pricing The Kazakhstan transfer pricing legislation provides clarity on various aspects of transfer pricing, including the use of LME and LBMA prices as the basis of market prices, quotation periods to be used for the sale and purchase of traded commodities and the acceptability of discounts with reference to LME LBMA prices when transacting in traded commodities.
Notwithstanding these amendments, the Directors have recognised a provision for the amounts that represent the Directors best estimate of the probable cash payments that will be required to settle any residual transfer pricing exposures based on the Directors interpretation of the transfer pricing legislation and the prevailing status of discussions with the tax authorities.
The risk remains that the tax authorities may take a different position with regard to the interpretation of the transfer pricing legislation, and amendments thereof, and the outcome of discussions with the Kazakhstan tax authorities may be materially different from the Directors expectations.
iv Possible additional tax liabilities The Directors believe that the Group is in substantial compliance with the tax laws promulgated in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan and any contractual terms entered into that relate to tax which affect its operations and that, consequently, no additional material tax liabilities will arise.
However, due to the reasons set out above, the risk remains that the relevant tax authorities may take a differing position with regard to the interpretation of contractual provisions or tax law inclusive of corporate income taxes, value added tax and subsoil use legislation.
132 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2017 144 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The resulting effect of any positions taken by the tax authorities that differ from those of the Directors is that additional tax liabilities may arise or the timing of refunds due may take longer than expected or may be refused.
However, due to the inherent nature of uncertain tax positions despite the approach adopted by the Group, as described above, it is not practical for the Directors to estimate the financial effect of the timing of tax refunds and of additional tax liabilities, if any, together with any associated penalties and charges for which the Group may be liable that may arise from different interpretations applied by the tax authorities.
c Environmental contingencies Environmental regulations, including emissions legislation, in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are continually evolving.
The outcome of environmental regulations under proposal or any future environmental legislation cannot be reliably estimated at present.
As obligations are determined, they will be provided for in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
The Directors believe that there are no significant liabilities under current legislation not accrued for in the Groups consolidated financial statements, however, they recognise that the environmental regulators in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan may take a differing position with regard to the interpretation of environmental legislation.
The resulting effect is that additional environmental liabilities may arise however, due to the range of uncertainties, it is not practical for the Directors to estimate any further potential exposures.
The provision that has been made for costs associated with restoration and abandonment of mine sites upon depletion of deposits see note 26, is based upon the estimation of the Groups specialists or external consultants.
Where events occur that change the level of estimated future costs for these activities, the provision will be adjusted accordingly.
d Use of subsoil and exploration rights In Kazakhstan, all subsoil reserves belong to the State, with the Ministry of Investments and Development the Ministry granting exploration and production rights to third party bodies.
Subsoil and exploration rights are not granted in perpetuity and any renewal must be agreed before the expiration of the relevant contract or licence.
These rights may be terminated by the Ministry if the Group does not satisfy its contractual obligations.
In January 2018, the Group has applied to extend the Koksay exploration licence for a further three years to 2021, which is expected to be granted during the course of the year.
In Kyrgyzstan, all subsoil reserves belong to the State, with the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources of the Kyrgyz Republic the competent body granting exploration and production rights to third party bodies.
These rights may be terminated by the competent body if the Company does not satisfy its contractual obligations.
e Capital expenditure commitments The Group has capital expenditure commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment as well as commitments under its mining subsoil agreements.
Committed expenditure under the subsoil agreements typically relates to investments in community-related projects, and includes investments in social sphere assets, infrastructure and public utilities.
The total commitments for property, plant and equipment at 31 December 2017 amounted to $47 million 2016: $109 million.
After the balance sheet date, the Group entered into commitments of $195 million for the Aktogay expansion project.
f Operating lease commitments The operating lease expense for the year was $3 million 2016: $3 million.
At 31 December, the Group had the following total commitments under non-cancellable operating leases: $ million 2017 2016 Within one year 3 4 After one year but not more than five years 9 11 More than five years 3 3 15 18 33.
Related party disclosures a Transactions with related parties Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties of the Company, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.

com 145 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Year ended 31 December 2017 33.
Related party disclosures continued a Transactions with related parties continued Cuprum Holding and related entities The majority of the related party transactions and balances are with companies which are part of the Cuprum Holding Group a company owned by Vladimir Kim, a Director of the Company, and Eduard Ogay, a former Director of the Company and provided under two Framework Service Agreements.
These include the provision of smelting and refining of the Groups copper concentrate, electricity supply and certain maintenance functions.
b Terms and conditions of transactions with related parties Prices for related party transactions are determined by the parties on an ongoing basis depending on the nature of the transaction.
Share-based payment plans The Companys share-based payment plans consist of a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, and a Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP.
The total expense for the year ended 31 December 2017 arising from these plans was $3 million 2016: $3 million.
The total number of shares outstanding under these schemes as at 31 December 2017 was 3,756,390 2016: 3,671,335.
The total number of shares exercisable under these schemes as at 31 December 2017 was 1,040,431 2016: 204,270.
These plans are discretionary benefits offered by the Company for the benefit of its employees.
The main purpose is to increase the interest of the employees in KAZ Minerals long-term business goals and performance through share ownership.
They represent incentives for employees future performance and commitment to be aligned to the goals of the Group.
For future awards, the Company may issue new shares or use shares held as treasury by the Company, as approved by shareholders, rather than purchase the shares in the open market through the Employee Benefit Trust.
Summary of significant accounting policies The following significant accounting policies have been applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
These accounting policies have been consistently applied across the Group.
a Foreign currency translation The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions translated at the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or the translation of monetary assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates, are taken to the income statement.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies and that result in the recognition of non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of each transaction.
The functional currency of the Company, the Groups main financing and holding companies and KAZ Minerals Sales Limited is the US dollar as the majority of the operating activities are conducted in US dollars.
The functional currency of the Groups Kazakh entities and their UK based project finance companies, as applicable, is the Kazakhstan tenge, with Bozymchak functional currency being the Kyrgyz som.
On consolidation, income statements of subsidiaries are translated into US dollars, at average rates of exchange.
Balance sheet items are translated into US dollars at period end exchange rates.
Exchange differences on the retranslation are taken to a separate component of equity.
The following foreign exchange rates against the US dollar have been used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements: 31 December 2017 31 December 2016 Spot Average Spot Average Kazakhstan tenge 332.33 326.00 333.29 342.16 Kyrgyz som 68.84 68.94 69.23 69.88 UK pounds sterling 0.74 0.78 0.80 0.74 b Business combinations The Group applies the purchase method to account for business combinations.
On the acquisition of a subsidiary, the purchase consideration is allocated to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities identifiable net assets on the basis of fair values at the date of acquisition.
Those mining rights, mineral reserves and resources that are able to be reliably valued are recognised in the assessment of fair values on acquisition.
Other potential reserves, resources and mineral rights, for which, in the Directors opinion, values cannot be reliably determined, are not recognised.
The consideration transferred cost of acquisition is the aggregate of: a the fair values at the date of exchange, of assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group: and b the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred in the income statement.
When the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair value attributable to the Groups share of the identifiable net assets, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill.
If the fair value attributable to the Groups share of the identifiable net assets exceeds the fair value of the consideration, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified and measured the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and recognises any additional assets or liabilities that are identified in that review.
If that excess remains after reassessment, the Group recognises the resulting gain in the income statement on the acquisition date.
134 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2017 146 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS When a subsidiary is acquired in a number of stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through the income statement.
Similar procedures are applied in accounting for the purchases of interests in associates and joint ventures.
Any goodwill arising on such purchases is included within the carrying amount of the investment in the associate, but not thereafter amortised.
Any excess of the Groups share of the net fair value of the associates identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of the investment is included in the income statement in the period of the purchase.
c Intangible assets i Non-mining intangible assets Non-mining intangible assets relate largely to software purchases, which are acquired by the Group and which have finite useful lives, are stated at cost which comprises purchase price plus any directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for intended use less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is its fair value which can be measured reliably as at the date of acquisition.
ii Amortisation Amortisation of intangible assets, which have expected useful lives of three to 10 years, is computed under the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
d Property, plant and equipment i Initial measurement Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
Costs which are necessarily incurred and revenues earned whilst commissioning new assets, in the period before they are capable of operating in the manner intended by management, are capitalised.
For mining and processing facility assets, this requires judgement based on the facts and circumstances of the operation and is considered to be when these assets have reached commercial levels of production.
Commercial production represents production in reasonable commercial quantities and refers to the level of output and not profit or loss and is generally considered to have been achieved when the operation is consistently operating at over 60% of its intended capacity for a sustained period of around three months.
ii Depreciation The cost of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life to its estimated residual value.
Each items estimated useful life has due regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the item is located.
Estimates of remaining useful lives and residual values are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, plant and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual asset to its estimated residual value or on a unit of production basis depending on the type of asset.
The unit of production method is the ratio of commodity production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves over the life of the mine using proven and probable mineral reserves as determined by the JORC Code on an annual basis based on the estimated economically recoverable reserves to which they relate.
Changes in estimates, which affect unit of production calculations, are accounted for prospectively.
Depreciation commences on the date the assets are ready for use within the business.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The expected useful lives are as follows: Buildings 15-40 years Plant and equipment 4-25 years Other 3-15 years iii Construction in progress Assets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment.
On completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category.
Construction in progress is not depreciated.
iv Repairs and maintenance Expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment that is accounted for separately, is capitalised with the carrying amount of the replaced component being written off.
Repairs and maintenance expenditure, including major overhauls which are infrequent, are capitalised if additional future economic benefits will arise from the expenditure.
All other repairs and maintenance expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
v Leased assets Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor and not transferred to the Group are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
com 147 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Year ended 31 December 2017 35.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued e Mining assets i Mineral licences and properties Costs of acquiring mineral licences and properties are capitalised on the balance sheet in the year in which they are incurred.
Costs associated with a start-up period for significant developments are capitalised during the commissioning period development expenditure where the asset is incapable of operating at normal levels without a commissioning period.
Mineral licences and properties are amortised over the remaining life of the mine using a unit of production method.
ii Mine development costs Mine development costs are incurred to obtain access to proved reserves or mineral-bearing ore deposits and to provide facilities for extracting, lifting and storing minerals.
Such costs are, upon commencement of production, amortised over the remaining life of the mine using a unit of production method.
iii Mine stripping costs Mine stripping costs incurred in order to access the mineral-bearing ore deposits are deferred prior to the commencement of production.
Such costs are amortised over the remaining life of the mine using a unit of production method.
The ongoing mining and development of the open-pit mines is generally performed via a succession of individual phases.
The costs of extracting material from an open-pit mine are generally allocated between ore and waste stripping in proportion to the tonnes of waste and ore material extracted the stripping ratio.
The waste stripping costs are generally absorbed into inventory and expensed as that inventory is processed and sold.
Where the stripping costs relate to a waste stripping campaign which is expected to provide improved access to an identifiable component of the ore body, the costs of removing waste in order to improve access to that part of the ore body will be capitalised within mining assets.
The capitalised costs will then be amortised in a systematic manner over the reserves that directly benefit from the specific stripping activity.
Changes to the stripping ratio arising from changes to mine plans or ore reserves are regarded in changes in estimates and are accounted for prospectively.
iv Exploration and evaluation costs Exploration and evaluation expenditure for each area of interest once the legal right to explore has been acquired, other than that acquired through a purchase transaction, is carried forward as an asset, within mining assets, provided that one of the following conditions is met: such costs are expected to be recouped through successful exploration and development of the area of interest or, alternatively, by its sale.
exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not yet reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active and significant operations in relation to the area are continuing.
Exploration expenditure which fails to meet at least one of the conditions outlined above is written off.
Administrative and general expenses relating to exploration and evaluation activities are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable exploration and evaluation assets acquired in a purchase transaction are recognised as assets at their cost, or fair value if purchased as part of a business combination.
Exploration assets are reassessed on a regular basis and these costs are carried forward provided that at least one of the conditions outlined above is met.
Exploration and evaluation assets transferred to mine development costs when attributable to producing interests are amortised on a unit of production basis over the remaining life of the associated mine.
f Impairment The carrying values of mining assets including capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure and property, plant and equipment are assessed for impairment when indicators of such impairment exist.
If any indication of impairment exists, an estimate of the assets recoverable amount is calculated.
If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and an impairment loss is charged to the income statement so as to reduce the carrying amount to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount.
i Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
This is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
If this is the case, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The Groups cash generating units are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
136 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2017 148 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ii Reversals of impairment A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversals are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in relation to goodwill are not reversed for subsequent increases in the recoverable amount.
g Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs incurred in the normal course of business in bringing each product to its present location and condition.
Cost is determined on the following bases: Raw materials and consumables are valued at cost on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis: and Work in progress and finished goods are valued at the cost of production, including the appropriate proportion of depreciation, labour and overheads based on normal operating capacity.
The cost of work in progress and finished goods is based on the weighted average cost method.
Net realisable value represents estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Inventory, usually stockpiled ore that has been extracted, which is not expected to be processed within 12 months of the balance sheet date and is considered to fall outside of the normal operating cycle of the operation, is included within non-current assets.
h Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables do not generally carry any interest and are normally stated at their nominal value less any impairment.
Impairment losses on trade receivables are recognised within an allowance account unless the Group considers that no recovery of the amount is possible, in which case the carrying value of the asset is reduced directly.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits held on call or with maturities which on inception are within the expected working capital profile of the Group and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts.
j Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
k Employee benefits i Long-term employee benefits The Groups entities located in Kazakhstan remit contributions to State managed pension plans on behalf of its employees.
Contributions to be paid by the Group are withheld from employees salaries based on prescribed rates and are recognised as part of the salary expense in the income statement as incurred.
The Groups defined benefit plans, including the death and disability plans for current and former employees, are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits Revised, such that the plan liabilities and assets are measured by actuarial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
The future benefit that employees have earned is discounted to determine the present value.
The discount rate is determined by reference to the US Treasury bond rate adjusted for country specific inflation and risk.
The Treasury bond used approximates to the average maturity profile of the Groups benefit obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified independent actuary on a rotational basis.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise for defined benefit plans not considered to be other long-term employee benefits.
In respect of other long-term employee benefit plans, namely the Groups disability benefits obligation, all actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
The expense in relation to all long-term employee benefits is charged to the income statement so as to match the cost of providing these benefits to the period of service of the employees.
ii Share-based payments Certain employees of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value of share awards with marketrelated vesting conditions is determined using the Monte Carlo method and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual outcome of awards which have vested.
No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued l Own shares Own equity instruments which are re-acquired either by the Employee Benefit Trust for the purposes of the Groups employee sharebased payment plans or by the Company as part of any share buy-back programmes are recognised at cost and deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration paid to acquire such equity instruments is recognised within equity.
m Social responsibility costs The Group contributes towards social programmes for the benefit of the local community at large.
The Groups contributions towards these programmes are expensed to the income statement at the point when the Group is committed to the expenditure.
n Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
i Site restoration costs Site restoration provisions are made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure and restoration, and for environmental rehabilitation costs which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs.
The provision is discounted where material and the unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs.
Over time, the discounted provision is increased for the change in present value based on the discount rates that reflect current market assessments and the risks specific to the liability.
At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future benefit and depreciated over the remaining life of the mine to which it relates using a unit of production method.
The provision is reviewed on an annual basis for changes in cost estimates, discount rates or life of operations.
Any change in restoration costs or assumptions will be recognised as additions or charges to the corresponding asset and provision when they occur.
For permanently closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.
ii Other Other provisions are accounted for when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation for which it is probable there will be an outflow of resources and for which the amount can be reliably estimated.
o Revenue Revenue represents the value of goods and services supplied to third parties during the year.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of expected consideration to be received, and excludes any applicable sales tax.
MET is included within cost of sales.
All revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue associated with the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title and any insurance risk has passed to the customer and the goods have been delivered in accordance with the contractual delivery terms or when any services have been provided.
Prior to assets operating in the manner as intended by management, revenue is capitalised within property, plant and equipment.
When those assets are operating in the manner intended which is considered when commercial levels of production are achieved, revenue is recognised in the income statement.
Almost all sales agreements for copper cathodes and copper concentrate, zinc concentrate and silver are provisionally priced i. e. the selling price is subject to final adjustment at the end of a quotation period, typically the average price either for the month of or the month following or two months following delivery to the customer, based on the LME LBMA market price for the relevant quotation period stipulated in the contract.
Such a provisional sale contains an embedded derivative which is required to be separated from the underlying host contract, being the sale of the commodity.
At each reporting date, the provisionally priced metal sales are marked-tomarket using forward prices, with adjustments both gains and losses being recorded in revenue in the income statement and in trade receivables or trade payables on the balance sheet.
p Finance income Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues, calculated in accordance with the effective interest rate method.
q Finance costs Finance costs comprise interest on borrowings which are not capitalised under the borrowing costs policy see 35 r below, and the unwinding of interest costs on provisions.
138 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2017 150 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS r Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying capital project under construction are capitalised and added to the project cost during construction until such time as the assets are considered substantially ready for their intended use, i. e. when they are capable of commercial production.
Where funds are borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred.
Where surplus funds are available for a short period of time from money borrowed specifically to finance a project, the income generated from the temporary investment of such amounts is also capitalised and deducted from the total capitalised borrowing costs.
Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the year.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs that represent avoidable costs not related to the financing arrangements of the development projects and are therefore not directly attributable to the construction of these respective assets are expensed in the period as incurred.
These borrowing costs generally arise where the funds are drawn down under the Groups financing facilities, whether specific or general, which are in excess of the near term cash flow requirements of the development projects for which the financing is intended, and the funds are drawn down ahead of any contractual obligation to do so.
s Income tax Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Excess profits tax is treated as income tax and forms part of the income tax expense.
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: those arising on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit: and investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised and in combination with other deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
t Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by shareholders.
Dividends receivable are recognised when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
u Financial instruments The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities on its balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
i Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
When financial assets are initially recognised, they are measured at fair value being the consideration given or received plus directly attributable transaction costs.
Any gain or loss at initial recognition is recognised in the income statement.
The Groups financial assets include cash and short-term investments, trade and other receivables, loans and other receivables, non-current deposits held for closure, and derivative financial instruments.
The Groups most significant financial assets, within the scope of IAS 39, are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
These are typically loans and receivables created by the Group in providing money to a debtor.
com 151 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Year ended 31 December 2017 35.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued u Financial instruments continued i Financial assets continued Subsequent measurement After initial measurement, loans and receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method EIR.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.
The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the income statement.
Allowance for impairment is estimated on a case-by-case basis.
Derecognition A financial asset is derecognised when the Group loses control over the contractual rights that comprise that asset.
This occurs when the rights are realised, expire or are surrendered.
Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
A financial asset or group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset an incurred loss event and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
ii Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, plus directly attributable transaction costs.
The Groups financial liabilities include trade and other payables, bank overdrafts, loans and borrowings, financial guarantee contracts and derivative financial instruments.
The Groups most significant financial liabilities, within the scope of IAS 39, are classified as loans and borrowings.
Subsequent measurement Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method after initial recognition.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised, as well as through the EIR amortisation process.
The EIR amortisation is included in finance costs in the income statement.
Derecognition A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.
iii Derivative financial instruments Where the Group enters into derivative contracts that are not hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by IAS 39, these are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in finance income or finance costs in the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in host contracts are accounted for as separate derivatives and recorded at fair value if their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contracts.
These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Reassessment only occurs if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that would have been expected.
iv Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is an enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
v Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets at each reporting date is determined by reference to quoted market prices, without any deduction for transaction costs.
For financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques.
Such techniques may include using recent arms length market transactions, reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models.

d Company accounting policies Basis of preparation The KAZ Minerals PLC parent company balance sheet, statement of cash flows, statement of changes in equity and related notes have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial information has been prepared on a historical cost basis.
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis see note 2 a.
The functional currency of the Company and the presentational currency adopted is US dollars.
Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements refer to notes 2 and 35 except for the additional accounting policy relating to non-current investments set out below.
There were no changes to the accounting policies during the year.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs as adopted by the EU requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, following implementation of these standards, actual results may differ from those estimates.
142 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2017 154 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Non-current investments Non-current investments are held at cost.
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount.
Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Any positive change in the amount or timing of estimated future cash flows or in the discount rate such that fair value of the Companys investments increases, consideration will be given to whether previously recognised impairments should be reversed.
e Company non-current investments $ million 2017 2016 Cost At 1 January 7,830 7,829 Additions 1 At 31 December 7,830 7,830 Provision for impairment At 1 January 4,478 5,946 Impairment reversals 840 1,468 At 31 December 3,638 4,478 Net book value 4,192 3,352 i KAZ Minerals Investments Limited In 2017, the continued ramp up to design capacity of the Bozshakol sulphide and Aktogay oxide plants, the achievement of commercial production of the Bozshakol clay and Aktogay sulphide plant, the improvement in the near term copper prices, the successful refinancing and increasing of the PXF financing facility and the Groups decision to proceed with the Aktogay expansion project, led to a reassessment of the carrying value of the Companys previously impaired investments.
The estimated recoverable amount of the Groups investment exceeded its carrying value and a reversal of impairment of $840 million 2016: $1,468 million was recognised.
The recoverable amount is supported by a range of internal valuations that were prepared using discounted cash flow models using assumptions relating to short, medium and long-term pricing and other assumptions including inflation, cost estimates and production profiles based on the Groups expectations of the assets.
The internal valuation range and the revised carrying value of the Companys investment is also supported by a range of recent equity analyst discounted cash flow valuations.
Changes in the outlook to commodity prices as well as any future changes in mine production plans, could impact the recoverable amount of the investment.
The determination of the fair value less costs to sell, as estimated in 2017 and 2016, is subject to the key sources of estimation uncertainty as disclosed in note 3. ii KAZ Minerals Services Limited In 2017, no additional investment 2016: $1 million relating to capital contributions made by the Company to KAZ Minerals Services Limited was recognised in respect of the share awards issued by the Company on behalf of employees of KAZ Minerals Services Limited.
