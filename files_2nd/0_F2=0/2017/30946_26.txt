Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Other information | 157 Reconciliations Combined operating ratio reconciliation The following tables reconcile the Groups profit before tax to the net underwriting margin used to calculate the combined operating ratio and its two component measures: expense ratio and loss ratio.
The combined operating ratio is the primary indicator used to measure overall performance of the Underwriting business and shows the amount of each premium spent on either indemnity costs the loss ratio or underwriting operating expenses the expense ratio.
The combined operating ratio is therefore a measure of underwriting profitability.
