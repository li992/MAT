General information HomeServe plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The address of the registered oce is Cable Drive, Walsall, WS2 7BN.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
2. significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs, adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period as explained in note 42.
Adoption of new or revised standards and accounting policies The following accounting standards have been adopted in the year: Amendments to IFRS10, Investment Entities Applying the Consolidation Exception IFRS12 and IAS28 Amendments to IAS1 Disclosure Initiative None of the accounting standards listed above have had any material impact on the amounts reported in this consolidated set of financial statements.
Standards in issue but not yet eective At the date of authorisation of these financial statements the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet e ective not all of which have been endorsed by the EU : IFRS9 Financial Instruments IFRS14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts IFRS15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS16 Leases Amendments to IFRS2 Classication and Measurement of Share-based payment Transactions Amendments to IFRS4 Applying IFRS9 Financial Instruments with IFRS4 Insurance Contracts Amendments to IAS12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses Amendments to IAS7 Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS40 Transfers of Investment Property Improvements to IFRS 2014-2016 Cycle IFRIC Interpretation 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration 135 Financial statements Notes to financial statements continued Year ended 31 March 2017 2. significant accounting policies continued The implementation of IFRS9 may impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments.
The implementation of IFRS15 may have an impact on revenue recognition and related disclosures.
IFRS16 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of leases.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the e ect of IFRS9, IFRS15 and IFRS16 until a detailed review has been performed.
We have established a review team and are assessing the impact in all of our businesses and expect this to be completed in the coming year.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the other Standards and Interpretations listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future years.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to a ect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report.
The Directors have reviewed the Groups budget, forecast and cash ows for 2018 and beyond, and concluded that they are in line with their expectations with regards to the Groups strategy and future growth plans.
In addition the Directors have reviewed the Groups position in respect of material uncertainties and have concluded that there are no items that would a ect going concern or that should be separately disclosed.
The Directors have concluded that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below: Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up to 31 March each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity, is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and has the ability to use its power to a ect its returns.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of the consolidated subsidiaries are identied separately from the Groups equity interest.
Non-controlling interests consist of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minoritys share of the changes in equity since the date of the combination.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the e ective date of acquisition or up to the e ective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
136 Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Interests in associates The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated into these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, an interest in an associate is initially recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Groups share of the profit and loss and other comprehensive income of the associate.
Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement, as incurred, in administrative expenses.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period see below adjustments.
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classied as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs.
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classied as equity are not recognised.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period see below, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition-date that, if known, would have a ected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, subject to a maximum of one year.
Any adjustments to contingent consideration for acquisitions made prior to 31 March 2010 which result in an adjustment to goodwill continue to be accounted for under IFRS3 2004 and IAS27 2005.
137 Financial statements Notes to financial statements continued Year ended 31 March 2017 2. significant accounting policies continued Goodwill Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised at cost as an asset at the date control is acquired the acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if there is an indication that it may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generatingunits expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating-unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating-unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written o to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT, Insurance Premium Tax and other sales related taxes.
Revenue recorded by the Group includes commissions receivable in the Groups role as an intermediary in the policy sale and administration process.
Any third-party costs incurred on behalf of the principal that are rechargeable under the contractual arrangement, or where the Groups role is only as an intermediary in the cash collection process, are not included in revenue.
Consequently, on the sale of a policy, gross revenue consists of only a component of the overall policy price, representing the commission receivable for the marketing and sale of the policy, stated net of sales related taxes.
Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate arrangements that can be provided to customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an optional extra, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contract.
Accordingly, revenue is recognised on the sale of a policy except where an obligation exists to provide future services, typically claims handling and policy administration services.
In these situations, a proportion of revenue, sucient to cover future claims handling costs and margin, is deferred over the life of the policy, as deferred income.
The assessment of future claims handling takes account of the expected numbers of claims and the estimated cost of handling those claims, which are validated through experience of historical actual costs.
138 Annual Report & Accounts 2017 The deferred revenue is released over the expected prole of anticipated claims over the policy period.
The deferral also includes a profit element to recognise the performance of these services in the future.
Revenue on sales of franchises is recognised when the obligations to the franchisee are complete.
Revenue on the sale of new franchise licences is recognised upon the signing of the related franchise agreement.
These franchise fees are non-refundable and primarily relate to initial set-up services.
Repair revenue relates to repairs undertaken on behalf of underwriters subject to separate contractual arrangements.
Such revenue is recognised on completion of the repair.
Revenue in respect of boiler installations and uninsured jobs is recognised when our performance obligations are complete.
Annual service revenue is recognised on completion of the annual service.
Ongoing service revenue is recognised in equal instalments over the life of the policy.
Marketing expenses Costs incurred in respect of marketing activity, including for example, direct mail and inbound outbound telephone costs, which is undertaken to acquire or renew a policy, are charged to the income statement in the period in which the related marketing campaign is performed.
Marketing expenses also include payments made to Anity Partners in recognition of their support for the Groups selling and policy renewal activities.
The terms of their support and related payments are included in contractual agreements with each Anity Partner.
Amounts incurred upon the sale and renewal of an individual policy by the Group, referred to as Anity Partner Commissions, are recognised as an operating expense when individual policies incept or renew.
Commissions are payable to Anity Partners only when the Group has collected the premium due on behalf of the third party underwriter from the policy holder.
Leasing Leases are classied as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classied as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benets received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
139 Financial statements Notes to financial statements continued Year ended 31 March 2017 2. significant accounting policies continued Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies except for those that are designated as long term equity investments, are re-translated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, with changes taken to the income statement.
Foreign exchange translation movements on monetary assets that are designated as long term equity investments are transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not re-translated.
Borrowings in foreign currencies are treated as monetary liabilities and are translated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Exchange rate movements on foreign currency borrowings are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Foreign currency borrowings are not treated as hedges of net investments.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates uctuate signicantly.
Exchange movements, if any, are classied as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such cumulative exchange movements are recognised as income or expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after charging all operating costs, but before investment income and finance costs.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to dened contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For dened benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing benets is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses and the return on scheme assets excluding interest are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of comprehensive income.
Re-measurements recorded in the statement of comprehensive income are not recycled.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benets are already vested, and is otherwise amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benets become vested.
Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net dened benefit liability or asset.
140 Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Any retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the dened benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from the calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Any tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on di erences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary di erences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary di erences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary di erences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary di erence and it is probable that the temporary di erence will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sucient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or within equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are o set when there is a legally enforceable right to set o current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged so as to write o the cost of assets, other than land, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Buildings 25 50 years Furniture, xtures and equipment 5 7 years Computer equipment 3 7 years Motor vehicles 3 years with 25% residual value Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
141 Financial statements Notes to financial statements continued Year ended 31 March 2017 2. significant accounting policies continued Intangible assets Acquisition intangible assets Acquired access rights relate to the contractual agreements entered into with the former owners of businesses acquired as part of business combinations.
These agreements set out the contractual terms of the Anity Partnership and provide the contractual framework within which the Group markets, sells and renews policies with the individual customers of the Anity Partner.
Acquired access rights are recorded at fair value by using the estimated and discounted incremental future cash ows resulting from the relationship.
Acquired access rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are in the range of 3 - 20 years.
Acquired customer databases represent the value attributable to the portfolios of renewable customer policies that exist at the date of acquisition and are acquired by the Group as part of a business combination.
Acquired customer databases are recorded at fair value using the estimated and discounted incremental future cash ows resulting from the future renewal of the portfolio of acquired policies over their estimated residual life.
Acquired customer databases are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are in the range of 3 - 15 years.
Other intangible assets Access rights arise from the contractual agreements with Anity Partners which provide the contractual framework within which the Group markets, sells and renews policies with the individual customers of the Anity Partner.
Access rights are valued at the discounted present value of the contractually committed payments, where such payments are not related to the success or otherwise of activity under the contractual agreements and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the length of the contractual agreement, up to a maximum of 20 years.
Trademarks represent costs incurred to legally protect the established brand names of the Group.
Trademarks are stated at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives, up to a maximum of 20 years.
Customer databases represent the value attributable to the portfolios of renewable customer policies that have been created by our Anity Partners through their own sales and marketing activity and subsequently purchased by the Group.
Such customer databases are recorded at their fair value based on the amount paid to the Anity Partner.
These customer databases are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected duration of the customer relationship, which are in the range of 3 - 10 years.
Computer software and the related licences are stated at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of 3 10 years.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have su ered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash ows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating-unit to which the asset belongs.
142 Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the assets for which the estimates of future cash ows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs comprise direct material cost only.
Cost is measured on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The classication depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets or liabilities and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Available for sale investments At each balance sheet date the Group conducts a fair value assessment of its investments, the di erence between the fair value and carrying value is charged or credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income accordingly and held in the available for sale reserve.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignicant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classied according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
143 Financial statements Notes to financial statements continued Year ended 31 March 2017 2. significant accounting policies continued Financial instruments continued Borrowings Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are stated at amortised cost and are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the e ective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Put options over the equity of subsidiary companies The potential cash payments related to put options issued by the Group over the equity of subsidiary companies are accounted for as financial liabilities.
The amounts that may become payable under the option on exercise are initially recognised at the present value of the expected gross obligation with the corresponding entry being recognised in retained earnings.
Such options are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the e ective interest rate method, in order to accrete the liability up to the amount payable under the option at the date at which it first becomes exercisable.
The charge arising is recorded as a nancing cost.
In the event that options expire unexercised, the liability is derecognised with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings.
Other put and call options Other put and call options are recognised at fair value with any associated benefit being recognised directly in the profit and loss account.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The Group also provides employees with the ability to purchase the Groups ordinary shares at a discount to the current market value through Save As You Earn schemes.
In addition, the Group provides employees with the ability to purchase shares through its One Plan scheme.
For every two shares purchased, employees will receive one free matching share at the end of the vesting period.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model or Monte Carlo simulation models depending on the type of scheme.
144 Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Own shares reserve Shares of the parent Company that were purchased by the HomeServe plc Employee benefit Trust were held at cost and shown as a deduction in equity.
Cost comprised consideration paid, including directly attributable costs.
The shares were held to satisfy obligations under the Groups equity settled share based payment schemes.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may di er from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision a ects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision a ects both current and future periods.
Revenue recognition Claims handling obligations A key accounting judgement in respect of revenue recognition is the proportion of revenue to defer to cover the Groups future obligations in respect of handling future claims arising on those policies that are on risk at the year end.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty in determining an appropriate proportion of revenue to defer are the assumptions made with regards to claims frequency and the estimated cost of handling a claim.
The Group uses historical experience of claim volumes and forecast activity levels to estimate these assumptions.
The total amount of revenue deferred at 31 March 2017 in respect of the Groups future claim handing obligations is 76.7m FY16: 54.4m.
If either of these assumptions were individually higher or lower than the Groups historical experience by 10% the impact to the profit in the year would be 7.7m.
Policy Cancellations A further judgement is in respect of those policies that may be cancelled by the customer part way through the contractual term, which will a ect the economic benets that ow to the Group.
To the extent that policies are expected to cancel mid-term and hence all the economic benets of those policies is not expected to ow to the Group, an estimate of the related revenue is not recognised.
The key source of estimation uncertainty in calculating the provision for policy cancellations are the expected mid-term cancellation percentage and the period of cover remaining on the policy at the point of cancellation.
The Group uses historical experience to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in this calculation.
The total amount of revenue not recognised at 31 March 2017 in respect of potential future cancellations is 18.0m FY16: 16.0m and is recognised as a reduction in the value of trade receivables.
The most material estimation uncertainty within this judgement is the mid-term cancellation percentage.
If this assumption was individually higher or lower than the Groups historical experience by 10% the impact to profit in the year would be 1.8m.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued Valuation of acquisition intangible assets Acquisitions may result in acquired access rights and acquired customer databases being recognised as intangible assets.
These are valued using the excess earnings method taking into account a number of key assumptions such as retention and net income.
In applying this methodology, certain key judgements and estimates are required to be made in respect of future cash ows together with an appropriate discount factor for the purpose of determining the present value of those cash ows.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty with respect to customer databases are the future retention rate and the income per customer generated from those customers.
The carrying value of acquired customer databases at 31 March 2017 is 90.0m FY16: 66.7m.
If the retention rate or income per customer was individually higher or lower by 10% the impact to profit in the year would be 9.0m.
In respect of intangible assets for acquired access rights, the key sources of estimation uncertainty relate to the assumptions regarding the number of policy sales and associated penetration of the customer list along with the cost of acquisition, retention rate and costs associated with servicing those customers.
The total value of acquired access rights at 31 March 2017 is 24.0m FY16: 8.6m, therefore if the assumptions used in this valuation were individually higher or lower by 10% the impact to the profit in the year would be 2.4m.
Impairment of goodwill and acquisition intangible assets The annual impairment assessment in respect of goodwill and acquisition intangibles requires estimates of the value in use or fair value less costs to sell of cash-generating units to which goodwill and acquisition intangibles have been allocated.
CGUs are aligned to the regions in which we operate.
As a result, estimates of future cash ows are required, together with an appropriate discount factor for the purpose of determining the present value of those cash ows.
The carrying value of goodwill is 301.9m FY16: 247.7m.
The carrying value of acquisition intangibles is 114.0m FY16: 75.3m.
Following the annual impairment review, no impairment charge has been recorded against goodwill or acquisition intangibles.
As set out in note 13, changes in respect of commercial outcomes around sales volumes, prices, margins and discount rates can impact the recoverable value.
Management do not believe that any reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions would produce an impairment in the forthcoming year.
In addition to the amounts above, there is goodwill of 25.7m included in the interests in associates in relation to our recent investment in Sherrington Mews Limited, the holding company of the Checkatrade Group.
Each individual associate will be assessed as a single asset if there are any indications of impairment.

Business and geographical segments Segment revenues and results IFRS8 requires operating segments to be identied on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, who is considered to be the Chief Executive, to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
Segment profit loss represents the result of each segment including allocating costs associated with head oce and shared functions, but before allocating investment income, finance costs, and tax.
This is the measure reported to the Chief Executive for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in significant Accounting Policies.
Group cost allocations are deducted in arriving at segmental operating profit.
Intersegment revenue is charged at prevailing market prices.
During the year the USA segment has been renamed North America reecting the increased presence that the Group has in Canada, which is managed and considered together with our business in the United States of America.
Other than the change in name of the USA segment, no other changes have been made to the operating segments.

Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions, these being 40% in the US FY16: 40%, 33% in France FY16: 33%, 25% in Spain FY16: 27% and 28% in Italy FY16: 28%, which explains the Overseas tax rate di erences below.
The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the income statement as follows: 2017 2016 m m Profit before tax on continuing operations 98.3 82.6 Tax at the UK corporation tax rate of 20% FY16: 20% 19.7 16.5 Tax effect of items that are not taxable deductible in determining taxable profit 0.2 2.3 Adjustments in respect of prior years current tax 1.3 0.4 Overseas tax rate differences 2.7 2.4 Movement in deferred tax liability 0.4 0.1 Effect of overseas losses 0.1 Tax expense for the year 23.9 21.0 Given the UK parented nature of the Group, the majority of nancing that the overseas businesses require is provided from the UK, and as such the UK has provided a number of intra-group loans to its overseas operations in order to fund their growth plans.
In light of the di erent tax rates applicable in each of the markets in which the Group operates, as noted above, these loans result in a reduction in the Groups e ective tax rate, which is included in Overseas tax rate di erences in the table above.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss in the financial year by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated excluding amortisation of acquisition intangibles.
The Group uses adjusted operating profit, EBITDA, adjusted profit before tax and adjusted earnings per share as its primary performance measures.
These are non-IFRS measures which exclude the impact of the amortisation of acquisition intangible assets FY17: 14.1m, FY16: 10.4m.
Acquisition intangible assets principally arise as a result of the past actions of the former owners of businesses in respect of marketing and business development activity.
Therefore, the adjusted measures reect the post acquisition revenue attributable to, and operating costs incurred by, the Group.
Diluted earnings per share includes the impact of dilutive share options in issue throughout the period.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the  CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The Group defines its CGUs as geographical territories, because they represent the smallest identiable group of assets that generate cash ows.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates the discount rates using pre-tax rates that reect current market assessments of the time value of money.
The growth rates are based on detailed business plans.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and plans for the next three years approved by the Directors and extrapolates the annual cash ow using estimated, country specic, long-term growth rates.
The pre-tax cost of capital rates used to discount the forecast pre-tax cash ows are di erent for each territory and are detailed below: UK 8.7% FY16: 7.5% North America 12.2% FY16: 10.6% France 10.4% FY16: 7.8% Spain 10.0% FY16: 8.0% Pre-tax cost of capital rates reect the latest cost of debt and equity for a sample of comparable companies in accordance with the market participant premise detailed in IAS 36.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGUs carrying value, which also reects the di erent risk prole of each CGU.
The Group believes that there are no reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions in the next year which would result in the carrying amount of goodwill exceeding the recoverable amount.

The longterm growth rate is 2% FY16: 2%.
Other intangible assets Acquisition intangibles represent non-monetary assets, arising on business combinations, and include acquired access rights and acquired customer databases.
Other intangibles include trademarks, access rights, customer databases and software.
The asset will be amortised over 10 years on a straight-line basis from the point at which the asset is complete.
At the balance sheet date, there are no contractual commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment FY16: nil.

This assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all significant balances that are past due and involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the creditworthiness of the counterparty.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, there is no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread across a large number of counterparties and customers.
There are no customers that represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 12.1m FY16: 7.1m which are past due at the reporting date but for which the Group has not provided for as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average age of receivables not impaired is 21 days FY16: 30 days.
Trade debtors to be received from customers relating to instalments of policy premiums that are not yet due have been excluded from the average age calculation.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Ageing of impaired trade receivables: 2017 2016 m m 1 - 30 days 31 - 60 days 61 - 90 days 0.2 91 days 1.3 2.2 Current not yet due 0.4 0.3 1.9 2.5 The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
Other receivables The Group serves as an intermediary, whereby it is responsible for the collection of cash on behalf of third parties.
Other receivables mainly represent those amounts to be collected from policyholders and are to be remitted to third parties for obligations such as the cost of underwriting and Insurance Premium Tax.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to individual receivables being small and spread across a diverse policyholder base.
In addition, overall balance sheet exposure is mitigated as defaults on these receivables can, in the most part, be o set against the corresponding payable included in Other creditors.
Cash balances and cash equivalents Cash balances and cash equivalents of 46.2m FY16: 54.2m comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.

Foreign currency borrowings are drawn in the UK and passed to the overseas subsidiaries of the Group by way of intercompany loans, denominated in the same currencies.
These external borrowings and the equivalent intercompany receivable loans are treated as monetary liabilities and assets respectively and, as such, the Groups foreign currency exposure risk is minimised.

172 Annual Report & Accounts 2017 The estimated fair values are calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model for SAYE and One Plan and Monte Carlo simulations for the LTIP.
The assumptions used in the models which are comparable to the prior year are as follows: Input Assumption Share price Price at date of grant Exercise price Per scheme rules Expected volatility 23% 52% Option life Per scheme rules Expected dividends Based on historic dividend yield Risk free interest rate 0.1% 1.3% Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages.
Volatility is calculated by looking at the historical share price movements prior to the date of grant over a period of time commensurate with the remaining term for each award.
The Group recognised total expenses of 7.4m FY16: 5.1m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
Retirement benefit schemes Dened contribution schemes The Group operates a dened contribution retirement benefit scheme for all UK employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the scheme within two years of joining and they choose to take a refund, the contributions paid by the Group are forfeited by the employee.
In addition to the scheme in the UK, the Group operates a dened contribution retirement benefit scheme for North America employees.
The total cost charged to income of 3.8m FY16: 3.4m represents contributions payable to the schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes.
At 31 March 2017, contributions of 323,000 FY16: 311,000 due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Dened benefit scheme The Group participates in a dened benefit scheme, the Water Companies Pension Scheme, which is closed to new members.
This is a sectionalised scheme and the Group participates in the HomeServe plc Section of the Scheme.
The Section is administered by a Trustee and is independent of the Groups nances.
Contributions are paid to the Section in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuary.
The results of the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2014 were updated to the accounting date by a qualied independent actuary in accordance with IAS19.
Remeasurements are recognised immediately through other comprehensive income.

As an indication, all other things being equal: an increase in the discount rate of 0.1% would lead to a reduction in the value placed on the obligations of the Section of approximately 0.8m an increase in the ination assumption rate of 0.1% would lead to an increase in the value placed on the obligations of the Section of approximately 0.7m an increase of life expectancy of one year would lead to an increase in the value placed on the obligations of the Section of approximately 0.9m.

Financial instruments Principal financial instruments The principal financial instruments used by the Group from which financial instrument risk arises are as follows: cash and cash equivalents bank overdrafts, revolving credit facilities, bank loans and Private Placements trade receivables other receivables trade payables contingent and deferred consideration other creditors investments.
All principal financial instruments are stated at amortised cost, with the exception of contingent and deferred consideration and investments which are held at fair value.
Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The Group has no financial instruments with fair values that are determined by reference to Level 1 or Level 2 and there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels during the period.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements.
The Group held the following Level 3 financial instruments at fair value: 2017 2016 m m Investments note 17 8.5 7.8 Call option over associate Contingent and deferred consideration at fair value through profit and loss: Current liabilities 2.6 1.2 Non-current liabilities 5.1 5.6 The movement in investments versus the prior year relates to the foreign exchange movement as a result of the weakening of Sterling versus the Euro.
The call option over associate included above relates to the option the Group has to acquire a further 35% of the shares in Sherrington Mews Limited, as referred to in note 18.
In accordance with IAS39 the valuation of this call option has been considered and it is not deemed to have any material fair value at 31 March 2017 as it would not currently allow the Group to acquire an additional stake at less than market value.

Financial instruments continued Principal financial instruments continued Contingent and deferred consideration liabilities are calculated using forecasts of future performance of acquisitions discounted to present value.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 21, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 25 to 32 and the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
The table below presents quantitative data for the components the Group manages as capital: 2017 2016 m m Attributable to equity holders of the parent 369.2 316.6 Bank and other loans 270.1 196.5 Certain of the entities in the Group are subject to externally imposed capital requirements from the Financial Conduct Authority.
Where such requirements exist, the Group manages the risk through the close monitoring of performance and distributable capital within the entities impacted by the regulations.
The Group has complied with all such arrangements throughout the current and preceding year.
178 Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Financial risk management objectives The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank and other loans, overdrafts and cash and cash equivalents.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
Financial risk management is overseen by the Board according to objectives, targets and policies set by the Board.
Treasury risk management, including management of currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk is carried out by a central Group Treasury function in accordance with objectives, targets and policies set by the Board.
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Classication of financial instruments In addition to the other financial assets and liabilities set out above in Principal financial instruments, the Group also has financial assets and liabilities disclosed in notes 20, 23 and 24.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates primarily relates to the Groups longterm debt requirements with oating interest rates.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of xed and variable rate debts.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change of 10% increase in the cost of borrowing, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on oating rate borrowings.
2017 2016 Increase in cost of borrowing 10% 10% Reduction in profit before tax m 0.1 0.1 Credit risk The Group trades only with creditworthy third parties.
It is the Groups policy that, with the exception of our policy membership customers, customers who wish to trade on credit terms are reviewed for financial stability.
The majority of the Groups trade receivables consist of a large number of individual members and hence for these balances the Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to a single counterparty.
As a result, the Groups exposure to bad debts is not considered to be significant.
Note 3 to the accounts contains further detail regarding the potential risk if cancellations were to be 10% higher than expected.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The Group manages the risk associated with cash and cash equivalents through depositing funds only with reputable and creditworthy banking institutions.
179 Financial statements Notes to financial statements continued Year ended 31 March 2017 Liquidity risk Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Groups Board which sets the framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash ows.
Included in note 21 are details of the undrawn facilities that are available to the Group to reduce liquidity risk further.
With the exception of deferred and contingent consideration, the revolving credit facilities, half of the amortising four year term loan, a loan in the USA and the US Private Placements, all of the Groups financial liabilities are due for payment within two years, based on contractual payment terms.
The maturity prole of the Groups financial liabilities based on contractual maturities is provided in the table below.
Interest is payable on all bank and other loans.
Deferred and contingent consideration payments are stated on the basis of expected cash outows before discounting.
The actual payment prole of Other creditors is principally dependent upon the collection of the corresponding Other receivables from policyholders.
These amounts principally relate to underwriting, which are collected from policyholders and remitted to underwriters following cash collection.
Therefore, the actual cash ows may di er from those presented, but will not result in the acceleration of the settlement of the liability.
The principal is included in the previous table when the facility is due to expire.
