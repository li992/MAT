119 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2017 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONAL FINANCIAL RISK GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS GROUP AND OTHER & MARKETPLACE REVIEW REVIEW INFORMATION NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 1 BASIS OF PREPARATION Smith & Nephew plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales.
In these accounts, the Group means the Company and all its subsidiaries.
The principal activities ofthe Group are to develop, manufacture, market and sell medical devices and services.
As required by the European Unions IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 2006, the Group has prepared its accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU effective as at 31 December 2017.
The Group has also prepared its accounts in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB effective as at 31 December 2017.
IFRSs as adopted by the EU differs in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the IASB.
However, the differences have no impact for the periods presented.
The preparation of accounts in conformity with IFRS requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year.
The accounting policies requiring management to use significant estimates and assumptions are: inventories, impairment, taxation and liability provisions.
These are discussed on page 114.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.
The Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis for accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Further information regarding the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in Our Business & Marketplace on pages 817.
As described in Note 15, the Group meets its funding requirements through a mixture of shareholders funds, bank borrowings and private placement notes.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had committed borrowing facilities of $2.4bn and total liquidity of $1.2bn, including net cash and cash equivalents of $155m and undrawn committed borrowing facilities of $1bn.
The earliest expiry date of the Groups committed borrowing facilities is in respect of a $300m bilateral term loan facility dueto expire in April 2020.
In addition, Note 16 includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: our financial risk management objectives: details of our financial instruments and hedging activities: and our exposures to foreign exchange, interest rates and credit risk.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group has sufficient financial resources.
The Directors have reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group are well placed to manage their business risks and to continue in operational existence for a period of at least three years from the date of the approval of the financial statements.
Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in accordance with the guidance Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting issued by the FRC in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
There have been no new accounting pronouncements impacting the Group in 2017.
New accounting standards effective 2018 A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for the Groups annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated accounts.
These include IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which will be adopted from 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 The Group has undertaken a detailed impact assessment applying IFRS 15 to all the current ways in which the Group delivers products or services to customers to identify divergence with current practice and has concluded that IFRS 15 will not have a significant impact on the timing and recognition of revenue.
The performance obligations involved in the sale of an orthopaedic implant are all considered to occur at the time of procedure giving rise to no difference in the timing of revenue recognition.
The instrument set and implant used in an orthopaedic procedure are considered to be part of a single performance obligation.
In line with past practice we will continue to measure and recognise revenue based on invoiced amounts at the time of the procedure.
Revenue recognised on the sale of products in our other surgical and wound businesses have also been considered with reference to IFRS 15 with no impact identified in relation to the timing and measurement of revenue.
The Group has also considered the impact on provisions for returns, trade discounts and rebates and has determined that the current policy is aligned with IFRS 15.
The Group intends to apply the practical expedients in IFRS 15 to not disclose the amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations and an explanation of when the Group expects to recognise that amount as revenue for all reporting periods presented before 1 January 2018.
The Group also intends to apply the practical expedients in relation to contracts with variable consideration and contracts that were completed at the beginning of the earliest period presented and or modified before the beginning of the earliest period presented.
The Group has concluded that applying these practical expedients will not have a significant impact on the timing, measurement and recognition of revenue.
The Group has assessed the disclosure requirements of IFRS 15 and has preliminarily determined that the majority of the disclosures are either currently included in the financial statements or can be prepared using data currently available.
The Group continues to assess the disclosure requirements in relation to unsatisfied performance obligations and the disaggregation of revenue.
120 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2017 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONAL FINANCIAL RISK GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS GROUP AND OTHER & MARKETPLACE REVIEW REVIEW INFORMATION NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS continued 1 BASIS OF PREPARATION continued IFRS 9 The amendments to IFRS 9 mainly relate to the classification and measurement of financial instruments, and will not have a significant impact to the Group financial statements.
When initially applying IFRS 9, the Group may choose as its accounting policy to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 instead of the requirements in IFRS 9.
The Group will continue to apply the hedge requirements of IAS 39 on transition.
The Group has considered the expected credit loss model and has determined that it will not have a significant impact on the provision for bad and doubtful debts.
The Group has elected, from 1 January 2018, to present changes in the fair value of trade investments in the income statement.
New accounting standards effective 2019 IFRS 16 IFRS16 Leases will be adopted retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognised at 1 January 2019 and the Group is currently assessing the application and impact of the standard.
1.1 Consolidation The Group accounts include the accounts of Smith & Nephew plc and its subsidiaries for the periods during which they were members of the Group.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are consolidated in the Group accounts from the date that the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated on consolidation.
Allsubsidiaries have year ends which are co-terminus with the Groups, with the exception of jurisdictions whereby a different year end is required by local legislation.
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary and any related components ofequity.
Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Any retained interest in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value.
1.2 Foreign currencies Functional and presentation currency The Group accounts are presented in US Dollars.
The Companys functional currency is US Dollars.
Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group companies at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated to the functional currency as at the exchange rate at the reporting date.
Non-monetary items are not retranslated.
Foreign operations Balance sheet items of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition are translated into US Dollars on consolidation at the exchange rates at the reporting date.
Income statement items and the cash flows of foreign operations are translated at average rates as an approximation to actual transaction rates, with actual transaction rates used for large one off transactions.
Foreign currency differences are recognised in Other comprehensive income and accumulated in Other reserves within equity.
These include: exchange differences on the translation at closing rates of exchange of non-US Dollar opening net assets: the differences arising between the translation of profits into US Dollars at actual oraverage, as an approximation and closing exchange rates: to the extent that the hedging relationship is effective, the difference on translation of foreign currency borrowings or swaps that are used to finance or hedge the Groups net investments in foreign operations: and the movement in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts used to hedge forecast foreign exchange cash flows.
The exchange rates used for the translation of currencies into US Dollars that have the most significant impact on the Group results were: 2017 2016 2015 Average rates Sterling 1.29 1.35 1.53 Euro 1.13 1.11 1.11 Swiss Franc 1.02 1.02 1.04 Year end rates Sterling 1.35 1.23 1.48 Euro 1.20 1.05 1.09 Swiss Franc 1.02 0.98 1.00 121 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2017 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONAL FINANCIAL RISK GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS GROUP AND OTHER & MARKETPLACE REVIEW REVIEW INFORMATION NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS continued 2 BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION The Group is engaged in a single business activity, being the development, manufacture and sale of medical technology products and services.
Development, manufacturing, supply chain and central functions are managed globally for the Group as a whole.
Sales are managed through two geographical selling regions: US and International: with a president for each who is responsible for the commercial review of that region.
The Executive Committee ExCo, comprises geographical presidents and certain heads of function and is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer CEO.
ExCo is the body through which the CEO uses the authority delegated to him by the Board of Directors to manage the operations and performance of the Group.
All significant operating decisions regarding the allocation and prioritisation of the Groups resources and assessment of the Groups performance are made by ExCo, and whilst the members have individual responsibility for the implementation of decisions within their respective areas, it is at the ExCo level that these decisions are made.
Accordingly, ExCo is considered to be the Groups chief operating decision maker as defined by IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
In making decisions about the prioritisation and allocation of the Groups resources, ExCo reviews financial information on an integrated basis for the Group as a whole and determines the best allocation of resources to Group-wide projects.
This information is prepared substantially on the same basis as the Groups IFRS financial statements aside from the adjustments described in Note 2.2.
In assessing performance, ExCo also considers financial information presented on a geographical selling region and product franchise basis for revenue.
Financial information for corporate and functional costs is presented on a Group-wide basis.
The types of products and services offered by the Groups global business segment are as follows: Sports Medicine Joint Repair, which offers surgeons a broad array of instruments, technologies and implants necessary to perform minimally invasive surgery of the joints: Arthroscopic Enabling Technologies, which offers healthcare providers a variety of technologies such as fluid management equipment for surgical access, high definition cameras, digital image capture, scopes, light sources and monitors to assist with visualisation inside the joints, radio frequency, electromechanical and mechanical tissue resection devices, and hand instruments for removing damaged tissue: Trauma & Extremities, consisting of internal and external devices used in the stabilisation of severe fractures and deformity correction procedures: Other Surgical Businesses, which includes robotics-assisted surgery, various products and technologies to assist in surgical treatment of the ear, nose and throat, and gynaecological instrumentation, until the Gynaecology business disposal in August 2016: Knee Implants, which offers an innovative range of products for specialised knee replacement procedures: Hip Implants, which offers a range of specialist products for reconstruction of the hip joint: Advanced Wound Care, which includes products for the treatment and prevention of acute and chronic wounds, including leg, diabetic and pressure ulcers, burns and post-operative wounds: Advanced Wound Bioactives, which includes biologics and other bioactive technologies that provide unique approaches to debridement and dermal repair regeneration: and Advanced Wound Devices, which consists of traditional and single-use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy and hydrosurgery systems.
The segment information is prepared in conformity with the accounting policies of the Group and the accounting standard IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
The segment profit measure reported to the Chief Executive Officer and the ExCo for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment is trading profit and excludes the effects of non-recurring, infrequent, non-cash and other items that management does not otherwise believe are indicative of the underlying performance of the consolidated Group as discussed in Note 2.2.
Group financing including interest receivable and payable is managed on a net basis outside the business segment.
122 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2017 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONAL FINANCIAL RISK GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS GROUP AND OTHER & MARKETPLACE REVIEW REVIEW INFORMATION NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS continued 2 BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION continued 2.1 Revenue by business segment and geography Accounting policy Revenue comprises sales of products and services to third parties at amounts invoiced net of trade discounts and rebates, excluding taxes on revenue.
Revenue from the sale of products is recognised upon transfer to the customer of the significant risks and rewards of ownership.
This is generally when goods are delivered to customers.
There is no significant revenue associated with the provision of discrete services.
In Established Markets we typically sell direct to healthcare institutions while in our Emerging Markets we typically sell to distributors and intermediaries.
In general our surgical business is more direct to hospitals and ambulatory service centres whereas in our wound business, and in particular products used in community and homecare facilities, it is through wholesalers.
Sales of inventory located at customer premises and available for customers immediate use are recognised when notification is received that the product has been implanted or used.
Appropriate provisions for returns, trade discounts and rebates are deducted from revenue.
Rebates comprise retrospective volume discounts granted to certain customers on attainment of certain levels of purchases from the Group.
These are accrued over the course of the arrangement based on estimates of the level of business expected and adjusted at the end of the arrangement to reflect actual volumes.

The Group has identified the following items, where material, as those to be excluded from operating profit when arriving at trading profit: acquisition and disposal-related items: amortisation and impairment of acquisition intangibles: significant restructuring programmes: gains and losses arising from legal disputes: and other significant items.
Further detail is provided in Notes 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5.

Internal development expenditure is only capitalised if the recognition criteria in IAS 38 Intangible Assets have been satisfied.
The Group considers that the regulatory, technical and market uncertainties inherent in the development of new products mean that in most cases development costs should not be capitalised as intangible assets until products receive approval from the appropriate regulatory body.
Payments to third parties for research and development projects are accounted for based on the substance of the arrangement.
If the arrangement represents outsourced research and development activities the payments are generally expensed except in limited circumstances where the respective development expenditure would be capitalised under the principles established in IAS 38.
By contrast, the payments are capitalised ifthearrangement represents consideration for the acquisition of intellectual property developed at the risk of the third party.
Capitalised development expenditures are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives from product launch.
Advertising costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.

127 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2017 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONAL FINANCIAL RISK GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS GROUP AND OTHER & MARKETPLACE REVIEW REVIEW INFORMATION NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS continued 5 TAXATION Accounting policy The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed.
It is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
The Group operates in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world and it is Group policy to submit its tax returns to the relevant tax authorities as promptly as possible.
At any given time, the Group is involved in disputes and tax audits and will have a number of tax returns potentially subject to audit.
Significant issues may take several years to resolve.
In estimating the probability and amount of any tax charge, management takes into account the views of internal and external advisers and updates the amount of tax provision whenever necessary.
The ultimate tax liability may differ from the amount provided depending on interpretations of tax law, settlement negotiations or changes in legislation.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is not recognised: for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and associates where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that this will not reverse in the foreseeable future: on the initial recognition of non-deductible goodwill: and on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, does not affect the accounting or taxable profit.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis, and at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled.
It is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised within other comprehensive income or equity respectively.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.

The 2015 net prior period adjustment benefit of $25m mainly relates to provision releases after settlement with tax authorities or the expiry of statute of limitations and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
Included in the total tax charge is a $32m net benefit as a result of the new US tax reform legislation enacted in December 2017, which comprises a benefit from a revaluation of deferred tax balances included within changes in tax rates, partially offset by a current tax charge relating to the deemed repatriation of foreign profits not previously taxed in the US.
Total taxation as per the income statement of $112m includes a $58m net credit 2016: $48m net charge, 2015: $130m net credit as a consequence of the net benefit from US tax reform, acquisitions and disposals, amortisation and impairment of acquisition intangibles and legal and other.
128 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2017 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONAL FINANCIAL RISK GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS GROUP AND OTHER & MARKETPLACE REVIEW REVIEW INFORMATION NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS continued 5 TAXATION continued Factors affecting future tax charges The Group operates in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world and is subject to factors that may affect future tax charges including the recently enacted US tax reform, the review by the European Commission into whether the UK CFC financing exemption rules constitute illegal State Aid, implementation of the OECDs BEPS actions, tax rate changes, tax legislation changes, expiry of the statute of limitations and resolution of tax audits and disputes.
At any given time the Group has unagreed years outstanding in various countries and is involved in tax audits and disputes, some of which may take several years to resolve.
Current tax payable of $233m includes $201m of provisions for uncertain tax positions in respect of various countries.
The Group believes that it has made adequate provision in respect of additional tax liabilities that may arise from these unagreed years, tax audits and disputes, the majority of which relate to transfer pricing matters as would be expected for a Group operating internationally.
However, the actual liability for any particular issue may be higher or lower than the amount provided resulting in a negative or positive effect on the tax charge in any given year, including a reduction in the tax charge because of an expiry of the relevant statute of limitations.
Whilst the impact can vary from year to year, the negative or positive effect on the tax charge for 2018 is not expected to result in a net prior period adjustment for 2018 which is greater than that realised in 2017.
The Group has completed its review of the new US tax reform legislation, as enacted, including the reduction of the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, which came into effect on 1 January 2018.
As a result, the Group expects a positive impact on its tax charge for future years in addition to the one-off net tax benefit of $32m in 2017.
However, it should be noted that parts of the new legislation are subject to questions of interpretation, and further regulations may be issued in the future to clarify or change certain elements, which may affect future tax charges.
In December 2016, the Group appealed to the First Tier Tribunal in the UK against a decision by HM Revenue and Customs HMRC relating to the tax deductibility of certain historical foreign exchange losses.
The decision of the Tribunal was released on 8 February 2017 and it upheld the Groups appeal.
HMRC appealed against this decision and their appeal will be heard by the Upper Tribunal in June 2018.
No tax benefit has been recognised to date in respect of these foreign exchange losses.
In the event that the Group is ultimately successful in the Courts, then the Groups tax charge would be reduced, in the year of success, as a result.
In 2016, the UK Government enacted legislation to reduce the main rate of UK statutory corporation tax to 19.0% from 1 April 2017 and 17.0% from 1 April 2020.
Overseas taxation is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.

130 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2017 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONAL FINANCIAL RISK GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS GROUP AND OTHER & MARKETPLACE REVIEW REVIEW INFORMATION NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS continued 6 EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE Accounting policies Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding shares held by the Company in the Employees Share Trust or as treasury shares.
Diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the basic earnings per share for the effect of conversion to ordinary shares associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise share options and awards granted to employees.
Adjusted earnings per share Adjusted earnings per share is a trend measure, which presents the long-term profitability of the Group excluding the impact of specific transactions that management considers affects the Groups short-term profitability.
Adjusted attributable profit is the numerator used for this measure.
The Group has identified the following items as those to be excluded when arriving at adjusted attributable profit: acquisitions and disposals related items including amortisation and impairment of acquisition intangible assets: significant restructuring programmes: significant gains and losses arising from legal disputes and other significant items including US tax reform and taxation thereon.
The calculations of the basic, diluted and adjusted earnings per ordinary share are based on the following attributable profit and numbers of shares: 2017 2016 2015 $ million $ million $ million Earnings Attributable profit for the year 767 784 410 Adjusted attributable profit see below 826 735 761 Attributable profit is reconciled to adjusted attributable profit as follows: 2017 2016 2015 Notes $ million $ million $ million Attributable profit for the year 767 784 410 Acquisition-related costs 10 9 25 Restructuring and rationalisation expenses 3 62 65 Amortisation and impairment of acquisition intangibles 9 140 178 204 1 Legal and other 13 20 187 Profit on disposal of business 21 326 US tax reform 5 32 Taxation on excluded items 5 26 48 130 Adjusted attributable profit 826 735 761 1 L egal and other credit in 2017 includes $16m within operating profits refer to Note 2.5, and a $3m charge within other finance costs for unwinding of the discount on the provision for known, anticipated and settled metal-on-metal hip claims.
In 2016 the legal and other credit includes $30m within operating profits refer to Note 2.5, a $5m charge within other finance costs for unwinding of the discount on the provision for known, anticipated and settled metal-on-metal hip claims, and a $5m charge within share of results of associates for expenses incurred by Bioventus for an aborted initial public offering of shares.
In 2015 legal and other costs include $190m within operating profit refer to Note 2.5 and a $3m net interest credit.

The denominators used for all categories of earnings for basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share are as follows: 2017 2016 2015 Number of shares millions Basic weighted number of shares 874 890 894 Dilutive impact of share options outstanding 1 3 5 Diluted weighted average number of shares 875 893 899 Earnings per ordinary share Basic 87.8 88.1 45.9 Diluted 87.7 87.8 45.6 2 Adjusted 94.5 82.6 85.1 2 A djusted earnings per share is calculated using the basic weighted number of shares.
7 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Accounting policies Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated residual values using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives, and is ultimately recognised in profit or loss.
Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment is 320 years and for buildings is 2050 years.
Assets in course of construction are not depreciated until they are available for use.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.
Finance costs relating to the purchase or construction of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that take longer than one year to complete are capitalised based on the Group weighted average borrowing costs.
All other finance costs are expensed as incurred.
Impairment of assets The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment loss.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.
In assessing value-in-use, its estimated future cash flow is discounted to its present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

133 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2017 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONAL FINANCIAL RISK GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS GROUP AND OTHER & MARKETPLACE REVIEW REVIEW INFORMATION NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS continued 8 GOODWILL Accounting policy Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually.
Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit CGU that is expected to benefit from the acquisition.
The goodwill is tested annually for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount to the carrying value of the CGUs.
The CGUs identified by management are at the aggregated product franchise levels of Orthopaedics, Other Surgical Devices and Advanced Wound Management, in the way the core assets are used to generate cash flows.
If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount then an impairment loss is determined to have occurred.
Any impairment losses that arise are recognised immediately in the income statement and are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill and then to the carrying amounts of the other assets of the CGU.
In carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill a number of significant assumptions have to be made when preparing cash flow projections.
These include the future rate of market growth, discount rates, the market demand for the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired businesses or products, levels of reimbursement and success in obtaining regulatory approvals.
If actual results should differ, or changes in expectations arise, impairment charges may be required which would adversely impact operating results.

For the purpose of goodwill impairment testing, the Advanced Wound Care & Devices and Bioactives CGUs have been aggregated Advanced Wound Management, as this is the level at which goodwill is monitored and level at which the economic benefits relating to the goodwill within these CGUs is realised.
Goodwill is allocated to the Groups CGUs as follows: 2017 2016 $ million $ million Orthopaedics 566 551 Other Surgical Devices 1,501 1,351 Advanced Wound Management 304 286 2,371 2,188 Impairment reviews were performed in September 2017 and September 2016 by comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
These were updated during December, taking into account any significant events that occurred between September and December.
For each CGU, the recoverable amounts are based on value-in-use which is calculated from pre-tax cash flow projections for five years using data from the Groups budget and strategic planning process, the results of which are reviewed and approved by the Board.
These projections exclude any estimated future cash inflows or outflows expected to arise from future restructurings.
The five-year period is in line with the Groups strategic planning process.
In determining the growth rates used in the calculations of the value-in-use, management considered annual revenue growth.
Projections are based on anticipated volume and value growth in the markets served by the Group and assumptions as to market share movements.
Each year the projections for the previous year are compared to actual results and variances are factored into the assumptions used in the current year.
The discount rates used in the value-in-use calculations reflect managements assessment of risks specific to the assets of each CGU.
8.1 Orthopaedics CGU The sales growth and trading profit margin used in the value-in-use calculation for the Orthopaedics CGU, which includes the Reconstruction and Trauma businesses, reflects managements distinctive orthopaedic reconstruction strategy, which combines cutting edge innovation, disruptive business models and a strong Emerging Markets platform to drive outperformance.
Revenue growth rates for the five-year period ranged from 1.0% to 10.6% for the various components of the Orthopaedics CGU.
The average growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond the five-year period in calculating the terminal value is 2.0%.
The pre-tax discount rate used in the Orthopaedics CGU value-in-use calculation reflects the geographical mix and is 10.0%.
134 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2017 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONAL FINANCIAL RISK GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS GROUP AND OTHER & MARKETPLACE REVIEW REVIEW INFORMATION NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS continued 8 GOODWILL continued 8.2 Other Surgical Devices CGU The value-in-use calculation for the Other Surgical Devices CGU reflects growth rates and trading profit margins consistent with managements strategy to rebalance Smith & Nephew towards higher growth areas such as, for example, Sports Medicine.
Revenue growth rates for the five-year period ranged from 1.0% to 9.0% for the various components of the Other Surgical Devices CGU.
The weighted average growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond the five-year period in calculating the terminal value is 2.0%.
Thepre-tax discount rate used in the Other Surgical Devices CGU value-in-use calculation reflects the geographical mix of the revenues and is 10.0%.
8.3 Advanced Wound Management CGU The aggregated Advanced Wound Management CGU comprises the Advanced Wound Care & Devices and Bioactives CGUs.
In performing the value-in-use calculation for this combined CGU, management considered the Groups focus across the wound product franchises, focusing on widening access to the customer, the higher added value sectors of healing chronic wounds and tissue repair using bioactives, and by continuing to improve efficiency.
Revenue growth rates for the five-year period ranged from 2.0% to 17.3% for the various components of the Advanced Wound Management CGU.
Thepre-tax discount rate used in the Advanced Wound Management CGU value-in-use calculation reflects the geographical mix and industry sector and is 10.0%.
8.4 Sensitivity to changes in assumptions used in value-in-use calculations The calculations of value-in-use for the identified CGUs are most sensitive to changes in discount and growth rates.
Managements consideration of these sensitivities is set out below: Growth of market and market share management has considered the impact of a variance in market growth and market share.
The valuein-use calculations shows that if the assumed long-term growth rates were reduced to nil, the recoverable amount of each CGU would still be greater than its carrying value.
Discount rate management has considered the impact of an increase in the discount rate applied to the value-in-use calculations.
This sensitivity analysis shows that for the recoverable amount of each CGU to be less than its carrying value, the discount rate would have to be increased to 29.5% for the Orthopaedics CGU, 16.6% for the Other Surgical Devices CGU and 26.3% for the Advanced Wound Management CGU.
9 INTANGIBLE ASSETS Accounting policies Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from a business combination including purchased patents, know-how, trademarks, licences and distribution rights are initially measured at cost.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a material business combination referred to as acquisition intangibles is the fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
All intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives.
The estimated useful economic life of an intangible asset ranges between three and 20 years depending on its nature.
Internally-generated intangible assets are expensed in the income statement as incurred.
Purchased computer software and certain costs of information technology projects are capitalised as intangible assets.
Software that is integral to computer hardware is capitalised as plant and equipment.
Contingent consideration Contingent consideration receivable associated with the sale of product rights and other assets outside a business combination is recognised at the time of purchase to the extent that the future event upon which the contingent consideration is conditional is within the Groups control, or to the extent that it is considered to be virtually certain that the contingent consideration will become due.
If the contingent consideration is outside the Groups control or it cannot be considered virtually certain that it will become due, an asset and corresponding entry in profit and loss is recognised only once it becomes virtually certain that the contingent consideration will become due.
Contingent consideration payable associated with the purchase of product rights and other assets outside a business combination is recognised at the time of sale to the extent that the future event upon which the contingent consideration is conditional is under the control of the seller and it is considered probable that the contingent consideration will become due.
Contingent consideration associated within a contingent condition that is within the Groups control is recognised at the point when the contingent condition is met.
Impairment of intangible assets The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which it belongs.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or CGUs fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.
In assessing value-in-use, its estimated future cash flow is discounted to its present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
In carrying out impairment reviews of intangible assets a number of significant assumptions have to be made when preparing cash flow projections.
If actual results should differ, orchanges in expectations should arise, impairment charges may be required which would adversely impact operating results.

In 2017, a product-related intangible asset was determined to have a value in use below its carrying value, resulting in an impairment charge of $10m being recognised.
In determining the recoverable amount of the Coblation technology asset acquired with the purchase of ArthoCare in 2014, revenue from products utilising this technology was assumed to have a growth rate of 4-5% in the medium term.
This supported the carrying value of the Coblation technology asset but a reduction of 4% would give rise to there being no headroom.
In 2016, two product-related intangible assets were determined to have a value in use below their carrying value, resulting in an impairment charge being recognised.
The impairment charge primarily relates to $32m from Oasis, calculated using a discount rate of 10.3%, a product right acquired with the Healthpoint acquisition in 2012.
The continued reimbursement pressure in 2016 resulted in revenues not increasing at the previously expected rate.
The second product-related intangible asset has no residual carrying value.
136 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2017 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONAL FINANCIAL RISK GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS GROUP AND OTHER & MARKETPLACE REVIEW REVIEW INFORMATION NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS continued 10 INVESTMENTS Accounting policy Investments, other than those related to associates, are initially recorded at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs on the trade date.
The Group has investments in unquoted entities and an entity that holds mainly unquoted equity securities, which by their nature have no fixed maturity date or coupon rate.
These investments are classed as available-for-sale carried at fair value.
The fair value of these investments are based on the underlying fair value of the equity securities: marketable securities are valued by reference to closing prices in the market: and non-marketable securities are estimated considering factors including the purchase price: prices of recent significant private placements of securities of the same issuer and estimates of liquidation value.
Changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income except where management considers that there is objective evidence of an impairment of the underlying equity securities.
Objective evidence would includea significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost less any impairment loss previously recognised.
Impairment losses are recognised by reclassifying the losses accumulated in other reserves to profit or loss.

The Groups share of associates profit or loss is included in one separate income statement line and is calculated afterdeduction of their respective taxes.
At 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, the Group holds 49% of Bioventus LLC Bioventus.
Bioventus is a limited liability company operating as a partnership.
The companys headquarters is located in Durham, North Carolina, US.
Bioventus focuses its medical product development around its core competencies of orthobiologic therapies and orthopaedic diagnostics from which it develops and markets clinically proven orthopaedic therapies and diagnostic tools, including osteoarthritis pain treatments, bone growth stimulators and ultrasound devices.
Bioventus sells bone healing stimulation devices and is a provider of osteoarthritis injection therapies.
The Groups ability to recover the value of its investment is dependent upon the ongoing clinical and commercial success of these products.
The profit after taxation recognised in the income statement relating to Bioventus was $6m 2016: loss after taxation $3m.
The carrying amount of this investment was reviewed for impairment as at the balance sheet date.
For the purposes of impairment testing the recoverable amount of this investment was based on its fair value less cost to sell, estimated using discounted cash flows.

12 INVENTORIES Accounting policy Finished goods and work-in-progress are valued at factory cost, including appropriate overheads, on a first-in first-out basis.
Raw materials and bought-in finished goods are valued at purchase price.
All inventories are reduced to net realisable value where lower than cost.
Inventory acquired aspart of a business acquisition is valued at selling price less costs to sell and a profit allowance for selling efforts.
Orthopaedic instruments are generally not sold but provided to customers and distributors for use in surgery.
They are recorded as inventory until they are deployed at which point they are transferred to plant and equipment and depreciated over their useful economic lives of between three and seven years.
A feature of the orthopaedic business is the high level of product inventory required, some of which is located at customer premises and is available for customers immediate use referred to as consignment inventory.
Complete sets of product, including large and small sizes, have to be made available in this way.
These outer sizes are used less frequently than standard sizes and towards the end of the product life cycle are inevitably in excess of requirements.
Adjustments to carrying value are therefore required to be made to orthopaedic inventory to anticipate this situation.
These adjustments are calculated in accordance with a formula based on levels of inventory compared with historical or forecast usage.
This formula is applied on an individual product line basis and is first applied when a product group has been on the market for two years.
This method of calculation is considered appropriate based on experience but it involves management judgements on effectiveness of inventory deployment, length of product lives, phase-out of old products and efficiency of manufacturing planning systems.

The decrease in reserves of $7m in the year comprised a $20m reduction in the reserve relating to the write-off of inventory which was partially offset by foreign exchange movements of $13m.
The determination of the estimate of excess and obsolete inventory is a critical accounting estimate and includes assumptions on the future usage of all different items of finished goods.
This estimate is not considered to have a range of potential outcomes that is significantly different to the $296m held at 31 December 2017.
The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in cost of goods sold amounted to $1,013m 2016: $1,131m, 2015: $961m.
In addition, $68m was recognised as an expense within cost of goods sold resulting from inventory write-offs 2016: $85m, 2015: $73m.
Notwithstanding inventory acquired within acquisitions, no inventory is carried at fair value less costs to sell in any year.

They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
These are classified as non-current assets.
The Group manages credit risk through credit limits which require authorisation commensurate with the size of the limit and which are regularly reviewed.
Credit limit decisions are made based on available financial information and the business case.
Significant receivables are regularly reviewed and monitored at Group level.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers and geographies.
Furthermore, the Groups principal customers are backed by government and public or private medical insurance funding, which historically represent a lower risk of default.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class ofreceivable.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.

The Group uses derivative financial instruments only to manage the financial risks associated with underlying business activities and their financing.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is not able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
The Groups policy is to ensure that there is sufficient funding and facilities in place to meet foreseeable borrowing requirements.
The Group manages and monitors liquidity risk through regular reporting of current cash and borrowing balances and periodic preparation and review of short and medium-term cash forecasts, having regard to the maturities of investments and borrowing facilities.
The Group has available committed facilities of $2.4bn 2016: $2.4bn.
The interest payable on borrowings under committed facilities is either at fixed or floating rates.
Floating rates are typically based on the LIBOR or other reference rate relevant to the term and currency concerned.
The Company is subject to restrictive covenants under its principal facility agreements.
These financial covenants are tested at the end of each half year for the 12 months ending on the last day of the testing period.
As of 31 December 2017, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.
The facilities are also subject to customary events of default, none of which are currently anticipated to occur.

142 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2017 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONAL FINANCIAL RISK GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS GROUP AND OTHER & MARKETPLACE REVIEW REVIEW INFORMATION NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS continued 15 CASH AND BORROWINGS continued 15.5 Finance leases Accounting policy Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The leased assets are measured initially at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised as property, plant or equipment and depreciated accordingly.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction in the outstanding liability.
The finance expense is allocated to each period during thelease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Future minimum lease payments under finance leases together with the present value of the minimum lease payments are as follows: 2017 2016 $ million $ million Within one year 3 After one and within two years 3 After two and within three years 3 After three and within four years After four and within five years After five years Total minimum lease payments 9 Discounted by imputed interest 2 Present value of minimum lease payments 7 In 2017, the Group terminated its finance lease.
Present value of minimum lease payments can be split out as: $nil 2016: $2m due within one year, $nil 2016: $5m due between one to five years and $nil 2016: $nil due after five years.
Liquidity and capital resources The Groups policy is to ensure that it has sufficient funding and facilities to meet foreseeable borrowing requirements.
At 31 December 2017, the Group held $155m 2016: $38m, 2015: $102m in cash net of bank overdrafts.
The Group had committed facilities available of $2,425m at 31 December 2017 of which $1,425m was drawn.
Smith & Nephew intends to repay the amounts due within one year using available cash and drawing down on the longer-term facilities.
The principal variations in the Groups borrowing requirements result from the timing of dividend payments, acquisitions and disposals of businesses, timing of capital expenditure and working capital fluctuations.
Smith & Nephew believes that its capital expenditure needs and its working capital funding for 2018, as well as its other known or expected commitments or liabilities, can be met from its existing resources and facilities.
The Groups net debt decreased from $1,550m at the beginning of 2017 to $1,281m at the end of 2017, representing an overall decrease of $269m.
The Groups planned future contributions are considered adequate to cover the current underfunded position in the Groups defined benefit plans.
143 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2017 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONAL FINANCIAL RISK GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS GROUP AND OTHER & MARKETPLACE REVIEW REVIEW INFORMATION NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS continued 16 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT Accounting policy Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at subsequent balance sheet dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of forecast third party and intercompany transactions are recognised in other comprehensive income until the associated asset or liability is recognised.
Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement in the period in which the hedged transaction affects profit and loss.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset, the amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying value of the asset.
Currency swaps to match foreign currency net assets with foreign currency liabilities are fair valued at the balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair values of currency swaps that are designated and effective as net investment hedges are matched in other comprehensive income against changes in value of the related net assets.
Interest rate derivatives transacted to fix interest rates on floating rate borrowings are accounted for as cash flow hedges and changes in the fair values resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss.
Interest rate derivatives transacted to convert fixed rate borrowings into floating rate borrowings are accounted for as fair value hedges and changes in the fair values resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in the income statement.
Any ineffectiveness on hedging instruments and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement within other finance costs as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is retained there until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred.
16.1 Foreign exchange exposures The Group operates in many countries and as a consequence has transactional and translational foreign exchange exposure.
It is Group policy for operating units not to hold material unhedged monetary assets or liabilities other than in their functional currencies.
Foreign exchange variations affect trading results in two ways.
Firstly, on translation of overseas sales and profits into US Dollars and secondly, transactional exposures arising where some, or all of the costs of sale are incurred in a different currency from the sale.
The principal transactional exposures arise as the proportion of costs in US Dollars, Sterling and Swiss Francs exceed the proportion of sales in each of these currencies and correspondingly the proportion of sales in Euros exceeds the proportion of costs in Euros.
The impact of currency movements on the cost of purchases is partly mitigated by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge forecast third party and intercompany trading cash flows up to one year.
When a commitment is entered into, forward foreign exchange contracts are normally used to increase the hedge to 100% of the exposure.
Cash flows relating to cash flow hedges are expected to occur within 12 months of inception and profits and losses on hedges are expected to enter into the determination of profit within cost of goods sold within a further 12-month period.
The principal currencies hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts are US Dollars, Euros, Sterling and Singapore Dollars.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had contracted to exchange within one year the equivalent of $2.3bn 2016: $1.8bn.
Based on the Groups net borrowings as at 31 December 2017, if the US Dollar were to weaken against all currencies by 10%, the Groups net borrowings would decrease by $3m 2016: decrease by $1m as the Group held a higher amount of foreign denominated cash than foreign denominated borrowings.
If the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2017 would have been $53m lower 2016: $51m lower.
Similarly, if the Euro were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2017 would have been $12m higher 2016: $17m higher.
Movements in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts would be recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve.
A 10% strengthening of the US Dollar or Euro against all other currencies at 31 December 2017 would have had the equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
The Groups policy is to hedge all actual foreign exchange exposures and the Groups forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges.
The net impact of transaction related foreign exchange on the income statement from a movement in exchange rates on the value of forward foreign exchange contracts is not significant.
In addition, the movements in the fair value of other financial instruments used for hedging such as currency swaps for which hedge accounting is not applied, offset movements in the values of assets and liabilities and are recognised through the income statement.
144 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2017 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONAL FINANCIAL RISK GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS GROUP AND OTHER & MARKETPLACE REVIEW REVIEW INFORMATION NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS continued 16 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT continued 16.2 Interest rate exposures The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash, borrowings and certain currency and interest rate swaps which are at floating rates.
When required the Group uses interest rate derivatives to meet its objective of protecting borrowing costs within parameters set by the Board.
These interest rate derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve, with the fair value of the interest rate derivatives recorded in the balance sheet.
Additionally, the Group uses interest rate swaps to reduce the overall level of fixed rate debt, within parameters set by the Board.
When used in this way, interest rate derivatives are accounted for as fair value hedges.
The fair value movement of the derivative is offset in the income statement against the fair value movement in the underlying fixed rate debt.
Based on the Groups gross borrowings as at 31 December 2017, if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points in all currencies then the annual net interest charge would increase by $6m 2016: $7m.
A decrease in interest rates by 100 basis points in all currencies would have an equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above.
16.3 Credit risk exposures The Group limits exposure to credit risk on counterparties used for financial instruments through a system of internal credit limits.
The financial exposure of a counterparty is determined as the total of cash and deposits, plus the risk on derivative instruments, assessed as the fair value of the instrument plus a risk element based on the nominal value and the historic volatility of the market value of the instrument.
The Group does not anticipate non-performance of counterparties and believes it is not subject to material concentration of credit risk as the Group operates within a policy of counterparty limits designed to reduce exposure to any single counterparty.
The maximum credit risk exposure on derivatives at 31 December 2017 was $28m 2016: $48m, being the total debit fair values on forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps.
The maximum credit risk exposure on cash at bank at 31 December 2017 was $169m 2016: $100m.
TheGroups exposure to credit risk is not material as the amounts are held in a wide number of banks in a number of different countries.
Credit risk on trade receivables is detailed in Note 13.

There were no other significant interest bearing financial liabilities.
Floating rates on liabilities are typically based on the one, three or six-month LIBOR or other reference rate relevant to the currency concerned.
Theweighted average interest rate on floating rate borrowings as at 31 December 2017 was 3% 2016: 2%.

16.5 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Accounting policy Measurement of fair values A number of the Groups accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets acquired in a business combination see Note 21.
When measuring the fair value of an asset or liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible.
Fair values are categorised into different levels in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable data unobservable inputs.
The Group recognises transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
There has been no change in the classification of financial assets and liabilities, the method and assumptions used in determining fair value and the categorisation of financial assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy from those disclosed in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2016.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is calculated by reference to quoted market forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of currency swaps is determined by reference to quoted market spot rates.
As a result, foreign forward exchange contracts and currency swaps are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
The changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness for derivatives designated in hedge relationships and other financial instruments recognised at fair value.
The fair value of investments is based upon third party pricing models for share issues.
As a result, investments are considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 during 2017 and 2016.
For cash and cash equivalents, short-term loans and receivables, overdrafts and other short-term liabilities which have a maturity of less than three months, the book values approximate the fair values because of their short-term nature.
Long-term borrowings are measured in the balance sheet at amortised cost.
As the Groups long-term borrowings are not quoted publicly and as market prices are not available, their fair values are estimated by discounting future contractual cash flows to net present values at the current market interest rates available to the Group for similar financial instruments as at the year end.
The fair value of the private placement notes is determined using a discounted cash flow model based on prevailing market rates.

The fair value of contingent consideration is estimated using a discounted cash flow model.
The valuation model considers the present value of expected payment, discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
The expected payment is determined by considering the possible scenarios, which relate to the achievement of established milestones and targets, the amount to be paid under each scenario and the probability of each scenario.
As a result, contingent consideration is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.

Where the Group is the plaintiff in pursuing claims against third parties, legal and associated expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred.
The recognition of provisions for legal disputes is subject to a significant degree of estimation.
In making its estimates management takes into account the advice of internal and external legal counsel.
Provisions are reviewed regularly and amounts updated where necessary to reflect developments in the disputes.
The ultimate liability may differ from the amount provided depending on the outcome of court proceedings or settlement negotiations or as new facts emerge.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
For the purpose of calculating any onerous lease provision, the Group takes the discounted future lease payments if any, net of expected rental income.
Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.
A provision for rationalisation is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating losses are not provided for.

Following the settlement of a large part of the US metal-on-metal hip claims discussed below the Group has estimated a provision of $157m 2016: $163m relating to the present value at 31 December 2017 of the estimated costs to resolve all other known and anticipated metal-on-metal hip claims.
The estimated value of the provision has been determined using an actuarial model.
Given the inherent uncertainty in assumptions relating to factors such as the number of claims and outcome the actual costs may differ significantly from this estimate.
A range of expected outcomes between the 25th and 75th percentile generated by the actuarial model would not give rise to a significantly different outcome in 2018.
The provision does not include any possible insurance recoveries on these claims or legal fees associated with defending claims.
The Group carries considerable product liability insurance, and will continue to defend claims vigorously.
The legal and other provisions mainly relate to various other product liability and intellectual property litigation matters.
All provisions are expected to be substantially utilised within five years of 31 December 2017 and none are treated as financial instruments.
149 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2017 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONAL FINANCIAL RISK GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS GROUP AND OTHER & MARKETPLACE REVIEW REVIEW INFORMATION NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS continued 17 PROVISIONS AND CONTINGENCIES continued 17.2 Contingencies The Company and its subsidiaries are party to various legal proceedings, some of which include claims for substantial damages.
The outcome of these proceedings cannot readily be foreseen, but except as described herein management believes none of them is likely to result in a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group.
The Group provides for outcomes that are deemed to be probable and can be reliably estimated.
There is no assurance that losses will not exceed provisions or will not have a significant impact on the Groups results of operations in the period in which they are realised.
In August 2003, the Group withdrew voluntarily from all markets the macrotextured versions of its OXINIUM femoral knee components.
A charge of $154m was recorded in 2004 for anticipated expenses in connection with macrotexture claims.
Most of that amount has since been applied to settlements of such claims, and all claims have now been resolved.
The aggregate cost at 31 December 2017 related to this matter is approximately $205m.
The Group has sought recovery from its primary and excess insurers for costs of resolving the claims.
The primary insurance carrier has paid $60m in full settlement of its policy liability.
However, the excess carriers have denied coverage, citing defences relating to the wording of the insurance policies and other matters.
In December 2004, the Group brought suit against them in the US district court for the Western District of Tennessee, for which a trial has not yet begun.
An additional $22m was received during 2007 from a successful settlement with a third party.
17.3 Legal proceedings Product liability claims The Group faces claims from time to time for alleged defects in its products and has on occasion recalled or withdrawn products from the market.
Such claims are endemic to the medical device industry.
The Group maintains product liability insurance subject to limits and deductibles that management believes are reasonable.
All policies contain exclusions and limitations, however, and there can be no assurance that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all claims.
In recent years, there has been heightened concern about possible adverse effects of hip implant products with metal-on-metal bearing surfaces, and the Group has incurred, and will continue to incur expenses to defend claims in this area.
As of February 2018, and giving effect to the US settlements described below, approximately 740 such claims were pending with the Group around the world, of which approximately 430 had given rise to pending legal proceedings.
Most claims relate to the Groups Birmingham Hip Resurfacing BHR product and its two modular metal-on-metal components: the Birmingham Hip Modular Head BHMH and the optional metal liner component of the R3 Acetabular System R3ML.
The BHMH and R3ML are no longer on the market: the R3ML was withdrawn in 2012 and the BHMH was phased out in 2014.
In 2015, the Group ceased offering smaller sizes of the BHR and restricted instructions for BHR use in female patients.
These actions were taken to ensure that the BHR is only used in those patient groups where it continues to demonstrate strong performance.
In 2015 and 2016, the Groups US subsidiary settled a large part of the majority of its US metal-on-metal hip lawsuits in two group settlements, without admitting liability.
Insurance receipts covered most of the amounts paid, with the net cash cost being $25m.
In November 2017, the Groups US subsidiary entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle a third group of claims, without admitting liability.
The third settlement is expected to be finalised in 2018.
These cases principally related to the Groups modular metal-on-metal hip components, which are no longer on the market.
On 5 April 2017, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation MDL ordered Smith & Nephew BHR cases pending or later filed in US federal court to be consolidated for pre-trial proceedings and transferred to the federal court in Baltimore, Maryland.
There are currently 253 cases pending in the MDL in the United States.
In England and Wales, the Groups UK subsidiary entered into a group settlement in 2017 to settle 150 claims principally related to the Groups modular metal-on-metal hip component, which are no longer on the market.
Metal-on-metal hip implant claims against various companies in England and Wales have been consolidated for trials under group litigation orders in the High Court in London.
The BHR and other claims pending against the Group have been stayed and will not be reactivated until the outcome of those trials is known.
The Group has requested indemnity from its product liability insurers for most of these metal-on-metal hip implant claims.
Each insurer makes its own decision as to coverage issues, and the liability of some insurers depends on exhaustion of lower levels of coverage.
Insurers of the lower layers of the Groups insurances have indemnified the Group in respect of these claims up to the limits of those insurances.
The Group has commenced arbitration proceedings against another insurer in respect of that insurers share of the claims and associated defence costs in the amount of $50m.
Litigation outcomes are difficult to predict and defence costs can be significant.
The Group takes care to monitor the clinical evidence relating to its metal hip implant products and ensure that its product offerings are designed to serve patients interests.
Intellectual property disputes The Group is engaged, as both plaintiff and defendant, in litigation with various competitors and others over claims of patent infringement and other intellectual property matters.
These disputes are being heard in courts in the US and other jurisdictions and also before agencies that examine patents.
Outcomes are rarely certain and costs are often significant.
The Group prosecuted and defended a series of patent infringement suits against Arthrex in US federal courts in Oregon and Texas starting in 2004, principally relating to suture anchors for use in shoulder surgery.
Arthrex paid $99m in June 2015 in connection with the Oregon litigation, and most of that award net of various expenses was recognised in the Groups operating profit at that time.
The Group asserted the same patent against additional Arthrex products in a follow-up suit that was scheduled for trial in February 2017 in the Oregon court.
Arthrex asserted its own suture anchor patents against Smith & Nephew in 2014 and 2015 in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.
In December 2016, the jury in that case decided that two of the Groups US subsidiaries infringed two asserted Arthrex patents and awarded Arthrex $17.4m.
In February 2017, the parties reached a settlement resulting in the dismissal of all patent litigation in Oregon and Texas.
Smith & Nephew agreed to pay Arthrex $8m, and each party agreed to additional payments contingent on the outcome of patent validity proceedings currently pending at the US Patent & Trademark Office relating to the asserted patents.
In November 2017, the US Patent & Trademark Office issued a Reexamination Certificate confirming validity of certain claims of US Patent No.
5,601,557 asserted by Smith & Nephew against Arthrex in the Oregon litigation.
The issuing of the Reexamination Certificate triggered a payment of $80m which was received by Smith & Nephew in December 2017, and $54m net of various expenses is recognised in the Groups 2017 operating profit.
The Group has fully provided for any possible additional payment relating to its historical sales.
150 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2017 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONAL FINANCIAL RISK GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS GROUP AND OTHER & MARKETPLACE REVIEW REVIEW INFORMATION NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS continued 17 PROVISIONS AND CONTINGENCIES continued In February 2016, ConforMIS, Inc. filed suit against the Groups US subsidiary in the Eastern Division of the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that a number of its patents generally directed to patient specific instrumentation associated with knee arthroplasty are infringed by Smith & Nephews VISIONAIRE cutting guides and associated knee implants.
The suit requests damages and an injunction.
Smith & Nephew seeks to invalidate the asserted patents at the US Patent & Trademark Office and has also filed counterclaims for infringement by ConforMIS of the Groups US patents.
17.4 Tax Matters At any given time the Group has unagreed years outstanding in various countries and is involved in tax audits and disputes, some of which may take several years to resolve.
The Group believes that it has made adequate provision in respect of related additional tax liabilities that may arise.
See Note 5 for further details.
18 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS Accounting policy The Group sponsors defined benefit plans in a number of countries.
A defined benefit pension plan defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement or a minimum guaranteed return on contributions, which is dependent on various factors such as age, years of service and final salary.
The Groups obligation is calculated separately for each plan by discounting the estimated future benefit that employees haveearned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The fair value of any plan assets is deducted to arrive at the net liability.
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is performed annually by external actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Re-measurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses and the return on the plan assets net of the costs ofmanaging the plan assets.
The Group recognises these immediately in other comprehensive income OCI and all other expenses, such as service cost, net interest cost, administration costs and taxes, are recognised in the income statement.
A number of key assumptions are made when calculating the fair value of the Groups defined benefit pension plans.
These assumptions impact the balance sheet asset and liabilities, operating profit, finance income costs and other comprehensive income.
The most critical assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and mortality assumptions to be applied to future pension plan liabilities.
The discount rate is based on the yield at the reporting date on bonds that have a credit rating of AA, denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid and have a maturity profile approximately the same as the Groups obligations.
In determining these assumptions management take into account the advice of professional external actuaries and benchmarks its assumptions against external data.
The Group determines the net interest expense income on the net defined benefit liability asset for the period by applying the discount rate used tomeasure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability asset.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution plans.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group and employees pay fixed contributions to a third party financial provider.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have beenpaid.
Contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
18.1 Retirement benefit net obligations assets The Groups retirement benefit obligations assets comprise: 2017 2016 $ million $ million Funded plans: UK Plan 53 4 US Plan 9 27 Other plans 46 52 16 83 Unfunded plans: Other plans 60 55 Retirement healthcare 25 26 69 164 Amount recognised on the balance sheet liability 131 164 Amount recognised on the balance sheet asset 62 The Group sponsors defined benefit pension plans for its employees or former employees in 16 countries and these are established under the laws of the relevant country.
Funded plans are funded by the payment of contributions and the assets are held by separate trust funds or insurance companies.
The provision of retirement and related benefits across the Group is kept under regular review.
Employees retirement benefits are the subject of regular management review.
The Groups defined benefit plans provide employees with an entitlement to retirement benefits varying between 1.3% and 66.7% of final salary on attainment of retirement age.
The level of entitlement is dependent on the years of service of the employee.
151 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2017 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONAL FINANCIAL RISK GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS GROUP AND OTHER & MARKETPLACE REVIEW REVIEW INFORMATION NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS continued 18 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued The Groups two major defined benefit pension plans are in the UK and US.
Both these plans were closed to new employees in 2003 and defined contribution plans are offered to new joiners.
The US and UK Plans were closed to future accrual in March 2014 and December 2016 respectively.
The UK Plan operates under trust law and responsibility for its governance lies with a Board of Trustees.
This Board is composed of representatives of the Group, plan participants and an independent trustee, who act on behalf of members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation.
The UK Plans assets are held by the trust.
Annual increases on benefits in payment are dependent on inflation.
There is no legislative minimum funding requirement in the UK, however the Group has agreed with the Board of Trustees to pay a schedule of supplementary payments seeNote 18.8.
The Trust Deed of the UK Plan and the Plan Document of the US Plan provide the Group with a right to a refund of surplus assets assuming the full settlement of plan liabilities in the event of a plan wind-up.
Furthermore, in the ordinary course of business the UK trustee and US committee have no rights to unilaterally wind up, or otherwise augment the benefits due to members of the plans.
Based on these rights, any net surplus in the UK and US Plans is recognised in full.
The US Plan is governed by a US Pension Committee which is comprised of both plan participants and representatives of the Group.
In the US, the Pension Protection Act 2006 established both a minimum required contribution and a maximum deductible contribution.
Failure to contribute at least the minimum required amount will subject the Company to significant penalties, and contributions in excess of the maximum deductible have negative tax consequences.
The minimum funding requirement is intended to fully fund the present value of accrued benefits over seven years.

Both the UK and US Plans hold a mixture of growth assets and matching assets.
The growth assets of the UK and US Plans are invested in a diversified range of industries across a broad range of geographies.
The UK Plan matching assets include liability matching assets and annuity policies purchased by the trustees, which aim to match the benefits to be paid to certain members from the plan and therefore remove the investment, inflation and demographic risks in relation to those liabilities.
The terms of the policy definethat the contract value exactly matches the amount and timing of the pensioner obligations covered by the contract.
In accordance with IAS19REmployee Benefits, the fair value of the insurance contract is deemed to be the present value of the related obligations which is discounted at the AA corporate bond rate.
In December 2014, the low risk asset portfolio held by the UK Plan was transferred into liability driven investments LDI which invests in a mixture of gilts and swaps.
18.4 Expenses recognised in the income statement The total expense relating to retirement benefits recognised for the year is $64m 2016: $23m, 2015: $58m.
Of this cost recognised for the year, $51m 2016: $48m, 2015: $49m relates to defined contribution plans and $13m 2016: $25m net credit, 2015: $9m net expense relates to defined benefit plans.
The cost charged in respect of the Groups defined contribution plans represents contributions payable to these plans by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
These were charged to operating profit in selling, general and administrative expenses.
There were $nil outstanding payments as at31 December 2017 due to be paid over to the plans 2016: $nil, 2015: $nil.
In 2016, the $25m net credit for the year includes a $44m curtailment gain arising from the closure of the UK Plan to future accrual and $5m past service credit relating to redundancies.
In 2015, the $9m net expense for the year includes a $16m past service cost credit arising from amendments to the US Retirement Healthcare plan and a$5m gain arising from benefit options offered to members of the UK Plan.
Defined benefit plan costs comprise service cost which is charged to operating profit in selling, general and administrative expenses and net interest cost and administration costs and taxes which are reported as other finance costs.

The UK uses the S2NA with projections in line with the CMI 2016 table and the US uses the RP2014 table with MP2016 scale.
The current longevities underlying the values of the obligations in the defined benefit plans are as follows: 2017 2016 2015 years years years Life expectancy at age 60 UK Plan: Males 28.8 29.7 29.6 Females 30.3 31.1 31.3 US Plan: Males 25.2 25.1 25.8 Females 27.4 27.4 28.2 Life expectancy at age 60 in 20 years time UK Plan: Males 31.0 32.5 32.6 Females 31.8 33.0 33.4 US Plan: Males 25.5 25.4 27.6 Females 28.0 27.9 29.9 18.6 Sensitivity analysis The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the assumptions used.
The following table summarises the increase decrease on the UK and US defined benefit obligation and pension costs as a result of reasonably possible changes in some of the assumptions while holding all other assumptions consistent.
The sensitivity to the inflation assumption change includes corresponding changes to the future salary increases and future pension increase assumptions.
The analysis does not take into account the full distribution of cash flows expected under the plan.
Changes to the inflation assumption will not have any effect on the US Pension Plan as it was closed to future accrual in 2014.

A decrease in the bond yield will increase the measure of plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by increases in the value ofmatching plan assets such as bonds and insurance contracts.
In the UK, the liability matching portfolio held in conventional and index-linked gilts was transferred into liability driven investments in order to reduce interest rate risk.
Inflation risk The UK Plan is linked to inflation.
A high rate of inflation will lead to a higher liability.
This risk is managed by holding inflation-linked bonds and an inflation-linked insurance contract in respect of some of the obligation.
In the UK, the liability matching portfolio held in conventional and index-linked gilts was transferred into liability driven investments in order to reduce inflation risk.
The UK and US Plans have been closed to future accrual which eliminates the exposure to this risk.
Investment risk If the return on plan assets is below the discount rate, all else being equal, there will be an increase in the plan deficit.
In the UK, this risk is partially managed by a portfolio of liability matching assets and a bulk annuity, together with a dynamic fide-risking policy to switch growth assets into liability matching assets over time.
The US Plan has a dynamic fide-risking policy to shift plan assets into longer-term stable asset classes.
The policy established 10 pre-determined funded status levels and when each trigger point is reached, the plan assets are re-balanced accordingly.
In 2017, two trigger points were reached and the plan assets were re-balanced such that there was reduced investment in equity securities and increased investment in government and corporate bonds.
Longevity risk The present value of the plans defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of the plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of plan participants above that assumed will increase the benefit obligation.
The UK Plan, in order to minimise longevity risk, has entered into an insurance contract which covers aportion of pensioner obligations.
Salary risk The calculation of the defined benefit obligation uses the future estimated salaries of plan participants.
Increases in the salary of plan participants above that assumed will increase the benefit obligation.
The exposure to salary risk in the UK and US has been eliminated with the closure of these Plans to future accrual.
18.8 Funding A full valuation is performed by actuaries for the Trustees of each plan to determine the level of funding required.
Employer contributions rates, based on these full valuations, are agreed between the Trustees of each plan and the Group.
The assumptions used in the actuarial valuations used for funding purposes may differ from those assumptions above.
UK Plan The most recent full actuarial valuation of the UK Plan was undertaken as at 30 September 2015.
The next full actuarial valuation will take place as at 30 September 2018.
This included supplementary payments of $24m 2016: $26m, 2015: $29m.
The Group has currently agreed to pay annual supplementary payments of $25m until 2021.
These supplementary payments will be reviewed when the 30 September 2018 valuation has been completed.
US Plan A full actuarial valuation for the US Plan was last undertaken as at 20 September 2013 before the closure of the Plan to future accrual.
Contributions to the US Plan were $20m 2016: $20m, 2015: $20m which represented supplementary payments of $20m.
Theplanned supplementary contribution for 2018 is being kept under review given the funding status.

The Groups objectives when managing capital are to ensure the Group has adequate funds to continue as a going concern and sufficient flexibility within the capital structure to fund the ongoing growth of the business and to take advantage of business development opportunities including acquisitions.
The Group determines the amount of capital taking into account changes in business risks and future cash requirements.
The Group reviews its capital structure on an ongoing basis and uses share buy-backs, dividends and the issue of new shares to adjust the retained capital.
The Group considers the capital that it manages to be as follows: 2017 2016 2015 $ million $ million $ million Share capital 178 180 183 Share premium 605 600 590 Capital redemption reserve 17 15 12 Treasury shares 257 432 294 Retained earnings and other reserves 4,101 3,595 3,475 4,644 3,958 3,966 157 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2017 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONAL FINANCIAL RISK GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS GROUP AND OTHER & MARKETPLACE REVIEW REVIEW INFORMATION NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS continued 19 EQUITY continued 19.2 Treasury shares Treasury shares represent the holding of the Companys own shares in respect of the Smith & Nephew Employees Share Trust and shares bought back as part of the share buy-back programme.

Future dividends will be dependent upon future earnings, the future financial condition of the Group and the Boards dividend policy.
The Board reviews the appropriate level of total annual dividend each year at the time of the full year results.
The Board intends that the interim dividend will be set by a formula and will be equivalent to 40% of the total dividend for the previous year.
Smith & Nephew plc, the Parent Company of the Group, is a non-trading investment holding company which derives its distributable reserves from dividends paid by subsidiary companies.

The consideration transferred in the acquisition is measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired.
Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment.
Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities.
Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, then it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.

The programme is expected to require a one-off cash cost of $240m of which a charge of around $100m is expected in 2018.
No provisions have been recorded in respect of this programme as at 31 December 2017.
A constructive obligation in relation to this programme had not arisen at 31 December 2017 as the Group had not announced the main features of the programme nor raised a valid expectation in those employees affected by the programme.
