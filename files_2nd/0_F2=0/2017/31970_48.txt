Accounting policies continued Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the Companys profit for the year.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as probable that they will be recovered.
Employee benefits The Company operated a contributory pension scheme, of the defined benefit type up to 5th April 2007, after which this scheme was closed for future accruals to existing members and was closed to new members.
Since 5th April 2007, the Company has operated a defined contribution scheme.
The scheme is administered by trustees who are independent of the Company finances.
Pension scheme assets in the defined benefit scheme are measured using market value.
Pension scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
The expected return on the schemes assets and the interest on the schemes liabilities arising from the passage of time are included in other finance income.
The pension schemes surplus, to the extent that it is considered recoverable, or deficit is recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet.
Accruals are made for holiday pay, based on a calculation of the number of days holiday earned during the year, but not yet taken and also for the annual performance bonus.
Warranty on the sale of products The Company provides a warranty from the date of purchase, except for those products that are installed by the Company where the warranty starts from the date of completion of the installation.
This is typically for a 12-month period, although up to three years is given for a small number of products.
A warranty provision is included in the accounts, which is calculated on the basis of historical returns and internal quality reports.
Derivative financial instruments In accordance with its treasury policy, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
The Company uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from operational and financing activities.
Forward exchange contracts are recognised initially at cost and then subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Where a forward contract is designated as a hedge of the variability in future cash inflows, the effective part of any gain or loss on the forward contract is recognised directly in equity.
Anyeffective cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.
Theineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreignexchange differences arising on such translation are recognised in the income statement.

In addition, note 20 in the financial statements includes the Companysobjectives and policies for managing its capital, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit risk andliquidity risk.
The Company has considerable financial resources at its disposal and the directors have considered the current financial projections.
