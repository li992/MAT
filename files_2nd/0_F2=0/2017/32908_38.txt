Deferred tax The Groups deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the end of each period in accordance with IAS 12 Income taxes.
The recognition of deferred tax assets is determined by reference to the Groups estimate of recoverability, using models where appropriate to forecast future taxable profits.
Deferred tax assets have only been recognised for territories where the Group considers that it is probable there would be sufficient taxable profits for the future deductions to be utilised.
Based on available evidence, both positive and negative, we determine whether it is probable that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realised.
The main factors that we consider include: the future earnings potential determined through the use the history of losses carried forward and other tax assets expiring: of internal forecasts: the timing of future reversal of taxable temporary differences: the cumulative losses in recent years: the expiry period associated with the deferred tax assets: and the various jurisdictions in which the potential deferred tax assets arise: the nature of the income that can be used to realise the deferred tax asset.
If it is probable that some portion of these assets will not be realised, then no asset is recognised in relation to that portion.
If market conditions improve and future results of operations exceed our current expectations, our existing recognised deferred tax assets may be adjusted, resulting in future tax benefits.
Alternatively, if market conditions deteriorate further or future results of operations are less than expected, future assessments may result in a determination that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not realisable.
As a result, all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may need to be reversed.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset as they relate to the same tax group.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances for financial reporting purposes: As As Gross Offset reported Gross Offset reported 2017 2017 2017 2016 2016 2016 m m m m m m Deferred tax assets 411.8 251.5 160.3 598.0 457.6 140.4 Deferred tax liabilities 765.2 251.5 513.7 1,150.0 457.6 692.4 353.4 353.4 552.0 552.0 The following are the major gross deferred tax assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon in 2017 and 2016: Accounting Retirement Property, Other Deferred provisions benefit plant & Tax losses Share-based Restructuring temporary compensation & accruals obligations equipment & credits payments provisions differences Total m m m m m m m m m 1 January 2016 41.9 49.5 91.0 44.7 71.3 78.8 16.9 16.6 410.7 Acquisition of subsidiaries 7.1 0.2 15.0 22.3 Credit charge to income 39.5 8.5 28.3 19.2 6.2 1.8 11.7 7.7 95.9 Credit to other comprehensive income 1.8 1.8 Charge to equity 15.0 15.0 Exchange differences 14.2 15.5 20.3 6.9 12.2 13.6 0.7 1.1 82.3 31 December 2016 95.6 80.6 141.4 70.8 89.7 75.8 5.9 38.2 598.0 Acquisition of subsidiaries 2.6 2.6 Charge credit to income 5.5 6.6 10.2 6.9 34.4 0.4 1.5 21.7 60.2 Impact of US tax reform 30.8 8.1 29.1 6.8 23.1 10.9 1.6 1.1 62.1 Charge to other comprehensive income 20.9 20.9 Charge to equity 27.3 27.3 Exchange differences 5.8 5.8 5.6 2.5 5.7 4.2 0.2 0.1 18.3 31 December 2017 53.5 84.9 75.6 68.4 72.7 33.0 5.8 17.9 411.8 Other temporary differences comprise a number of items including tax deductible goodwill, none of which is individually significant to the Groups consolidated balance sheet.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of the tax benefit of 1,539.3 million 2016: 1,104.4 million of such tax losses and other temporary differences.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 3,169.9 million 2016: 4,048.8 million of losses and other temporary differences as the Group considers that there will not be enough taxable profits in the entities concerned such that any additional asset could be considered recoverable.
Included in the total unrecognised temporary differences are losses of 33.4 million that will expire within 110 years, and 2,945.2 million of losses that may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of the temporary differences in relation to the investment in subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 3,898.0 million 2016: 3,270.8 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and the Group considers that it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Currency derivatives The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows and the exchange risk arising on translation of the Groups investments in foreign operations.
The Group is a party to a variety of foreign currency derivatives in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
The Group designates its foreign currency-denominated debt as hedging instruments against the currency risk associated with the translation of its foreign operations.
During 2017, the Group held no currency derivatives designated ashedges.
At the balance sheet date, the total nominal amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedges was 177.7 million 2016: 122.0 million.

Acquisitions The Group accounts for acquisitions in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
IFRS 3 requires the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities other than non-current assets or disposal groups held for sale to be recognised at fair value at acquisition date.
In assessing fair value at acquisition date, management make their best estimate of the likely outcome where the fair value of an asset or liability may be contingent on a future event.
In certain instances, the underlying transaction giving rise to an estimate may not be resolved until some years after the acquisition date.
IFRS 3 requires the release to profit of any acquisition reserves which subsequently become excess in the same way as any excess costs over those provided at acquisition date are charged to profit.
At each period end management assess provisions and other balances established in respect of acquisitions for their continued probability of occurrence and amend the relevant value accordingly through the consolidated income statement or as an adjustment to goodwill as appropriate under IFRS 3.
The Group acquired a number of subsidiaries in the year.
The following table sets out the book values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and their fair value to the Group.

use for valuing companies, and is one of the metrics that management uses to assess the performance of the business.
The Groups Media Investment Management sub-sector is increasingly buying digital media for its own account on a transparent opt-in basis and, as a result, the subsequent media pass-through costs have to be accounted for as revenue, as well as billings.
In addition, the Data Investment Management sector, which forms a significant part of the Groups revenue and in which none of the Groups direct competitors are present, includes pass-through costs, principally for data collection.
Therefore, management considers that revenue less pass-through costs gives a helpful reflection of top-line growth.
