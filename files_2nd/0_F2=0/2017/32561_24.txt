Consolidated accounts 2016 17 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 2 March 2017 1Authorisation of consolidated financial statements The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC for the year ended 2 March 2017 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 24 April 2017.
Whitbread PLC is a public limited company incorporated and fully domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The address of the registered office isgiven on page 172.
The significant activities of the Group are described in Note 4, Segment information, and in the strategic report on pages 4to 61.
2Accounting policies Basis of accounting and preparation The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period and the defined benefit pension scheme, as explained inthe accounting policies below.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
Further detail is contained in the viability statement included in the strategic report on page 58.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand except when otherwise indicated.
The financial year represents the 52 weeks to 2 March 2017 prior financial year: 53 weeks to 3 March 2016.
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 3 March 2016, except for the adoption of the new standards and interpretations that are applicable for the year ended 2 March 2017.
The significant accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The Group has adopted the following standards and interpretations which have been assessed as having no financial impact or disclosure requirements at this time: The IASBs annual improvement process, 20122014: IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 1: IAS 16 and IAS 38 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: IAS 16 and IAS 41 Bearer Plants Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41: IAS 27 Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements Amendments to IAS 27: IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28: and IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations Amendments to IFRS 11.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries, together with theGroups share of the net assets and results of joint ventures and associate incorporated using the equity method of accounting.
These are adjusted, where appropriate, to conform to Group accounting policies.
The financial statements of significant trading subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company except for Yueda Costa Shanghai Food & Beverage Management Company Limited which has a year-end of 31 December as per Chinese legislation.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.
Control is the power to direct the relevant activities of the subsidiary whichsignificantly affect the subsidiarys return, so as to have rights to the variable return from its activities.
Apart from the acquisition of Whitbread Group PLC by Whitbread PLC in 2000 01, which was accounted for using merger accounting, acquisitions by the Group are accounted for under the acquisition method and any goodwill arising is capitalised as an intangible asset.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from, or up to, the date that control passes respectively.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated, unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Significant accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of consideration over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is reviewed forimpairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or losson disposal.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016 17 115 Consolidated accounts 2016 17 Consolidated accounts Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued At 2 March 2017 2Accounting policies continued Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost.
An intangible asset acquired as part of abusiness combination is recognised outside of goodwill if the asset is separable, or arises from contractual or other legal rights, and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset as follows: trading licences have an indefinite life: reacquired franchise rights are amortised over the life of the acquired franchise agreement: IT software and technology is amortised over periods of three to six years: acquired customer relationships are amortised over 15 years: and operating rights agreements are amortised over the life of the contract.
The carrying values are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost at transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Gross interest costs incurred on the financing of qualifying assets arecapitalised until the time that the assets are available for use.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over theestimated useful life of the asset asfollows: freehold land is not depreciated: freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to 50 years: and plant and equipment is depreciated over three to 30 years.
The residual values are reviewed annually.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable.
Any impairment in the values of property, plant and equipment is charged to the income statement.
Profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment reflect the difference between net selling price and carrying amount at the date of disposal and are recognised in the income statement.
Payments made on entering into, or acquiring, leaseholds that are accounted for as operating leases are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Impairment The Group assesses assets or groups of assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
Individual assets are grouped, for impairment assessment purposes, at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups ofassets cash generating units or CGUs.
If such indication of impairment exists, or when annual impairment testing for anasset group is required, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined with reference to the CGU to which theasset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement within operating costs.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated tothe units and then to reduce the carrying amounts of other assets in the CGU, on a pro-rata basis.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such an indication exists, the CGUs recoverable amount is estimated.
Apreviously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimated future cash flows used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount thatwould have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such a reversal is recognised in the income statement.
After such a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets carrying amount, less any residual value, on a straight-line basis over its remaining useful life.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016 17 116 Consolidated accounts 2016 17 2Accounting policies continued For the purposes of impairment testing, all centrally held assets are allocated in line with IAS 36 to CGUs based on managements view of the consumption of the asset.
Any resulting impairment is recorded against the centrally held asset.
Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at the level management monitor goodwill, which is at strategic business unit level.
The Group performs an annual review of its goodwill to ensure that its carrying amount is not greater than its recoverable amount.
In the absence of a comparable recent market transaction that demonstrates that the fair value, less the costs of disposal, of goodwill and intangible assets exceeds their carrying amount, the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
An impairment is then made to reduce the carrying amount to the recoverable amount.
Property, plant and equipment For the purposes of the impairment review of property, plant and equipment, the Group considers each trading outlet to be aseparate CGU.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Consideration is also given, where appropriate, to the market value of the asset either from independent sources or, inconjunction with, an accepted industry valuation methodology.
Investments in joint ventures The Group assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying valuemay not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is compared with its recoverable amount.
Where thecarrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the investment iswritten down to its recoverable amount.
Assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale only if available for immediate sale in their present condition and a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.
Suchassets are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value, less the cost to sell, and are not depreciated oramortised.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is calculated on the basis of first in, first out andnetrealisable value is the estimated selling price less any costs to sell.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the timevalue of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Onerous contracts Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions.
An onerous contract is considered to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under thecontract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
Warranties Provisions for the expected costs of warranty obligations arising on the acquisition or disposal of a business are recognisedat the date of the relevant transaction, at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle theGroups obligation.
Restructuring costs A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan and has raised a valid expectation, in those affected, that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it.
The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016 17 117 Consolidated accounts 2016 17 Consolidated accounts Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued At 2 March 2017 2Accounting policies continued Non-underlying items and use of underlying performance measures We use a range of measures to monitor the financial performance of the Group.
These measures include both statutory measures in accordance with IFRS and alternative performance measures APMs which are consistent with the way that thebusiness performance is measured internally.
The term underlying profit is not defined under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, statutory measurements of profit.
Underlying measures of profitability are non-IFRS because they exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts thatare excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS.
We report underlying measures because we believe they provide both management and investors with useful additional information about the financial performance of the Groups businesses.
Underlying measures of profitability represent the equivalent IFRS measures adjusted for specific items that we consider hinder comparison of the financial performance of the Groups businesses either from one period to another or with other similar businesses.
The face of the income statement presents underlying profit before tax and reconciles this to profit before tax.
Underlyingearnings per share is calculated using underlying profit after tax attributable to parent shareholders.
The adjustments made to reported profit in the consolidated income statement, in order to derive our underlying results, may include: Profit or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, property reversions and onerous leases.
On occasion wemaydispose of properties, either as part of a sale and leaseback transaction or because the property is no longer requiredin our ongoing business.
In addition, the Group may recognise liabilities in respect of lease obligations on properties which have been previously disposed of but where the lease obligations have reverted to the Group under privity.
Profits or losseson these items may be significant and are not reflective of the Groups ongoing trading results: Profit or loss on the sale of a business or investment.
These disposals are not part of the Groups ongoing trading businessand are therefore excluded: Significant one-off restructuring costs, resulting from a strategic review of the Groups businesses or operations, theinclusion of which would distort the year on year comparability of the Groups trading results: Impairment of assets as the result of restructuring or closure of a business and impairment of sites which are underperforming or are to be closed, the inclusion of which would distort the year-on-year comparability of the Groups trading results: Amortisation of intangible assets recognised as part of a business combination or other transaction outside of the ordinarycourse of business: Finance charge credit for defined benefit pension scheme.
These costs are non-cash and do not relate to the Groups ongoing activities as the scheme is closed to future accrual: Finance costs resulting from the unwinding of discounts on provisions created in respect of non-underlying items: and Significant and one-off tax settlements in respect of prior years including the related interest and the impact of changes inthe statutory tax rate, the inclusion of which would distort year on year comparability, as well as the tax impact of the non-underlying items identified above.
Foreign currency translation Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange quoted atthe balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Trading results are translated into the functional currency generally sterling at average rates of exchange for the year.
Day-to-day transactions in a foreign currency are recorded in the functional currency at an average rate for the month in which those transactions take place, which is used as a reasonable approximation to the actual transaction rate.
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement.
The differences that arise from translating the results of foreign entities at average rates of exchange, and their assets and liabilities at closing rates, are also dealt with in a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
All other currency gains and losses are dealt with in theincome statement.
A number of subsidiaries within the Group have a non-sterling functional currency.
The financial performance and end position of these entities are translated into sterling in the consolidated financial statements.
Balance sheet items are translated at the rate applicable at the balance sheet date.
Transactions reported in the income statement are translated using an average rate for the month in which they occur.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016 17 118 Consolidated accounts 2016 17 2Accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of the goods or services provided have transferred to the buyer, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with thetransaction will flow to the Group.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable from the sale of goods and services to third parties after deducting discounts, allowances for customer loyalty and other promotional activities.
Revenue includes duties whichthe Group pays as principal, but excludes amounts collected on behalf of other parties, such as value added tax.
Allsales between Group businesses are eliminated on consolidation.
Revenue of the Group comprises the following streams: Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of food, beverages and merchandise is recognised at the point of sale, with the exception of wholesale transactions which are recognised on delivery.
The Group operate some customer loyalty programmes.
Where award credits are granted as part of a sale transaction, aportion of revenue equal to the fair value of the award points earned is deferred until redemption.
The fair value of points awarded is determined with reference to the discount received upon redemption and the level of redemption: Rendering of services Revenue from room sales and other guest services is recognised when rooms are occupied and as services are provided: and Franchise fees Revenue from fees received in connection with the franchise of the Groups brand names is recognised when earned.
Leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Rental payments in respect of operating leases are charged against operating profit on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental costs over the lease term.
Finance revenue Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues, using the effective interest method.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, except for gross interest costs incurred on the financing of major projects, which are capitalised until the time that the projects are available for use.
Retirement benefits In respect of the defined benefit pension scheme, the obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation, reduced by the fair value of the scheme assets.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
Re-measurements are recognised in full in the period inwhich they occur in the statement of comprehensive income and are not reclassified to the income statement in subsequent periods.
For defined benefit plans, the employers portion of the past and current service cost is charged to operating profit, withnetinterest costs reported within finance costs.
In addition, all administration costs, other than those relating to the management of plan assets or taxes payable by the plan itself, are charged as incurred to operating costs in the income statement.
Net interest is calculated by applying the opening discount rate to the opening net defined benefit obligation taking into account the expected contributions and benefits paid.
Curtailments and settlements relating to the Groups defined benefit plan are recognised in the period in which the curtailment or settlement occurs.
Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payment transactions Equity-settled transactions Certain employees and directors of the Group receive equity-settled remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The cost of these equitysettled transactions is measured by reference to the fair value, determined using a stochastic model, at the date at whichthey aregranted.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over theperiod in which the performance conditions or non-vesting conditions are fulfilled, ending on the relevant vesting date.
Except for awards subject to market-related conditions for vesting, the cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions, at each reporting date until the vesting date, reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, andisadjusted to reflect the directors best available estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
Theincome statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as atthe beginning and end of that period.
If options are subject to market-related conditions, awards are not cumulatively adjusted for the likelihood of these targets being met.
Instead, these conditions are included in the fair value of the awards.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
Where an equity-settled award is forfeited, the related expense recognised to date is reversed.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016 17 119 Consolidated accounts 2016 17 Consolidated accounts Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued At 2 March 2017 2Accounting policies continued Cash-settled transactions The cost is fair-valued at grant date and expensed over the period until the vesting date, with recognition of a corresponding liability.
The liability is re-measured to fair value at each reporting date, up to and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement for the period.
Tax The income tax charge represents both the income tax payable, based on profit for the year, and deferred income tax.
Deferred income tax is recognised in full, using the liability method, in respect of temporary differences between the tax base of the Groups assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts that have originated but have not been reversed by the balance sheet date.
No deferred tax is recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill, or the initial recognition of an asset or liability, in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeablefuture.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all, or part of, the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other comprehensive income.
Similarly, income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are charged orcredited directly to equity.
Otherwise, income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Treasury shares Own equity instruments which are held by the Group treasury shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Investments in joint ventures and associates Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor.
The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined them tobe joint ventures.
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given, including acquisition charges associated with the investment.
After initial recognition, investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method.
Recognition and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities The recognition of financial assets and liabilities occurs when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The derecognition of financial assets takes place when the Group no longer has the right to cash flows, the risks and rewards of ownership, or control of the asset.
The derecognition of financial liabilities occurs when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Financial assets Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Some assets held by the Group are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
On initial recognition theseassets are recognised at fair value.
Subsequent measurement is also at fair value, with changes recognised through finance revenue or costs in the income statement.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money issignificant.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised orimpaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank, cash in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist ofcash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016 17 120 Consolidated accounts 2016 17 2Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into derivative transactions with a view to managing interest and currency risks associated with underlying business activities and the financing of those activities.
Derivative financial instruments used by the Group are stated at fair value on initial recognition and at subsequent balance sheet dates.
The fair value of derivative instruments is calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the applicable market yield curves at the balance sheet date.
Cash flow hedges mitigate exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
Fair value hedges mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment and include foreign currency swaps.
Hedge accounting is only used where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship, it meets the Groups risk management objective strategy for undertaking the hedge and it is expected to be highly effective.
The portion of any gains or losses on cash flow hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting and are determined tobe effective, is recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income.
The gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The change in fair value of derivatives designated as part of a fair value hedge, is recognised in the income statement in finance costs.
The change in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability, that is attributable to the hedged risk, is also recognised in the income statement within finance costs.
When a firm commitment that is hedged becomes an asset or a liability recognised on the balance sheet, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in whichthe transaction that results from a firm commitment that is hedged affects the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, for cash flow hedges, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
When a fairvalue hedge item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of any directly associated issue costs.
Borrowings are subsequently recorded at amortised cost, with any difference between the amount initially recorded and theredemption value recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affectthe amounts reported as assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported as revenues and expenses during the year.
However, the nature of estimation means that the actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management has made the following judgements andestimates which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements: Key accounting judgements Residual values and asset lives The residual value is the net realisable value of an asset at the end of its useful economic life.
The Group has taken an assessment of the residual values that are appropriate for the business and reviews this assessment annually.
Note 13 provides details of the value of fixed assets capitalised.
Intangible asset capitalisation IT software and technology assets The amount capitalised includes the total cost of any external products or services as well as any internal costs directly attributable to the development of the assets.
Management judgement is involved in determining whether projects meetthecriteria for capitalisation.
Note 12 provides details of the value of IT software capitalised.
Non-underlying items During the year certain items are identified and separately disclosed as non-underlying.
Judgement is applied as to whetherthe item meets the necessary criteria as per the accounting policy disclosed earlier in this note.
Note 6 provides information on all of the items disclosed as non-underlying in the current year financial statements.
Areas of estimation uncertainty Impairment An impairment test of tangible and intangible assets is undertaken each year using both an EBITDA multiple and a discounted cash flow approach.
Note 14 describes the assumptions used together with an analysis of the sensitivity tochanges in key assumptions.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016 17 121 Consolidated accounts 2016 17 Consolidated accounts Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued At 2 March 2017 2Accounting policies continued Asset lives Asset lives are based upon managements estimation at the point of capitalisation.
Periodically these are reviewed to ensure that the estimated lives of the assets remain appropriate and if not the assets are re-lifed prospectively.
Notes 12 and 13 provide details on the depreciation and amortisation booked.
Defined benefit pension Defined benefit pension plans are accounted for in accordance with actuarial advice using the projected unit credit method.
Note 29 describes the assumptions used together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
Restructuring provisions Restructuring costs are provided for using the best information available to management at the balance sheet date.
Thisincludes estimates of future costs and judgements on the likely outcome timing of restructuring activities.
Note 21 providesdetails of the value of the provisions carried.
Taxation The calculation of the Groups total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items, where the tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority.
The final resolution of some of these items may give rise to material income statement and or cash flow variances.
Corporation tax is calculated on the basis of income before taxation, taking into account the relevant local tax rates and regulations.
For each operating entity, the current income tax expense is calculated and differences between the accounting and tax base are determined, resulting in deferred tax assets or liabilities.
Assumptions are made around the tax net book value of assets to which capital allowances apply, the level of capital allowances, the extent of rollover gains, indexation thereon and the tax base into which they have been rolled.
Assumptions are also made around the assets which qualify for capital allowances and the level of disallowable expenses andthese affect the income tax calculation.
Provisions may be made for uncertain exposures or recoveries, which can have an impact on both deferred and current tax.
A deferred tax asset shall be recognised for the carry forward of unused tax losses, pension deficits and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused taxcredits can be utilised.
Details of the carrying value of corporation and deferred tax can be found in Note 9.
Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB not effective for the current year and not early adopted by the Group The following standards and interpretations, which have been issued by the IASB and are relevant for the Group, subject toEU ratification, become effective after the current year-end and have not been early adopted by the Group: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was issued in July 2014 and is a replacement of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IFRS 9 covers the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with a new hedge accounting model and a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment.
The new standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, subject to EU adoption.
The Group hasundertaken an initial impact assessment which indicates that the adoption of IFRS 9 will not have a material impact onitsconsolidated results and financial position.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers in May 2014.
The new standard provides a single, five-step revenue recognition model, applicable to all sales contracts, which is based upon the principle that revenue is recognised when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer.
It replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance under current IFRS and becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, subject to EU adoption.
The Group has undertaken an initial impact assessment which indicates that the adoption of IFRS 15 will not have a material impact on its consolidated result and financial position, but is likely to result in additional disclosure requirements.
IFRS 16 Leases The IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases in January 2016.
The new standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has alow value.
It replaces the existing leasing Standard, IAS 17 Leases, and related Interpretations and becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, subject to EU adoption.
The Group has determined that the application of IFRS 16 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial result and financial position.
This includes recognition of interest and amortisation expense in place of fixed rental expense in the income statement and the recognition of right ofuseassets and lease liabilities for its operating lease portfolio on the balance sheet.
There is no net cash flow impact on application of IFRS 16.
The Group is currently undertaking a detailed assessment to determine the full impact of IFRS 16 onits consolidated results and financial position.

The Group has determined that the impact of IAS 7 will be limited todisclosureand will have noimpact on its consolidated result and financial position.
Whilst the following standards and interpretations are relevant to the Group, they have been assessed as having minimal 1 orno financial impact or additional disclosure requirements at this time : IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 with IFRS 4 Insurance contracts Amendments to IFRS 4: IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts: IAS 40 Amendments to IAS 40: Transfers of Investment Property: IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Loss: IFRS 2 Amendments to IFRS 2: IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Translations and Advance Consideration: and The IASBs annual improvement process, 20142016.

3Revenue An analysis of the Groups revenue is as follows: 2016 17 2015 16 m m Sale of goods 1,717.2 1,626.8 Rendering of services 1,349.1 1,260.0 Franchise fees 39.7 35.0 Revenue 3,106.0 2,921.8 4Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into two strategic business units Premier Inn & Restaurants andCosta based upon their different products and services: Premier Inn & Restaurants provide services in relation to accommodation and food: and Costa generates income from the operation of its branded, owned and franchised coffee outlets.
The UK and International Premier Inn & Restaurants segments have been aggregated on the grounds that the Internationalsegment is immaterial.
Management monitors the operating results of its strategic business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance.
Segment performance is measured based on underlying operating profit.
Included within the unallocated and elimination columns in the tables below are the costs of running the public company.
The unallocated assets and liabilities are cash and debt balances held and controlled by the central treasury function, taxation, pensions, certain property, plant and equipment, centrally held provisions and central working capital balances.
Inter-segment revenue is from Costa to the Premier Inn & Restaurants segment and is eliminated on consolidation.
Transactions were entered into on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
The following tables present revenue and profit information and certain asset and liability information regarding business operating segments for the years ended 2 March 2017 and 3 March 2016.

These measures include both statutory measures in accordance with IFRS and APMs which are consistent with the way that the business performance is measured internally.
Underlying measures of profitability represent the equivalent IFRS measures adjusted for specific items that we consider hinder the comparison of the financial performance of the Groups businesses either from one period to another or with other similar businesses.
Previously this note was reported as exceptional items and non-underlying adjustments.
The definition and policy has been simplified in 2016 17 to refer to non-underlying items only.
There has been no change in definition or metric and therefore presentation is reflected in the comparative disclosure without any restatement of values.

2 On 13 July 2016, the Group announced its intention to exit hotel operations in South East Asia.
This has resulted in the recognition of impairment losses onassets of 11.0m, investment in joint ventures of 0.9m and goodwill of 3.0m as well as the recognition of a restructuring provision of 15.1m for costs ofexiting management agreements and closure of regional offices.
3 During the year, Costa has undertaken a strategic review of its international operations.
This has led to the decision to exit its French equity business and to restructure its Chinese operations.
In France this has resulted in the recognition of impairment losses of 1.5m, store closure costs of 0.8m and restructuring costs of 6.8m including a restructuring provision of 6.6m for redundancy and lease exit costs.
In China the review has led to impairment losses of 3.2m, store closure costs of 1.6m and onerous lease provisions of 0.6m.
The restructure is ongoing and there are expected to be further closure costs in the next financial year.
The share attributable to the parent shareholders is 2.7m.
4 During the year, the Group undertook significant operational reorganisation of support centre operations.
This restructuring has resulted in costs of 12.4m, including staff redundancy and consultation costs, asset impairments of 2.9m as well as the recognition of a restructuring provision of 6.3m covering staff redundancy and consultation costs.
5 During the year, the Group received a refund on settlement of a historic VAT claim.

Deferred tax Deferred tax relates to the following: Consolidated Consolidated balance sheet income statement 2017 2016 2016 17 2015 16 m m m m Deferred tax liabilities Accelerated capital allowances 44.0 48.7 4.7 3.3 Rolled over gains and property revaluations 68.1 73.3 4.5 8.0 Gross deferred tax liabilities 112.1 122.0 Deferred tax assets Pensions 53.1 28.7 0.7 2.2 Other 3.0 1.4 0.5 5.8 Gross deferred tax assets 50.1 27.3 Deferred tax expense 10.4 7.7 Net deferred tax liability 62.0 94.7 Total deferred tax liabilities relating to disposals during the year were nil 2016: nil.
The Group has incurred overseas tax losses which, subject to any local restrictions, can be carried forward and offset against future taxable profits in the companies in which they arose.
The Group carries out an annual assessment of the recoverability ofthese losses and does not think it is appropriate at this stage to recognise any deferred tax asset.
If the Group were to recognise these deferred tax assets in their entirety, profits would increase by 16.5m 2016: 10.7m, of which, the share attributable to the parent shareholders is 13.9m 2016: 8.9m.
At 2 March 2017, there was no recognised deferred tax liability 2016: nil for taxes that would be payable on any unremitted earnings, as all such amounts are permanently reinvested or, where they are not, there are no corporation tax consequences of such companies paying dividends to parent companies.
Tax relief on total interest capitalised amounts to 1.8m 2016: 2.0m.
Factors affecting the tax charge for future years The Finance No 2 Act 2015 reduced the main rate of UK corporation tax to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020.
The effect of these rates was included in the financial statements in 2015 16.
The Finance Act 2016 further reduced the main rate of UK corporation tax to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.
The effect of the new rate is a reduction of the deferred tax liability by a net of 2.7m comprising a credit of 5.2m to the income statement, a charge of 3.2m to the statement of consolidated income and a reserves movement of 0.7m.
The rate changes will also impact the amount of the future cash tax payments to be made by the Group.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016 17 130 Consolidated accounts 2016 17 10Earnings per share The basic earnings per share EPS figures are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders, therefore before non-controlling interests, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year after deducting treasury shares and shares held by an independently managed employee share ownership trust ESOT.
The diluted earnings per share figures allow for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares of the weighted average number of options outstanding during the year.
Where the average share price for the year is lower than the option price, the options become anti-dilutive and are excluded from the calculation.
The number of such options was nil 2016: nil.
The numbers of shares used for the earnings per share calculations are as follows: 2016 17 2015 16 million million Basic weighted average number of ordinary shares 182.2 181.4 Effect of dilution share options 0.4 1.4 Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares 182.6 182.8 The total number of shares in issue at the year-end, as used in the calculation of the basic weighted average number of ordinary shares, was 195.4m, less 12.1m treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 1.0m held by the ESOT 2016: 195.2m, less 12.6m treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 0.9m held by the ESOT.

IT software and technology assets have been assessed as having finite lives and are amortised under the straight-line method over periods ranging from three to six years from the date the asset became fully operational.
Other intangibles comprise Costa overseas trading licences and territory fees, reacquired franchise rights, Costa Express operating rights agreements and development costs.
The trading licences, which have a carrying value of 1.6m 2016: 1.6m, are deemed to have indefinite lives as there is noforeseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to contribute to the Groups net cash inflow.
The operating rights agreements are being amortised over ten years and have a carrying value of 0.2m 2016: 0.2m.
Development costs have a carrying value of 1.9m 2016: 2.6m and are being amortised over six years.
The reacquired franchise right arose from the acquisition of Life Coffee Cafes Limited in 2014 15 and is being amortised over five years and has a carrying value of 5.2m 2016: 7.2m.
The balance of 0.4m 2016: 0.4m relates to territory fees which are being amortised over 20 years.

Whereindicators of impairment are identified an impairment assessment is undertaken.
In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value, less costs of disposal and its value in use.
In the absence of any information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is deemed to be its value in use.
The Group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model, which applies a pre-tax discount rate of 7.0% in the UK 2015 16: 8.1%, 7.1% in France 2015 16: 8.1%, 7.2% in China 2015 16: 8.4%, 6.5% in Singapore 2015 16: 7.5% and 7.5% inPoland 2015 16: 8.8%.
The future cash flows are based on assumptions from the business plans and cover a five-year period.
These business plans and forecasts include managements most recent view of medium-term trading prospects.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using long-term growth rates for the relevant country, ranging from 2.0% to3.5% with the UK, the most significant country, being 2.0% 2015 16: 2.0%.
The events and circumstances that led to the impairment charge of 28.1m are set out below: Premier Inn & Restaurants As a result of the decision to exit hotel operations in India and South East Asia, impairment losses of 10.2m have been recorded to bring asset values in line with realisable values.
As part of the UK operational restructure seven restaurant sites were converted to Brewers Fayre leading to an impairment of2.9m.
In addition, seven restaurant sites were transferred to assets held for sale resulting in an impairment of 3.9m.
Theremaining 1.6m impairment arose on sites which are to be closed or are underperforming.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016 17 135 Consolidated accounts 2016 17 Consolidated accounts Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued At 2 March 2017 14Impairment continued Costa The Costa international restructuring has resulted in impairment losses of 1.5m in France and 3.2m in China.
The remaining impairment charge includes 2.8m in the UK, 0.9m in Singapore and 1.1m in Poland, where stores are to be closed or are underperforming.
Impairment reversals Following an improvement in trading performance and an increase in amounts of estimated future cash flows of previously impaired sites, reversals of 2.8m have been recognised, 2.6m in Premier Inn & Restaurants and 0.2m in Costa.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgements used in arriving at future growth rates and the discount rates applied to cash flow projections.
The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to the growth rates used in the five-year business plans and in the pre-tax discount rates would be an incremental impairment charge of: Premier Inn & Restaurants Costa Total Incremental impairment charge m m m Impairment if business plan growth rates were reduced by 1% pt 4.1 4.1 Impairment if discount rates were increased by 1% pt 4.0 4.0 Goodwill Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at strategic business unit level, being the level at which management monitor goodwill.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
In the absence of a recent market transaction, the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a 2.0% growth rate 2015 16: 2.0%.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 7.0% 2015 16: 8.1%.
The resultant impairment review required 3.0m impairment of goodwill allocated to the Premier Inn & Restaurants CGU 2015 16: nil as a result of the decision to exit hotel operations in India and South East Asia.
No impairment was required forgoodwill allocated to the Costa CGU 2015 16: nil.

On 13 July 2016, the Group announced its intention to exit hotel operations in South East Asia.
This resulted in the recognition ofa restructuring provision of 15.1m for costs of exiting management agreements and closure of regional offices.
The Group has also recognised restructuring provisions of 12.9m resulting from decisions to exit the Costa equity market inFrance and the reorganisation of support centre operations.
The restructuring provisions are expected to be used within one year.
Onerous contracts Onerous contract provisions relate primarily to property reversions.
Provision is made for rent and other property related costs for the period that a sublet or assignment of the lease is not possible.
Where the property is deemed likely to be assigned, provision is made for the best estimate of the reverse lease premium payable on the assignment.
Where the property is deemed likely to be sublet, the rental income and the timing of the cash flows are estimated by bothinternal and external property specialists and a provision is maintained for the estimated cost incurred by the Group.
Onerous lease provisions are discounted using a discount rate of 3.74% 2016: 3.74% based on an approximation for the timevalue of money.
The amount and timing of the cash outflows are subject to variation.
The Group utilises the skills and expertise of both internal and external property experts to determine the provision held.
Provisions are expected to be utilised over a period ofup to 18 years.
Other Other provisions relate to warranties given on the disposal of businesses.
These are expected to be used within one year.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016 17 142 Consolidated accounts 2016 17 22Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, private placement loans, senior unsecured bonds, cash, short-term deposits, trade receivables and trade payables.
The Groups financial instrument policies can be found in the accounting policies in Note 2.
The Board agrees policies for managing the financial risks summarised below: Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Groups long-term debt obligations.
Interest rate swaps are used where necessary to maintain a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings to manage this risk, in line with the Group treasury policy.
Although the private placement loan notes are US dollar denominated, cross-currency swaps mean that the interest rate risk is effectively sterling only.
At the year-end, 761.2m 90.3% of Group debt was fixed for an average of 6.29 years at an average interest rate of 4.0% 2016: 776.2m 88.9% for 7.29 years at 4.1%.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the Group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates.
This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio offixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 2 March 2017 and 3 March 2016 respectively.
Consequently, the analysis relates to the situation at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended.
The following assumptions were made: balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt anddeposits does not change as interest rates move: gains or losses are recognised in equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies set out in Note 2: and cash flow hedges were effective.
Based on the Groups net debt position at the year-end, a 1% pt change in interest rates would affect the Groups profit beforetax by approximately 0.8m 2015 16: 1.0m, and equity by approximately 7.3m 2016: 13.1m.
Liquidity risk In its funding strategy, the Groups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and bank loans.
This strategy includes monitoring the maturity of financial liabilities to avoidthe risk of a shortage of funds.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit where maturity is fixed at no more than threemonths.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets.

The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
This is minimised by dealing with counterparties with good credit ratings.
The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, which have been estimated by management based on prior experience and any known factors at the balance sheet date which may indicate that a provision is required.
The Groups maximum exposure on its trade and other receivables is the carrying amount as disclosed in Note 17.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, the Groups exposure arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of theseinstruments.
The Group seeks to minimise the risk of default in relation to cash and cash equivalents by spreading investments across a number of counterparties.
In the event that any of the Groups banks get into financial difficulty, the Group is exposed to the risk of withdrawal of currently undrawn committed facilities.
This risk is mitigated by the Group having a range of counterparties to its facilities.
Foreign currency risk Foreign exchange exposure is currently not significant to the Group.
Although the Group has US dollar denominated loan notes, these have been swapped into sterling thereby eliminating foreign currency risk.
Sensitivity analysis has therefore notbeen carried out.
The Group monitors the growth and risks associated with its overseas operations and will undertake hedging activities asand when they are required.
Capital management The Groups primary objective in regard to capital management is to ensure that it continues to operate as a going concern andhas sufficient funds at its disposal to grow the business for the benefit of shareholders.
The Group seeks to maintain a ratio of debt to equity that balances risks and returns and also complies with lending covenants.
See pages 54 to 57 of this report for the policies and objectives of the Board regarding capital management, analysis of the Groups credit facilities andfinancing plans for the coming years.
The Group aims to maintain sufficient funds for working capital and future investment in order to meet growth targets.
Themanagement of equity through share buy-backs and new issues is considered as part of the overall leverage framework balanced against the funding requirements of future growth.
In addition, the Group may carry out a number of sale and leaseback transactions to provide further funding for growth.
The Groups financing is subject to financial covenants.
These covenants relate to measurement of EBITDA against consolidated net finance charges interest cover and total net debt leverage ratio, on a not-adjusted-for pension and property lease basis.
The Group has complied with all of these covenants.
The above matters are considered at regular intervals and form part of the business planning and budgeting processes.
Inaddition, the Board regularly reviews the Groups dividend policy and funding strategy.
23Financial instruments Fair values As in the prior year, the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities disclosed in Notes 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 24 are considered to be reasonable approximations of their fair values.
The fair value of derivative instruments is calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the market yield curve at the balance sheet date using level 2 techniques.
IFRS 13 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source ofinputs used to derive the fair value.
The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 Other techniques for which all inputs, which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value, are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3 Techniques which use inputs, which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value, that are not based on observable market data.

Derivative financial instruments include 43.3m assets 2016: 21.6m and 8.3m liabilities 2016: 9.6m due after one year.
Derivative financial instruments Hedges Cash flow hedges At 2 March 2017, the Group has interest rate swaps in place to swap a notional amount of 50.0m 2016: 100.0m whereby itreceives a variable interest rate based on LIBOR on the notional amount and pays fixed rates of between 5.145% and 5.190% 2016: 5.145% and 5.372%.
These swaps have maturities beyond the current life of the revolving credit facility 2021 and are in place to hedge against the core level of debt the Group will hold.
The swaps are being used to hedge the exposure tochanges in future cash flows from variable rate debt.
The Group also has cross-currency swaps in place whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of between 3.92% and 4.86% 2016: 3.92% and 4.86% on a notional amount of US$250.0m 2016:US$250.0m and pays an average of 4.72% on a notional sterling balance of 158.2m 2016: 4.72% on 158.2m.
The cash flow hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 2 March 2017 and a net unrealised gain of 0.2m 2015 16: net unrealised loss of 6.5m has been recorded in other comprehensive income.
The ineffectiveness recorded within finance costs in the income statement for 2016 17 was nil 2015 16, a debit of 1.0k.
Fair value hedges At 2 March 2017, the Group has cross-currency swaps in place whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of 5.23% 2016: 5.23% ona notional amount of US$75.0m 2016: US$75.0m and pays a spread of between 1.715% and 1.755% 2016: 1.715% and 1.755% over 6m GBP LIBOR on a notional sterling balance of 50.1m 2016: 50.1m.
The fair value hedges were also assessed to be highly effective at 2 March 2017.
An increase in the fair value of the interest rate swap of 6.5m 2016: an increase of 5.4m offset by a loss in the fair value of the hedged items of 6.6m 2016: loss of5.2m led to a debit of 0.1m recorded within finance costs in the income statement 2016: a credit of 0.2m in finance revenue in the income statement.
Cash flow and fair value hedges are expected to impact on the income statement in line with the liquidity risk table shown inNote 22.

27Commitments and contingencies Operating lease commitments The Group leases various buildings which are used within the Premier Inn & Restaurants and Costa businesses.
The leases arenon-cancellable operating leases with varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The Group also leases various plant and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
Contingent rents are the portion of the lease payment that is not fixed in amount but based upon the future amount of a factor that changes other than with the passage of time e. g. percentage of future sales, amount of future use, future price indices or future market rates of interest.
Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases, on an undiscounted basis, are as follows: 2017 2016 m m Due within one year 247.0 214.5 Due after one year but not more than five years 850.8 724.6 Due after five years but not more than ten years 742.0 675.4 Due after ten years 1,298.9 1,282.2 3,138.7 2,896.7 Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases disclosed above includes 13.7m in relation toprivity contracts 2015 16: 40.5m.
Future lease costs in respect of these privity contracts are included within the onerouscontracts provision Note 21.
Onerous contracts are under constant review and every effort is taken to reduce thisobligation.
The weighted average lease life of future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases is 11.7 years 2016:12.3 years.
Group companies have sublet space in certain properties.
The future minimum sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable sublease agreements as at 2 March 2017 are 25.8m 2016: 49.5m of which 14.5m 2016: 36.6m relates to privity contracts.
Contingent liabilities There are no contingent liabilities to be disclosed in the year ended 2 March 2017 2016: nil.

Vesting of all shares under the scheme will depend on continued employment and meeting earnings per share EPS and return on capital employed ROCE performance targets over a three-year period the vesting period.
Details of the performance targets for the LTIP awards can be seen inthe remuneration report on pages 78 to 98.
The awards are settled in equity once exercised.
Movements in the number of share awards are as follows: 2017 2016 Awards Awards Outstanding at the beginning of the year 685,426 817,642 Granted during the year 284,129 223,730 Exercised during the year 257,797 302,577 Expired during the year 88,115 53,369 Outstanding at the end of the year 623,643 685,426 Exercisable at the end of the year 26,855 9,963 Deferred equity awards Awards are made under the Whitbread Leadership Group Incentive Scheme implemented during 2004 05.
The awards are not subject to performance conditions and will vest in full on the release date subject to continued employment at that date.
If the director or senior executive of the Group ceases to be an employee of Whitbread prior to the release date, normally three years after the award, by reason of redundancy, retirement, death, injury, ill health, disability or some other reason considered to be appropriate by the Remuneration Committee, the awards will be released in full.
If employment ceases for any other reason, the proportion of awards which vest depends upon the year in which the award was made and the date that employment ceased.
If employment ceases in the first year after an award is made none of the awards vest, between thefirst and second anniversary, 25% vests and between the second and third anniversary, 50% vests.

The weighted average contractual life of the share options outstanding as at 2 March 2017 is between two and three years.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for options exercised during the year was 39.09 2016: 43.25.
The fair value of share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a stochastic model, taking into account theterms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
Expected volatility reflects the assumption that historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily bethe actual outcome.
The risk-free rate is the rate of interest obtainable from government securities over the expected life of the equity incentive.
The expected dividend yield is calculated on the basis of publicly available information at the time of the grant date which, inmost cases, is the historic dividend yield.
No other features relating to the granting of options were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
Employee share ownership trust ESOT The Company funds an ESOT to enable it to acquire and hold shares for the LTIP.
All dividends on the shares in the ESOT are waived by the Trustee.

Contributionsby both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested, trustee-administered funds.
The Group contributes a specified percentage of earnings for members of the above defined contribution scheme, and thereafter has no further obligations in relation to the scheme.
The total cost charged to income in relation to the defined contribution scheme in the year was 8.6m 2015 16: 8.1m.
At the year-end, 30,344 employees 2016: 29,307 were active members of the scheme, which also had 11,772 deferred members 2016: 6,181.
Defined benefit scheme The defined benefit final salary section of the principal Group pension scheme, the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, wasclosed to new members on 31 December 2001 and to future accrual on 31 December 2009.
The Whitbread Group Pension Fund is set up under UK trust law, registered with Her Majestys Revenue and Customs and regulated by the Pensions Regulator.
The Whitbread Group Pension Fund is governed by a corporate trustee which operates the scheme inaccordancewith the requirements of UK pensions legislation.
At the year-end the scheme had no active members 2016: nil, 21,942 deferred pensioners 2016: 22,792 and 16,581 pensions in payment 2016: 16,647.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.
The IAS 19 pension cost relatingto the defined benefit section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund is assessed in accordance with actuarial advice from, and calculations provided by, Lane Clark & Peacock, using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of thedefined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
As the scheme is closed to future accrual, there is nofuture service cost.
Under the governing documentation of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, any future surplus in the Fund would be returnable to Whitbread PLC by a reduction in future contributions.
As such, there are no adjustments required in respect ofIFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit plan obligation at the end of the reporting period is 18.0 years 2016:16.5 years.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016 17 150 Consolidated accounts 2016 17 29Retirement benefits continued Funding Expected contributions to be made in the next reporting period total 92.6m 2016: 82.1m.
In 2016 17, contributions were 88.1m with 78.2m from the employer, 9.1m from Moorgate Scottish Limited Partnership SLP and 0.8m of benefits settled by the Group in relation to an unfunded scheme 2015 16: 82.0m, with 73.0m from the employer, 8.9m from Moorgate SLP and 0.1m of benefits settled by the Group in relation to an unfunded scheme.
In addition, Whitbread paid 2.2m 2015 16: 2.3m of investment manager expenses.
A scheme specific actuarial valuation for the purpose of determining the level of cash contributions to be paid into the Whitbread Group Pension Fund was undertaken as at 31 March 2014.
A deficit recovery plan and some protection whilst the scheme remains in deficit, have been agreed with the Trustee.
For the period of the deficit, the Group has agreed to give undertakings to the Trustee similar to some of the covenants provided in respect of its banking agreements, up to the value of any outstanding recovery plan payments or the remaining deficit, if lower.
Until the next valuation, the Trustee has also been given a promise of accelerated payments of up to 5.0m per annum where increases in ordinary dividends exceed RPI and the right to consultation before anyspecial distributions can be made.
In addition to the scheduled deficit contribution payments described above, the Pension Scheme will receive a share of the income, profits and a variable capital payment from its investment in Moorgate SLP, which was established by the Group intheyear ended 4 March 2010 the share in profits is accounted for by the Group as contributions when paid.
The partnership interests in Moorgate SLP are held by the Group, the general partner and by the Pension Scheme.
Moorgate SLP holds an investment in a further partnership, Farringdon Scottish Partnership SP, which was also established by the Group during 2009 10.
Property assets with a market value of 221.0m have been transferred from other Group companies to Farringdon SP and leased back to Whitbread Group PLC and Premier Inn Hotels Limited.
The Group retains control over these properties, including the flexibility to substitute alternative properties.
However, the Trustee has first charge over the property portfolio and certain other assets with an aggregate value of 228.0m.
The Group retains control over both partnerships and, as such, they are fully consolidated in these consolidated financial statements.
The Pension Scheme is a partner in Moorgate SLP and, as such, is entitled to an annual share of the profits of the partnership over the next eight years.
At the end of this period, the partnership capital allocated to the Pension Scheme partner will, depending on the funding position of the Pension Scheme at that time, be transferred in cash to the Pension Scheme up to avalue of 150.0m 2016: 150.0m.
Under IAS 19, the investment held by the Pension Scheme in Moorgate SLP, a consolidated entity, does not represent a plan asset for the purposes of the consolidated financial statements.
Accordingly, the pension deficit position in these consolidated financial statements does not reflect the 190.2m 2016: 165.8m investment in Moorgate SLP held by the Pension Scheme.
During the year ended 28 February 2013, the Group entered into a charge in favour of Whitbread Pension Trustees Limited over properties with a market value totalling 180.0m at that date.
The charge was to secure the obligations of the Group to make payments to the Pension Fund as part of the recovery plan to reduce the deficit.
This, together with the properties secured asaconsequence of the arrangement surrounding the partnerships, secures properties totalling 408.0m in favour of the PensionScheme.
Risks Through its defined benefit scheme, the Group is exposed to a number of risks in relation to the IAS 19 deficit, the most significant of which are detailed below: Principal impact on assets Risk Description and obligation reconciliations Market volatility The defined benefit obligation is linked to AA-rated corporate bonds Return on plan assets whilst scheme assets are invested in equities, gilts, bonds, property and cash.
This exposes the Group to risks including those relating tointerest rates, equity markets, property markets and foreign exchange.
Changing market conditions, in conjunction with discount rate fluctuations, will lead to volatility in the Groups net pension liability on the balance sheet, pension expense in the income statement and re-measurement movements in other comprehensiveincome.
Inflationary risk Due to the link between the scheme obligation and inflation, Actuarial movements in anincreased rate of inflation will lead to higher scheme liabilities.
financialassumptions Accounting The defined benefit obligation is calculated by projecting the Discount rate: interest income on assumptions futurecash flows of the scheme for many years into the future.
scheme assets and cost on liabilities Consequently, the assumptions used can have a significant impact Mortality: actuarial movements on the balance sheet position and income statement charge.
indemographic assumptions Inpractice, future Scheme experience may not be in line with theassumptions adopted.
For example, an increase in the life expectancy of members would increase scheme liabilities.

The assumptions in relation to discount rate, mortality and inflation have a significant effect on the measurement of scheme liabilities.
The following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in these assumptions: Increase decrease in liability 2017 2016 m m Discount rate 0.25% increase to discount rate 125.0 88.0 0.25% decrease to discount rate 134.0 94.0 Inflation 0.25% increase to inflation rate 97.0 69.0 0.25% decrease to inflation rate 94.0 66.0 Life expectancy Additional one-year increase to life expectancy 95.0 75.0 The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method projected unit credit method has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet.
The methods and types of assumptions did not change.
