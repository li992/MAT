The address of its registered office is Buildings 1 & 2 Trident Place, Mosquito Way, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, AL10 9UL.
The financial period represents the 53 weeks ended 3 December 2017 prior period 52 weeks ended 27 November 2016.
Basis of Preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretation Committee IFRIC interpretations as endorsed by the European Union IFRS-EU, and those parts of the Companies Act applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest hundred thousand unless otherwise stated.
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for financial instruments that have been measured at fair value.
The Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements of the Company.
Exemptions The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 408 of the Companies Act and not presented an income statement or a statement of comprehensive income for the Company alone.
New standards, amendments and interpretations issued that are effective but not material to the Company The Company has considered the following new standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are effective for the Company for the financial year beginning 28 November 2016 and concluded that they are either not relevant to the Company or that they would not have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements: Various Amendments to various IFRSs and IASs including those arising from the IASBs annual improvements project 1 January 2016 IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements amendments 1 January 2016 IFRS 11 Joint arrangements amendments 1 January 2016 IFRS 12 Disclosure in other entities amendments 1 January 2016 IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements amendments 1 January 2016 IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment amendments 1 January 2016 IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures amendments 1 January 2016 IAS 34 Interim financial reporting amendments 1 January 2016 IAS 38 Intangible assets amendments 1 January 2016 New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted by the Company The following further new standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards and interpretations which are relevant to the Company have been issued but are not effective for the financial year beginning 28 November 2016 and have not been adopted early: IFRS 2 Share-based payments amendments 1 January 2018 IFRS 9 Financial instruments 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 IAS 12 Income taxes amendments 1 January 2017 IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures amendments 1 January 2018 Various Amendments to various IFRSs and IASs including those arising from the IASBs annual improvements project Various The following new standards are not yet effective and the impact on the Company is currently under review: IFRS 9, published in July 2014, replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, including a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets and the new general hedge accounting requirements.
It also carries forward the guidance on recognition and derecognition of financial instruments from IAS 39.
The Group is assessing the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from the application of IFRS 9.
Our initial review of IFRS 9 has indicated that the impact of this new standard on the Groups results is unlikely to be material.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers endorsed by the EU provides on the recognition and measurement of revenue.
The standard establishes a principles-based approach for revenue recognition and is based on the concept of recognising revenue for obligations only when they are satisfied and the control of goods or services is transferred.
This applies to all contracts with customers except those in the scope of other standards.
This new standard will replace IAS 18 Revenue and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 unless adopted early.
The Company does not expect there to be an impact from IFRS 15.
The Company will continue to monitor the impact of IFRS 15 on new service contracts as they arise.
IFRS 16 Leases provides guidance on the classification, recognition and measurement of leases to help provide useful information to the users of financial statements.
The main aim of this standard is to ensure all leases will be reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, irrespective of substance over form.
The new standard will replace IAS 17 Leases and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 unless adopted early.
IFRS 16 is not expected to have an impact on the amounts recognised in the Companys consolidated financial statements as the Company currently has no leases.
com 183 25615 Proof 8 6 February 2018 12:13 AM NOTES TO THE COMPANY Financial Statements ACCOUNTING POLICIES Foreign Currency Translation Transactions and Balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured.
Foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Income Statement.
Taxation Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Management periodically evaluate positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of the Company financial statements requires the use of certain judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
SECTION 2 RESULTS FOR THE YEAR 2.1 Profit Before Tax Accounting Policies Administrative Expenses Administrative expenses consist of fees for professional services, bank charges and any other costs of an administrative nature.
2.2 Operating Results During the period, the Company obtained audit services from its auditors, Deloitte LLP, to the amount of 70,000 2016:  LLP, 65,000.
2.3 Employee Information The Company does not incur any direct staff costs as the Groups employees are employed by a subsidiary company.
Analysis and disclosures in relation to share-based payments are given in Note 4.3.

They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period which are classified as non-current assets.
The Companys loans and receivables comprise Other receivables and Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet.
Other Receivables Other receivables are non-interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost, reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
No security has been granted over other receivables unless stated otherwise.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, demand deposits with banks and short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less at the Balance Sheet date.
Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Trade and Other Payables Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

com 185 25615 Proof 8 6 February 2018 12:13 AM NOTES TO THE COMPANY Financial Statements 3.6 Provisions Employee Incentive Schemes Provisions for employee incentive schemes relate to HMRC unapproved equity-settled schemes and the Cash-based Long Term Incentive Plan Cash LTIP.
For all unapproved schemes and the Cash LTIP, the Company is liable to pay employers' NIC upon allotment of the share awards.
Unapproved schemes are the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Chairmans Share Matching Award, the Growth Incentive Plan GIP and unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
For more details on these schemes, refer to Note 4.10 to the consolidated financial statements.
In 2014, the Company established the Cash LTIP in order to incentivise selected high performing employees of the Group.
At the end of the three-year vesting period, employees will be paid a cash amount equal to the notional number of awards at the prevailing share price, adjusted for the achievement of the performance conditions.
Provisions Employee Incentive Schemes m As at 29 November 2015 3.7 Charged to the Income Statement additional provision 0.9 unused amounts reversed 0.2 Used during the period 1.9 As at 27 November 2016 2.5 Charged to the Income Statement additional provision 1.7 unused amounts reversed 0.1 Used during the period 0.7 As at 3 December 2017 3.4 Analysis of Total Provisions as at 27 November 2016 Employee Incentive Schemes m Current 0.9 Non-current 1.6 2.5 Analysis of Total Provisions as at 3 December 2017 Employee Incentive Schemes m Current 0.8 Non-current 2.6 3.4 Employee Incentive Schemes The provision consists of the Cash LTIP and employers NIC on HMRC unapproved equity-settled schemes.
The Cash LTIP provision represents the expected cash payments to participants upon vesting of the awards.
It has been calculated using various assumptions regarding liquidity, participants retention and achievability of the performance conditions and valued with reference to the year end share price.
If at any point following initial valuation any of these assumptions are revised, the charge will need to be amended accordingly.
In addition to the base cost, since this is a cash benefit, the Company will be liable to pay employers' NIC on the value of the cash award on vesting, which is included in the above employers NIC provision.
To calculate the employers NIC provision, the applicable employers NIC rate is applied to the number of share awards which are expected to vest, valued with reference to the year end share price.
The number of share awards expected to vest is dependent on various assumptions which are determined by management: namely participants retention rate, the expectation of meeting the performance criteria, if any, and the liquidity discount.
All assumptions are supported by historical trends and internal financial forecasts, where appropriate.
Ocado Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts for the 53 weeks ended 3 December 2017 186 25615 Proof 8 6 February 2018 12:13 AM Our Financials 3.6 Provisions continued For the GIP, an external valuation was carried out to determine the fair value of the awards granted see Note 4.10 g to the consolidated financial statements.
If at any point during the life of each share award any non-market conditions are subject to change, such as the retention rate or the likelihood of the performance condition being met, the number of share awards likely to vest will need to be recalculated which will cause the value of the employers NIC provision to change accordingly.
Once the share awards under each of the schemes have vested, the provision will be utilised when they are allotted to participants.
Vesting will occur between 2017 and 2020.
SECTION 4 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING COSTS 4.1 Borrowings 3 December 27 November 2017 2016 m m Borrowings 243.3 Non-current liabilities 243.3 The loan outstanding at period end can be analysed as follows: Carrying Carrying Amount as at Amount as at Final 3 December 27 November Principal amount Security Current Instalment Payment 2017 2016 m Inception Held Interest Rate Frequency Due m m 250.0 June 2017 Collateral 4% Semi-annually June 2024 243.3 4.2 Share Capital and Premium Accounting Policies Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Share Capital and Premium Included in the total number of ordinary shares outstanding below are 32,803,390 2016: 32,830,613 ordinary shares held by the Groups Employee Benefit Trust see Note 4.10 b to the consolidated financial statements.
The ordinary shares held by the trustee of the Groups Employee Benefit Trust pursuant to the Joint Share Ownership Scheme are treated as treasury shares in the Groups Consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation.
These ordinary shares have voting rights but these have been waived by the trustee.
The number of allotted, called up and fully paid shares, excluding treasury shares, at the end of each period differs from that used in the basic earnings per share calculation in Note 2.9 to the consolidated financial statements, as basic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding treasury shares.
At 3 December 2017, the number of ordinary shares available for issue under the Block Listing Facilities was 12,083,504 2016: 13,318,184.
These ordinary shares will only become allotted when the shares under the Share Incentive Plan have been awarded or the share options under the Groups Executive Share Ownership Scheme, non-employee share options and Sharesave schemes have been exercised, and are therefore not included in the total number of ordinary shares outstanding.
The movements in the called up share capital and share premium are set out below: Ordinary Shares Ordinary Share Number Shares Premium million m m At 29 November 2015 625.4 12.6 259.0 Issues of ordinary shares 3.4 0.6 Allotted in respect of share option schemes 0.4 0.5 At 27 November 2016 629.2 12.6 260.1 Issues of ordinary shares 1.1 0.9 Allotted in respect of share option schemes 0.4 0.6 At 3 December 2017 630.7 12.6 261.6 4.3 Share-based Payments For more information on the Groups share schemes, see Note 4.10 to the consolidated financial statements.
com 187 25615 Proof 8 6 February 2018 12:13 AM NOTES TO THE COMPANY Financial Statements 4.4 Financial Instruments Accounting Policies Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Balance Sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Company classifies its financial instruments into available-for-sale, loans and receivables, and other financial liabilities at amortised cost.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets and liabilities were acquired.
Management determine the classification of their financial instruments at initial recognition or in certain circumstances on modification.
Offsetting Financial Instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying values and fair values of all financial instruments that are included in the financial statements.
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are based on prices available from the market on which the instruments are traded where available.
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their carrying values but for completeness are included in the analysis below.
3 December 2017 27 November 2016 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Notes 000 000 000 000 Financial Assets Investments 3.1 512.5 512.5 505.6 505.6 Cash and cash equivalents 3.4 117.5 117.5 14.6 14.6 Other receivables 3.3 386.7 386.7 244.0 244.0 Total financial assets 1,016.7 1,016.7 764.2 764.2 Financial Liabilities Trade and other payables 3.5 5.5 5.5 0.3 0.3 Senior secured notes 4.1 243.3 240.9 Total financial liabilities 248.8 246.4 0.3 0.3 4.5 Credit Risk The Companys exposures to credit risk arise from holdings of cash and cash equivalents and other receivables.
Exposure to Credit Risk The carrying value of financial assets, as set out in Note 4.3, represents the maximum credit exposure.
No collateral is held as security against these assets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Companys exposure to credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is managed by investing in banks and financial institutions with strong credit ratings and by regular review of counterparty risk.
Other Receivables Other receivables at the end of both periods consist primarily of amounts due from subsidiary undertakings.
Management provide for irrecoverable debts when there are indicators that a balance may not be recoverable.
The ageing of other receivables at the balance sheet date is set out below: 3 December 2017 27 November 2016 Gross Impairment Gross Impairment Notes 000 000 000 000 Not past due 3.3 386.7 244.0 There were no unimpaired balances at the period end where the Company had renegotiated the terms.
Management have not provided for irrecoverable debts against any of their other receivable balances.

As at 3 December 2017 the facility has not been utilised.
The Company regularly reviews its financing arrangements.
The Company monitors cash flow as part of its day-to-day control procedures and the Board considers cash flow projections on a monthly basis.
The Companys capital management policies are consistent with those of the Group.
For further details on the Groups capital management strategy see Note 4.11 to the consolidated financial statements.

No financial assets are held in foreign currencies.
Due to the Companys lack of exposure to currency risk, no sensitivity analysis has been performed.
Interest Rate Risk The Company has no interest bearing financial liabilities with a variable rate and its interest bearing financial assets consist of only cash and cash equivalents and certain amounts due from subsidiary undertakings.
These financial assets are exposed to interest rate risk as the Company holds money market deposits at floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by investing cash in a range of cash deposit accounts with UK banks split between fixed-term deposits, notice accounts and money market funds.
At the balance sheet date the interest rate profile of the Companys interest bearing financial instruments was: 3 December 27 November 2017 2016 m m Fixed Rate Instruments Financial assets 117.5 14.6 Financial liabilities 243.3 Sensitivity Analysis An increase of 100 basis points 1.0% in interest rates would impact equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below.
A rate of 100 basis points was deemed appropriate, considering the current short-term interest rate outlook.
The calculation applies the increase to average floating rate interest bearing borrowings and cash and cash equivalents existing during the period.
This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant and considers the effect on financial instruments with variable interest rates.
