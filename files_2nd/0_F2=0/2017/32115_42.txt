Retirement benefit assets and obligations.
Financial instruments, contracts and obligations under share based payment transactions.
Liabilities or assets that are not contractual such as income taxes that are created as a result of statutory requirements imposed by governments, prepayments, provisions and deferred income are not financial liabilities or financial assets.
Accordingly, prepayments, provisions, deferred income and amounts payable or receivable in respect of corporation tax, sales tax including UK Value Added Tax, payroll tax and other taxes are excluded from the disclosures provided in this note.

Information on the carrying value of such derivatives is provided in note 25 g. The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities shown above are determined as follows: The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accrued income, trade receivables and other receivables is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Given the short average time to maturity, no specific assumptions on discount rates have been made.
The effect of credit losses not already reflected in the carrying value as impairment losses is assumed to be immaterial.
The carrying value of trade payables, other payables, accruals, loan from non-controlling interest and loan from joint venture is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Given the relatively short average time to maturity, no specific assumptions on discount rates have been made.
The fair value of fixed-rate notes included in borrowings that are quoted on a recognised stock exchange is determined with reference to the bid price as at the balance sheet date.
The carrying value of fixed-rate notes that are not quoted on a recognised stock exchange and fixed-rate hire purchase and finance lease liabilities included in borrowings is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value taking account of the amounts involved in the context of total financial liabilities and the fixed interest rates relative to market interest rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of other borrowings on which interest is payable at floating rates is not considered to be materially different from the carrying value.
We do not consider that the fair value of financial instruments would change materially from that shown above as a result of any reasonable change to the assumptions made in determining the fair values shown above.
The fair value of financial instruments, and in particular the fixed rate notes, would be affected by changes in market interest rates.
Excluding the element hedged in a fair value hedge, we estimate that a 100 basis points reduction in market interest rates would increase the fair value of the fixed-rate notes liability by around 26.1m 2016: 37.7m.

This note c presents qualitative information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, including the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk: there have been no significant changes to these matters during the year ended 29 April 2017.
This note c also provides summary quantitative data about the Groups exposure to each risk.
In addition, information on the Groups management of capital is provided in section 1.6.
10 of the Strategic report which forms part of these financial statements.
The Groups overall financial risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the likelihood and or magnitude of adverse effects on the financial performance and financial position of the Group.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments from time to time to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk, commodity price risk and interest rate movements.
The Group does not generally hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
A Group Treasury Committee and central treasury department Group Treasury oversee financial risk management in the context of policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in co-operation with the Groups operating units.
Group Treasury is responsible for the execution of derivative financial instruments to manage financial risks.
Certain financial risk management activities for example, the management of credit risk arising from trade and other receivables are devolved to the management of individual business units.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investing excess liquidity.
i Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices and commodity prices will affect the Groups financial performance and or financial position.
The objective of the Groups management of market risk is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board.
Generally the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to reduce volatility in the consolidated income statement.

The Group is exposed to foreign currency translation risk principally as a result of net investments in foreign operations and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group has material foreign investments in Canada and the USA.
To reduce balance sheet translation exposure, the Group partially hedges the sterling carrying value of foreign operations through borrowings denominated in their functional currency or, where appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
Gains and losses arising from hedging instruments that provide a hedge against foreign net investments are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Bank loans drawn in USDollars and a US$150.0m bond issued in October 2012 have been accounted for as a hedge of the Groups foreign net investments.
The Groups objective in managing and measuring foreign currency translation risk associated with net investments in foreign operations and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies is to maintain an appropriate cost of borrowing and retain some potential for benefiting from currency movements whilst partially hedging against adverse currency movements.
It is the Groups policy to examine each foreign investment individually and to adopt an appropriate hedging strategy.
The Group measures foreign currency translation risk by identifying the carrying value of assets and liabilities denominated in the relevant foreign currency and quantifying the impact on equity of changes in the relevant foreign currency rate.
The Groups consolidated income statement is principally exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates in the following ways: The translation of the revenues and costs of the Groups North American operations: and The translation of interest payable on US dollar denominated debt.
The Groups consolidated balance sheet exposures to foreign currency translation risk excluding immaterial exposure to Euros were as follows: 2017 2016 m m US dollars Net investments in foreign operations excluding intra-group balances, cash and borrowings 243.3 244.6 Cash 22.9 25.9 Borrowings 224.3 198.7 Canadian dollars Net investments in foreign operations excluding intra-group balances, cash and borrowings 23.0 23.6 Cash 2.1 2.1 Net exposure 67.0 97.5 The amounts shown above are the carrying values of all US and Canadian dollar items in the consolidated balance sheet that would have differed at the balance sheet date had a different foreign currency exchange rate been applied, except that derivatives that are cash flow hedges are excluded.
The sensitivity of the amounts shown above in the Groups consolidated balance sheet to US and Canadian dollar translation exposures is illustrated below: 2017 2016 US dollar US dollar balance sheet foreign exchange rate 1.2937 1.4649 Impact of 10% depreciation of UK sterling against US dollar US dollar foreign exchange rate 1.1643 1.3184 Increase in consolidated equity m 4.7 8.0 Impact of 10% appreciation of UK sterling against US dollar US dollar foreign exchange rate 1.4231 1.6114 Decrease in consolidated equity m 3.8 6.5 Canadian dollar Canadian dollar balance sheet foreign exchange rate 1.7689 1.8349 Impact of 10% depreciation of UK sterling against Canadian dollar Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate 1.5920 1.6514 Increase in consolidated equity m 2.8 2.9 Impact of 10% appreciation of UK sterling against Canadian dollar Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate 1.9458 2.0184 Decrease in consolidated equity m 2.3 2.3 The above sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: Only those foreign currency assets and liabilities that are directly affected by changes in foreign exchange rates are included in the calculation.
The above calculations assume that the exchange rates between sterling and any currencies other than the one stated do not change as a result of the change in the exchange rate between the currencies stated.

The Group is exposed to limited foreign currency transactional risk due to the low value of transactions entered into by subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency.
Group Treasury carries out forward buying of currencies where appropriate.
The Group reviews and considers hedging of actual and forecast foreign exchange transactional exposures up to one year forward.
At 29 April 2017 there were no material net transactional foreign currency exposures 2016: Nil.
The Groups exposure to commodity price risk includes a foreign currency element due to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the sterling cost of fuel for the Groups UK operations.
The effect of foreign exchange rate movements on sterling-denominated fuel prices is managed through the use of fuel derivative financial instruments denominated in the functional currency in which the fuel is purchased.
Further information on fuel hedging is given under the heading Price risk on page 120.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk principally through its borrowings and interest rate derivatives.
It has a mixture of fixed-rate borrowings where the fair value is exposed to changes in market interest rates, cash and floating-rate borrowings where the future cash flows are exposed to changes in market interest rates.
The Groups objective with regards to interest rate risk is to reduce the risk of changes in interest rates significantly affecting future cash flows and or profit.
To provide some certainty as to the level of interest cost, it is the Groups policy to manage interest rate exposure through the use of fixed and floating rate debt.
Derivative financial instruments are also used where appropriate to generate the desired interest rate profile.
The Group measures interest rate risk by quantifying the relative proportions of each of gross debt and net debt that are effectively subject to fixed interest rates and considers the duration for which the relevant interest rates are fixed.
At 29 April 2017, the interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial liabilities was as follows: Weighted Weighted average period average fixed for which rate Floating rate Fixed rate Total interest rate is fixed Currency m m m % Years Sterling 209.1 305.9 515.0 4.0 8.4 US Dollar 61.8 162.5 224.3 3.6 4.8 Gross interest bearing financial liabilities 270.9 468.4 739.3 3.9 7.2 At 30 April 2016, the interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial liabilities was as follows: Weighted Weighted average period average fixed for which rate Floating rate Fixed rate Total interest rate is fixed Currency m m m % Years Sterling 192.5 405.9 598.4 4.0% 9.4 US Dollar 156.9 41.8 198.7 2.0% 2.7 Gross interest bearing financial liabilities 349.4 447.7 797.1 3.8% 8.8 The above figures take into account the effect of US$150m of interest rate derivatives which swapped the US$150m Notes maturing October 2022 from fixed to floating rate debt for a period of four years to December 2016, and 100m of interest rate derivatives which swap 100m of the 400m Notes maturing September 2025 from fixed to floating rate debt for a period of two years to December 2018.
The floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates fixed in advance for periods ranging from one to six months based on market rates.
The maturity profile of the Groups borrowings is shown in note 21 a.
The Groups financial assets on which floating interest is receivable include cash deposits and cash in hand of 313.3m 2016: 382.3m.
As at 29 April 2017, the Group had no other financial assets on which fixed interest is receivable 2016: Nil.
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.

Price risk The Group is exposed to commodity price risk.
The Groups operations as at 29 April 2017 consume approximately 411m litres of diesel fuel per annum.
As a result, the Groups future profit and cash flows are exposed to movements in the underlying price of fuel.
The Groups objective in managing commodity price risk is to reduce the risk that movements in fuel prices result in adverse movements in its profit and cash flow.
The Group has a policy of managing the volatility in its fuel costs by maintaining an ongoing fuel-hedging programme whereby derivatives are used to fix or cap the variable unit cost of a percentage of anticipated fuel consumption.
The Groups exposure to commodity price risk is measured by quantifying the element of projected future fuel costs, after taking account of derivatives in place, which varies due to movements in fuel prices.
Group Treasury is responsible for the processes for measuring and managing commodity price risk.
The Groups overall fuel costs include the impact of delivery margins, fuel taxes and fuel tax rebates.
These elements of fuel costs are not managed as part of Group Treasurys commodity price risk management and are managed directly by business unit management.
The Group uses a number of fuel derivatives to hedge against movements in the price of the different types of fuel used in each of its divisions.
The fuel derivatives hedge the underlying commodity price risk denominated in US$ and in the case of the UK Bus regional operations Division, the UK Bus London Division and the UK Rail Division, they also hedge the currency risk due to the commodity being priced in US$ and the functional currency of the divisions being pounds sterling.
At 29 April 2017 and 30 April 2016, the projected fuel costs excluding premia payable on fuel derivatives, delivery margins, fuel taxes and fuel tax rebates for the next twelve months were: 2017 2016 m m Costs subject to fuel swaps: UK Bus regional operations 64.0 66.5 UK Bus London 9.1 7.1 UK Rail 14.2 26.3 North America 17.9 26.0 105.2 125.9 Costs not subject to fuel swaps: UK Bus regional operations 0.3 1.1 megabus Europe 1.3 UK Bus London 2.5 4.5 UK Rail 10.6 1.7 North America 9.8 4.6 23.2 13.2 Total 128.4 139.1 The figures in the above table are after taking account of derivatives and applying the fuel prices and foreign exchange rates as at the balance sheet date.
If all of the relevant fuel prices were 10% higher at the balance sheet date, the amounts in the above table would change by the following: 2017 2016 m m Costs not subject to fuel swaps: UK Bus regional operations 0.1 megabus Europe 0.1 UK Bus London 0.3 0.4 UK Rail 1.0 0.2 North America 1.0 0.5 Decrease in projected profit before taxation 2.3 1.3 page 120 | Stagecoach Group plc 145376 STC Back PRINT CIO 145376 STC Back V13 06 07 2017 17:33 Page 121 Note 25 Financial instruments continued c Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments continued i Market risk continued If all of the relevant fuel prices were 10% lower at the balance sheet date, the amounts would change by the following: 2017 2016 m m Costs not subject to fuel swaps: UK Bus regional operations 0.1 megabus Europe 0.1 UK Bus London 0.3 0.4 UK Rail 1.0 0.2 North America 1.0 0.5 Increase in projected profit before taxation 2.3 1.3 The revenue receivable under certain of the contracts that the Group has with customers is subject to adjustment for changes to certain fuel prices.
This further reduces the unhedged exposure to fuel prices shown above.
Demand for the Groups services can also be affected by movements in fuel prices due to the impact on the cost of competing transport services, including private cars.
The Group is also exposed to changes in electricity prices, principally in its UK Rail Division where electricity is consumed to power some of the trains operated.
The Group has some protection to price changes via rail industry arrangements to fix the price on a proportion of anticipated future electricity consumption.
The Groups joint venture, Virgin Rail Group, is also exposed to changes in fuel and electricity prices and applies commodity price risk management strategies similar to those applied by the Group and explained above.
ii Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Credit risk is managed by a combination of Group Treasury and business unit management, and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to amounts due from outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
The Groups objective is to minimise credit risk to an acceptable level whilst not overly restricting the Groups ability to generate revenue and profit.
It is the Groups policy to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
To control credit risk, counterparty credit limits are set by reference to published credit ratings and the counterpartys geographical location.
The Group considers the risk of material loss in the event of non-performance by a financial counterparty to be low.
In determining whether a financial asset is impaired, the Group takes account of: The fair value of the asset at the balance sheet date and where applicable, the historic fair value of the asset: In the case of receivables, the counterpartys typical payment patterns: In the case of receivables, the latest available information on the counterpartys creditworthiness such as available financial statements, credit ratings etc.
The movement in the provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is shown in note 18.
The table below shows the financial assets exposed to credit risk at the balance sheet date: Gross Impairment Net exposure Gross Impairment Net exposure 2017 2017 2017 2016 2016 2016 m m m m m m Trade receivables 256.9 2.5 254.4 237.1 2.5 234.6 Loans, other receivables and accrued income 93.6 93.6 69.5 69.5 Cash and cash equivalents pledged as collateral 18.6 18.6 18.6 18.6 Cash and cash equivalents other 294.7 294.7 363.7 363.7 Excluding derivative financial instruments 663.8 2.5 661.3 688.9 2.5 686.4 Derivatives used for hedging 14.3 14.3 6.6 6.6 Total exposure to credit risk 678.1 2.5 675.6 695.5 2.5 693.0 The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer or counterparty.
The Groups largest credit exposures are to the UKsDepartment for Transport, Transport for London, and other government bodies and financial institutions with short-term credit ratings of A2 or equivalent or better, all of which the Group considers unlikely to default on their respective liabilities to the Group.

iii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups objective in managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The funding policy is to finance the Group through a mixture of bank, lease and hire purchase debt, capital markets issues and cash generated by the business.
As at 29 April 2017, the Groups credit facilities were 1,130.5m 2016: 1,146.6m, 648.3m 2016: 686.5m of which were utilised, including utilisation for the issuance of bank guarantees, performance season ticket bonds and letters of credit.
The Group had the following undrawn committed banking and uncommitted asset finance facilities: 2017 2016 m m Expiring within one year 160.3 189.9 Expiring beyond two years 321.9 270.2 482.2 460.1 Although there is an element of seasonality in the Groups bus and rail operations, the overall impact of seasonality on working capital and liquidity is not considered significant.
The Board expects the Group to be able to meet current and future funding requirements through free cash flow and available committed facilities.
In addition, the Group has investment grade credit ratings which should allow it access at short notice to additional bank and capital markets debt funding.
The Group has bank lines of credit arranged on a bi-lateral basis with a group of relationship banks which provide bank facilities for general corporate purposes.
These arranged lines of credit allow cash drawdowns to finance the Group and also include facilities which are dedicated to issuing performance season ticket bonds, guarantees and letters of credit.

Where the contractual cash flows are variable based on a price, foreign exchange rate, interest rate or index in the future, the contractual cash flows in the above table have been determined with reference to the value of the relevant price, foreign exchange rate, interest rate or index as at the balance sheet date.
In determining the interest element of contractual cash flows in cases where the Group has a choice as to the length of interest calculation periods and the interest rate that applies varies with the period selected, the contractual cash flows have been calculated assuming the Group selects the shortest available interest calculation periods.
Where the holder of an instrument has a choice of when to redeem, the amounts in the above tables are on the assumption the holder redeems at the earliest opportunity.
In the case of bank loans, which are drawn under revolving facilities, the contracted interest cash flows in respect of interest up to and including the next rollover date are shown and the principal is shown as repayable at the expiry date of the relevant facility.

In connection with the issue of the Groups US$150m Bonds in October 2012, the Group entered into a number of interest rate fair value hedges.
In addition, during the year ended 30 April 2015, the Group entered into a number of interest rate derivatives as cash flow hedges of the Groups exposure to floating interest rates to December 2016.
In September 2015, following the issue of the Groups 400m sterling notes, these sterling-denominated interest rate derivatives were subsequently cancelled.
The Group entered into new interest rate derivatives as fair value hedges of the Groups exposure to fixed interest rates from December 2016 on expiry of the existing US dollar-denominated fair value hedges.

These derivatives were intended to hedge against the variability of forecast future floating-rate interest payments on debt fromDecember 2016.
In September 2015, the Group issued 400m of new fixed-rate bonds to re-finance the previous 400m of fixed-rate bonds that were due to mature in December 2016.
Following that issue of new bonds, the forecast floating-rate interest payments were no longer expected to occur because fixed-rate debt had been issued rather than the previously anticipated floating-rate debt.
The derivatives were cancelled following the new bond issue.
There have been no other instances during the year ended 29 April 2017 2016: None from a Group perspective where a forecast transaction for which hedge accounting had previously been used was no longer expected to occur.
Hedge of foreign net investments The Groups hedging of foreign net investments during the year ended 29 April 2017 is explained on page 87.
The movements in the fair value of the US$150m 4.36% notes and US$ bank loans used as hedging instruments in the year were as follows: 2017 2016 m m US$ 4.36% notes Fair value at start of year 102.4 97.6 Changes in fair value during the year 13.5 4.8 Fair value at end of year 115.9 102.4 US$ bank loans Fair value at start of year 54.6 52.1 Changes in fair value during the year 7.2 2.5 Fair value at end of year 61.8 54.6 The fair values of the non-derivative hedging instruments shown above only take account of fair value movements arising from movements in foreign exchange rates.
