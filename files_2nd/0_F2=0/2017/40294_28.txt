b Basis of consolidation Consolidated subsidiaries are those entities in which the Group has power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain economic benefits.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are presently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.

Accounting policies of subsidiaries are changed when necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
Under IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures.
The classification depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement.
The Group determines, at each reporting date, whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in joint ventures is impaired.
If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the joint ventures and the carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to share of profit or loss of joint venture in the statement of comprehensive income.
Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
c Business combinations The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations of entities not under common control.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group.
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Cost is adjusted to reflect changes in consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income.

Principal accounting policies continued Strategic Report j Impairment Financial The carrying values of non-financial assets are tested annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows which Our are independent from other assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit CGU to which the asset belongs is Governance estimated.
The recoverable amount of a non-financial asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell, and its value in use.
Value in use is Financial Statements the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or CGU.
An impairment loss is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income whenever the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss in a subsidiary consolidated under predecessor accounting note 1z is recognised as a movement in the merger reserve and retained earnings in addition to recognising a loss on the statement of comprehensive income.

An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives as follows: Trademarks 10 years Website and software 5 years Lease premiums Over the life of the lease on a straight-line basis Distribution agreements 6 23 years Trademarks comprise the external cost of registration and associated legal costs.
Website and software costs consist primarily of externally incurred development costs.

These growth estimates include a new store opening programme and the developments of the wholesale business in line with the Board approved Group long-term financial plan.
The assumptions used in the growth model have the potential to change.
The deferred tax asset recognised in the financial statements in respect of US tax losses is 5.5m.
A 1% reduction in the EBIT growth assumptions would reduce the deferred tax asset recognised by 0.2m.

New accounting pronouncements New standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective: At the balance sheet date there are a number of new standards and amendments to existing standards in issue but not yet effective including IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers, which is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, and IFRS 16 Leases, which is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The Group has not early adopted any of these new standards or amendments to existing standards.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments supersedes IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The new standard introduces a principles-based approach to the classification and measurement of financial instruments, a new impairment model to be applied and changes to hedge accounting.
Upon initial assessment, management do not expect there to be a material effect on the financial statements.

This standard will bring operating leases onto the balance sheet.
Management have performed an initial assessment of its impact, including sensitivity analysis, based on forecast Notes to the Group operating leases at transition date and expect there to be a material adjustment to the Group retained earnings, lease liabilities and right of use assets.
An associated finance charge and depreciation charge will replace the operating lease charge and as a result there is expected to be an impact on operating profit and on profit after tax in future periods.

The Group has defined its CGUs as Retail and Wholesale.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
The recoverable amounts in 2017 were measured based on post-tax value in use 2016: based on post-tax value in use.
This methodology is considered reasonable given the significant levels of headroom noted from this assessment.
Detailed forecasts for the next five years have been used which are based on approved annual budgets and strategic projections representing the best estimate of future performance.

Intangible assets continued Strategic Report Key assumptions Financial In determining the recoverable amount it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate the present value of future cash flows.
In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management reflecting past experience and are consistent with Our relevant external sources of information.
Discount rates Financial Discount rates are derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 10.5%.
The pre-tax weighted cost of Statements capital is 13.6%.
Operating cash flows The main assumptions, which are derived from past experience and external information, within the forecast operating cash flows, include the achievement of future sales prices, volumes, raw material input costs and the level of ongoing capital expenditure.
Long-term growth rates To forecast beyond the five years, a long-term average growth rate of 2% has been used: this is not greater than the average longterm retail growth rate for each CGU.
Goodwill sensitivity analysis The results of the Groups impairment tests are dependent on estimates and judgements made by management, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above.
A sensitivity analysis as to potential changes in key assumptions has therefore been performed.
The present values of the future cash flows of the Retail and Wholesale CGUs are significant and are insensitive to any changes to potential changes to key assumptions.
