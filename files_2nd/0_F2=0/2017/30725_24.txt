STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 105 Financial statements NOTES 1 Basis of preparation Bunzl plc the Company is a public company, which is limited by shares and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Company is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom and is registered in England and Wales.
i Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 have been approved by the Board of directors of Bunzl plc.
They are prepared in accordance with i EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using IFRS and ii IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
They are prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of certain items which are measured at fair value as described in the accounting policies below.
The directors consider that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
ii New accounting standards and interpretations There are no new standards issued by the IASB that are applicable to the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017.
The Group has adopted all relevant amendments to existing standards and interpretations issued by the IASB that are effective from 1 January 2017 with no material impact on its consolidated results or financial position.
The Group is currently assessing the potential impact of new and revised standards and interpretations issued by the IASB that will be effective from 1 January 2018 and beyond, none of which have been adopted early.
A summary of the Groups current considerations with respect to three of the new accounting standards is included below.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers is effective in the consolidated financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2018.
IFRS 15 requires companies to apportion revenue from customer contracts to separate performance obligations and recognise revenue as these performance obligations are satisfied.
The vast majority of the Groups revenue is generated from the delivery of goods to customers representing a single performance obligation which is satisfied upon delivery of the relevant goods.
During the year the Group carried out a detailed assessment of its other revenue streams and assessed the revenue recognition policies for these goods and services against the requirements of IFRS 15.
The Groups other revenue generating activities represent circa 1% of total revenue.
The majority of this revenue relates to design and fit-out services for foodservice customers and fulfilment services where the Group does not take title to inventory.
Having assessed these and other services performed, the Group has determined that the recognition of revenue under IFRS 15 does not differ materially from current accounting practice.
Accordingly, based on the Groups assessment, the application of IFRS 15 is not anticipated to have a material impact on the timing of revenue recognition and is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Groups operating profit or financial position.
Therefore the adoption of IFRS 15 is not expected to lead to a restatement of the 2017 consolidated income statement in the 2018 Annual Report.
The Group will adopt IFRS 15 on 1 January 2018 using the retrospective approach.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments will be effective in the consolidated financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2018 with a transition date of 1 January 2017.
The Group has reviewed the differences between IFRS 9 and the current accounting policies which comply with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and has determined that the only notable change affecting the Group is that IFRS 9 provides a new expected credit loss impairment model for financial assets.
During the year the Group carried out an assessment of the impact of adopting the expected credit loss impairment model for financial assets particularly on the provision for trade receivables and has determined that it will not have a material impact on the overall level of provisioning.
Based on the Groups overall assessment, the application of IFRS 9 is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Groups consolidated results or financial position.
Therefore the adoption of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018 is not expected to lead to a restatement of the 2017 results in the 2018 Annual Report.
IFRS 16 Leases will be effective in the consolidated financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2019.
The Group will adopt IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019 and intends to use the modified retrospective approach to transition utilising the practical expedients outlined in the standard.
To prepare for the transition to this new accounting standard, data has been collated on all of the Groups leases which are principally for warehouses, offices and vehicles.
Based on the Groups assessment, which is ongoing, the application of IFRS 16 will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
The new standard will require that the Group's leased assets are recorded within property, plant and equipment as 'right of use assets' with a corresponding lease liability which is based on the discounted value of the cash payments required under each lease.
Whilst the actual impact will not be known until IFRS 16 is adopted on 1 January 2019, using projections based on leases in place at 31 December 2017 and assuming an adoption date of 1 January 2017, it is currently estimated that adoption of IFRS 16 would increase the carrying value of property, plant and equipment at 31 December 2017 by between 350 million and 400 million, with liabilities increasing by between 450 million and 500 million.
The existing operating lease expense, currently recorded in operating costs, will be replaced by a depreciation charge, which will be lower than the current operating lease expense, and a separate financing expense, which will be recorded in interest expense.
It is currently estimated that there will be a small positive impact on profit before tax but there will be no net cash flow impact arising from the new standard.
Net debt to EBITDA being earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, customer relationships and software amortisation and acquisition related items calculated at average exchange rates will increase by approximately 0.2 times but current banking covenants will be unaffected.
The Group does not currently intend to alter its approach as to whether assets should be leased or bought going forward.
Apart from these three standards, the Group does not anticipate that any other new or revised standards and interpretations currently issued by the IASB that will be effective from 1 January 2018 and beyond will have a material impact on its consolidated results or financial position.
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2017 105 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 106 Financial statements NOTES CONTINUED 2 Accounting policies The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.
a Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group is either exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
A list of all of Bunzl plcs subsidiary undertakings is included in the Related undertakings note in the Shareholder information section on pages 155 to 157 and is subject to audit.
The results of all of the subsidiary undertakings are included in full in these consolidated financial statements.
ii Business combinations The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date.
The consideration paid or payable in respect of acquisitions comprises amounts paid on completion and deferred consideration, excluding payments which are contingent on the continued employment of former owners of businesses acquired.
The excess of the consideration excluding payments contingent on future employment over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Payments that are contingent on future employment and transaction costs and expenses such as professional fees are charged to the income statement.
When less than 100% of a subsidiary is acquired, the Group measures the present ownership component of the non-controlling interest at fair value at the acquisition date which means that goodwill includes a portion attributable to the non-controlling interest.
When an acquisition of less than 100% of a subsidiary also includes an option to purchase the remaining share of the subsidiary, the anticipated acquisition method is applied, where judged appropriate to do so, meaning that no non-controlling interest is recognised.
A liability is carried on the balance sheet equal to the fair value of the option and this is revised to fair value at each reporting date with differences being recorded in acquisition related items in the income statement.
iii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
b Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement, unless they qualify for cash flow or net investment hedge accounting treatment, in which case the effective portion is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses of foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates.
All resulting exchange differences, including exchange differences arising from the translation of borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such balances, are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve.
Differences that have arisen since 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented in this separate component of equity.
c Revenue The Group is principally engaged in the delivery of goods to customers.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement upon delivery of the relevant goods which is the point in time at which the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred.
Revenue is not recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due.
Revenue is valued at invoiced amounts, excluding sales taxes, less estimated provisions for returns and trade discounts where relevant.
Returns provisions and early settlement discounts are based on experience over an appropriate period whereas volume discounts are based on agreements with customers.
d Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold consists of the cost of the inventories sold or disposed of in the period where the cost of inventories is net of supplier rebate income related to those inventories.

Provisions 7.5 3.0 Retirement benefit obligations 8.3 9.0 i Property, plant and equipment Other 1.6 2.4 Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
The carrying values of 28.9 28.0 property, plant and equipment are periodically reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.

Bu Bun nz zl plc A l plc An nnu nual al Report 201 Report 2017 7 107 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 108 Financial statements NOTES CONTINUED 2 Accounting policies continued k Intangible assets i Goodwill Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method.
As permitted by IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group chose to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations from 1 January 2004 and elected not to restate previous business combinations.
For acquisitions made before 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the amount previously recorded under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
For acquisitions that occurred between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009, goodwill represents the cost of the business combination in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
For acquisitions that have occurred on or after 1 January 2010, goodwill represents the cost of the business combination excluding payments contingent on future employment, and transaction costs and expenses in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and is tested annually for impairment.
Negative goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised immediately in the income statement.
ii Customer relationships Customer relationships intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised on acquisition and recorded at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, customer relationships intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives which range from 10 to 19 years.
iii Software Software is stated at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.
The carrying value of software is periodically reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives which range from three to seven years.
l Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed annually to determine if there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amounts are estimated.
The recoverable amounts of assets carried at amortised cost are calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at appropriate pre-tax discount rates.
The recoverable amounts of other assets are the greater of their fair value less the costs of disposal and the value in use.
In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present values using appropriate pre-tax discount rates.
Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, with impairment losses being recognised in the income statement.
m Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out principle and comprises the purchase price, net of any related supplier volume rebates, plus import duties and other taxes, inbound freight and haulage costs and other related costs incurred to bring the product into its present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated cost of completion and estimated cost necessary to make the sale.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
n Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are initially measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition these assets are measured at amortised cost less any impairment losses.
A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables or uncertainty as to whether the Group will be able to collect all such amounts.
o Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value including any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition these liabilities are measured at amortised cost.

schemes are recognised on the balance sheet as a defined benefit pension asset or a defined benefit pension liability based on the difference between the fair value of pension scheme assets and the present value of pension scheme liabilities.
Bu Bun nz zl plc A l plc An nnu nual al Report 201 Report 2017 7 109 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 110 Financial statements NOTES CONTINUED 2 Accounting policies continued The present value of pension scheme liabilities are calculated by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted using the rate applicable to AA rated corporate bonds that have a similar maturity and currency to the pension scheme liabilities.
The fair value of any pension scheme assets at bid price are deducted from the present value of pension scheme liabilities to determine the net deficit or surplus of each scheme.
Remeasurements arising from defined benefit pension schemes comprise actuarial gains and losses on pension scheme liabilities and the actual return on pension scheme assets excluding amounts already included in net interest.
The net actuarial gain or loss for the year is recorded in full in the statement of comprehensive income.
Current service cost, past service cost or gain and gains and losses on any settlements and curtailments are credited or charged to the income statement.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent benefits are already vested.
Net interest on the net defined benefit pension liability or asset is calculated by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit pension scheme deficit or surplus at the beginning of the year to the net defined benefit pension liability or asset at the beginning of the year.
Net interest is recorded within finance expense in the income statement.
When the valuation of a defined benefit pension scheme results in a surplus, the recognised defined benefit pension asset is limited to the present value of benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the pension scheme or reductions in future contributions and takes into account the adverse effect of any minimum funding requirements.
v Dividends The interim dividend is recognised in the statement of changes in equity in the period in which it is paid and the final dividend in the period in which it is approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
w Alternative performance measures Further to the various performance measures defined under IFRS, the Group reports a number of alternative performance measures that are designed to assist with the understanding of the underlying performance of the Group and its businesses.
These measures are not defined under IFRS and, as a result, do not comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Practice and are therefore known as alternative performance measures and may not be directly comparable with other companies alternative performance measures.
They are not designed to be a substitute for any of the IFRS measures of performance.
The principal alternative performance measures used within the consolidated financial statements and the location of the reconciliations to equivalent IFRS measures are: adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before income tax and adjusted profit for the year as reconciled on the face of the consolidated income statement : effective tax rate, being tax on adjusted profit as a percentage of adjusted profit before income tax as shown in Note 6 : adjusted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share as reconciled in Note 7 : cash conversion % operating cash flow, as reconciled on the face of the consolidated cash flow statement, to adjusted operating profit : return on average operating capital % the ratio of adjusted operating profit to the average of the month end operating capital employed being property, plant and equipment, software, inventories and trade and other receivables less trade and other payables : and return on invested capital % the ratio of adjusted operating profit to the average of the month end invested capital being equity after adding back net debt, defined benefit pension scheme liabilities, cumulative customer relationships amortisation, acquisition related items and amounts written off goodwill, net of the associated tax.
These measures exclude the charge for customer relationships amortisation, acquisition related items and any associated tax, where relevant.
Acquisition related items comprise deferred consideration charges relating to the retention of former owners of businesses acquired, transaction costs and expenses and adjustments to previously estimated earn outs.
Customer relationships amortisation, acquisition related items and any associated tax are items which are not taken into account by management when assessing the results of the business as they are considered by management to form part of the total spend on acquisitions or are non-cash items resulting from acquisitions and therefore do not relate to the underlying operating performance and distort comparability between businesses and between reporting periods.
Accordingly, these items are removed in calculating the profitability measures by which management assess the performance of the Group.
Other alternative performance measures, including the Groups key performance indicators which are set out and defined on pages 22 and 23, are used to monitor the performance of the Group and a number of these are based on, or derived from, the alternative performance measures noted above.
All alternative performance measures have been calculated consistently with the methods applied in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016.
Growth rates at constant exchange rates are calculated by retranslating the results for the year ended 31 December 2016 at the average rates for the year ended 31 December 2017 so that they can be compared without the distorting impact of changes caused by foreign exchange translation.

Bank loans are drawn for various periods of up to three months at interest rates linked to LIBOR.
The interest rate risk on the floating rate debt is managed using interest rate options.
Borrowings with a notional principal of 150.0m were capped at 31 December 2017 31 December 2016: 101.3m.
Hedge accounting is not applied to the interest rate caps since the majority of their value is related to time value.

Level two fair value measurements use inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the relevant asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities stated at fair value have been determined by discounting expected future cash flows, translated at the appropriate balance sheet date exchange rates and adjusted for counterparty or own credit risk as applicable.
At 31 December 2017 the fair values, based on unadjusted market data, of the US private placement notes, was 1,158.2m 2016: 1,304.7m and of the senior unsecured bond was 304.4m 2016: nil.
For other financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value, including cash at bank and in hand, bank loans and overdrafts, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, their carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value due to their short term nature.
Bank loans are priced based on floating interest rates and the credit spread has not changed since the inception of the loan.
However, within other payables there is 12.0m 2016: 7.1m related to earn outs on businesses acquired which are recorded at fair value.
This is a level three fair value which is initially measured based on the expected future profitability of the businesses acquired at the acquisition date and subsequently reassessed at each reporting date based on the most recent data available on the expected profitability of the businesses acquired.

Bu Bun nz zl plc A l plc An nnu nual al Report 201 Report 2017 7 131 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 132 Financial statements NOTES CONTINUED 20 Retirement benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement benefit schemes in the US, the UK and elsewhere in Europe including France, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland.
The funds of the principal defined benefit schemes are administered by trustees and are held independently from the Group.
Pension costs of defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Contributions to all schemes are determined in line with actuarial advice and local conditions and practices.
Scheme assets for the purpose of IAS 19 Employee Benefits are stated at their bid value.
Characteristics of defined benefit pension schemes UK The UK defined benefit scheme is a contributory defined benefit pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The scheme has been closed to new members since 2003.
The valuation of the UK defined benefit pension scheme has been updated to 31 December 2017 by the Groups actuaries.
The UK scheme is an HMRC registered pension scheme and is subject to standard UK pensions and tax law.
This means that the payment of contributions and benefits are subject to the appropriate tax treatments and restrictions and the scheme is subject to the scheme funding requirements outlined in section 224 of the Pensions Act 2004.
In accordance with UK trust and pensions law, the pension scheme has a corporate trustee.
Although the Company bears the financial cost of the scheme, the responsibility for the management and governance of the scheme lies with the trustee, which has a duty to act in the best interest of members at all times.
The assets of the scheme are held in trust by the trustee who consults with the Company on investment strategy decisions.
The trustees, in agreement with the Company, have hedging in place to reduce the impact of inflation and interest rate movements on the funding of the plan.
The last full triennial valuation on the UK defined benefit pension scheme was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 5 April 2015 and showed that there was a deficit on the agreed funding basis.
To address the deficit, the Company has agreed to contribute an additional 5.5m per year from April 2016 to 30 June 2022.
US The principal US defined benefit pension scheme is a non-contributory defined benefit pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The valuation of the US defined benefit pension scheme has been updated to 31 December 2017 by the Groups actuaries.
The US scheme is a qualified pension scheme and is subject to standard regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act 1974, the Pension Protection Act 2006 and the Department of Labor and Internal Revenue reporting requirements.
The scheme pays annual premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to insure the benefits of the scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held in trust by an independent custodian.
The Company has established a Retirement Scheme Investment Committee.
The members of the Committee are the scheme fiduciaries and, as such, are ultimately responsible for the management of the scheme assets.
The Committee performs the oversight function and delegates the day-to-day management process to appropriate staff.
A registered investment adviser advises the Committee regarding the investment of scheme assets.
A fide-risking strategy has been agreed for the scheme to reduce the mismatch between the assets and liabilities, whereby investments are switched from return seeking assets to liability matching assets as the funding improves, based on pre-agreed triggers.
Annual actuarial valuations are performed on the US defined benefit scheme.
The last annual review was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 1 January 2017 and showed that there was a required annual contribution of $5.2m.
In 2018, the Group plans to contribute $8.0m for the 2017 plan year to cover prudently this required contribution and anticipate future funding needs.
In 2017, the Group also paid a contribution of $8.0m for the 2016 plan year.
The annual review as at 1 January 2018 is ongoing.

Part of the Groups strategy is to grow through acquisition.
The Group has developed a process to assist with the identification of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the separate identification of intangible assets in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
This formal process is applied to each acquisition and involves an assessment of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with assistance provided by external valuation specialists where appropriate.
Until this assessment is complete, the allocation period remains open up to a maximum of 12 months from the relevant acquisition date.
At 31 December 2017 the allocation period for all acquisitions completed since 1 January 2017 remained open and accordingly the fair values presented are provisional.
Adjustments are made to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the allocation period to the extent that further information and knowledge come to light that more accurately reflect conditions at the acquisition date.
To date the adjustments made have impacted assets acquired to reflect more accurately the estimated realisable or settlement value.
Similarly, adjustments have been made to acquired liabilities to record onerous commitments or other commitments existing at the acquisition date but not recognised by the acquiree.
Adjustments have also been made to reflect the associated tax effects.
The consideration paid or payable in respect of acquisitions comprises amounts paid on completion, deferred consideration and payments which are contingent on the retention of former owners of businesses acquired.
IFRS 3 requires that any payments that are contingent on future employment, including payments which are contingent on the retention of former owners of businesses acquired, are charged to the income statement.
All other consideration has been allocated against the identified net assets, with the balance recorded as goodwill.
Transaction costs and expenses such as professional fees are charged to the income statement.
The acquisitions provide opportunities for further development of the Groups activities and create enhanced returns.
Such opportunities and the workforces inherent in each of the acquired businesses do not translate to separately identifiable intangible assets but do represent much of the assessed value that supports the recognised goodwill.
For each of the businesses acquired during the year, the name of the business, the market sector served, its location and date of acquisition, as well as the estimated annualised revenue it would have contributed to the Group for the year if such acquisitions had been made at the beginning of the year, are separately disclosed.
The remaining disclosures required by IFRS 3 are provided separately for those individual acquisitions that are considered to be material and in aggregate for individually immaterial acquisitions.
An acquisition would generally be considered individually material if the impact on the Groups revenue or profit measures on an annualised basis or the relevant amounts on the balance sheet is greater than 5%.
Management also applies judgement in considering whether there are any material qualitative differences from other acquisitions made.
