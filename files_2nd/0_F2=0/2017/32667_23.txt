Accounting for subsidiaries The Companys investments are made through a number of SPVs refer to note 24 which are domiciled in the UK.
The Company does not hold equity interests inthese SPVs, the Investment Adviser holds a nominal equity position in each SPV and operates the SPVs on a day-to-day basis.
The Company owns 100% of theloan notes issued by the SPVs with the exception of GCP Rooftop Solar 6 Limited 37.7% and FHW Dalmore Salford Pendleton Housing Plc 13.2%.
The Directors have made an assessment in regard to whether the Company controls the SPVs and whether the SPVs meet the definition of subsidiary companies inaccordance with the definition of IFRS 10.
The Directors have made an assessment on whether the Company as an investor controls the SPVs under each ofthe criteria within IFRS 10.
The Directors are of the opinion that the Company demonstrates all three of the criteria for all SPVs which therefore determines these SPVs to be considered subsidiary companies within the definition of IFRS 10, with the exception of GCP Rooftop Solar 6 Limited and Salford Pendleton Housing Limited, which are considered to be associates as the Company has significant influence over the relevant activities of the SPV through similar arrangements.
Assessment as an investment entity Entities that meet the definition of an investment entity within IFRS 10 are required to measure their subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss rather than consolidate the entities.
The criteria which define an investment entity are as follows: an entity that obtains funds from one or more investors for the purpose of providing those investors with investment services: an entity that commits to its investors that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income or both: and an entity that measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis.
The Directors have concluded that the Company continues to meet the characteristics of an investment entity, in that it has more than one investor and its investors are not related parties: holds a portfolio of investments, predominantly in the form of loan securities which generates returns through interest income and capital appreciation: the Company reports to its investors via quarterly investor information and to its management, via internal management reports, on a fair value basis.
All investments are reported at fair value to the extent allowed by IFRS in the Companys annual reports.
76 Financial statements GCP INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS LIMITED Annual report and financial statements 2017 Accounting policy Holdings of the loan notes held by the Company are shown as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss in the statement of financial position whichin the opinion of the Directors represent the fair value of the SPVs as any other net assets held in the SPVs at year end are immaterial.
The Company recognises a financial asset or a financial liability when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace are recognised on the trade date, i. e. the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
A financial asset or, where applicable apart of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised where: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: and either a the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset but has transferred control of the asset.
When the Company transfers its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Companys continuing involvement in the asset.
The Company derecognises a financial liability when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expired.
Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value.
All transaction costs for such instruments are recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income.
After initial measurement, the Company measures financial instruments which are classified as fair value through profit or loss at fair value.
Subsequentchanges in the fair value of those financial instruments are recorded in profit or loss of the statement of comprehensive income.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
For all other financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined by using appropriate valuation techniques.
Valuation techniques include using recent arms length market transactions, referenced to appropriate current market data, and discounted cashflow analysis, at all times making as much use of available and supportable market data as possible.
An analysis of fair values of financial instruments and further details as to how they are measured are provided in note 18.

18.1 Capital management The Company is funded from equity balances, comprising issued ordinary share capital as detailed in note 16 and retained earnings, as well as a revolving creditfacility, as detailed in note 15.
The Company may seek to raise additional capital from time to time to the extent that the Directors and the Investment Adviser believe the Company will be ableto make suitable investments.
The Company raises capital on a highly conservative basis only when it has a clear view of a robust pipeline of highly advanced investment opportunities.
Additional capital was raised during the year as disclosed in note 16.
The Company may borrow up to 20% of its NAV as at such time any such borrowings are drawn down.
At the year end, borrowings amounted to 3.4% of NAV 2016: 3.7%.
18.2 Financial risk management objectives The Company has an investment policy and strategy, as summarised in its prospectus dated 28 March 2017, that sets out its overall investment strategy and its general risk management philosophy and has established processes to monitor and control these in a timely and accurate manner.
These guidelines are the subject of regular operational reviews undertaken by the Investment Adviser to ensure that the Companys policies are adhered to as it is the Investment Advisers duty to identify and assist in the control of risk.
The Investment Adviser reports regularly to the Directors who have ultimate responsibility for the overallrisk management approach.
The Investment Adviser and the Directors ensure that all investment activity is performed in accordance with the investment guidelines.
The Companys investment activities expose it to various types of risks that are associated with the financial instruments and markets in which it invests.
Risk is inherent in the Companys activities and it is managed through a process of ongoing identification, measurement and monitoring.
The financial risks to which the Company is exposed include market risk which includes other price risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
82 Financial statements GCP INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS LIMITED Annual report and financial statements 2017 18.3 Market risk There is a risk that market movements in interest rates, credit markets and observable yields may decrease or increase the fair value of the Companys financial assets without regard to the assets underlying performance.
The fair value of the Companys financial assets is measured and monitored on a quarterly basis bythe Investment Adviser with the assistance of the Valuation Agent.
The Valuation Agent considers the movements in comparable credit markets and publicly available information around each project in assessing the expected future cash flows from each investment.
The valuation principles used are based on a discounted cash flow methodology.
A fair value for each asset acquired by the Company is calculated by applying arelevant market discount rate to the contractual cash flows expected to arise from each asset.
The Valuation Agent determines the discount rates that it believes the market would reasonably apply to each investment taking into account, inter alia, the following significant inputs: Pound Sterling interest rates: movements of comparable credit markets: and observable yields on other comparable instruments.
In addition, the following are also considered as part of the overall valuation process: general infrastructure market activity and investor sentiment: and changes to the economic, legal, taxation or regulatory environment.
The Valuation Agent exercises its judgement in assessing the expected future cash flows from each investment.
Given that the investments of the Company aregenerally fixed-income debt instruments in some cases with elements of inflation protection or other investments with a similar economic effect, the focusof the Valuation Agent is on assessing the likelihood of any interruptions to the debt service payments, in light of the operational performance of the underlying asset.
The valuations are reviewed by the Investment Adviser and the Directors and the subsequent NAV is reviewed and approved by the Directors on a quarterly basis.
The table below shows how changes in discount rates affect the changes in the valuation of financial assets at fair value.
The range of discount rates used reflects the Investment Advisers view of a reasonable expectation of valuation movements across the portfolio in a twelve-month period.
30 September 2017 Change in discount rates 0.50% 0.25% 0.00% 0.25% 0.50% Value of financial assets at fair value 000 866,216 882,460 899,258 916,638 934,626 Change in value of financial assets at fair value 000 33,042 16,798 17,380 35,368 As at 30 September 2017, the discount rates used in the valuation of financial assets ranged from 6.50% to 10.38%.

Financial instruments continued 18.4 Interest rate risk Interest rate risk has the following effect: Fair value of financial assets Interest rates are one of the factors which the Valuation Agent takes into account when valuing the financial assets.
Future cash flows The Company primarily invests in senior and subordinated debt instruments of infrastructure Project Companies.
The financial assets have fixed interest rate coupons, albeit with some inflation protection and as such movements in interest rates will not directly affect the future cash flows payable to the Company.
Interest rate hedging may be carried out to seek to provide protection against falling interest rates in relation to assets that do not have a minimum fixed rate ofreturn acceptable to the Company in line with its investment policy and strategy.
Where the debt instrument is subordinated, the Company is indirectly exposed to the gearing of the infrastructure Project Companies.
The Investment Adviser ensures as part of its due diligence that the Project Company debt ranking senior to the Companys investment has been hedged against movement in interest rates where appropriate, through the use of interest rate swaps.
Borrowings During the year the Company made use of its Facility with RBSI, which was used to finance investments made by the Company.
Details of the RBSI Facility are given in note 15.
Any potential financial impact of movements in interest rates on the cost of borrowings to the Company is mitigated by the short-term nature of such borrowings.
18.5 Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company.
The assets classified at fair value through profit or loss do not have a published credit rating, however, the Investment Adviser monitors the financial position and performance of the Project Companies on a regular basis to ensure that credit risk is appropriately managed.
The Company is exposed to differing levels of credit risk on all its assets.
Per the statement of financial position, the Companys total exposure to credit risk is 907 million 2016: 752 million being the balance of total assets less prepayments.
As explained in note 14, cash is held at a number of financial institutions tospread credit risk, with cash awaiting investment being held on behalf of the Company at banks which carry a minimum rating of A-1, P-1 or F1 from Standard& Poors, Moodys or Fitch respectively or in one or more similarly rated money market or short-dated gilt funds.
Before an investment decision is made, the Investment Adviser performs extensive due diligence complemented by professional third party advisers, including technical advisers, financial and legal advisers and valuation and insurance experts.
After an investment is made the Investment Adviser uses detailed cash flow forecasts to assess the continued creditworthiness of Project Companies and their ability to pay all costs as they fall due.
The forecasts are regularly updated with information provided by the Project Companies in order to monitor ongoing financial performance.
The Project Companies receive a significant portion of revenue from government departments and public sector or local authority clients.
The Project Companies are also reliant on their subcontractors, particularly facilities managers, continuing to perform their service delivery obligations such that revenues are not disrupted.
The credit standing of each significant subcontractor is monitored on an ongoing basis and period end significant exposures are reported to the Directors quarterly.
The concentration of credit risk to any individual project did not exceed 10% 2016: 10% of the Companys portfolio as at the year end.
The Investment Adviser also monitors the concentration of risk based upon the nature of each underlying project.
The concentration of credit risk associated with counterparties is deemed to be low.
The counterparties are typically public sector entities which generate pre-determined, long-term, public sector backed revenues in the form of subsidy payments FiT and ROCs payments for renewables transactions, unitary charge payments for PFI transactions or lease payments for social housing projects.
In the view of the Investment Adviser and the Board, the UK Government has both the ability and willingness to satisfy its obligations to these public sector entities.
The credit risk associated with each Project Company is further mitigated because the cash flows receivable are secured over the assets of the ProjectCompany, which in turn has security over the assets of the underlying projects.
The debt instruments held by the Company are held at fair value, andthecredit riskassociated with these investments is one of the factors which the Valuation Agent takes into account when valuing the financial assets.
84 Financial statements GCP INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS LIMITED Annual report and financial statements 2017 The Investment Adviser regularly monitors the concentration of risk based upon the nature of each underlying project to ensure appropriate diversification andrisk remains within acceptable parameters.
Changes in credit risk affect the discount rates.
The sensitivity of the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is disclosed on page83.
The Directors have assessed the credit quality of the portfolio at the year end and based on the parameters set out above are satisfied that the credit quality remains within an acceptable range for long-dated debt.
18.6 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
Exposure to liquidity risk arises because of the possibility that the Company could be required to pay its liabilities earlier than expected.
The Companys objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank deposits and interest bearing loans and borrowings.
The following table analyses all of the Companys assets and liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from 30 September 2017 to the contractual maturity date.
The Directors have elected to present both assets and liabilities in the liquidity disclosure below to illustrate the net liquidity exposure of the Company.

Financial instruments continued 18.7 Fair values of financial assets Basis of determining fair value The Valuation Agent carries out quarterly fair valuations of the financial assets of the Company.
These valuations are reviewed by the Investment Adviser and theDirectors and thesubsequent NAV is reviewed and approved by the Directors on a quarterly basis.
The basis for the Valuation Agents valuations is described in note 18.3.
Fair value measurements Investments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following fair value hierarchy levels depending on whether their fair value is based on: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly derivedfromprices : and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
An investment is always categorised as Level 1, 2 or 3 in its entirety.
In certain cases, the fair value measurement for an investment may use a number of different inputs that fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
In such cases, an investment level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgement and is specific to the investment.
The Company recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
The table below summarises all securities held by the Company based on the fair valuation technique adopted: 30 September 30 September Fair value 2017 2016 hierarchy 000 000 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Loan notes Level 2 659,966 520,296 Loan notes Level 3 239,292 179,386 The Directors have classified the financial instruments as Level 2 or Level 3 depending on whether or not there is a consistent data set of comparable and observable market transactions.
Due to the limited number of comparable and observable market transactions, the Directors have classified the Companys investments in biomass projects as Level 3.
Discount rates between 7.2% and 10.3% were applied to the investments categorised as Level 3.
86 Financial statements GCP INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS LIMITED Annual report and financial statements 2017 The following table shows a reconciliation of all movements in the fair value of financial instruments categorised within Level 3 between the beginning and end of the year: 30 September 30 September 2017 2016 000 000 Opening balance 179,386 165,431 Purchases 63,633 29,827 Repayments 6,370 7,125 Unrealised gain on investments at fair value through profit or loss 7,498 1,081 Unrealised loss on investments at fair value through profit or loss 4,855 9,828 Closing balance 239,292 179,386 For the Companys financial instruments categorised as Level 3, changing the discount rates used to value the underlying instruments alters the fair value.
Achange in the discount rates used to value the Level 3 investments would have the following effect on profit before tax: 30 September 2017 Level 3 0.50% 0.25% 0.00% 0.25% 0.50% Valuation of financial assets at fair value 000 232,036 235,618 239,292 243,062 246,930 Change in valuation of financial assets at fair value 000 7,256 3,674 3,770 7,638 30 September 2016 Level 3 0.50% 0.25% 0.00% 0.25% 0.50% Valuation of financial assets at fair value 000 173,882 176,600 179,386 182,245 185,176 Change in valuation of financial assets at fair value 000 5,504 2,786 2,859 5,790 In determining the discount rates for calculating the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, movements to Pound Sterling interest rates, comparable credit markets and the observable yield on comparable instruments could give rise to changes in the discount rates.
The Directors consider the inputs used in the valuation of investments and the appropriateness of their classification in the fair value hierarchy.
In particular the Directors are satisfied that significant inputs into the discount rates, other than in respect of biomass investments as noted on page 86, are market observable.
Should the valuation approach change causing an investment to meet the characteristics of a different level of the fair value hierarchy, it will be reclassified accordingly.
During the period there were no transfers of investments between levels therefore, no further disclosure is considered necessary by the Directors.
