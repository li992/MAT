FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017 Notes to the financialstatements Notes to the financial For the year ended 30 September 2017 statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation Shaftesbury PLC the Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The address of the registered office is given on page 103.
The Company is the ultimate parent company of the Shaftesbury PLC Group the Group.
The Company has not presented its own Statement of Comprehensive Income, as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company made a profit of 57.7 million 2016: 282.9 million in the year.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRIC and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared in Pounds Sterling and under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investment properties and derivative financial instruments.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors affecting performance, financial position and future development are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 64.
The financial position of the Group including cash flow, liquidity, borrowings, undrawn facilities and debt maturity analysis is set out on pages 54 to 57.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months from the date these financial statements were approved.
Therefore, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Critical judgements, assumptions and estimates The Groups significant accounting policies are stated below.
Not all of these significant accounting policies require the directors to make difficult, subjective or complex judgements or estimates.
However, the directors consider the valuation of investment properties to be critical because of the level of complexity, judgement or estimation involved and its impact on the financial statements.
These judgements involve assumptions or estimates in respect of future events.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The Groups wholly-owned portfolio is valued by its external valuers, Cushman & Wakefield.
Knight Frank LLP value the investment properties owned by the Longmartin joint venture.
The valuations are used as the basis for the fair value of investment properties.
The valuation of the Groups property portfolio is inherently subjective due to, among other factors, the individual nature of each property, its location and the expected future rental income.
As a result, the valuations the Group places on its property portfolio are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate, particularly in periods of volatility or low transaction flow in the commercial property market.
Cushman & Wakefield and Knight Frank LLP make a number of assumptions in forming their opinion on the valuation of our investment properties, which are detailed in the Basis of Valuation on pages 142 to 143.
These assumptions are in accordance with the RICS Valuation - Global Standards.
However, if any assumptions made by the external valuers prove to be incorrect, this may mean that the value of the Groups properties differs from their valuation reported in the financial statements, which could have a material effect on the Groups financial position.
See note 9 for further information.
New accounting standards and interpretations a T he following amendments to existing Standards and Interpretations were relevant to the Group and mandatory for the first time for the financial year ended 30 September 2017: STANDARD OR INTERPRETATION EFFECTIVE FROM Annual Improvements 2012-2014 1 January 2016 Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint arrangements on acquisition of an interest in a joint operation 1 January 2016 Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 on depreciation and amortisation 1 January 2016 Amendments to IAS 27 Separate financial statements on equity accounting 1 January 2016 Amendments to IFRS 10, 12 and IAS 28 on consolidation for investment entities 1 January 2016 Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements disclosure initiative 1 January 2016 No material changes to accounting policies arose as a result of these amendments.
118 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017 1 Accounting policies continued Notes to the b T he following new Standards and amendments to existing Standards are relevant to the Group, are not yet effective in the year ended 30 September 2017 and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements: STANDARD OR INTERPRETATION EFFECTIVE FROM financialstatements Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of cash flows - disclosure initiative 1 January 2017 Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification of share-based payment transactions 1 January 2018 For the year ended 30 September 2017 IFRS 9 Financial instruments 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments This standard deals with, amongst other things, the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
Having carried out an assessment of the standard, the Group believes the main impact will be the measurement and presentation of trade receivables in the Group financial statements, and balances due from subsidiaries in the Company financial statements.
Having considered expected credit losses and sources of forward-looking data, we do not currently expect any impact will be material.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers This standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control passes to a customer.
In our case, the standard is most applicable to the recognition point for service charge income and disposals of investment properties.
As the standard excludes rental income, which falls within the scope of IFRS 16 Leases, it is not expected that IFRS 15 will have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
There may be changes to presentation and disclosure.
IFRS 16 - Leases For operating leases in excess of one year, this standard requires lessees to recognise a right-of-use asset and a related lease liability representing the obligation to make lease payments.
The right-of-use asset is assessed for impairment annually and is amortised on a straight-line basis.
The lease liability is amortised using the effective interest method.
Lessor accounting is substantially unchanged from current accounting.
Therefore, since the Group is primarily a lessor, this standard does not significantly impact the Groups financial statements.
However, for the Company, it will result in the recognition of a right-to-use asset and corresponding lease liability, which we estimate at approximately 3 million, in the year when the standard becomes effective.
c There are no other Standards or Interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company is exposed to variable returns and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
The accounting policies of the subsidiaries are consistent with those adopted by the Group.
In the Companys Balance Sheet, investments in subsidiaries are included at cost less any provision in respect of impairment loss.
Net property income Revenue comprises rents receivable from tenants under operating leases, recognised on an accruals basis, and recoverable expenses incurred on behalf of tenants, where the Group acts as principal.
Rents are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Value added tax is excluded from all amounts.
Income arising as a result of rent reviews is recognised when agreement of new terms is reasonably certain.
Premiums receivable from tenants to surrender their lease obligations are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The cost of any incentives given to lessees to enter into leases is spread on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable period of the lease, being the earlier of its expiry date or the date of the first break option.
Lease incentives are usually in the form of rent-free periods.
Irrecoverable property costs are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income when they arise.
Employee benefits Share-based remuneration The cost of granting share options to employees is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income based on the fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value of the net asset value non-market based vesting condition is calculated when the options are granted, using the modified binomial option pricing model.
At the end of each reporting period, the directors review their estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on actual and forecast net asset values.
The impact of any revision to original estimates is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The fair value of the total shareholder return market based vesting condition is calculated when the options are granted using the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model, using various assumptions as set out in note 20.
The fair value is charged on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
No adjustment is made to the original estimate for market based conditions after the date of grant, regardless of whether the options vest or not.
The amount charged in the Statement of Comprehensive Income is credited to the share-based payments reserve.
Following the exercise of share options, the charges previously recognised in respect of those options are released from the share-based payments reserve to retained earnings.
Pension contributions Payments to defined contribution plans are charged as an expense to the Statement of Comprehensive Income as they fall due.
119 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017 1 Accounting policies continued Investment properties Investment properties are initially recognised on acquisition at cost, including related acquisition costs, and are revalued annually to reflect fair value.
Fair value is determined either by external professional valuers or by the directors in the case of properties sold shortly after the period end.
The fair value, as determined by the valuers, is reduced for any unamortised lease incentive balances.
Gains or losses arising on the revaluation of investment properties are included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Depreciation is not provided in respect of investment properties.
Additions to properties include costs of a capital nature only.
Expenditure is classified as capital when it results in future economic benefits which are expected to accrue to the Group.
All other property expenditure is written-off in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as incurred.
Premiums payable to tenants in connection with the surrender of their lease obligations are capitalised if they arise in connection with a value-enhancing project, otherwise they are recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Amounts received by way of compensation for dilapidations from tenants vacating properties are credited against the cost of reinstatement works.
Where the Group has no intention of carrying out such works, the amounts received are credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Purchases and sales of investment properties are recognised in the financial statements when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred.
All of the Groups leases to its tenants are operating leases except where the Group grants long leasehold interests to tenants, in which case, as substantially allthe risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the tenant, the property is not recognised as an investment property.
Acquisitions Where properties are acquired through corporate acquisitions and there are no significant assets other than investment property and liabilities, and without a business being acquired, the acquisition is treated as an asset acquisition.
In all other cases, the acquisition is treated as a business combination.
Joint ventures Joint ventures are those entities over which the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The Group has one joint venture, the investment in which is accounted for using the equity method.
On initial recognition the investment was recognised at cost.
Subsequently, the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the Groups share of the profit or loss of, and dividends from, the joint venture.
The Groups investment in the joint venture is presented separately on the Balance Sheet and the Groups share of the joint ventures post-tax profit or loss for the year is also presented separately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Where there is an indication that the Groups investment in its joint venture may be impaired, the Group evaluates the recoverable amount of its investment, being the higher of the joint ventures fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
If the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
If the Groups share of losses in the joint venture equals or exceeds its investment in the joint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has legal or constructive obligations to make payments on behalf of the joint venture.
In the Companys Balance Sheet, the investment in its joint venture is stated at cost less any provision for impairment loss.
Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and trade payables are recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost, less any provision for impairment in respect of trade receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and on-demand bank deposits.
Cash held on deposit which has certain conditions restricting its use and is not available on demand, liquid or readily convertible, is classified within other receivables.
Borrowings and costs of raising finance Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction costs incurred and are subsequently held at amortised cost.
Issue costs and premiums are written-off to the Statement of Comprehensive Income using an effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments, comprising interest rate swaps for hedging purposes, are measured at fair value.
Movements in fair value are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Segmental information The Groups properties, which are all located in Londons West End, are managed as a single portfolio.
Its properties, which are of a similar type, are combined into villages.
All of the villages are geographically close to each other and have similar economic features and risks.
In view of the similar characteristics and the reporting of all investment, income and expenditure to the Board at an overall Group level, the aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8 have been applied to give one reportable segment.
The Board assesses the performance of the reportable segment based on net property income and investment property valuation.
Financial information provided to the Board is prepared on a basis consistent with these financial statements.

All properties were valued on the basis of fair value and highest and best use, in accordance with the RICS Valuation - Global Standards, which incorporate, the International Valuation Standards and the RICS UK Valuation Standards edition current at the valuation date and IFRS 13.
When considering a propertys highest and best use, the valuer considers its actual and potential uses which are physically, legally and financially viable.
Where the highest and best use differs from the existing use, the valuer considers the use a market participant would have in mind when formulating the price it would bid and reflects the cost and likelihood of achieving that use.
The fair value of the Groups investment properties has primarily been determined using a market approach, which provides an indication of value by comparing the subject asset with similar assets for which price information is available.
The external valuer uses information provided by the Group, such as tenancy information and capital expenditure expectations.
In deriving fair value, the valuer also makes a series of assumptions, using professional judgement and market observations.
These assumptions include equivalent yields and rental values ERVs applicable to the properties.
Equivalent yields are based on current market prices, depending on, inter alia, the location and use of the properties.
ERVs are calculated using a number of factors which include current rental income, market comparatives and occupancy levels.
Whilst there is market evidence for these inputs, and recent transaction prices for similar properties, there is still a significant element of estimation and judgement.
As a result of adjustments made to market observable data, these significant inputs are deemed unobservable.
Since the key inputs to the valuation are unobservable, the Group considers all its investment properties fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy in IFRS 13.
The Groups policy is to recognise transfers between hierarchy levels as at the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
There have been no transfers during the year 2016: none.
The key assumptions made by the valuers are set out in the Basis of Valuation on pages 142 to 143.
The major inputs to the external valuation are reviewed by the senior management team.
In addition, the valuer meets with external auditors and the Audit Committee.
Further details of the Audit Committees responsibilities in relation to valuations can be found in the Audit Committee Report on pages 82 to 84.
A summary of the Cushman & Wakefield report can be found on pages 144 to 145.
Fees were agreed at fixed amounts in advance of the valuations being carried out.
It is noted that Cushman & Wakefield acted as letting agents for Shaftesbury Carnaby PLC, Shaftesbury Soho Limited and Shaftesbury Chinatown PLC in the year.
The fees payable by the Group to Cushman & Wakefield do not constitute a significant part of their fee income.
123 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017 9 Investment properties continued Sensitivity analysis As noted in the critical judgements, assumptions and estimates section on page 118, the valuation of the Groups property portfolio is inherently subjective.
The Groups properties are all located in Londons West End and are virtually all multi-use buildings, usually configured with commercial uses on the lower floors and office and or residential uses on the upper floors.
Cushman & Wakefield value properties in their entirety and not by use, consequently the sensitivity analysis below has been performed on the Groups portfolio as a whole.

All other factors being equal, a higher equivalent yield would lead to a decrease in the valuation of a property, and an increase in the ERV would increase the capital value, and vice versa.
At 30 September 2017, the Group had capital commitments of 13.6 million 2016: 31.3 million.
See pages 48 to 49 for a discussion of the Groups property activity during the year.

The Groups trade and other payables are all due within one year 2016: all due within one year.
Amounts due from to subsidiaries have been restated at 30 September 2016 to present these balances on a gross basis.
Other financial instruments The Groups mortgage bonds and secured term loans are held at amortised cost in the Balance Sheet.
The fair value of these financial instruments is in excess of book value.
This excess, which is not recognised in the reported results for the year, is 16.2 million 2016: 52.5 million.
The fair values have been calculated based on a discounted cash flow model using the relevant reference gilt and appropriate market spread.
The valuation technique falls within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy in IFRS 13.
The fair values of the Groups and Companys cash and cash equivalents, and those financial instruments included within trade and other receivables, interest bearing borrowings excluding the mortgage bonds and the secured term loans, and trade and other payables are not materially different from the values at which they are carried in the financial statements.

The Group reviews the creditworthiness of potential tenants prior to entering into contractual arrangements.
Where appropriate, tenants are required to provide cash deposits to mitigate the potential loss in the event of default.
Deposits held are referred to in note 13.
The Group has a large and diverse tenant base so that tenant credit risk is widely spread.
Provision is made in full where recovery of financial assets is, in the opinion of the directors, uncertain.
The carrying amount of financial assets, net of provisions for impairment, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired are expected to be fully recoverable.
Where cash deposits are held, they are placed with one of the Groups existing facility providers.
Liquidity risk The Board keeps under review the Groups funding requirements, available facilities and covenant compliance to ensure it has sufficient funds available to meet its existing commitments and to extend its portfolio through investment and acquisition of additional properties.
The Groups policies regarding finance and its current financial position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 56 to 57.
Market risk Market risk arises from the Groups use of interest bearing financial instruments, and is the risk that future cash flows from financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and credit costs.
The Groups policy is to minimise market risk through long-term fixed rate debt.
The Board keeps under review the Groups market risk, particularly in light of expectations of future interest rate movements.
Interest rate risk At 30 September 2017, the Groups drawn borrowings consisted entirely of fixed rate debt.
Given this, the Groups exposure to changes in long-term interest rates and the potential impact on the Groups results and equity is considered to be insignificant.
This does not take into account valuation movements on the Groups investment properties as a result of movements in long-term interest rates, which would be reflected in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Capital risk management The capital structure of the Group consists of equity and net borrowings, including cash held on deposit.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings is set out in note 16 and the Groups equity structure is set out in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group regularly reviews its loan covenant compliance.
The Groups capital management objectives are to continue as a going concern and to provide enhanced shareholder returns whilst maintaining an appropriate risk reward balance to accommodate changing financial and operating market cycles.
The Groups capital structure such as levels of gearing and loan-to-value ratio are discussed in the Strategic Report on pages 56 to 57.

In accordance with EPRA recommendations, the adjustment for the fair value of derivatives at 30 September 2016 excludes those interest rate swaps which were cancelled in October 2016.
This is calculated using the drawn cost of borrowings of 2.99% 2016: 4.45% plus the cost of commitment fees on undrawn bank facilities of 0.69% 2016: 0.70%.
At 30 September 2017, the undrawn bank facilities totalled 275.0 million 2016: 59.3 million.
For total debt, the blended cost of debt is 3.26% 2016: 4.52% and includes the impact of our share of debt in our joint venture of 60 million 2016: 60 million, upon which interest is charged at 4.43% 2016: 4.43%.
