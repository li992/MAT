Each sensitivity considers each change in isolation and is calculated using the same methodology as used for the calculation of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the period.
The inflation sensitivity includes the impact of changes to the assumptions for the revaluation and pension increases.
In practice it is unlikely that the changes would occur in isolation.
During the year ending 31 May 2018 the Group expects to make cash contributions of 6.0m 2017: 6.0m to funded defined benefit plans.
