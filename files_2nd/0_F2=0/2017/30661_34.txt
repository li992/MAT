Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 1 Segment reporting IFRS 8 requires segment reporting to be based on the internal financial information reported to the chief operating decision maker.
The groups chief operating decision maker isdeemed to be the executive committee whose primary responsibility it is to manage the groups day-to-day operations and analyse trading performance.
The groups segments comprise Vanquis Bank, CCD, Moneybarn and Central which are those segments reported in the groups management accounts used by the executive committee as the primary means for analysing trading performance.
The executive committee assesses profit performance using profit before tax measured on a basis consistent with the disclosure inthegroup financial statements.

The intangible asset was calculated based on the discounted cash flows associated with Moneybarns core broker relationships and is being amortised over an estimated useful life of 10 years.
The amortisation charge in 2017 amounted to 7.5m 2016: 7.5m.
Exceptional items in 2017 comprise: 2017 m Estimated costs of settlement of the FCA investigation into ROP at Vanquis Bank: balance reduction applied to receivables in respect of existing customers 75.4 cash restitution to customers, higher expected future complaint costs, expenses and fine 96.7 Total Vanquis Bank 172.1 Estimated costs of settlement of the FCA investigation at Moneybarn: balance reduction applied to receivables in respect of existing customers 12.1 cash restitution to customers, fine and costs of administering redress 7.9 Total Moneybarn 20.0 CCD costs in respect of the migration to the new home credit operating model: redundancy, retention, training and consultancy costs 32.5 Total CCD 32.5 Total exceptional items 224.6 146 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Financial statements 1 Segment reporting continued On 27 February 2018, a resolution was reached with the FCA in respect of their investigation into ROP in Vanquis Bank.
The investigation concluded that Vanquis Bank did not adequately disclose in its sales calls that the charges for ROP would be treated as a purchase transaction and therefore potentially incur interest.
A settlement has been reached with the FCA to refund those customers with the interest element of ROP charges in the period between inception of the product in 2003 and the communication to ROP customers which was conducted in December 2016.
The total estimated cost of settlement amounts to 172.1m and comprises: i restitution to customers of 127.1m, comprising balance reductions to existing customers of 75.4m, being a gross balance reduction of 90.1m less release of impairment provisions of 14.7m, and cash settlements to customers of 51.7m: ii higher expected forward flow of ROP complaints more generally in respect of which compensation may have to be paid of 30.7m: iii administration costs of 12.3m: and iv the fine levied by the FCA of just under 2.0m.
The release of impairment provisions of 14.7m has been reflected as a credit to impairment with the remaining estimated costs of 186.8m being reflected within administrative and operating costs.
The FCA investigation into affordability, forbearance and termination options in Moneybarn is continuing.
Based on the work undertaken to date and the status of discussions with the FCA, the estimated cost of restitution and fine is estimated to be 20.0m of which 12.1m, comprising a gross balance reduction of 32.5m less release of impairment provisions of 20.4m, has been reflected as a reduction in receivables and 7.9m has been reflected as a provision in the 2017 year-end balance sheet.
The release of impairment provisions of 20.4m has been reflected as a credit to impairment with the remaining estimated costs of 40.4m being reflected within administrative and operating costs.
Costs of 32.5m have been incurred in 2017 in respect of the migration to the new home credit operating model and subsequent implementation of the recovery plan to re-establish relationships with customers and stabilise the operation following the poor execution of the migration.
The costs comprise 32.5m in respect of redundancy, retention, training and consultancy costs which are stated net of an exceptional pension credit of 3.9m associated with those employees made redundant who were part of the groups defined benefit pension scheme see note 19.
A net exceptional credit of 17.3m was recognised in 2016 comprising an exceptional gain of 20.2m in respect of Vanquis Banks interest in Visa Europe following completion of Visa Inc. s acquisition of Visa Europe on 21 June 2016 see note 15 and an exceptional impairment charge of 2.9m in respect of glos IT platform within CCD following the decision to develop guarantor loans as part of the wider Vanquis Bank loans proposition on a separate IT platform see note 11.
All of the above activities relate to continuing operations.
Revenue between business segments is not material.

The impact of this is a reduction in the notional allocation of group borrowings to CCD of 181.9m 2016: increase of 68.1m and an equivalent reduction 2016: increase in the notional cash allocated to central activities of the same amount.
Historically, the notional allocation has been to increase the borrowings of CCD.
However, following the significant losses incurred by CCD during 2017 the notional allocation is a reduction for the first time.
The intra-group elimination adjustment removes the notional allocation to state borrowings and cash on a consolidated group basis.
The groups businesses operate principally in the UK and Republic of Ireland.
The amortisation charge in 2016 included 2.6m of exceptional impairment in respect of glo software development costs held as an intangible assets within CCD.
The acquired intangible asset in respect of Moneybarns broker relationships is held on consolidation and, therefore, the amortisation charge has been allocated to central in the above analysis, consistent with the net asset analysis.
147 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Revenue Revenue is recognised by applying the effective interest rate EIR to the carrying value of a loan.
The EIR is calculated at inception and represents the rate which exactly discounts the future contractual cash receipts from a loan to the amount of cash advanced under that loan, plus directly attributable issue costs e. g. aggregator broker fees.
In addition, in CCD and Moneybarn the EIR takes account of customers repaying early.
Fee income is recognised at the time the charges are made to the customer on the basis the performance is complete.
As a result, the introduction of IFRS 15, effective from 1 January 2018, does not have a material impact on the group or company.
Group 2017 2016 m m Interest income 1,047.5 1,039.6 Fee income 148.8 143.6 Total revenue 1,196.3 1,183.2 All fee income earned relates to Vanquis Bank and Moneybarn.
Interest income relates to the interest charges on Vanquis Bank credit cards and Moneybarn conditional sale agreements together with the service charge on home credit and Satsuma loans.
Fee income relates to Vanquis Bank and Moneybarn and predominantly reflects default and over-limit fees as well as other ancillary income streams such as ROP fees within Vanquis Bank.
Interchange income is also recognised within Vanquis Bank as part of fee income on an accruals basis.
Fee income in 2017 represented 23% 2016: 24% of Vanquis Bank revenue and 1% of Moneybarn revenue.

This primarily reflects a lower average blended rate on retail deposits and the increased mix of retail deposits.
Retail deposits represent approximately 59% of the groups funding at the end of 2017 compared with approximately 51% in 2016.
The all-in blended cost of taking retail deposits in 2017, after the cost of holding a liquid assets buffer and other liquid resources in adherence with the PRAs liquidity regime, was 2.9% 2016: 3.0%.
Interest cover continues to be one of the groups banking covenants.
It is calculated as profit before tax and exceptional items, interest and amortisation divided by finance costs, excluding net hedge ineffectiveness, and has a minimum requirement of 2.0 times.
Interest cover, prior to exceptional items, in 2017 was 2.6 times compared with 5.2 times in 2016.
The reduction in this measure reflects the impact of the significant trading disruption within the home credit business during 2017.

Commission paid to self employed agents has reduced from 90.7m in 2016 to 46.9m in 2017 due to the change in operation model in the UK home credit operating model and the employment of customer experience managers CEMs from 6 July 2017.
The home credit business in ROI continues to operate a self employed model.

The tax charge in respect of the exceptional gain in 2016 amounted to 5.1m and represents a 5.7m tax charge on the disposal of Vanquis Banks interest in Visa Europe Limited at the combined mainstream UK corporation tax and bank corporation tax surcharge rates of 28% and a tax credit of 0.6m relating to tax relief for the impairment of glo intangible assets at the mainstream UK corporation tax rate of 20%.
The tax credit in respect of the amortisation of acquisition intangibles amounts to 1.4m 2016: 1.5m.
The effective tax rate for 2017, prior to the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items, is 15.1% 2016: 23.2%.
The decreaseinthe rate reflects a tax credit in respect of prior years, including a release of part of the provision for uncertain tax liabilities, net of the impact of the bank corporation tax surcharge of 8% which came into effect on 1 January 2016 and applies to Vanquis Banks taxable profits in excess of25m.
In addition to the introduction of bank corporation tax surcharge with effect from 1 January 2016, during 2015, changes were also enacted reducing the mainstream corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and from 19% to 18% with effect from 1 April 2020.
In 2016, a further change was enacted, which further reduced the mainstream corporation tax rate from 18% to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.
Deferred tax balances at 31 December 2017 have been measured at 17% 2016: 17% and, in the case of Vanquis Bank, at the combined mainstream UK corporation tax and bank corporation tax surcharge rates of 25% 2016: 25% on the basis that the temporary differences on which deferred tax has been calculated are expected to reverse after 1 April 2020 2016: 1 April 2020.
In 2017, movements in deferred tax balances have been measured at the mainstream corporation tax rate for the year of 19.25% 2016: 20.00%, and, in the case of Vanquis Bank, at the combined mainstream UK corporation tax and bank corporation tax surcharge rates for the year of 27.25% 2016: 28.00%.
A tax credit of 0.6m 2016: nil represents the income statement adjustment to deferred tax as a result of these changes andan additional deferred tax credit of 0.3m 2016: 0.6m has been taken directly to other comprehensive income in respect of items reflected directly in other comprehensive income.

The 0.4m deferred tax charge on the available for sale investment in 2017 represents deferred tax at the combined mainstream UK corporation tax and bank corporation tax surcharge rates of 27.25% on the change in valuation of the Visa Inc. preferred stock during the year.
The rate of tax charge on the loss 2016: profit before taxation for the year is higher than 2016: higher than the average rate of mainstream corporation tax in the UK of 19.25% 2016: 20%.
This can be reconciled as follows: Group 2017 2016 m m Loss profit before taxation 123.0 343.9 Loss profit before taxation multiplied by the average rate of mainstream corporation tax in the UK of 19.25% 2016: 20% 23.7 68.8 Effects of: benefit of lower tax rates overseas 0.1 0.4 adjustment in respect of prior years 22.5 3.9 non deductible general expenses 0.2 0.2 impact of change in UK tax rate 0.6 tax rate difference on tax losses carried back to prior years 0.6 write off of deferred tax asset in relation to share based payment reserve 0.9 non deductible bank compensation expenses 35.3 additional 10% of bank compensation expenses 3.5 non deductible fines and expenses 1.2 impact of bank corporation tax surcharge 17.8 16.3 Total tax charge 11.4 81.0 The profits of the home credit business in the Republic of Ireland have been taxed at the Republic of Ireland statutory tax rate of 12.5% 2016: 12.5% rather than the UK statutory mainstream corporation tax rate of 19.25% 2016: 20% giving rise to a beneficial impact on the group tax charge of 0.1m 2016: 0.4m.
The 22.5m credit 2016: 3.9m in respect of prior years represents the benefit of settling historic tax liabilities and of securing tax deductions for employee share awards which are higher than those originally anticipated and the release of part of the provision for uncertain tax liabilities which is no longer required.
The 0.6m 2016: nil impact of the change in UK tax rate on tax losses carried back represents the benefit of carrying back 2017 tax losses in CCD to 2016 when the higher mainstream corporation tax rate of 20% applied.
Deferred tax assets are typically recognised on share-based payment charges on the basis that these represent a good estimate of the tax relief that will be available when the share awards vest.
The write off of the deferred tax asset of 0.9m 2016: nil represents the reduction in tax relief expected to arise because of the reduction in the share price, where such reduction in share price has not been reflected through the share-based payments charges.
The settlements payable to Vanquis Bank customers following the resolution reached with the FCA, are in accordance with the bank compensation provisions which apply to banking companies, and are non deductible in computing Vanquis Banks profits for tax purposes see note 24.
This gives rise to an adverse impact on the tax charge of 35.3m 2016: nil.
It also gives rise to an additional 10% deemed taxable receipt under the bank compensation provisions which is intended to equate to a disallowance of the administration costs associated with the compensation.
This gives rise to a further adverse impact on the tax charge of 3.5m.
As Moneybarn is not a banking company, the bank compensation provisions do not apply to the estimated restitution payable to Moneybarn customers.
The actual and estimated fines levied by the FCA see note 24 and certain other expenses are not tax deductible for both Vanquis Bank and Moneybarn.
This gives rise to an adverse impact on the tax charge of 1.2m 2016: nil.
The adverse impact of the bank corporation tax surcharge amounts to 17.8m 2016: 16.3m and represents tax at the bank corporation tax surcharge rate of 8% on Vanquis Banks taxable profits in excess of 25m where taxable profits are calculated after adding back bank compensation payments, the 10% deemed taxable receipt, the FCA fine and other add backs.
150 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Financial statements 6 Loss earnings per share The group presents basic and diluted loss earnings per share EPS data on its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for treasury shares own shares held.
Diluted EPS calculates the effect on EPS assuming conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Dilutive potential ordinary shares are calculated as follows: i F or share awards outstanding under performance-related share incentive schemes such as the Performance Share Plan PSP and the Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS, the number of dilutive potential ordinary shares is calculated based on the number of shares which would be issuable if: i the end of the reporting period is assumed to be the end of the schemes performance period: and ii the performance targets have been met as at that date.
ii F or share options outstanding under non-performance related schemes such as the Save As You Earn scheme SAYE, a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated is compared with the number of share options outstanding, with the difference being the dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The group also presents an adjusted EPS, prior to the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items.
Reconciliations of basic and diluted loss earnings per share are set out below: 2017 2016 Weighted Weighted average average Loss number of Per share number of Per share earnings shares amount Earnings shares amount Group m m pence m m pence Loss earnings per share Shares in issue during the year 148.1 147.6 Own shares held 3.0 Basic loss earnings per share 134.4 148.1 90.7 262.9 144.6 181.8 Dilutive effect of share options and awards 1.5 1.9 Diluted loss earnings per share 134.4 148.1 90.7 262.9 146.1 179.9 Potential ordinary shares should be treated as dilutive when, and only when, their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share or increase loss per share.
As the group has reported a basic loss per share in 2017, the dilutive effect of share options and awards has been removed.
The Directors have elected to show an adjusted loss earnings per share prior to the amortisation of acquisition intangibles which arose ontheacquisition of Moneybarn in August 2014 see note 11 and prior to exceptional items see note 1.

8 Directors remuneration The remuneration of the directors, who are the key management personnel of the group, is set out below in aggregate for each of the categories specified in IAS 24, Related party disclosures.
Group and company 2017 2016 m m Short-term employee benefits 2.0 4.1 Post-employment benefits 1.2 0.5 Share-based payment credit charge 1.6 4.0 Total 1.6 8.6 The directors remuneration above reflects: Short-term employee benefits comprise salary fees, bonus and benefits earned in the year.
Post-employment benefits represent the sum of: i the increase in the transfer value of the accrued pension benefits less directors contributions for those directors who are members of the groups defined benefit pension scheme: ii company contributions into personal pension arrangements for all other directors: and iii amounts accrued under the Unfunded, Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme UURBS.
The share-based payment credit reflects the lower expected vesting of any of the groups share-based incentives following the downturn in trading in the home credit business and the settlement of regulatory matters at Vanquis Bank and Moneybarn.
This differs from the directors remuneration report on pages 105 to 126 which does not include the share-based payment credit of 1.6m 2016: 4.0m charge but includes the value of LTIS and PSP share awards due to vest in 2018 of nil 2016: 4.6m.
The value was calculated assuming 100% of share awards vested at the average share price during the last three months of 2016.
No directors 2016: nil accrued retirement benefits in the year under the cash balance section of the Provident Financial Staff Pension Scheme the pension scheme.
The pension scheme is a defined benefit scheme with cash balance benefits.
No directors 2016: nil paid or had contributions paid on their behalf into the PFG Retirement Plan in the year.
The PFG Retirement Plan is a Group Personal Pension Plan insured with Standard Life.
The company operates an Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme UURBS to provide cash balance benefits to those employees affected by the Lifetime Allowance or the Reduced Annual Allowance.
During 2017 the increase in the UURBS relating to Andrew Fisher and Peter Crook was 0.3m 2016: 0.4m and the balance outstanding at 31 December 2017 was nil 2016: 829m for Andrew Fisher and 1,441m 2016: 1,262m for Peter Crook.
Andrew Fisher elected to receive a cash supplement from June 2017.
The balance outstanding at 31 December amounted to 0.1m 2016: nil.

It did not include the 4,500 self employed agents within CCD at the end of 2016.
The 60% increase in CCD average employee numbers reflects the impact of the change in the UK operating model in 2016 from self employed agents to an employed workforce.
Vanquis Bank average employee numbers have increased by 7% during 2017 due to the growth of the business, including the continued expansion of the second contact centre in CCDs head office in Bradford and resource to support collections activity for Satsuma.
Moneybarns 21% increase in average headcount reflects the resource required to support the growth of the business and bring processes into line with the rest of the group.

The 7.2m 2016: 9.0m credit in the company for the pension charge represents contributions received from the subsidiaries in relation to the defined benefit schemes, partly offset by the charge in relation to the defined contribution schemes.
The decrease in the share-based payment charge from 14.3m in 2016 to a credit of 2.4m in 2017 primarily reflects the lower expected vesting levels across the group.
The share-based payment credit of 2.4m 2016: 14.3m charge relates to equity settled schemes of 3.4m 2016: 10.9m charge partly offset by a cash settled schemes charge of 1.0m 2016: 3.4m charge.

The recoverable amount is determined from a value in use calculation.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation relate to the discount rates and growth rates adopted.
Management adopt pre-tax discount rates which reflect the time value of money and the risks specific to the Moneybarn business.
The cash flow forecasts are based on the most recent financial budgets approved by the group Board for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years using a terminal growth rate of 1.5% 2016: 3.0%.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 11% 2016: 9%.
No reasonably foreseeable reduction in the assumptions would give rise to an impairment and therefore no further sensitivity analysis has been presented.

Following the significant losses incurred in CCD during 2017, a full review has been undertaken of the companys 258.0m investment in Provident Financial Management Services Limited the holding company within CCD and the loans of 438.0m provided to Provident Financial Management Services Limited in 2004 and 200.0m provided to Provident Personal Credit Limited in 2012.
As a result of this review: The investment in Provident Financial Management Services Limited of 258.0m has been fully impaired in the companys income statement.
The company has released Provident Financial Management Services Limited from its obligations under the 438.0m loan and released Provident Personal Credit Limited from its obligations under the 200.0m loan.
As a result of the intercompany loan releases, an amount of 386.8m has been booked as an impairment to the companys income statement and the remaining balance of the intercompany loans of 251.2m has been capitalised as an investment in Provident Financial Management Services Limited.
The investment value in Provident Financial Management Services Limited is supported by the forecast future cash flows from CCD.
The total exceptional impairment charges taken to the companys income statement in 2017 amounts to 644.8m.
A reserve transfer of 571.3m has been made from the non-distributable reserve to retained earnings to offset the impact of the above impairment charges.
The non-distributable reserve was created on the sale of Provident Personal Credit Limited by the company to Provident Financial Management Services Limited in 2000 seenote 27.
73.5m of the impairment charges have not been matched with a transfer from the non-distributable reserve as this amount represents the companys original cost of investment in Provident Personal Credit Limited.
The disposal in 2017 of 6.4m represents the IFRIC 11 adjustment relating to share options awards provided to subsidiary employees.
Under IFRIC 11, the fair value of the options awards issued is required to be treated as a capital contribution and an investment in the relevant subsidiary, net of any share options award that have vested.
The adjustment in respect of IFRIC 11 in 2017 amounted to a net credit of 6.4m and was therefore treated as a disposal.
The adjustment for IFRIC 11 in 2016 amounted to a 0.8mdebit and was treated as an addition.
The impairment charge to the income statement in 2017 of 2.0m represents the impairment of investments in various dormant companies following a dormant company rationalisation to eliminate dormant companies through liquidation and striking off dividends being paid up to the parent.
The following are the subsidiary undertakings which, in the opinion of the directors, principally affect the profit or assets of the group or are a guaranteeing subsidiary of the groups syndicated bank facility and certain other borrowings.

157 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 14 Amounts receivable from customers Under IAS 39, on inception of a loan, receivables represent the amounts initially advanced to customers plus directly attributable issue costs.
Subsequently, receivables are increased by the revenue recognised and reduced by cash collections and any deduction for impairment.
Revenue is recognised on the net value of the receivable after deduction for impairment and not on the gross receivable prior to impairment.
The group adopted IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018 which requires an impairment provision to be recognised on inception of a loan based on the expected losses, further details can be found on page 44.
The balance at 31 December 2017 is stated net of an estimated balance reduction of 75.4m, comprising a gross balance reduction of 90.1m less release of impairment provisions of 14.7m, following the resolution of the FCA investigation into ROP on 27 February 2018 see note 1.
CCD receivables comprise 352.2m in respect of the Provident home credit business 2016: 560.0m, 35.8m in respect of Satsuma 2016: 18.2m and 2.6m in respect of glo 2016: 6.6m.
Moneybarn receivables are stated net of an estimated balance reduction of 12.1m, comprising a gross balance reduction of 32.5m less release of impairment provisions of 20.4m, in respect of the ongoing FCA investigation into affordability, forbearance and termination options which is continuing see note 1.
The average effective interest rate for the year ended 31 December 2017 was 28% for Vanquis Bank 2016: 29%, 111% for CCD 2016: 115% and 30% for Moneybarn 2016: 30%.
The average period to maturity of the amounts receivable from customers within CCD is seven months 2016: seven months and within Moneybarn is 40.0 months 2016: 39.0 months.
Within Vanquis Bank, there is no fixed term for repayment of credit card loans other than a general requirement for customers to make a monthly minimum repayment towards their outstanding balance.
For the majority of customers, this is currently the greater of 2.3% of the amount owed plus any fees and interest charges in the month and 5.
The fair value of amounts receivable from customers is approximately 3.6 billion 2016: 3.3 billion.
Fair value has been derived by discounting expected future cash flows net of collection costs at the credit risk adjusted discount rate at the balance sheet date.
Under IFRS 13, Fair value measurement, receivables are classed as Level 3 as they are not traded on an active market and the fair value is therefore determined through future cash flows.
The credit quality of amounts receivable from customers is as follows: 2017 2016 Credit quality of amounts Vanquis Bank CCD Moneybarn Group Vanquis Bank CCD Moneybarn Group receivable fromcustomers m m m m m m m m Neither past due nor impaired 1,456.3 145.8 268.6 1,870.7 1,338.8 323.1 235.3 1,897.2 Past due but not impaired 50.2 50.2 63.9 63.9 Impaired 98.4 194.6 95.5 388.5 85.9 197.8 62.0 345.7 Total 1,554.7 390.6 364.1 2,309.4 1,424.7 584.8 297.3 2,306.8 2017 2016 Credit quality of amounts Vanquis Bank CCD Moneybarn Group Vanquis Bank CCD Moneybarn Group receivable fromcustomers % % % % % % % % Neither past due nor impaired 93.7 37.3 73.8 81.0 94.0 55.3 79.1 82.2 Past due but not impaired 12.9 2.2 10.9 2.8 Impaired 6.3 49.8 26.2 16.8 6.0 33.8 20.9 15.0 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Past due but not impaired balances all relate to home credit loans within CCD.
There are no accounts loans within Vanquis Bank or Moneybarn which are past due but not impaired.
In home credit, past due but not impaired balances relate to loans which are contractually overdue.
However, contractually overdue loans are not deemed to be impaired unless the customer has missed two or more cumulative weekly payments in the previous 12-week period since only at this point do the expected future cash flows from loans deteriorate materially.
In Vanquis Bank delinquency levels have remained broadly stable through 2017 reflecting the sound quality of the receivables book and the stable UK employment market.
This compares with the improving profile of delinquency experienced in the first nine months of 2016.
The CCD arrears profile has deteriorated during 2017 reflecting the higher level of arrears and impairment arising on the transition to the new operating model.
The Moneybarn profile has deteriorated during 2017 reflecting: i the flow through of defaults on higher risk categories of business prior to the tightening of underwriting in the second quarter of the year: and ii an increased number of customers on payment arrangements due to increased forbearance.

159 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 14 Amounts receivable from customers continued Interest income recognised on amounts receivable from customers which have been impaired can be analysed as follows: Group 2017 2016 Interest income recognised on impaired amounts receivable from customers m m Vanquis Bank 44.0 38.2 CCD 243.4 286.1 Moneybarn 14.2 10.0 Total group 301.6 334.3 IAS 39 requires interest revenue to be recognised on the net carrying value of a receivable after deductions for impairment and not on the outstanding amount of the loan prior to impairment.
Using Vanquis Bank as an example, whilst interest revenue for customer statement balances is broadly calculated on the gross receivables balance of 1,843.6m subject to the normal suspension of interest, where applicable, and the timing of customer payments, interest revenue for IFRS purposes is calculated based on the net receivables balance of 1,554.7m, which is stated after the deduction of the impairment allowance account of 288.9m.
The non-standard customers served by the group are generally more likely to miss payments compared with more prime customers.
As the group recognises impairment events early after missing two weekly payments in the last 12weeks in CCD and after missing one monthly payment in Vanquis Bank and Moneybarn the groups level of revenue on impaired loans is comparatively high.

The gilts had a maturity on origination in excess of three months and are therefore disclosed as an available for sale investment.
Vanquis Banks total liquid assets buffer and other liquid resources, including 227.5m held in cash and cash equivalents, held in accordance with the PRAs liquidity regime amounted to 263.4m at 31 December 2017 2016: 168.9m.
b Visa shares The Visa shares represents preferred stock in Visa Inc. held by Vanquis Bank following completion of Visa Inc. s acquisition of Visa Europe Limited on 21 June 2016.
In consideration for Vanquis Banks interest in Visa Europe Limited, Vanquis Bank received cash consideration of 15.9m 12.2m on completion, preferred stock with an approximate value of 10.7m and deferred cash consideration of 1.4m due on the third anniversary of the completion date.
The preferred stock is convertible into Class A common stock of Visa Inc. at a future date, subject to certain conditions.
Following completion of the transaction in 2016, the gain of 17.5m taken through equity in 2015 in respect of the Visa Europe shares was recycled through the income statement together with the 2.7m movement in the fair value of the consideration between the 2015 year-end and completion of the transaction resulting in an exceptional gain on disposal of 20.2m.
The fair value of the preferred stock in Visa Inc. held by Vanquis Bank as at 31 December 2017 of 9.9m is held as an available for sale investment and the fair value of the deferred cash consideration of 1.2m is included within debtors.
The movement in the fair value of the available for sale investment during the year of 1.9m in respect of the movement in the Visa Inc. share price and the movement in foreign exchange rates has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
The valuation of the preferred stock has been determined using the common stocks value as an approximation as both classes of stock have similar dividend rights.
However, adjustments have been made for: i illiquidity, as the preferred stock is not tradeable on an open market and can only be transferred to other VISA members: and ii future litigation costs which could affect the valuation of the stock prior to conversion.
Under IFRS 13, Fair value measurement, the investment is classified as Level 3 as the valuation is determined using a combination of observable and unobservable inputs.
As the common stock share price is readily available, the inputs are deemed to be observable.
However, certain assumptions have been made in respect of the illiquidity adjustment to the share price and the likelihood of litigation costs in the future.
These inputs are therefore deemed to be unobservable.

a Hedging reserve movements The fair value of derivative financial instruments is required to be reflected in the balance sheet.
Generally, providing the derivative financial instruments meet certain accounting requirements, any movement in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates is deferred in the hedging reserve and does not impact the income statement.
The groups derivative financial instruments all currently meet these criteria.
If the interest rates payable on interest rate swaps are higher than the current interest rate at the balance sheet date, then a derivative liability is recognised.
Conversely, if the interest rates payable on interest rate swaps are lower than the current floating interest rate at the balance sheet date, then a derivative asset is recognised.
The movement in the hedging reserve within equity as a result of the changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments can be summarised as follows: Group Company 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m m m Interest rate swaps 0.1 0.4 0.1 0.4 Foreign exchange contracts 0.1 Net credit to the hedging reserve 0.2 0.4 0.1 0.4 Under IFRS 13, Fair value measurement, all derivative financial instruments are classed as Level 2 as they are not traded in an active market and the fair value is therefore determined through discounting future cash flows, using appropriate market rates and yield curves.
b Income statement All cash flow hedges are deemed to be effective.
There was no impact on the income statement of the group and the company in the year in respect of the movement in the fair value of ineffective interest rate swaps, previously designated as cash flow hedges 2016: nil.

The group has entered into various interest rate swaps which were designated and effective under IAS 39 as cash flow hedges at inception.
The movement in the fair value of effective interest rate swaps during the year was as follows: Group and company 2017 2016 m m Liability at 1 January 0.1 0.5 Credited to the hedging reserve 0.1 0.4 Liability at 31 December 0.1 The weighted average interest rate and period to maturity of the interest rate swaps held by the group and company were as follows: 2017 2016 Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted average Range of average average Range of average interest interest period to interest interest period to rate rates maturity rate rates maturity Group and company % % years % % years Sterling 0.7 0.60.8 0.2 0.7 0.60.8 0.1 d Foreign exchange contracts The group uses foreign exchange contracts in order to manage the foreign exchange rate risk arising from CCDs euro operations in the Republic of Ireland.
A liability of 0.1m is held in the group balance sheet as at 31 December 2017 in respect of foreign exchange contracts 2016: liability of 0.2m.
The groups foreign exchange contracts comprise forward foreign exchange contracts to buy sterling and sell euros for a total notional amount of 3.2m 2016: 7.6m.
These contracts have a range of maturity dates from 16 January 2018 to 14 August 2018 2016: 17 January 2017 to 12 December 2017.
These contracts were designated as cash flow hedges and were effective under IAS 39.
Accordingly, the movement in fair value of 0.1m has been credited to the hedging reserve within equity 2016: nil.
18 Trade and other receivables Company 2017 2016 Non-current assets m m Amounts owed by group undertakings 76.9 871.6 There are no amounts past due and there is no impairment provision held against amounts owed by group undertakings due for repayment in more than one year 2016: nil.
The amounts owed by group undertakings are unsecured, due for repayment in more than one year and accrue interest at rates linked to LIBOR.
Amounts owed to group undertakings have reduced from 871.6m in 2016 to 76.9m in 2017 as the company has waived loans of 638.0m to PFMSL and PPC during the year seenote 13.

There are nil amounts past due in respect of trade and other receivables due in less than one year 2016: nil.
Within the company, an impairment provision of 122.9m 2016: 123.3m is held against amounts owed by group undertakings due in less than one year representing the deficiency in the net assets of those group undertakings.
There has been a 0.4m credit to the company income statement in 2017 2016: 0.2m charge in respect of the decreased provision.
Prepayments and accrued income have increase by 6.7m due to: i higher consultancy costs: ii higher broker fees and: iii higher licence fees.
Amounts owed by group undertakings are unsecured, repayable on demand or within one year, and generally accrue interest at rates linked to LIBOR.
The maximum exposure to credit risk of trade and other receivables equates to the carrying value 2016: carrying value set out above.
The fair value of trade and other receivables approximately equates to the carrying value.
164 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Financial statements 19 Retirement benefit asset a Pension schemes defined benefit The retirement benefit asset reflects the difference between the present value of the groups obligation to current and past employees to provide a defined benefit pension and the fair value of assets held to meet that obligation.
As at 31 December 2017, the fair value of the assets exceeded the obligation and hence a net pension asset has been recorded.
The group operates a defined benefit scheme: the Provident Financial Staff Pension Scheme.
The scheme is of the funded, defined benefit type and has been substantially closed to new members since 1 January 2003.
All future benefits in the scheme are now provided on a cash balance basis, with a defined amount being made available at retirement, based on a percentage of salary that is revalued up to retirement with reference to increases in price inflation.
This retirement account is then used to purchase an annuity on the open market.
The scheme also provides pension benefits which were accrued in the past on a final salary basis, but which are no longer linked to final salary.
The scheme also provides death benefits.
The scheme is a UK registered pension scheme under UK legislation.
The scheme is governed by a Trust Deed and Rules, with trustees responsible for the operation and the governance of the scheme.
The trustees work closely with the group on funding and investment strategy decisions.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 1 June 2015 by a qualified independent actuary.
The valuation used for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee benefits, has been based on results of the 2015 valuation, updated to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme as at the balance sheet date.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the balance sheet date.
The group is entitled to a refund of any surplus, subject to tax, if the scheme winds up after all benefits have been paid.
The group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are as follows: Investment risk the liabilities for IAS 19 purposes are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields.
If the assets underperform this yield a deficit will arise.
The scheme has a long-term objective to reduce the level of investment risk by investing in assets that better match liabilities: Change in bond yields a decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the liabilities, although this will be partly offset by an increase in matching assets: Inflation risk part of the liabilities are linked to inflation.
If inflation increases then liabilities will increase, although this will be partly offset by an increase in assets.
As part of a long-term fide-risking strategy, the scheme has increased its portfolio in inflation matched assets: and Life expectancies the schemes final salary benefits provide pensions for the rest of members lives and for their spouses lives.
If members live longer than assumed, then the liabilities in respect of final salary benefits increase.
The net retirement benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet of the group and company is as follows: Group and company 2017 2016 m % m % Equities 68.7 8 83.1 10 Other diversified return seeking investments 75.8 9 73.9 9 Corporate bonds 141.6 17 141.2 17 Fixed interest gilts 202.9 24 193.0 23 Index-linked gilts 341.6 41 337.4 41 Cash and money market funds 4.9 1 1.5 Total fair value of scheme assets 835.5 100 830.1 100 Present value of funded defined benefit obligation 733.2 757.7 Net retirement benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet 102.3 72.4 As part of a fide-risking strategy agreed between the company and the pension trustees to hedge the inflation and interest rate risks associated with the liabilities of the pension scheme, a substantial amount of more volatile growth funds equities were reinvested in liability protection assets fixed interest and index-linked gilts in January 2015.
Further work was undertaken to refine the liability protection assets in early 2016.
165 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 19 Retirement benefit asset continued The valuation of the pension scheme has increased from 72.4m at 31 December 2016 to 102.3m at 31 December 2017.

166 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Financial statements 19 Retirement benefit asset continued Movements in the present value of the defined benefit obligation were as follows: Group and company 2017 2016 m m Present value of the defined benefit obligation at 1 January 757.7 604.1 Current service cost 4.2 4.0 Interest on scheme liabilities 19.1 22.3 Exceptional curtailment credit 3.9 Actuarial movement experience 3.7 4.5 Actuarial movement demographic assumptions 21.3 Actuarial movement financial assumptions 18.3 158.3 Net benefits paid out 44.6 26.5 Present value of the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 733.2 757.7 The liabilities of the scheme are based on the current value of expected benefit payments over the next 90 years.
The weighted average duration of the scheme liabilities is approximately 19 years 2016: 19 years.
The principal actuarial assumptions used at the balance sheet date were as follows: Group and company 2017 2016 % % Price inflation RPI 3.20 3.25 Price inflation CPI 2.10 2.15 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.95 3.00 Inflationary increases to pensions in deferment 2.10 2.15 Discount rate 2.40 2.55 The pension increase assumption shown above applies to pensions increasing in payment each year in line with RPI up to 5%.
Pensions accrued prior to 2000 are substantially subject to fixed 5% increases each year.
In deferment increases prior to retirement are linked to CPI.
The mortality assumptions are based on the self-administered pension scheme SAPS series 1 tables, with multipliers of 105% and 115% respectively for males and females.
The 5% upwards adjustment to mortality rates for males and a 15% upwards adjustment for females reflects the lower life expectancies within the scheme compared to average pension schemes, which was concluded following a study of the schemes membership.
Future improvements in mortality are based on the Continuous Mortality Investigation CMI 2016 model with a long-term improvement trend of 1.25% per annum.
Under these mortality assumptions, the life expectancies of members are as follows: Male Female 2017 2016 2017 2016 Group and company years years years years Current pensioner aged 65 21.4 21.8 22.9 23.3 Current member aged 45 from age 65 22.9 23.5 24.5 25.2 The table below shows the sensitivity on the defined benefit obligation not including any impact on assets of changes in the key assumptions.
Depending on the scenario, there would also be compensating asset movements.

The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the group and company.
The group also operates a separate pension scheme for auto-enrolment into which the company and subsidiaries contribute a proportion of qualifying earnings of the member of 1%.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the group or company.
The pension charge in the consolidated income statement represents contributions paid by the group in respect of these plans and amounted to 8.1m for the year ended 31 December 2017 2016: 7.9m.
Contributions made by the company amounted to 0.4m 2016: 0.4m.
0.6m contributions were payable to the fund at the year end 2016: 0.2m.
The group contributed less than 0.1m in 2017 and 2016 into individual personal pension plans in the year.
The Unfunded, Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme UURBS increased by 0.2m 2016: 0.6m, as a result of the transfer of Andrew Fishers scheme to a personal pension plan, and 1.6m into cash supplements 2016: 0.6m.
168 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Financial statements 20 Deferred tax Deferred tax is a future tax liability or asset resulting from temporary differences or timing differences between the accounting value of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes.
Deferred tax arises primarily in respect of derivative financial instruments, the groups pension asset, deductions for employee share awards which are recognised differently for tax purposes, property, plant and equipment which is depreciated on a different basis for tax purposes, certain cost provisions for which tax deductions are only available when the costs are paid and available for sale assets which are taxed only on disposal.
The deferred tax liability recognised on the acquisition of Moneybarn relates primarily to the intangible asset in respect of Moneybarns broker relationships which will be amortised in future periods but for which tax deductions will not be available.
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the balance sheet liability method.
During 2015, reductions in corporation tax rates were enacted, reducing the mainstream UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and from 19% to 18% with effect from 1 April 2020.
In addition, the Government introduced a bank corporation tax surcharge enacted in the 2015 Finance No 2 Act which imposes, with effect from 1 January 2016, an additional 8% corporation tax on profits of Vanquis Bank over 25m.
During 2016, a further change was enacted which further reduced the mainstream UK corporation tax rate from 18% to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.
Deferred tax at 31 December 2017 has been measured at 17% 2016: 17% and, in the case of Vanquis Bank, at the combined mainstream UK corporation tax and bank corporation tax surcharge rates of 25% 2016: 25% on the basis that the temporary differences on which deferred tax has been calculated are expected to reverse after 1 April 2020 2016: 1 April 2020.
In 2017, movements in deferred tax balances have been measured at the mainstream corporation tax rate for the year of 19.25% 2016: 20.0%, and, in the case of Vanquis Bank, at the combined mainstream UK corporation tax and bank corporation tax surcharge rates for the year of 27.25% 2016: 28.0%.
A tax credit of 0.6m 2016: nil represents the income statement adjustment to deferred tax as a result of these changes and an additional deferred tax credit of 0.3m 2016: 0.6m has been taken directly to other comprehensive income in respect of items reflected directly in other comprehensive income.

21 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash at bank and held in short-term deposits, floats held by CEMs within CCD and Vanquis Banks liquid assets buffer, including other liquid resources, held in accordance with the PRAs liquidity regime.
The PRA requires regulated entities to maintain a liquid assets buffer and other liquid resources to ensure they have available funds to help protect against unforeseen circumstances.
The amount of the liquid assets buffer is calculated using Individual Liquidity Guidance ILG set by the PRA based on the Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process ILAAP prepared by Vanquis Bank.
In addition, further liquid resources must be maintained based upon daily stress tests linked to three key liquidity risks of Vanquis Bank, namely retail deposits maturities, undrawn credit card lines and operating cash flows.
This results in a dynamic liquid resources requirement, largely driven by retail deposits maturities in the following three months.
Vanquis Banks liquid assets buffer, including other liquid resources, amounts to 263.4m at 31 December 2017 2016: 168.9m and is held in a combination of UK government gilts of 35.9m 2016: nil held within available for sale investments and a Bank of England reserves account of 227.5m 2016: 168.9m which is held within cash and cash equivalents.

Excluding retail deposits, the weighted average period to maturity of the groups committed facilities was 2.5 years 2016: 2.3 years.
d Interest rate and currency profile of borrowings Before taking account of the various interest rate swaps and cross-currency swap arrangements entered into by the group and company, the interest rate and foreign exchange rate exposure on borrowings is as follows: 2017 2016 Fixed Floating Total Fixed Floating Total Group m m m m m m Sterling 1,687.5 437.8 2,125.3 1,459.6 335.0 1,794.6 Euro 48.8 48.8 60.5 60.5 Total group 1,687.5 486.6 2,174.1 1,459.6 395.5 1,855.1 2017 2016 Fixed Floating Total Fixed Floating Total Company m m m m m m Sterling 395.7 435.0 830.7 518.4 332.4 850.8 Euro 48.8 48.8 60.5 60.5 Total company 395.7 483.8 879.5 518.4 392.9 911.3 As detailed in note 17, the group and company have entered into various interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate exposure on borrowings.
After taking account of the aforementioned interest rate swaps, the groups fixed rate borrowings are 1,707.5m 2016: 1,569.7m and the companys fixed rate borrowings are 415.7m 2016: 628.5m.
172 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Financial statements 22 Borrowings continued e Senior public bonds On 23 October 2009, the company issued 250.0m of senior public bonds.
The bonds have an annual coupon of 8.0% and are repayable on 23 October 2019. f Private placement loan notes On 13 January 2011, the company entered into a committed 100.0m facility agreement with the Prudential M&G Investments UK Companies Financing Fund to provide a 10-year term loan which amortises between years five and ten.
The first two repayments of 10.0m were repaid in 2016 and 2017.
The third instalment of 15.0m was paid on 31 January 2018.
The company also entered into a 20m private placement loan note with a third party on 4 March 2011 repayable over a seven-year period at a rate linked to LIBOR and a euro 10m facility agreement over a seven-year period on 3 February 2011 at a rate linked to EURIBOR, which was repaid one year ahead of its maturity date in February 2017. g Retail bonds The company has three outstanding retail bonds issued on the Order Book for Retail Bonds ORB platform established by the London Stock Exchange as follows: Amount Rate Issue date m % Maturity date 14 April 2010 25.2 7.5% 14 April 2020 27 March 2013 65.0 6.0% 27 September 2021 9 April 2015 60.0 5.125% 9 October 2023 Total group and company 150.2 The retail bonds issued on 4 April 2012 amounting to 120.0m and accruing interest at 7.0% were repaid in full on their maturity date of 4 October 2017.
Represents an all-in cost of 7.5%, comprising a 7.0% interest rate payable to the bond holder and 0.5% payable to the distributor.
h Undrawn committed borrowing facilities The groups funding and liquidity policy is designed to ensure that the group is able to continue to fund the growth of the business.
The group therefore maintains headroom on its committed borrowing facilities, together with cash held on deposit, to fund growth and contractual maturities for at least the following 12 months, after assuming that Vanquis Bank will fully fund itself through retail deposits and repay its intercompany loan to Provident Financial plc.
The undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December were as follows: Group and company 2017 2016 m m Expiring within one year Expiring within one to two years 110.2 Expiring in more than two years 66.2 Total group and company 66.2 110.2 The group has committed borrowing facilities of 2,242.0m 2016: 1,962.4m at the end of 2017.
The table above also does not include the additional capacity for Vanquis Bank to take retail deposits up to the value of the intercompany loan from Provident Financial plc of 76.9m as at 31 December 2017.
Accordingly, Vanquis Banks retail deposits capacity at 31 December 2017 amounts to 76.9m.
The groups total funding capacity therefore amounts to 177.4m, being the groups adjusted headroom on undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 100.5m plus the amount of Vanquis Banks intercompany loan of 76.9m plus surplus cash held on deposit of 34.3m, excluding the liquid assets buffer held by Vanquis Bank.

24 Provisions Group 2017 2016 Provisions m m At 1 January Created in the year 104.6 Total 104.6 On 27 February 2018, Vanquis Bank agreed a settlement with the FCA into the investigation into ROP.
The total estimated cost of settlement amounts to 172.1m and comprises: i restitution to customers of 127.1m comprising balance reductions to existing customers of 75.4m and cash settlements of 51.7m: ii higher expected forward flow of ROP complaints more generally in respect of which compensation may need to be paid of 30.7m: iii administration costs of 12.3m: and iv the fine levied by the FCA of just under 2.0m.
The balance reductions of 75.4m have been applied to amounts receivable from customers at 31 December 2017 with the remaining estimated cost of 96.7m being recognised as a provision at 31 December 2017.
The estimated costs of the balance reductions, cash settlements and fine are based on the settlement agreement with the FCA.
The provision in respect of anticipated future claims in respect of ROP complaints more generally represents managements best estimate of the groups liability for customer restitution costs based on: i the total number of complaints that the group may receive: ii the proportion that may result in restitution: and iii the average cost of restitution.
The timing of the resulting economic outflows is uncertain and will depend on, but not limited to, whether the claims will be made and the timing of any claims.
A 10% increase decrease in the number of expected claims would result in a - 3m impact on the provision for future claims.
Provisions in respect of the expected costs of administering the restitution programme are based on managements best estimates, taking into account the level of the restitution programme and the current cost base of Vanquis Bank.
Moneybarn continues to cooperate with the FCA with its ongoing investigation into affordability, forbearance and termination options.
Managements best estimate in respect of the potential liability in respect of the investigation, based on the work of external consultants and managements own analysis of potentially affected customers within the areas being investigated, is estimated to be 20.0m.
This comprises 12.1m in respect of balance reductions to existing customers and 7.9m in respect of potential cash restitution, administration costs and an FCA fine.
The balance reductions of 12.1m have been applied to amounts receivable from customers at 31 December 2017 with the remaining estimated cost of 7.9m being recognised as a provision at 31 December 2017.

The group previously operated senior executive share option schemes ESOS SESO, although no options have been granted under these schemes since 2006.
When an equity settled share option or award is granted, a fair value is calculated based on the share price at grant date, the probability of the option award vesting, the groups recent share price volatility, and the risk associated with the option award.
A fair value is calculated based on the value of awards granted and adjusted at each balance sheet date for the probability of vesting against performance conditions.
The fair value of all options awards are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the underlying option award.
During 2017, awards options have been granted under the LTIS, PSP, SAYE and PFEP schemes 2016: awards options have been granted under the LTIS, PSP, SAYE and PFEP schemes.

The transaction enabled Provident Financial Management Services Limited to be established as a central service function for its subsidiaries Provident Personal Credit Limited and Greenwood Personal Credit Limited and ensured that the entities forming CCD were consolidated into one sub-group which more accurately reflected the groups structure.
The original gain on sale of 809.2m was recognised as a non-distributable reserve as the consideration provided by Provident Financial Management Services comprised cash funded by the issue of debt and shares by Provident Financial Management Services Limited to Provident Financial plc.
The debt was refinanced in 2004 with a new 638m term loan from Provident Financial plc.
200m of the original gain was made distributable in 2005 following the settlement in cash of 200m of the 638m loan by Provident Financial Management Services Limited.
Following the significant losses incurred in CCD during 2017, a full review has been undertaken of the companys investment in Provident Financial Management Services Limited and the intercompany loans of 438m and 200m provided to Provident Financial Management Services Limited and Provident Personal Credit Limited respectively.
As a result of this review, the company has released Provident Financial Management Services Limited and Provident Personal Credit Limited from their obligations under the intercompany loans and impairment charges of 644.8m have been taken to the companys income statement in 2017.
571.3m of the non-distributable reserve has been transferred to retained earnings to offset these impairment charges see note 13.
The remaining 73.5m of impairment charges have not been matched with a transfer from the nondistributable reserve as this amount represents the companys original cost of investment in Provident Personal Credit Limited.
For the purposes of declaring dividends distributable reserves include: i retained earnings, adjusted to reflect the unrealised gain on the retirement benefit asset: ii share-based payment reserve net of deferred tax: iii merger reserve: iv treasury share reserve and: v an element of the intra-group loan receivable created as part of the group reorganisation in 2000.
Historically, approximately 50m of the intra-group loan receivable from Provident Financial Management Services Limited created as part of the aforementioned group reorganisation in 2000 met the criteria for qualifying consideration in accordance with Tech 02 17.
This was on the basis that the debtor was capable of settling the receivable within a reasonable period of time, there was reasonable certainty that the debtor would be capable of settling when called upon to do so, and there was an expectation that the receivable would be settled.
Based on historic dividends levels, 50m was considered to be an appropriate amount that Provident Financial Management Services Limited could settle within a year.
Accordingly, the company had historically included 50m as part of distributable reserves for the purposes of assessing dividend distributions.
Following the significant deterioration in performance of CCD during 2017 and the subsequent release of the intra-group loan receivable, there is no longer any intra-group loan receivables capable of meeting the criteria for qualifying consideration.
The distributable reserves do not include distributable reserves held within subsidiary companies.
The proposed rights issue is being undertaken through a cash box structure which will allow merger relief to be applied to the issue of shares rather than recording share premium and thereby create distributable reserves for the company where capital is not injected in Vanquis Bank.
The net proceeds of the proposed rights issue of 300m, will be recorded as an increase in share capital and the creation of a merger reserve.
50.0m of the capital raised will be injected into Vanquis Bank with the remaining 250m being retained in the company.

In 2016, Vanquis Bank and the PRA agreed a voluntary requirement for Vanquis Bank not to pay dividends to, or enter into certain transactions outside the normal cause of business with, the Provident Financial group without the PRAs consent pending the outcome of the FCAs investigations into ROP.
The voluntary requirement remains in place whilst the customer redress programme agreed with the FCA is sufficiently progressed.
With the consent of the PRA, Vanquis Bank paid dividends to Provident Financial plc of 67.3m during 2017.
Vanquis Bank has now paid cumulative dividends of 380m out of its surplus capital since it commenced paying dividends in 2011.
182 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Financial statements 29 Related party transactions continued In 2016 the company also received a dividend of 45.0m from Provident Financial Management Services Limited, the holding company of the companies forming CCD.
There are no transactions with directors other than those disclosed in the directors remuneration report.
30 Contingent liabilities A contingent liability is a liability that is not sufficiently certain to qualify for recognition as a provision where uncertainty exists regarding the outcome of future events.
a Threatened proceedings in respect of the companys alleged failure to disclose previously certain matters contained in the companys public announcement on 22 August 2017.
On 26 January 2018, the company received a letter on behalf of an institutional investor which has a number of subsidiary investment funds in connection with certain matters disclosed in its public announcement on 22 August 2017.
On that date, as part of a trading update, the company announced, among other things, that Vanquis Bank was co-operating with an investigation by the FCA into ROP, had agreed with the FCA to enter into a voluntary requirement to suspend all new sales of ROP in April 2016 and had agreed with the PRA, pending the outcome of the FCA investigation, not to pay dividends to, or enter into certain transactions outside the normal course of business with, the group without the PRAs consent.
The institutional investor asserts that the company is liable to compensate it and its subsidiary investment funds for losses suffered as a result of the fact that certain matters disclosed in the trading update were not publicly announced earlier or disclosed to them by the company in investor meetings.
The institutional investor has not quantified the losses that it alleges have been incurred, although it alleges that it and its subsidiary investment funds held significant positions in the companys shares at the time.
The institutional investor also asserts that the companys earlier public announcements were false or misleading or, alternatively, the delay in disclosing those matters publicly was dishonest pursuant to Section 90A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, and the company made actionable misstatements during those investor meetings.
Whilst the matters alleged on behalf of the institutional investor are complex and the company is at an early stage of analysing the claims, the company currently believes the claims by the institutional investor are unmeritorious and considers the prospects of the claims being upheld to be limited.
As such, the company intends to defend its position vigorously and to the fullest extent possible.
In the event these claims, or claims brought by any other investors in connection with these, or other, announcements or investor meetings, were upheld, the compensation which the company may be required to pay could have a material adverse effect on the groups business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
b Other legal actions and regulatory matters In addition, during the ordinary course of business the group is subject to other complaints and threatened or actual legal proceedings including class or group action claims brought by or on behalf of current or former employees, agents, customers, investors or other third parties, as well as legal and regulatory reviews, challenges, investigations and enforcement actions, both in the UK and overseas.
All such material matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the group incurring a liability.
In those instances where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a payment will be made, a provision is established to managements best estimate of the amount required at the relevant balance sheet date.
In some cases it will not be possible to form a view, for example because the facts are unclear or because further time is needed properly to assess the merits of the case, and no provisions are held in relation to such matters.
However the group does not currently expect the final outcome of any such case to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, operations or cash flows.
c Bank guarantees and Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme UURBS The company has a contingent liability for guarantees given in respect of borrowing facilities of certain subsidiaries to a maximum of 69.0m 2016: 112.8m.
At 31 December 2017, the fixed and floating rate borrowings in respect of these guarantees amounted to 2.8m 2016: 2.6m.
No loss is expected to arise.
These guarantees are defined as financial guarantees under IAS 39 and their fair value at 31 December 2017 was not deemed to be material 2016: not material.
A floating charge is held over CCDs receivables of up to 15m in respect of the unfunded pension benefit promises made to executive directors and certain members of senior management affected by the reduced annual allowance to pension schemes introduced in 2011 under the UURBS.

The total cost of redress and fines is estimated to be 172.1m in respect of the Vanquis Bank investigation and 20.0m in respect of the Moneybarn investigation.
The aggregate payments agreed to be made by Vanquis Bank in respect of the FCA investigations and the estimated cost in respect of Moneybarn has materially adversely impacted both Vanquis Banks and the groups regulatory capital.
As a result, the group has concluded that it is necessary action to raise additional capital of 300.0m gross proceeds of 331m net of expenses of 31m by way of a proposed rights issue to meet the costs of resolving the investigations, restore the groups prudent capital position, seek to maintain the groups investment grade rating and re-establish normal access to funding from the bank and debt capital markets.
The proposed rights issue is expected to complete in April 2018 and has been fully underwritten subject to customary conditions.
During February 2018, the group took the following actions in respect of its funding and capital position, prior to the launch of the proposed rights issue: Agreed amendments and waivers of certain covenants with the groups banks in respect of the syndicated revolving bank facility and with M&G in respect of the term loan in order to provide the group with greater covenant headroom to address the impact arising from the disruption in the home credit business in 2017 and the impact of the provisions taken by the group in the balance sheet as at 31 December 2017 relating to the FCA investigations.
The net worth covenant has been temporarily reduced from 400m to 375m at 31 December 2017 and 31 March 2018, the net worth excluding Vanquis Bank covenant has been temporarily reduced from 155m to 100m at 31 December 2017 and 31 March 2018 and the interest cover covenant has been temporarily reduced from 2.0 times to 1.25 times for the 12 months ending 31 March 2018 and 30 June 2018.
These amendments and waivers will cease to have effect if the proposed rights issue were not to proceed and complete.
Arranged an 85m bridge facility with Barclays Bank and JP Morgan Securities.
The bridge facility was used to provide sufficient funds to allow Vanquis Bank to draw down 85m under an intercompany loan facility between Provident Financial plc and Vanquis Bank, providing Vanquis Bank with an additional 85m of funding which Vanquis Bank intends to hold as additional liquid resources.
At the same time, committed headroom under an existing intercompany faculty was cancelled and will, in the future reduce the reliance of Vanquis Bank on Provident Financial plc in due course.
Subject to the success of the proposed rights issue, the net proceeds of 300m will be received on 12 April 2018 and 85m of such proceeds will be used to repay the bridge facility provided by the underwriting banks.
50m of the proceeds will be injected into Vanquis Bank via a subscription of equity.
The capital injection will be used by Vanquis Bank, together with its cash and additional borrowings from retail depositors, to pay for the costs of resolving the FCAs investigation into ROP.
Subject to regulatory approval and the liquidity profile of Vanquis Bank continuing to be satisfactory, Vanquis Bank intends to repay the intercompany loan facility provided by Provident Financial by 2019 and be fully funded through retail deposits thereafter.
Shared a revised capital plan with the PRA which resulted in an increase in the groups regulatory capital requirement, primarily due to an increase of approximately 100m in respect of conduct and operational risk assessments.
In finalising its new capital plan reflecting its current and expected capital requirements, the group has taken into account, amongst other things: i the receipt of 300m net proceeds from the proposed rights issue: ii the groups revised dividend policy and estimated future levels of dividends to be paid by the company and Vanquis Bank: iii the estimated payments to be made in connection with Vanquis Banks settlement with the FCA in connection with ROP: iv Moneybarns estimated liability in connection with the FCAs investigation: v the amendment and waiver of certain covenants under the syndicated revolving bank facility and M&G term loan: and vi management actions planned and proposed to be taken.
