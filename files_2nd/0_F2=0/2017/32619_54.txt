They are not necessarily intended to be realised in the short term.
The Trustees of each Scheme invest in different categories of asset and with different allocations amongst those categories, according to the investment principles of that Scheme.
Currently, the investment strategy of the CARE Scheme is to maintain a balance of growth assets equities and diversified growth funds, income assets comprising credit investments, corporate bonds and absolute return bonds and protection assets comprising an LDI portfolio, with a weighting towards protection assets.
There are no direct investments in the Groups own shares or property occupied by any member of the Group.

In January 2013, the Company made a contribution to the CARE Scheme of 30m.
On the same day, the CARE Scheme invested 30m in the Wm Morrison Property Partnership SLP as a limited partner.
The SLP holds properties which have been leased back to the Company in return for rental income payments.
The Group retains control over these properties, including the flexibility to substitute alternative properties.
As a partner in the SLP, the CARE Scheme is entitled to receive a fixed distribution of 2.2m p. a. from the profits of the SLP for 20 years from 2013, subject to certain conditions.
In July 2015, the SLP was amended to enhance the security provided to the Schemes by including additional properties.
The terms of these additional properties are such that the CARE Scheme has no entitlement to receive a distribution.
The CARE Schemes interests in the SLP increases the net pension asset on an IAS 19 accounting basis because the investments held by the CARE Scheme qualify as an asset for Company IAS 19 purposes.

In practice any movement in assumptions could be accompanied by a partially offsetting change in asset values, and the corresponding overall impact on the net asset liability is therefore likely to be lower than the amounts below in a number of scenarios.
Extrapolation of the sensitivities shown may not be appropriate.

The Company along with other subsidiaries of the Group participate in the RSP.
There is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost between the Company and its subsidiaries.
The contribution of each participating subsidiary to the RSP is currently calculated in proportion to the number of employees that are members of the RSP.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at 5 April 2016 for the Morrison Scheme and the RSP.
The valuations indicated that, on the agreed funding basis, the Morrison and RSP Schemes had surpluses of 1m and 10m respectively.
As a result of these funding positions there are currently no deficit contributions payable.
As such there is no minimum funding requirement in force.
The results of the 2016 actuarial valuations for the CARE Scheme has been used and updated for IAS 19 Employee benefits purposes for the period to 29 January 2017 by a qualified independent actuary.
For the RSP an actuarial valuation for the purposes of IAS 19, based on member data as at 31 December 2016, has been completed and updated to 29 January 2017 by a qualified independent actuary.
The Schemes expose the Company to inflation risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
In addition, the CARE Scheme exposes the Company to longevity risk.
At the year end, schemes in surplus have been disclosed within the assets on the balance sheet.
The Company has taken legal advice with regard to the recognition of a pension surplus and also recognition of a minimum funding requirement under IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirement and their interaction.
This advice concluded that recognition of a surplus is appropriate on the basis that the Company has an unconditional right to a refund of a surplus.
In respect of the RSP this on the basis that paragraph 11 a of IFRIC 14 applies enabling a refund of surplus during the life of the RSP.
In respect of the Morrison Scheme, this is on the basis that paragraph 11 b or 11 c of IFRIC 14 applies enabling a refund of surplus assuming the gradual settlement of the scheme liabilities over time until all members have left the scheme or the full settlement of the Schemes liabilities in a single event i. e. as a scheme wind up.
Amendments to the current version of IFRIC 14 are currently being considered.
The legal advice received by the Company has considered the proposed new wording to paragraph 12 A of IFRIC 14 concerning whether other parties have a unilateral power to use a schemes surplus to settle in full the schemes liabilities and has concluded that the above accounting treatment should not be affected by the current exposure draft, including the planned revised wording, to IFRIC 14.
The current best estimate of Company contributions to be paid to the defined benefit schemes for the accounting period commencing 29 January 2017 is 73m 2016: 59m.
This estimate includes amounts payable from the SLP and salary sacrificed contributions from employees.
