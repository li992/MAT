It is estimated that: a 1% increase in the discount rate would generate an impairment of 286m: a 10% reduction in future cash flows would generate an impairment of 115m: or a 1% reduction in growth rate would generate an impairment of 326m.

The reduction in amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings is mainly as a result of the loan waiver provided to a subsidiary company during the period see note 5.
