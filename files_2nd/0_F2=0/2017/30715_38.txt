169 GSK Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Governance and remuneration Financial statements Investor information 6.
Segment information Operating segments are reported based on the financial information provided to the Chief Executive Officer and the responsibilities of the Corporate Executive Team CET.
GSK reports results under four segments: Pharmaceuticals: Pharmaceuticals R&D: Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare, and individual members of the CET are responsible for each segment.
The Groups management reporting process allocates intra-Group profit on a product sale to the market in which that sale is recorded, and the profit analyses below have been presented on that basis.
As explained on page 58, from 1 January 2017 only significant legal charges have been excluded from segment profit and reported within other reconciling items between segment profit and operating profit.
Segment profits for 2016 and 2015 have been revised onto a comparable basis.
Corporate and other unallocated turnover and costs included the results of several Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare products which were held for sale in a number of markets in order to meet anti-trust approval requirements in 2015, together with the costs of corporate functions.
