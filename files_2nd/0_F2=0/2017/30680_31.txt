178 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2017 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONAL FINANCIAL RISK GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS GROUP AND OTHER & MARKETPLACE REVIEW REVIEW INFORMATION OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION continued NON-IFRS FINANCIAL INFORMATION ADJUSTED MEASURES These Financial Statements include financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
These measures, which include trading profit, trading profit margin, tax rate on trading results, EPSA, ROIC, trading cash flow, free cash flow, trading profit to trading cash conversion ratio, and underlying growth, exclude the effect of certain cash and non-cash items that Group management believes are not related to the underlying performance of the Group.
These non-IFRS financial measures are also used by management to make operating decisions because they facilitate internal comparisons of performance to historical results.
Non-IFRS financial measures are presented in these Financial Statements as the Groups management believe that they provide investors with a means of evaluating performance of the business segment and the consolidated Group on a consistent basis, similar to the way in which the Groups management evaluates performance, that is not otherwise apparent on an IFRS basis, given that certain non-recurring, infrequent, noncash and other items that management does not otherwise believe are indicative of the underlying performance of the consolidated Group may not be excluded when preparing financial measures under IFRS.
These non-IFRS measures should not be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, or superior to financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Underlying revenue growth Underlying growth in revenue is used to compare the revenue in a given year to the previous year on a like-for-like basis.
This is achieved by adjusting for the impact of sales of products acquired in material business combinations or disposed of and for movements in exchange rates.
Underlying growth in revenue is considered by the Group to be an important measure of performance in terms of local functional currency since it excludes those items considered to be outside the influence of local management.
The Groups management uses this non-IFRS measure in its internal financial reporting, budgeting and planning to assess performance on both a business and a consolidated Group basis.
Revenue growth atconstant currency is important in measuring business performance compared to competitors and compared to the growth of the market itself.
The Group considers that revenue from sales of products acquired in material business combinations results in a step-up in growth in revenue in the year of acquisition that cannot be wholly attributed to local managements efforts with respect to the business in the year of acquisition.
Depending on the timing of the acquisition, there will usually be a further step change in the following year.
A measure of growth excluding the effects of business combinations also allows senior management to evaluate the performance and relative impact of growth from the existing business and growth from acquisitions.
The process of making business acquisitions is directed, approved and funded from the Group corporate centre in line with strategic objectives.
The material limitation of the underlying growth in revenue measure isthat it excludes certain factors, described above, which ultimately have a significant impact on total revenues.
The Group compensates for this limitation by taking into account relative movements in exchange rates in its investment, strategic planning and resource allocation.
In addition, as the evaluation and assessment of business acquisitions is not within the control of local management, performance of acquisitions is monitored centrally until the business is integrated.
The Groups management considers that the non-IFRS measure of underlying growth in revenue and the IFRS measure of growth in revenue are complementary measures, neither of which management uses exclusively.
Underlying growth in revenue reconciles to growth in revenue reported, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS by making two adjustments, the constant currency exchange effect and the acquisitions and disposals effect, described below.
The constant currency exchange effect is a measure of the increase decrease in revenue resulting from currency movements on non-US Dollar sales and is measured as the difference between: 1 the increase decrease in the current year revenue translated into US Dollars at the current year average exchange rate and the prior revenue translated at the prior year rate: and 2 the increase decrease being measured by translating current and prior year revenues into US Dollars using the prior year closing rate.
The acquisitions and disposals effect is the measure of the impact on revenue from newly acquired material business combinations and recent material business disposals.
This is calculated by comparing the current year, constant currency actual revenue which include acquisitions and exclude disposals from the relevant date of completion with prior year, constant currency actual revenue, adjusted to include the results of acquisitions and exclude disposals for the commensurate period in the prior year.
These sales are separately tracked in the Groups internal reporting systems and are readily identifiable.

The Group has identified the following items, where material, as those to be excluded from operating profit and cash generated from operations when arriving at trading profit and trading cash flow, respectively: acquisition and disposal related items arising in connection with business combinations, including amortisation of acquisition intangible assets, impairments and integration costs: restructuring events: gains and losses resulting from legal disputes and uninsured losses.
In addition to these items, gains and losses that materially impact the Groups profitability or cash flows on a short-term or one-off basis and the cash cost to fund defined benefit pension schemes that are closed to future accrual are excluded from operating profit and cash generated from operations when arriving at trading profit and trading cash flow, respectively.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share EPSA EPSA is a trend measure, which presents the long-term profitability of the Group excluding the post-tax impact of specific transactions that management considers affect the Groups short-term profitability and the one-off impact of US tax reform.
The Group presents this measure to assist investors in their understanding of trends.
Adjusted attributable profit is the numerator used for this measure and is determined by adjusting attributable profit for the items that are excluded from operating profit when arriving at trading profit and items that are recognised below operating profit that affect the Groups short-term profitability.
The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS is basic earnings per ordinary share EPS.

183 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2017 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONAL FINANCIAL RISK GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS GROUP AND OTHER & MARKETPLACE REVIEW REVIEW INFORMATION 2016 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS COMMENTARY ON THE INCOME STATEMENT Group revenue increased by $35m, 1% on a reported basis, from $4,634m in 2015 to $4,669m in 2016.
The underlying increase is 2%, after adjusting for 1% attributable to the unfavourable impact of currency movements.
Cost of goods sold increased by $129m, 11% on a reported basis, from $1,143m in 2015 to $1,272m in 2016.
The movement is primarily due to underlying trading.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $275m 10% on a reported basis from $2,641m in 2015 to $2,366m in 2016.
In 2016, administrative expenses included amortisation of software and other intangible assets of $61m 2015: $66m, $62m of restructuring and rationalisation expenses 2015: $65m, an amount of $178m relating to amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles 2015: $204m, $9m of acquisition related costs 2015: $12m and $30m net credit primarily related to a $44m curtailment credit on UK post-retirement benefits 2015: $190m charge for legal and other charges.
Excluding the above items, selling, general and administrative expenses were $2,086m in 2016, a decrease of $18m from $2,104m in 2015.
Research and development expenditure as a percentage of revenue remained broadly consistent at 4.9% in 2016 2015: 4.8%.
Expenditure was $230m in 2016 compared to $222m in 2015.
The Group continues to invest in innovative technologies and products to differentiate it from competitors.
Operating profit increased by $173m from $628m in 2015 to $801m in 2016.
This movement in 2016 was primarily driven by the absence of costs recognised in 2015 relating to anticipated and settled metal-on-metal hip claims.
Net interest expense increased by $8m from a net $38m expense in 2015 to a net $46m expense in 2016.
This movement is primarily due to an increase in the effective interest rate and the increase in net debt due to the acquisition of Blue Belt Technologies.
Other finance costs in 2016 increased by $1m and principally relates to costs associated with the Groups retirement benefit schemes.
The taxation charge increased by $129m to $278m from $149m in 2015 principally due to the tax charge on the disposal of the Gynaecology business.
Our reported tax rate of 26.2% 2015: 26.7% includes the one-off benefit of a US tax settlement which is partly offset by the tax rate on the disposal of the predominantly US Gynaecology business.
COMMENTARY ON THE GROUP BALANCE SHEET Non-current assets increased by $123m to $4,815m in 2016 from $4,692m in 2015.
This is principally attributable to the following: Property, plant and equipment increased by $50m from $932m in 2015 to $982m in 2016.
There were $320m of additions together with $2m acquired with the Blue Belt acquisition which was partially offset by $21m of assets disposed.
Depreciation of $224m was charged during 2016 and there were unfavourable currency movements of $27m.
This movement relates to additions of $211m from the acquisition of Blue Belt and BST-CarGel.
This was partially offset by unfavourable currency movements of $35m.
Intangible assets decreased by $91m from $1,502m in 2015 to $1,411m in 2016.
There were additions of $72m in 2016 relating to intellectual property, distribution rights and software acquired together with $85m acquired with the Blue Belt and BST-CarGel acquisitions.
Amortisation and impairment during 2016 was $239m and there were unfavourable currency movements of $9m.
Investments increased to $25m from $13m in 2015.
The increase was attributable to additions of $2m and fair value remeasurement of $10m.
Deferred tax assets decreased by $8m in the year from $105m in 2015 to $97m in 2016.
The net deferred tax asset position is $3m 2015: asset of $28m.
The decrease of $25m is due to tax accrual to tax return adjustments and current year utilisation of net deferred tax assets offset by the impact of acquisitions of $15m.
Current assets increased by $54m to $2,529m from $2,475m in 2015.
The movement relates to the following: Inventories rose by $27m to $1,244m in 2016 from $1,217m in 2015.
This movement is driven by inventory increases in distribution hubs and general increase across the Emerging Markets.
This was offset by unfavourable currency movements of $26m.
The level of trade and other receivables increased by $47m to $1,185m in 2016 from $1,138m in 2015.
The movement primarily relates to increased trade receivables of $39m and $10m decrease in the bad debt provision as well as unfavourable currency movements.
Cash at bank has decreased by $20m from $120m in 2015 to $100m in 2016.
Current liabilities increased by $4m from $1,344m in 2015 to $1,348m in 2016.
This movement is attributable to: Bank overdrafts and loans increased by $40m from $46m in 2015 to $86m in 2016.
Trade and other payables increased by $42m from $842m in 2015 to $884m in 2016 primarily due to deferred consideration for acquisitions made in 2016.
Provisions decreased by $46m from $193m in 2015 to $147m in 2016 primarily due to utilisation of the legal provision for known and anticipated metal-on-metal hip claims.
Current tax payables decreased by $32m from $263m in 2015 to $231m, mainly attributable to differences in the timing of cash tax payments year-on-year.
