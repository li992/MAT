STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 101 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1: Corporate information Ferrexpo plc the Company is incorporated and registered in England, which is considered to be the country of domicile, with its registered office at 55 St Jamess Street, London SW1A 1LA, UK.
Ferrexpo plc and its subsidiaries the Group operate two mines and a processing plant near Kremenchug in Ukraine, have an interest in a port in Odessa and sales and marketing activities around the world including offices in Switzerland, Dubai, Japan, China, Singapore and Ukraine.
The Group also owns logistics assets in Austria which operate a fleet of vessels operating on the Rhine and Danube waterways and an ocean-going vessel which provides top off services and operates on international sea routes.
The Groups operations are vertically integrated from iron ore mining through to iron ore concentrate and pellet production and subsequent logistics.
The Groups mineral properties lie within the Kremenchug Magnetic Anomaly and are currently being extracted at the Gorishne-Plavninske and Lavrykivske GPL and Yerystivske deposits.
The majority shareholder of the Group is Fevamotinico S. a. r. l. Fevamotinico, a company incorporated in Luxembourg and ultimately owned by The Minco Trust, of which Kostyantin Zhevago, the Groups Chief Executive Officer, is a beneficiary.
At the time this report was published, Fevamotinico held 50.3% 2016: 50.3% of Ferrexpo plcs issued share capital.
Note 2: Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Ferrexpo plc and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for post-employment benefits measured in accordance with IAS 19 revised Employee benefits.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of US Dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand except where otherwise indicated.
The Group made changes to the presentation of its consolidated income statement in the consolidated financial statements.
These changes included: i the aggregation of Cost of sales, Selling and distribution expenses, General and administrative expenses, Other expenses, Write-offs, and Losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment into a single line item Operating expenses: and ii the removal of references to adjusted items and continued operations.
These changes simplify the presentation, enhance the understandability of the financial statements and better align with industry practice of other listed mining companies.
As a result, comparative period balances have been represented to align with these changes.
This presentation was already applied for the interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2017.
The detailed accounting policies are included in the disclosure notes to the specific financial statement accounts.
Going concern The Group has assessed that, taking into account: i its available cash and cash equivalents available at the date of authorisation of the consolidated financial statements: ii its cash flow projections for the period of managements going concern assessment: and iii events and conditions beyond the period of managements going concern assessment, in particular the debt repayments totalling US$177,022 thousand in April and May 2019, it has sufficient liquidity to meet its present obligations and cover working capital needs for the aforementioned period and will remain in compliance with its financial covenants throughout this period.
Therefore, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for the preparation of this set of financial statements.
See also the Directors Report on page 85 for further information.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements for Ferrexpo plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 December each year.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared as at the same reporting date as Ferrexpo plcs, using consistent accounting policies.
Subsidiaries acquired are fully consolidated from the date the Group obtains effective control.
Similarly, subsidiaries disposed of are deconsolidated from the date on which the Group ceases to hold effective control.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without obtaining or losing control is accounted for as an equity transaction.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated unless costs cannot be recovered.
Business combinations On the acquisition of a subsidiary, the business combination is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregated amount of the consideration transferred, measured at the date of acquisition.
The consideration paid is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of fair values at the date of acquisition.
Acquisition costs are expensed when incurred and included in general and administrative expenses.
Functional and presentational currencies Based on the economic substance of the underlying business transactions and circumstances relevant to the parent, the functional currency of the parent has been determined to be the US Dollar, with each subsidiary determining its own functional currency based on its own circumstances.
The Group has chosen the US Dollar as its presentational currency.
The functional currency of Ukrainian subsidiaries, which is where the Groups main operations are based, is the Ukrainian Hryvnia.
Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 102 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 2: Basis of preparation continued Foreign currency translation For individual subsidiary company accounts, transactions in foreign currencies i. e. other than the functional currency are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date and non-monetary assets and liabilities at the historic rate.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
For presentation of the Groups consolidated accounts, if the functional currency of a subsidiary is different to the presentational currency as at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of this entity are translated into the presentational currency at the rate ruling at the reporting date and the income statement is translated using the average exchange rate for the period based on the officially published rates by the National Bank of Ukraine NBU.
The foreign exchange differences arising are taken directly to a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity the deferred cumulative amount of exchange differences recognised in equity relating to the particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
Note 3: New accounting policies New standards and interpretations adopted The accounting policies and methods of computation adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Groups annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 except for the adoption of new amendments and improvements to IFRSs effective as of 1 January 2017.
These new standards and interpretations had no effect on reported results, financial position or disclosure in the financial statements: Amendment to IAS 7 Statement of cash flow Disclosure initiative Amendment to IAS 12 Income taxes Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 cycle New standards and interpretations not yet adopted The Group has elected not to adopt early any revised and amended standards or interpretations that are not yet mandatory in the EU.
The standards and interpretations below could have an impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments The complete standard was issued in July 2014 including the requirements previously issued and additional amendments and becomes effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The new standard replaces IAS 39 and includes a new expected loss impairment model, changes to the classification and measurement requirements of financial assets as well as to hedge accounting.
The impact of an expected loss impairment model does not materially impact the Groups consolidated financial statements on the basis i the Group does not have a history of credit losses: and ii there has not been a significant change in the mix, credit terms, or credit quality of the underlying counterparties as at 31 December 2017.
The changes to classification and measurement of financial instruments is unchanged on application of the new standard.
The Group does not apply hedge accounting under IAS 39 and does not intend to apply it under IFRS 9.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers The new standard was issued in May 2014 and outlines a single comprehensive model of accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes the current revenue recognition standard.
The new standard establishes the principles for the disclosure of useful information in the financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainties of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
The Group has assessed the impacts of transitioning to IFRS 15.
Under IFRS 15 the revenue recognition model will change from one based on the transfer of risk and reward of ownership to the transfer of control of ownership.
The Groups revenue is predominantly derived from sales of iron pellets, where the point of recognition is dependent on the contractual sales terms based on the International Commercial terms Incoterms.
As the time of the transfer of risks and rewards coincides with the transfer of a control, the timing and the amount of revenue recognised is unlikely to be materially affected for the majority of sales.
For the Incoterms Cost, Insurance and Freight CIF, and Cost and Freight CFR, the seller must contract for and pay the freight necessary to bring the goods to the named port of destination.
Consequently, the freight service on sales contracts with CIF and CFR Incoterms will meet the criteria of a separate performance obligation and a portion of the revenue earned under these contracts, representing the obligation to perform freight service, is deferred and recognised over time as this obligation is fulfilled, along with the associated costs.
The Group has assessed the impact of the CIF and CFR sales for the year ending 31 December 2017.
If the new standard were applied as of 31 December 2017, freight-related revenue of US$6,006 thousand would have been deferred, reducing revenue and the operating result by the same amount, and US$63,447 thousand would have been disclosed as freight-related revenue in Note 6, without an effect on the operating result.
The Group will apply IFRS 15 for the annual reporting periods beginning on 1 January 2018, with the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 15, recognised at the date of initial application.
Apart from the impact stated above, the Group does not anticipate the application of IFRS 15 to have a material impact on the financial position and or financial performance.
IFRS 16 Leases The new standard was issued in January 2016, replacing the previous leases standard, IAS 17 Leases, and related interpretations.
IFRS 16 establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for the customer lessee and the supplier lessor.
IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating or finance as is required by IAS 17.
Instead, it introduces a single lessee accounting model requiring a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the underlying asset has a low value or the Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 103 Note 3: New accounting policies continued lease term is 12 months or less.
Currently, the Group leases land and buildings under operating leases.
The vast majority of these operating leases are for land used for the extraction of ore and are not within the scope of IFRS 16 and will be accounted for under IFRS 6 Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources.
The Group expects that the new standard will primarily result in the recognition of right-of-use assets and liabilities in respect of the long-term rental contracts for its office premises in London, Dubai and Tokyo, land not used for the direct extraction of ore as well as for lease equipment.
This new standard applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 subject to EU endorsement and the Group does not intend to early adopt this standard.
If the new standard were applied as of 31 December 2017, right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities of US$15,167 thousand, before the effect from discounting, would have been recognised without an effect on the operating result.
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over income tax treatments The interpretation was issued in June 2017 and clarifies the accounting treatment for uncertainties in income taxes.
The new interpretation is to be applied to the determination of taxable results, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments under IAS 12, and becomes effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019 subject to EU endorsement.
The Group is in the process of performing the impact assessment and does not intend to apply early the new interpretation.
The Group does not expect an impact on its consolidated financial statements from all other standards, interpretations and amendments issued at the reporting date, but not yet to be adopted for these financial statements.
Note 4: Use of critical estimates and judgements The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
These estimates and judgements are based on information available as at the date of authorising the consolidated financial statements for issue.
Actual results could therefore differ from those estimates and judgements.
The Group identified a number of areas involving the use of critical estimates and judgements made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements and supporting information is embedded within the following disclosure notes: Critical estimates Note 12 Taxation recoverability of deferred tax assets Note 14 Property, plant and equipment deferred stripping costs Note 17 Inventories lean and weathered ore Critical judgements Note 12 Taxation tax legislation in Ukraine Note 31 Share capital and reserves net investments in foreign operations Note 5: Segment information The Group is managed as a single segment, which produces, develops and markets its principal product, iron ore pellets, for sale to the metallurgical industry.
While the revenue generated by the Group is monitored at a more detailed level, there are no separate measures of profit reported to the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
In accordance with IFRS 8 Operating segments, the Group presents its results in a single segment, which are disclosed in the income statement for the Group.
Management monitors the operating result of the Group based on a number of measures, including underlying EBITDA, gross profit and net debt.
Underlying EBITDA and gross profit The Group presents the underlying EBITDA as it is a useful measure for evaluating its ability to generate cash and its operating performance.
The Groups full definition of underlying EBITDA is disclosed in the Glossary on page 156.

Disclosure of revenue and non-current assets The Group does not generate significant revenues from external customers attributable to the United Kingdom, the Companys country of domicile.
The information on the revenues from external customers attributed to the individual foreign countries is given in Note 6.
The Group does not have any significant non-current assets that are located in the country of domicile of the Company.
The vast majority of the noncurrent assets are located in Ukraine.
Note 6: Revenue Accounting policy Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
The following specific recognition criteria are to be met before revenue is recognised: Sale of goods including sales of pellets and fuel from bunker business Revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, customs duties and sales taxes.
Risks and rewards of the ownership of goods pass when title for the goods passes to the customer as determined by the terms of the sales agreement.
The sales are typically made under the following terms: CIF Cost Insurance and Freight : CFR Cost and Freight : DAP Delivery At Place : or FOB Free on Board.
Under DAP terms, revenue is recognised when goods arrive at the agreed destination or at the border crossing, whereas under the other above mentioned terms the title passes on the date of the bill of lading.
If the sales agreement allows for adjustment of the sales prices based on survey of the goods by the customer e. g. ore content the revenue is recognised based on the most recent determined product specification.
Revenues related to provisionally priced sales are initially recognised at the estimated fair value of the consideration receivable based on the forward price at each reporting date for the relevant period outlined in the different contracts.
See Note 3 in terms of the impact of the new accounting standard IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers that becomes mandatory for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
Logistic services Revenue from logistic services rendered is recognised as the services are completed.
Where services are invoiced in advance of discharge, amounts attributable to the time between the end of the reporting period and the discharge date are deferred.
Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 105 Note 6: Revenue continued Other sales Other sales and services provided include predominantly the revenue generated from the sale of other materials and repair and maintenance works provided to third parties.

Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 106 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 7: Operating expenses before special items Accounting policy Operating expenses arise in the course of the ordinary activities of the Group and are recognised in the income statement when a decrease in future economic benefits related to a decrease in an asset or an increase of a liability has arisen that can be measured reliably.
Expenses are recognised in the income statement on the basis of a direct association between costs incurred and specific items of income.
When economic benefits are expected to arise over several accounting periods and the association with income can only be broadly or indirectly determined, expenses are systematically allocated to the accounting period in which the economic benefits are expected to arise.
Operating expenses for the year ended 31 December 2017 consisted of the following: Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.17 31.12.16 Cost of sales 411,490 400,333 Selling and distribution expenses 219,703 209,530 General and administrative expenses 41,954 38,647 Other operating expenses 43,800 38,550 Total operating expenses before special items 716,947 687,060 Operating expenses include: Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.17 31.12.16 Inventories recognised as an expense upon sale of goods 367,161 360,503 Employee costs 53,293 47,284 Inventory movements 1,846 11,311 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 45,920 50,233 Amortisation of intangible assets 472 438 Royalties and levies 19,610 15,294 Costs of logistics and bunker business 63,127 55,363 Audit and non-audit services 1,342 1,651 Community support donations 28,384 27,519 Losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment 7,754 4,448 Special items not included in the operating expenses are shown in Note 10.

Note 12: Taxation Accounting policy Current income tax Current income taxes are computed based on enacted or substantively enacted local tax rates and laws at the reporting date and the expected taxable incomes of the subsidiaries for the respective period.
Current income taxes are recognised as an expense or income in the consolidated income statement unless related to items recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity or if related to the initial accounting for a business combination.
Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for taxable temporary differences if it is probable that they will become taxable.
Deferred income tax assets are generally recognised for deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
No deferred assets or liabilities are recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction, other than in a business combination, which affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 110 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 12: Taxation continued Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets in relation to temporary differences on such investments and interests are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there are sufficient taxable profits available against which the benefits of the temporary differences can be utilised and that they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax assets to be utilised.
Additionally, unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.
Income tax effects on items directly recognised in other comprehensive income or equity are also recognised in other comprehensive income or equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Critical estimates Recoverability of deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets are recognised on temporary differences and available tax loss carry forwards when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered in a future period.
A deviation between expected and effective future taxable profits in the different local jurisdictions may have an adverse impact on the recognised deferred tax balances in the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
This is particularly the case for a deferred tax asset totalling US$28,822 thousand that was recognised for available tax loss carry forwards for a Ukrainian subsidiary during the financial year 2017 and with a carrying value of US$13,847 thousand as at 31 December 2017.
According to the currently enacted tax legislation, these available losses do not expire.
Assumptions about the generation of expected future taxable profits depend on managements estimates of future cash flows, which depend on estimates of future production and sales volumes, commodity prices and operating costs.
Further, the Group derecognised a deferred tax asset of US$25,396 thousand Note 10 on the basis that the liquidator of the Groups former transactional bank in Ukraine has not recognised all of the Groups claims of cash and deposit balances, for which a loss was recorded by the Group in 2015.
The Group is currently in legal dispute to have the claims recognised Note 30.
Assessing the probability of the Groups claims being recognised is highly subjective and will ultimately depend on the outcome of the court proceedings in Ukraine.
Critical judgements Tax legislation in Ukraine The Group prices its sales between its subsidiaries using international benchmark prices for comparable products covering product quality and applicable freight.
The Group judges these to be on terms which comply with applicable legislation.
In August 2017, the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine SFS commenced a tax audit at the Groups major subsidiary in Ukraine with a focus on cross-border transactions in terms of its pellet sales to another subsidiary of the Group.
According to the current legislation, the SFS has to complete this audit within 18 months from the commencement.
No provision has been booked as at 31 December 2017.
Following a tax audit at PJSC Ferrexpo Poltava Mining FPM claims were made by the Ukrainian tax authorities in relation to allegedly unpaid withholding tax totalling US$6,057 thousand UAH170 million and associated fines and penalties of US$1,496 thousand UAH42 million in respect of interest paid to a subsidiary of the Group in the United Kingdom in 2013 and 2014.
Following the audits for aforementioned years, the Ukrainian tax authorities also initiated tax audits for the years 2015 and 2016.
The management of the Group expects to continue to successfully defend any claims made by the tax authorities in the Ukrainian courts.
Consequently, no provision has been made for the claimed withholding tax and associated fines and penalties as at 31 December 2017.
The income tax expense for the year ended 31 December 2017 consisted of the following: Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.17 31.12.16 Current income tax Current income tax charge 45,423 40,542 Amounts related to previous years 4,154 1,440 Total current income tax 41,269 41,982 Deferred income tax Origination and reversal of temporary differences 14,092 216 Total deferred income tax 14,092 216 Total income tax expense 55,361 42,198 Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 111 Note 12: Taxation continued The amounts related to the prior year shown in table on the previous page are predominantly related to effects from final tax assessments received in Switzerland during the year ended 31 December 2017 and in the United Kingdom during the comparative year ended 31 December 2016.
As a result of the final tax assessments received, a recorded tax accrual in Switzerland could be released in financial year 2017 whereas in the financial year 2016 an income receivable balance recorded in the United Kingdom in a previous year had to be derecognised.
Tax effects on items charged to the statement of other comprehensive income consisted of the following for the year ended 31 December 2017: Year ended Year ended US$000 Notes 31.12.17 31.12.16 Tax effect of exchange differences arising on translating foreign operations 31 4,557 16,607 Tax effect of remeasurement gains on defined benefit pension liability 1,556 246 Total income taxes charged to other comprehensive income 6,113 16,361 The weighted average statutory corporate income tax rate is calculated as the average of the statutory tax rates applicable in the countries in which the Group operates, weighted by the profits and losses before tax of the subsidiaries in the respective countries, as included in the consolidated financial information.
The weighted average statutory corporate income tax rate was 13.5% for the financial year 2017 2016:8.9%.
A reconciliation between the income tax charged in the accompanying financial information and income before taxes multiplied by theweighted average statutory tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2017 is as follows: Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.17 31.12.16 Profit before tax 449,833 231,398 Notional tax charge computed at the weighted average statutory tax rate of 13.5% 2016: 8.9% 60,819 20,594 1 Derecognition of deferred tax assets 25,396 2 Reassessment of prior year temporary differences 5,919 1,148 3 Effect from capitalisation of tax loss carry forwards 24,026 4 Expenses not deductible for local tax purposes 7,295 7,828 Income exempted for local tax purposes 2,385 1,588 5 Income for local tax purposes 1,039 7,767 Effect from change in permanent differences 1,957 6 Non-recognition of deferred taxes on current year losses 4,552 7 Tax effect related to previous years 4,154 1,440 Effect of higher local tax rate on special items 1,003 Other including translation differences 747 1,460 Total income tax expense 55,361 42,198 1 Derecognition of deferred tax assets includes the effect in the amount of US$25,396 thousand in respect of an allowance recorded on restricted cash and deposits balances.
See Note 10 and Note 30 for further information.
2 Reassessment of prior year temporary differences in the year ended 31 December 2017 predominantly relates to previously unrecognised deferred taxes on temporary differences for a Ukrainian subsidiary, which became profitable in 2017.
This effect is expected to be non-recurring.
The effect from the reassessment in the comparative year relates to interest expenses from previous years that became deductible in Ukraine in 2017 as the subsidiaries are profitable again.
Depending on the level of taxable result in future years, additional interest expenses might become deductible.. 3 Effect in the year ended 31 December 2017 is related to the capitalisation of all available tax losses for a Ukrainian subsidiary that become profitable in 2017.
As the entire balance of available tax loss carry forwards was recognised as deferred tax asset, the effect is expected to be of a non-recurring nature.
4 Effect in the year ended 31 December 2017 predominantly relates to expenses not deductible in Ukraine and Switzerland.
The effect in Switzerland is expected to be non-recurring whereas the one in Ukraine is expected to be recurring to a certain extent as a portion of operating expenses is historically not deductible for tax purposes according to the enacted local tax legislation.
5 Reconciling item in the year ended 31 December 2017 relates to an income taxable in Switzerland, which is expected to be of a recurring nature, whereas the item in the comparative year relates to an adjustment made in Ukraine in respect of sales of pellets to subsidiaries of the Group abroad in order to address the changes in the local transfer pricing law, which is expected to be non-recurring.
6 Non-recognition of deferred taxes on current year losses due to the uncertainty in respect of the timing of the subsidiaries becoming profitable for local tax purposes, which, depending on the level of taxable results of the Groups subsidiaries in the different jurisdictions, might be of a recurring nature.
7 Effects are related to final tax assessments received in Switzerland in the current and in the United Kingdom in the comparative year.
Both effects are expected to be of a non-recurring nature.

Note 13: Earnings per share and dividends paid and proposed Accounting policy Basic number of Ordinary Shares outstanding The basic number of Ordinary Shares is calculated by reducing the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue by the weighted average of shares held in treasury and employee benefit trust reserve.
The basic earnings per share EPS are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity shareholders of Ferrexpo plc by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares.
Dilutive potential Ordinary Shares The dilutive potential Ordinary Shares outstanding are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue on the assumption of conversion of all potentially dilutive Ordinary Shares.
All share awards that are potentially dilutive are considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
Distributable reserves Ferrexpo plc the Company is the Groups holding company, with no direct operating business, so its ability to make distributions to its shareholders is dependent on its ability to access profits held in the subsidiaries.
The Groups consolidated retained earnings shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity do not reflect the profits available for distribution in the Group as of 31 December 2017.

Note 14: Property, plant and equipment Accounting policy Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and or accumulated impairment losses.
Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment and borrowing costs for qualifying assets see below if the recognition criteria are met.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
Major spare parts and servicing equipment qualify as property, plant and equipment when they are expected to be used during more than one period.
Expenditure incurred after the assets have been put into operation, such as repairs and maintenance and overhaul costs, are charged to the income statement in the period the costs are incurred unless it can be demonstrated that the expenditure results in future economic benefits, when the expenditure is capitalised as an additional cost.
Upon recognition, items of property, plant and equipment are divided into components, which represent items with a significant value that have different useful lives.
Assets included in property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful life taking into account their own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the assets are located.
The remaining useful lives for major assets are reassessed on a regular basis.
Changes in estimates, which affect the unit of production calculations, are accounted for prospectively.
Except for mining assets, which are depreciated using the unit of production method, depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, as follows: Buildings: 2050 years Vessels: 3040 years Plant and equipment: 315 years Vehicles: 715 years Fixtures and fittings: 2.510 years An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item is included in the income statement in the period the item is derecognised.
Assets in the course of construction are initially recognised in assets under construction.
Assets under construction are not depreciated.
On completion of the asset and when available for use, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate asset category in property, plant and equipment and depreciation commences.
Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 115 Note 14: Property, plant and equipment continued Freehold land is not depreciated.
Deferred stripping costs Rock, soil and other waste materials are typically to be removed to access an ore body, which is known as stripping activity.
Stripping work comprises overburden removal at pre-production, mine extension and production stages.
Pre-production stripping costs incurred in the development of a component of a mine before commercial production commences are capitalised as part of assets under construction.
After the commencement of commercial production, the respective capitalised pre-production stripping costs are transferred to mining assets and depreciated over the life of the respective component of the ore body on a unit of production UOP basis.
Production stripping costs are generally charged to the income statement as variable production costs unless these costs are related to gaining improved access to an identified component of the ore body to be mined in future periods.
Such production stripping costs are capitalised within mining assets provided all the following conditions are met: it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the stripping activity will be realised: the component of the ore body for which access has been improved can be identified: and the costs relating to the stripping activity associated with the improved access can be reliably measured.
Once the commercial production of the specific component of the ore body commences, the capitalised production stripping costs are depreciated on a UOP basis over the life of the respective identified component.
No production stripping costs were capitalised as at 31 December 2017 2016: nil.
Mining assets Any capitalised stripping activities, either of a pre-production or production nature, are reclassified to mining assets at the point of time when the extraction of the ore body of the specific component starts.
Mining assets are depreciated using the UOP method based on the estimated economically recoverable reserves to which they relate.
Exploration and evaluation assets Costs incurred in relation to the exploration and evaluation of potential iron ore deposits are capitalised and classified as tangible or intangible assets depending on the nature of the expenditures.
Costs associated with exploratory drilling, researching and analysing of exploration data and costs of pre-feasibility studies are included in tangible assets whereas those associated with the acquisition of licences are included in intangible assets.
Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditures are carried forward as an asset as long as these costs are expected to be recouped in full through successful development and exploration in a future period.
Exploration and evaluation assets are measured at cost and are neither amortised nor depreciated, but monitored for indications of impairment.
To the extent that the capitalised expenditures are not expected to be recouped the excess is fully provided for in the financial year in which this is determined.
Upon reaching the development stage, exploration and evaluation assets are either transferred to assets under construction or other intangible assets, if those costs were associated with the acquisition of licences.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective asset.
All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur.
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs incurred in connection with the borrowing of the funds.
In the case of general borrowings used to fund the acquisition or construction of a qualifying asset, the borrowing costs to be capitalised are calculated based on a weighted average interest rate applicable to the relevant general borrowings of the Group during aspecific period.
Impairment testing Property, plant and equipment is considered to be part of a single cash-generating unit CGU.
The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined to be the fair value less cost of disposal.
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there are indications that assets may be impaired or previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset, such as goodwill, is required, the Group estimates the assets recoverable amounts.
If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Individual balances of receivables and prepayments are assessed at each reporting date and written off when management deems that there is no possibility of recovery.
Further information on the result of the annual impairment testing of goodwill is provided in Note 15.
Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 116 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 14: Property, plant and equipment continued A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
In this case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount, but not exceeding the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognised in the income statement and the basis for future depreciation is adjusted accordingly.
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
Critical estimates Capitalised stripping costs Stripping costs are deferred and capitalised if related to gaining improved access to an identified component of an ore body to be mined in future periods.
The capitalised amount is determined based on the volume of waste extracted, compared with expected ore volume in the identified component of the ore body.
The identification of the components of a mines ore body is a critical estimate and is made by reference to the respective life of mine plan, which depends on a range of factors, including the price of iron ore, the cost of extraction and the mines specific operational features.
Changes to the life of mine plan, including the life and design of a mine, may result in changes to the expected stripping ratios waste to ore extracted and may result in the capitalisation of production stripping costs or adjustments of the carrying value of stripping costs capitalised in previous periods.
As at 31 December 2017, deferred pre-production stripping costs totalling US$110,124 thousand relate to components in operation and are included in mining assets.
Deferred pre-production stripping costs in relation to components expected to be put into operation in a future period totalled US$22,734 thousand and are included in assets under construction.
No production stripping costs are capitalised as of this point of time.
Once production commences, stripping costs are transferred to mining assets.
Property, plant and equipment includes capitalised borrowing costs on qualifying assets of US$17,810 thousand 2016: US$15,454 thousand.
The capitalised borrowing costs on general borrowings were determined based on the capitalisation rate of 9.0% 2016: 7.8%, which is the average effective interest rate on general borrowings during the period.
The Group has no specific borrowings in relation to qualifying assets during either reporting period.
The carrying value of equipment held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts at 31 December 2017 was US$2,214 thousand 2016: US$2,746 thousand.
Leased assets and assets under hire purchase contracts are pledged as security for the related finance leases and hire purchase liabilities.
US$47,921 thousand of property, plant and equipment have been pledged as security for liabilities 2016: US$47,236 thousand.
The gross value of fully depreciated property, plant and equipment that is still in use is US$24,728 thousand 2016: US$20,553 thousand.
Note 15: Goodwill and other intangible assets Accounting policy Goodwill If the cost of acquisition in a business combination exceeds the identifiable net assets attributable to the Group, the difference is considered as purchased goodwill, which is not amortised.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for indication of impairment annually and, in case those are identified, an impairment assessment is conducted.
Animpairment loss recognised for goodwill is never reversed in a subsequent period.
In the case that the identifiable net assets attributable to the Group exceed the cost of acquisition, the difference is recognised in profit and loss as a gain on bargain purchase.
For each business combination, the Group measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
If the initial accounting for a business combination cannot be completed by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, only provisional amounts are reported, which can be adjusted during the measurement period of 12 months after acquisition date.
Exploration and evaluation assets See policy disclosed in Note 14.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost and the useful lives are assessed as either finite or indefinite.
Following the initial recognition, the intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
If amortised, the intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, ranging between one and three years.
Capitalised mineral licences are amortised on a unit of production basis.
The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is its fair value as at the date of acquisition.

This represents the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The major component of other intangible assets comprises mining licences and purchased software.
Impairment testing Impairment testing was performed at 31 December 2017 based on a fair value less cost of disposal calculation using cash flow projections over the remaining estimated lives of the GPL and the Yerystivske deposits, which are expected to expire in 2038 and 2048, respectively, according to the current approved mine plans.
The estimated production volumes are based on these mine plans and do not take into account the effects of expected future mine life extension programmes.
The cash flow projection is based on a financial long-term model approved by the senior management covering the expected life of the mines.
The production capacity remains at a fixed level once full capacity is reached and therefore no perpetual growth rate is applied for the cash flow projections beyond this point of time.
Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 119 Note 15: Goodwill and other intangible assets continued The key assumptions used for the impairment testing are: Estimates assumptions Basis Future production: Proved and probable reserves Commodity prices: Contract prices and longer-term price estimates Cost of raw materials and other production distribution costs: Expected future costs Exchange rates: Current market exchange rates Discount rates: Cost of capital risk adjusted for the resource concerned Cash flows are projected based on managements expectations regarding the development of the iron ore and steel market and the cost of producing and distributing the pellets.
The Group takes into account two key assumptions: selling price and total production costs considering relevant macro and local factors.
In determining the future long-term selling price, the Group takes into account external and internal analysis of the longer-term and shorterterm supply and demand dynamics in the local region and throughout the world along with costs of production of competitors and the marginal cost of incremental production in a particular market.
The Group considers local supply and demand balances affecting its major customers and the effects this could have on the longer-term price.
The assumptions for iron ore prices ranged from US$60 per tonne to US$63 per tonne of 62% Fe fines CFR North China 2016: US$55 per tonne to US$62 per tonne.
Cost of production and shipping is considered taking into account local inflationary pressures, major exchange rate developments between local currency and the US Dollar, the longer-term and shorter-term trends in energy supply and demand and the effect on costs along with the expected movements in steel-related commodity prices, which affect the cost of certain production inputs.
For the purpose of the goodwill impairment test, the future cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 14.0% 2016: 14.0% per annum.
These rates reflect the time value of money and risk associated with the asset, and are in line with the rates used by competitors with a similar background.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Management believes that due to the available headroom resulting from the Groups impairment testing of its operating assets, no reasonable change in the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of these operating assets to materially exceed its recoverable amount.

Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition are accounted for as follows: Raw materials at cost on a first-in, first-out basis.
Finished goods and work in progress at cost of direct materials and labour and a proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal operating capacity, but excluding borrowing costs.
Lean and weathered ore at cost, if lower than net realisable value.
The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion conversion into pellets or concentrate and the estimated costs necessary to sell the product or goods.
Major spare parts and servicing equipment that meet the definition of property, plant and equipment are, in accordance with IAS 16, included in property, plant and equipment and not in inventory.
Critical estimates Lean and weathered ore Iron ore of various grades is being extracted at the Groups two operating mines GPL and Yerystivske.
In order to maximise the operational efficiency and output of the processing facility at FPM, management determines the optimal mix and grade of ore to be delivered to the processing facility from each mine.
During the last financial years, including the financial year 2017, ore of a lower iron content was stockpiled due to limited processing capacities.
It is the Groups intention to process the stockpiled ore once additional processing capacities are available.
This additional capacity is currently being constructed and expected to be completed during the financial year 2020 and as a consequence the entire balance is classified as non-current.
As at 31 December 2017, the ore valued at cost totalled US$175,831 thousand.
Critical estimates in determining the net realisable value of the lean and weathered ore includes i the expected timing of the completion of the capacity upgrade programme at FPM, ii forecast iron ore pellet prices, and iii the estimated cost to process the ore into iron ore pellets.
Separate stress tests have been performed, which assumed the lowest forecast iron ore price from a set of brokers, a one-year delay in the completion of the additional capacity and 10% increase in processing costs and under each scenario the cost value remained recoverable.
At 31 December 2017, inventories comprised: As at As at US$000 31.12.17 31.12.16 Raw materials and consumables 34,295 26,847 Spare parts 42,053 35,603 Finished ore pellets 15,482 12,408 Work in progress 2,475 2,522 Other 2,340 1,555 Total inventories current 96,645 78,935 Lean and weathered ore 175,831 130,357 Total inventories non-current 175,831 130,357 Total inventories 272,476 209,292 Inventories classified as non-current mainly comprise lean and weathered ore that are, based on the Groups current processing plans, not planned to be processed within the next year.
It is the Groups intention to process this ore at a later point of time and it is expected that it will take more than one year to process this stockpile, depending on the Groups future mining activities, processing capabilities and anticipated market conditions.

An allowance for doubtful debts is recorded when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Individual balances are written off when management deems that there is no possibility of recovery.
Trade receivables include provisionally priced sales, which are open at the end of the reporting period.
Certain contracts have embedded provisional pricing mechanisms, which have the character of commodity derivatives that are carried at fair value through profit and loss.
Revenues on these contracts are initially recognised at the estimated fair value of consideration receivable, based on the contractual price, and adjusted at the end of each subsequent reporting period on the basis of changes in iron ore prices and the specific underlying contract terms.
Final prices based on the relevant index are normally known within 60 days after the reporting period.

Note 22: Pension and post-employment obligations Accounting policy The defined benefit costs relating to the plans operated by the Group in the different countries are determined and accrued in the consolidated financial statements using the projected unit credit method for those employees entitled to such payments.
The underlying assumptions are defined by management and the defined benefit pension liability is calculated by independent actuaries at the end of each annual reporting period.
Remeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, are immediately reflected in the statement of financial position.
The corresponding charge or credit is recognised in the other comprehensive income of the period in which it occurred and immediately reflected in retained earnings as not reclassified to the income statement in subsequent periods.
The costs of managing plan assets are deducted from the return on plan assets reflected in other comprehensive income.
All other scheme administration costs are charged to the income statement.
The net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit pension liability or plan assets.
Any past service costs are recognised in the income statement at the earlier of when the plan amendment occurs or when related restructuring costs are recognised.
The service costs including current and past are included in cost of sales, selling and distribution expenses and general and administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement whereas the net finance expenses are included in finance expenses.
The effects from remeasurements are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The defined benefit pension liability is the aggregate of the defined benefit obligation less plan assets of funded schemes.
The Group operates funded and unfunded schemes.
The Groups expenses in relation to defined contribution plans are charged directly to the income statement.
The Group mainly operates defined benefit plans for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in Ukraine and Switzerland.
All local defined benefit pension liabilities are calculated by independent actuaries applying accepted actuarial techniques.
In addition to the aforementioned schemes, the Group operates a defined benefit scheme in Austria and contribution plans for qualifying employees in the United Kingdom and in Singapore.
Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 124 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 22: Pension and post-employment obligations continued Details of the major defined benefit schemes in Ukraine and Switzerland are provided below: Ukraine The Group makes defined contributions to the Ukrainian State Pension scheme at statutory rates based on gross salary payments for the employees of PJSC Ferrexpo Poltava Mining FPM and LLC Ferrexpo Yeristovo Mining FYM.
The Group also has a legal obligation to compensate the Ukrainian State Pension Fund for additional pensions paid to certain categories of the current and former employees of the Group.
Additionally, the Group had a legal obligation to its employees in the form of a collective agreement to make a one-off payment on retirement to employees with a long term of service which was also included in the pension liability before the end of the financial year 2017.
All pension schemes in Ukraine are unfunded.
In October 2017, the Ukrainian pension legislation was changed by adjusting the average state salary for the years 2014 to 2018, stepwise increasing insurance length of services and decreasing the coefficient for one year of service.
Following the change to the pension legislation, the pensions for the current pensioners have been recalculated and resulted in a past service cost gain of US$4,038 thousand as of 31 December 2017 for both Ukrainian schemes.
As of 1 December 2017, the collective agreement for FPM was changed in order to remove FPMs obligation of additional payments to its employees reaching the retirement age in order to improve their welfare.
This change affected 6,992 employees and resulted in a curtailment gain of US$655 thousand.
At 31 December 2017, the pension schemes in Ukraine covered 4,302 current employees 2016: 8,735 people following the above-mentioned change of the collective agreement for FPM.
There are 956 former employees currently in receipt of pensions 2016: 1,026 people.
Switzerland The employees of the Groups Swiss operation are covered under a collective pension plan multi-employer plan, which is governed in accordance with the requirements of Swiss law.
The funding, of which two-thirds is contributed by the employer and one-third by the employees, is based on the regulations of the pension scheme and Swiss law.
The pension scheme in Switzerland is funded and the assets of the pension scheme are held separately from those of the Group and are invested with an insurance company.
The accumulated capital of the employees is subject to interests determined by the local legislation and defined in the regulations of the pension scheme.
On retirement, employees are entitled to receive either a lump sum or an annual proportion of their accumulated capital as a pension underpinned by certain guarantees.
The Group, and in certain cases the employees, make contributions to the pension scheme as a percentage of the insured salaries and depending on the age of the employees.
At 31 December 2017, the Swiss pension scheme covered 20 people 2016: 20 people.

Contributions to the defined benefit plans, including benefits paid by employer and employee contributions, are expected to be US$1,685 thousand for the schemes in Ukraine and US$659 thousand in Switzerland in the next financial year.
The expenses in relation to the defined contribution plan in the United Kingdom and Singapore totalled US$50 thousand 2016: US$67 thousand.

Taking into account the requirements of Swiss law, it is assumed that equities and bonds reflect investments into quoted assets whereas a portion of the other assets in the portfolio could be investments into non-quoted assets.
Changes to interest rates and future salary increases in Ukraine are considered to be the main pension-related risks for the Group, as such changes are likely to affect the balance of the Groups defined benefit obligation.
The percentage used to calculate the sensitivities was set under consideration of the volatility for these assumptions for the Ukrainian schemes and has also been applied for the Groups less material schemes in other jurisdictions.
Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 127 Note 22: Pension and post-employment obligations continued Changes to the significant assumptions would have the following effects on the defined benefit obligation in the different jurisdictions: Year ended 31.12.17 Ukrainian Swiss Other Ukrainian Swiss Other US$000 schemes scheme jurisdictions schemes scheme jurisdictions Increase by Decrease by 1.0% or 1.0% or 1.0% or 1.0% or 1.0% or 1.0% or Change 1 year 1 year 1 year 1 year 1 year 1 year Discount rate % 1,587 868 9 1,845 1,221 10 Future salary increases % 1,324 181 8 1,178 162 9 Local inflation % 249 6 n a 247 6 n a Indexation of pension % n a 556 n a n a n a n a Life expectancy years 286 102 n a 335 102 n a Following new rules in the Ukrainian pension legislation, the pension indexation is defined by the future salary increases and the local inflation rate.

The methods and assumptions used for the sensitivity analysis for the prior year are unchanged.
Note 23: Provisions Accounting policy General Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Site restoration Site restoration provisions are made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure and restoration and for environmental rehabilitation costs determined by an independent expert in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs.
The provision is discounted, if material, and the unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs.
At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future benefit and depreciated over future production from the mine to which it relates.
The provision is reviewed on an annual basis for changes in cost estimates, discount rates or the life of operations.
The provision for site restoration changed as follows during the financial year 2017: Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.17 31.12.16 Opening balance 1,071 975 Unwind of the discount 150 141 Charge to the income statement 904 76 Translation differences 55 121 Closing balance 2,070 1,071 Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 128 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 23: Provisions continued The costs of restoration of the different deposits in the Groups open pit mines are based on amounts determined by an independent and credited institute taking into account the codes of practice and laws applicable in Ukraine.
The useful lives of the different pits and mines are determined by the same institute based on expected annual stripping and production volumes having taken into account the expected timing and effect of future mine-life extension programmes.
It is expected that the restoration works of the GPL mine will start after the years 2038, 2041 and 2061 depending on the different areas within the mine.
The first restoration work of the Yerystivske mine is expected to start after2032.
The provision represents the discounted value of the estimated costs of decommissioning and restoring the mines at the dates when the deposits are expected to be depleted in the relevant areas within the mine.
The present value of the provision has been calculated in Ukrainian Hryvnia using a nominal pre-tax discount rate of 13.0% 2016: 16.0% and the costs are expected to be incurred once the restoration works begin in the different areas of the mines.
Uncertainties in estimating the provision include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning and reclamation alternatives and the discount and inflation rates to be used in the calculations.

The first instalment is due on 31 March 2019 and the final maturity date is 31 December 2020.
The aforementioned major bank debt facilities were guaranteed and secured as follows: Ferrexpo AG and Ferrexpo Middle East FZE assigned the rights to revenue from certain sales contracts: PJSC Ferrexpo Poltava Mining assigned all of its rights of certain export contracts for the sale of pellets to Ferrexpo AG and Ferrexpo Middle East FZE: and the Group pledged bank accounts of Ferrexpo AG and Ferrexpo Middle East FZE into which sales proceeds from assigned sales contracts are exclusively received.
In addition to the major bank debt facilities listed above, the Group has outstanding unsecured Notes at par value totalling US$346,385 thousand as at 31 December 2017 which fall due in two equal instalments of US$173,193 thousand on 7 April 2018 and 2019, respectively.
The Notes have a 10.375% interest coupon payable semi-annually.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had no open trade finance facilities 2016: US$19,025 thousand.
Trade finance facilities are secured against receivables related to these specific trades.
All facilities are shown net of associated arrangement fees, except for the revolving syndicated pre-export finance facilities, for which the fees are presented in prepayments and current assets and other non-current assets based on the maturity of the underlying facility and are amortised over the term of the facility.

Note 27: Financial instruments Accounting policy Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.
Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities e. g. promissory notes, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings and trade and other payables.
Derivative financial instruments Except for the provisionally priced receivables disclosed in Note 18, the Group does not hold any derivative financial instruments.
Initial measurement Non-derivative financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value.
Any transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets or financial liabilities are added or deducted from its fair value except for financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through the income statement.
For those financial assets and financial liabilities, the transaction costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date i. e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Regular way purchases or sales are those that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
The subsequent measurement is based on the classification of the financial instruments.
Subsequent measurement Financial assets Loans and receivables Except for the provisionally priced receivables disclosed in Note 18, loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired along with the amortisation process.
Other Other non-derivative financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses.
Financial liabilities Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 131 Note 27: Financial instruments continued Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced either directly or through use of an allowance account.
The amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant.
If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and it is objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is to be reversed.
Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
The accounting classification of each category of financial instruments, and their carrying amounts, are set out below: As at 31.12.17 Financial liabilities measured at Loans and amortised US$000 Notes receivables cost Total Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 25 97,742 97,742 Trade and other receivables 18 88,327 88,327 Other financial assets 620 620 Total financial assets 186,689 186,689 Financial liabilities Trade and other payables 21 48,428 48,428 Accrued liabilities 24 15,956 15,956 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 26 501,064 501,064 Total financial liabilities 565,448 565,448 As at 31.12.16 Financial liabilities measured at Loans and amortised US$000 Notes receivables cost Total Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 25 144,751 144,751 Trade and other receivables 18 90,568 90,568 Other financial assets 877 877 Total financial assets 236,196 236,196 Financial liabilities Trade and other payables 21 28,807 28,807 Accrued liabilities 24 12,540 12,540 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 26 733,702 733,702 Total financial liabilities 775,049 775,049 Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 132 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 27: Financial instruments continued Fair values and impairment testing Financial assets and other financial liabilities The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and payables are approximately equal to their carrying amounts due to their short maturity.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings The fair values of interest-bearing loans and borrowings are based on the discounted cash flows using market interest rates except for the fair value of the Eurobond issued, which is based on the market price quotation at the reporting date.
The fair values of interest-bearing loans and borrowings totalled US$526,599 thousand 2016: US$743,888 thousand.
Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position Except for the provisionally priced trade receivables Level 2 disclosed in Note 18, the Group does not have any financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Level 1 to Level 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 in these periods.
Financial risk management Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk: liquidity risk: market risk including currency and commodity risk.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee and the CFO.
The Group operates a centralised financial risk management structure under the management of the Executive Committee, accountable to the Board.
The Executive Committee delegates certain responsibilities to the CFO.
The CFOs responsibilities include authority for approving all new physical, commercial or financial transactions that create a financial risk for the Group.
Additionally, the CFO controls the management of treasury risks within each of the business units in accordance with a Board-approved Treasury Policy.
Financial instrument risk exposure and management Natural hedges that can be identified and their effectiveness quantified are used in preference to financial risk management instruments.
Derivative transactions may be executed for risk mitigation purposes only speculation is not permitted under the approved Treasury Policy and are designed to have the effect of reducing risk on underlying market or credit exposures.
Appropriate operational controls ensure operational risks are not increased disproportionately to the reduction in market or credit risk.
The Group has not used any financial risk management instruments that are derivative in nature, or other hedging instruments, in this or prior periods.
Credit risk Trade and other receivables The Group, through its trading operations, enters into binding contracts, which contain obligations that create exposure to credit, counterparty and country risks.
It is the primary objective of the Group to manage such risks to reduce uncertainty of collection from buyers.
A secondary objective is to minimise the cost of reducing risks within acceptable parameters.
Trade finance is used to balance risk and payment.
These risks include the creditworthiness of the buyer, and the political and economic stability of the buyers country.
Trade finance generally refers to the financing of individual transactions or a series of revolving transactions and are often self-liquidating, whereby the lending bank stipulates that all sales proceeds to be collected are applied to settle the loan, the remainder returned to the Group.
Trade finance transactions are approved by the Group Treasurer.
The primary objective is to ensure that the margins paid and conditions applicable should be the same as, or better than, those which other organisations with similar creditworthiness would achieve, and compared with other financing available to the Group.
Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 133 Note 27: Financial instruments continued Credit risk is the risk associated with the possibility that a buyer will default, by failing to make required payments in a timely manner or to comply with other conditions of an obligation or agreement.
Where appropriate, the Group uses letters of credit to assist in mitigating such risks.
Counterparty risk crystallises when a party to an agreement defaults.
Where letters of credit are used to minimise this risk, the Group uses a confirming bank with a similar or higher credit rating to mitigate country and or credit risk of the issuing bank.
Country risk is the potential volatility of foreign assets, whether receivables or investments, that is due to political and or financial events in a given country.
Group Treasury monitors the concentration of all outstanding risks associated with any entity or country, and reports to the Group CFO on a timely basis.
Investment securities Outside Ukraine the Group limits its cash exposure to credit, counterparty and country risk by only investing in liquid securities and with counterparties that are incorporated in an A or better S&P rated OECD country.
A ratings approach is used to determine maximum exposure to each counterparty.
Cash not required within three months for production, distribution and capital expenditures is invested with counterparties rated by S&P or Moodys at a level of long-term BBB S&P or short-term A3 S&P or better.
Recognising that the principal activities of the Group are predominantly in Ukraine, special consideration is given to Ukrainian transactional banking counterparties where the sector is small and constrained by the sovereign credit rating.
Exceptions may be made under the following conditions: the counterparty is resident in Ukraine: and the counterparty is included in the top 15 financial institutions in Ukraine based on the Groups assessment of the financial institution.
Subsequent to the declaration of insolvency of the Groups former transactional bank in Ukraine see Note 30, the Group changed its transactional banking arrangements and is currently working with four banks in Ukraine, all of them being subsidiaries of Western banks, and is still exposed to Ukraine country and banking sector risk in this respect.
Guarantees The Groups policy is to provide financial guarantees under limited circumstances only for the benefit of wholly owned or substantially wholly owned subsidiaries.
At 31 December 2017, Ferrexpo AG, Ferrexpo Finance plc and Ferrexpo Middle East FZE were jointly and severally liable under a US$350 million revolving pre-export finance facility, of which US$112,500 thousand was drawn as of 31 December 2017 2016: US$350,000 thousand and US$131,250 thousand was available 2016: nil, and an undrawn US$195 million pre-export finance facility.
Ferrexpo plc, Ferrexpo AG and Ferrexpo Middle East FZE are guarantors to the Eurobond Notes issued by Ferrexpo Finance plc totalling US$346,385 thousand, which is due for repayment on 7 April 2018 and 2019, respectively.
Additionally, the Notes benefit from a surety agreement provided by FPM.
Certain Group companies act as guarantors for several finance facilities provided to Ukrainian subsidiaries: Ferrexpo AG amounting to US$38,902 thousand 2016: US$63,465 thousand, Ferrexpo Middle East FZE amounting to US$15,852 thousand 2016: US$25,108 thousand and Ferrexpo plc amounting to US$7,984 thousand 2016: US$13,307 thousand.
The total remaining contractual maturities of the guarantees provided under the facilities listed above is US$497,800 thousand 2016: US$736,265 thousand.
Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets at 31 December 2017 was US$186,689 thousand 2016: US$236,196 thousand and represents the maximum credit exposure.
See page 131 for further information.
Of the total maximum exposure to credit risk, US$13,170 thousand 2016: US$47,025 thousand related to Ukraine.
The total receivables balance relating to the Groups top three customers was US$49,918 thousand 2016: US$21,766 thousand making up 63.4% of the total amounts receivable 2016: 30.8%.
The top three customers are considered to be crisis resistant top-class steel mills and sales are made under long-term contracts.
Impairment profile The Groups exposure to credit risk relating to trade and other receivables is disclosed in Note 18.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach is to ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation by holding surplus cash or undrawn committed credit facilities.
Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 134 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 27: Financial instruments continued The Group prepares detailed rolling cash flow forecasts, which assist it in monitoring cash flow requirements and optimising its cash return on investments.
Typically the Group intends to ensure that it has sufficient cash on demand and or lines of credit to meet expected operational expenses, including the servicing of financial obligations.
For further information see the Groups Viability Statement on page 40.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities: As at 31.12.17 Less than Between Between More than US$000 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years 5 years Total Interest-bearing Fixed rate loans and borrowings 189,004 181,180 370,184 Floating rate loans and borrowings 119,847 5,468 2,301 127,616 Interest accrued 9,358 9,358 Future interest payable 30,251 9,218 70 39,539 Total interest-bearing 348,460 195,866 2,371 546,697 Non-interest-bearing Trade and other payables 48,428 48,428 Accrued liabilities 15,956 15,956 Total non-interest-bearing 64,384 64,384 Total financial liabilities 412,844 195,866 2,371 611,081 In the current year, the presentation of the interesting-bearing loans and borrowings balances in the liquidity risk table above was changed from amortised costs disclosed in the past to contractual amounts due to reflect the contractual maturities at the respective period ends.
The comparative information of the table below has been re-presented to be on a consistent basis.
The difference of the total of fixed and floating interest-bearing loans and borrowings compared to the balances disclosed in Note 26 mainly relates to arrangement fees paid for specific facilities.
As at 31.12.16 Less than Between Between More than US$000 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years 5 years Total Interest-bearing Fixed rate loans and borrowings 15,538 188,991 181,177 385,706 Floating rate loans and borrowings 204,271 138,518 7,770 350,559 Interest accrued 10,548 10,548 Future interest payable 47,381 30,489 9,307 87,177 Total interest-bearing 277,738 357,998 198,254 833,990 Non-interest-bearing Trade and other payables 28,807 28,807 Accrued liabilities 12,540 12,540 Total non-interest-bearing 41,347 41,347 Total financial liabilities 319,085 357,998 198,254 875,337 Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of the Group.
Functional currencies for the Group are primarily the Ukrainian Hryvnia, but also US Dollars, Swiss Francs, Euro and UK Pounds Sterling.
The Groups major lines of borrowings and the majority of its sales are denominated in US Dollars, with costs of local Ukrainian production mainly in Hryvnia.
The value of the Hryvnia is published by the NBU.
The devaluation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia reduced the operating costs of the production unit in US Dollar terms and the value of Hryvnia payables recorded in the statement of financial position at the year end in US Dollars.
As the majority of sales and receivables are denominated in US Dollars, a devaluation in the local currency will result in operating exchange gains recorded in the income statement.
Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 135 Note 27: Financial instruments continued With the devaluation of the local currency, US Dollar-denominated loans held by the Ukrainian subsidiary resulted in non-operating exchange losses to the extent these are not matched by US Dollar-denominated assets.
Fixed assets are similarly held in local currency amounts and the devaluation in the currency resulted in reduced net asset values with the effect recorded in the translation reserve.
The NBU manages and determines the official exchange rates.
An interbank market for exchange of currencies exists in Ukraine and is monitored by the NBU.
The Group, through financial institutions, exchanges currencies at bank offered market rates.
Trade receivables are predominately in US Dollars and are not hedged.
Trade payables denominated in US Dollars are also not hedged on the market, but are matched against US Dollar currency receipts.
This includes the interest expense, which is principally payable in US Dollars.
Trade receivables and trade payables in Ukrainian Hryvnia are not hedged as a forward market for the currency is generally not available.
Other Group monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are considered immaterial as the exposure to currency risk mainly relates to corporate costs within Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows based on notional amounts: As at 31.12.17 Ukrainian US Swiss Other US$000 Hryvnia Dollars Euro Franc currencies Total Financial assets 6,906 145 673 1,446 9,170 Financial liabilities Trade and other payables 1,818 1,719 201 5,656 9,394 Accrued liabilities 5 15 913 933 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 20,238 12 20,250 Total financial liabilities 22,061 1,731 216 6,569 30,577 Net financial assets liabilities 15,155 1,586 457 5,123 21,407 As at 31.12.16 Ukrainian US Swiss Other US$000 Hryvnia Dollars Euro Franc currencies Total Financial assets 1,172 207 768 2,226 4,373 Financial liabilities Trade and other payables 1,488 1,332 238 569 3,627 Accrued liabilities 2 20 982 1,004 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 32,296 37 32,333 Total financial liabilities 33,786 1,369 258 1,551 36,964 Net financial assets liabilities 32,614 1,162 510 675 32,591 Interest rate risk The Group predominantly borrows bank funds that are at floating interest rates and is exposed to interest rate movements.
The interest rate exposure to US Dollars remained relatively low during the period, and no interest rate swaps have been entered into in this or prior periods.
Commodity risk Revenues related to provisionally priced sales are initially recognised at the estimated fair value of the consideration receivable based on the forward price at each reporting date for the relevant period outlined in the different contracts.
As a consequence, the receivable balance may change in a future period when final invoices can be issued based on final iron ore prices to be applied according to the specific underlying contract terms.
The provisionally priced iron ore exposure at 31 December 2017 was 176,000 tonnes 2016: 173,000 tonnes which gave rise to a fair value gain relating to the embedded provisional pricing mechanism of US$846 thousand as at 31 December 2017 2016: fair value loss of US$777 thousand.
Final iron ore prices based on the relevant index are normally known within 60 days after the reporting period.
The difference between the provisionally priced receivable balance recognised as at 31 December 2017 and the receivable balance taking into account the known final prices is US$863 thousand 2016: US$1,433 thousand and would have increased the consolidated result and the shareholders equity by this amount.
Where pricing terms deviate from the index-based pricing model, derivative commodity contracts may be used to swap the pricing terms to the iron ore index price.
Finished goods are held at cost without revaluation to a spot price for iron ore pellets at the end of the reporting period, as long as the recoverable amount exceeds the cost basis.
Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 136 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 27: Financial instruments continued Sensitivity analysis A 20% strengthening of the US Dollar against the following currencies at 31 December would have increased decreased income statement and equity by the amounts shown below.
The percentage applied to the sensitivity analysis of the Groups foreign currency exposure is based on the average change of the Ukrainian Hryvnia, the Groups most relevant foreign currency, compared to the US Dollar in past years, which might repeat again in the near future.
This percentage was also applied for the Groups less relevant foreign currencies and does not have a significant effect on the total effect of this sensitivity analysis.
This assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
Year ended Year ended 31.12.17 31.12.16 Income Income statement statement US$000 equity equity Ukrainian Hryvnia 2,526 5,436 Euro 264 194 Swiss Franc 76 85 Total 2,714 5,545 A 20% weakening of the US Dollar against the above currencies would have an equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all the other variables remain constant.
Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and the Group does not hold any derivatives e. g. interest rate swaps.
Therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect the income statement.
Cash flow sensitivity for variable rate instruments An increase of 100 basis points bps in interest rates would have decreased equity and the consolidated result by the amounts shown below.
The possible change applied to the cash flow sensitivity represents a plausible scenario taking into account the movement of variable interest rates in the last year and possible changes in the near future.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.17 31.12.16 Net finance charge 299 1,868 A decrease of 100bps would increase equity and profit by US$1,288 thousand for the year ended 31 December 2017 2016: increase of US$1,014 thousand.
This is on the basis that all the other variables remain constant.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base.
The Board of Directors monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders, as well as the return on capital, which the Group defines as total shareholders equity, excluding non-controlling interests, and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
Please refer to the statement of changes in equity for details of the capital position of the Group.
A key measure in respect of the Groups capital management is the level of net debt and the net debt to EBITDA ratio.
Both key figures improved significantly during the financial year 2017 as a result of the strong financial performance.
The net debt has decreased from US$588,951 thousand at the beginning of the year to US$399,217 thousand as at 31 December 2017.
The capital base of the Group can be adversely affected by falls in the price of iron ore reducing reported revenues and profitability.
The price that the industry earns for iron ore products is cyclical in nature and the Board of Directors continues to review its capital base in line with industry trends.
In prior years the Board approved investments in growth projects as part of its policy to support a strong capital base.
During the financial years 2015 and 2016, in recognition of the industry trend and to further support the Groups capital base, the Board slowed down investments in major growth projects.
Under consideration of increased iron ore prices and more positive industry trends, suspended investments in major growth projects accelerated again in 2017 and are expected to continue in 2018.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
The Board continues to support maintaining a sound capital base balanced against these market constraints.
The Board maintains a dividend policy consistent with the Groups profile, reflecting the investment activities the Group has made supporting current and future production growth and the cash generated by existing operations, while maintaining a prudent level of dividend cover supported by an appropriate level of liquidity.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is subject to externally imposed capital requirements other than a bank covenant requirement to maintain consolidated equity of the Group of US$500,000 thousand including non-controlling interests and excluding the translation reserve.
Compliance is ensured by balancing dividend payments against the earnings of the Group.
Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 137 Note 27: Financial instruments continued Ferrexpo plc the Company is the Groups holding company, with no direct operating business, so its ability to make distributions to its shareholders is dependent on its ability to access profits held in the subsidiaries.
See Note 13 for further information.
For more information about the Groups interest-bearing loans and borrowings see Note 26.
Note 28: Share-based payments Accounting policy Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the award at the grant date using modelling techniques consistent with the mathematics underlying the Black-Scholes option pricing model extended to allow for the performance conditions.
The fair value is determined by reference to the quoted closing share price on the grant date.
The cost is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, except for market conditions, such as the relative Total Shareholder Return TSR.
Where the vesting of awards is subject to the satisfaction of certain market conditions, a vesting charge is recognised irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where awards terminate before the performance period is complete, any unamortised expense is recognised immediately.
At each reporting date, the cumulative expense of outstanding awards is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous reporting date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in employee benefit trust reserve in equity.

Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 140 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 30: Commitments, contingencies and legal disputes continued Deposit Guarantee Fund and liquidator of Bank F&C The Groups former transactional bank in Ukraine, Bank F&C BFC, is still going through the liquidation process after having been declared insolvent by the National Bank of Ukraine and put under temporary administration on 18 September 2015.
The Group has recorded in previous periods a full allowance for its cash and deposit balances denominated in Ukrainian Hryvnia held with BFC on the date of introduction of temporary administration, totalling UAH4,262 million US$151,850 thousand as at 31 December 2017 2016: US$156,866 thousand.
The Group, through its major subsidiaries in Ukraine, is engaged in various court proceedings with the aim to maximise its recovery in the liquidation process of BFC as disclosed below.
The Groups principal Ukrainian subsidiary, PJSC Ferrexpo Poltava Mining FPM, is claiming the release of UAH217 million US$7,731 thousand as of 31 December 2017, which was blocked after the introduction of the temporary administration of BFC on 18 September 2015.
FPM has filed a cassation appeal in respect of an earlier adverse judgment received from the court.
With judgment of 17 October 2017, the relevant court instance dismissed FPMs appeal in full.
Based on legal advice obtained, there are no legal grounds for an appeal against this judgement to the Supreme Court of Ukraine.
Following the commencement of the liquidation process of BFC and in accordance with the applicable local legislation, FPM, LLC Ferrexpo Yeristovo Mining FYM and LLC Ferrexpo Belanovo Mining FBM, collectively referred to as Ukrainian subsidiaries, submitted on 21 January 2016 their claims for cash and deposit balances held with BFC on the date of introduction of temporary administration totalling UAH4,262 million US$151,850 thousand as of 31 December 2017.
On 22 April 2016, the liquidator of BFC issued certificates recognising UAH540 million US$19,240 thousand as of 31 December 2017 of these claims and recognised these claims in the ninth rank.
The aforementioned Ukrainian subsidiaries are currently involved in legal proceedings in respect of the under-recognition of the claims amounting to UAH3,722 million US$132,610 thousand as of 31 December 2017 and the ranking of the claims in the liquidation process.
The court proceedings commenced in October 2016 and following various hearings during the financial year 2017, the relevant court instance dismissed on 25 October 2017 FPMs claim in full.
FPM filed an appeal on 13 November 2017 and a hearing took place on 21 February 2018.
In this hearing, the liquidator of BFC failed to provide certain original documents requested by the court.
As a result, the court did not rule on the parties motions yet, but instead decided to adjourn the hearing.
The next hearing is scheduled for 29 March 2018.
The claims of FYM and FBM on the same matter are still pending with the relevant courts, but no hearings took place or are scheduled yet.
Note 31: Share capital and reserves Accounting policy Ordinary Shares Ordinary Shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of Ordinary Shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.
Employee benefit trust reserve Ferrexpo plc shares held by the Group are recognised at cost and classified in reserves.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale and the original cost to be recorded in reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Treasury shares Own equity instruments, which are re-acquired treasury shares, are recognised at cost and deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration is recognised in reserves.
Translation reserve The translation reserve represents exchange differences arising on the translation of non-US Dollar functional currency operations, mainly those in Ukrainian Hryvnia, within the Group into US Dollars.
Critical judgements Net investments in foreign operations There are various intercompany balances between subsidiaries used to finance capital expenditure projects as well as working capital requirements.
The vast majority of these loans are denominated in US Dollars and are translated into the respective local functional currencies in the subsidiaries local accounts.
Loans for which cash settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future are, in substance, a part of the Groups net investment in that foreign operation.
In assessing whether cash settlement is planned or likely to occur in the foreseeable future, critical judgement is required in forecasting whether the Group will generate sufficient cash outside of Ukraine to satisfy its liquidity requirements.
Translation differences on these loans are recognised in other comprehensive income translation reserve and only reclassified from the translation reserve to profit or loss on disposal of the respective net investment.
Translation losses related to these loans of US$22,046 thousand, net of associated tax effect of US$4,557 thousand, are recognised in other comprehensive income for the financial year 2017 2016: US$121,261 thousand.
It is the Group managements view that the total balance of the loans granted by the Group to its Ukrainian subsidiaries qualifies as net investment in its foreign operations.
