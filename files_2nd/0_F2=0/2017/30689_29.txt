Change in functional currency Following the settlement reached with the Trustees of the UK Coats Pension Plan and the Brunel Holdings Pension scheme it was determined the functional currency of Coats Group plc had changed from Great Britain pounds Sterling to United States dollars USD, effective 1 March 2017.
To give effect to the change in functional currency, the assets, liabilities and equity of Coats Group plc in Sterling at 1 March 2017 were converted into USD at an exchange rate of US$1:0.8078.
Comparative financial information for the year ended 31 December 2016 was originally presented in GBP, the Companys functional currency at that time.
The comparative financial information has been restated from Sterling into USD as follows: Income and expenses were translated into USD at the average exchange rate for the year ended of US$1:0.738: Assets and liabilities were translated into USD at the 31 December 2016 year end exchange rate of US$1:0.8106: and Opening balances as of 1 January 2016 were translated into USD at the 31 December 2015 exchange rate of US$1:0.678.
The comparative financial information for equity items has been restated from Sterling into USD as follows: Share capital, share premium account, capital redemption reserve, capital reduction reserve and own shares reserve were stated in USD in the Coats Group plc consolidated financial statements.
In order to keep these balances consistent with the Groups consolidated financial statements the balances have not been retranslated as at 1 January 2016 or 31 December 2016.
The resulting exchange differences were held temporarily within a functional currency translation reserve.
The share options reserve and profit and loss account reserve balances were originally stated in Sterling and were retranslated USD as follows: as at 1 January 2016 using an exchange rate of US$1:0.678. as at 31 December 2016 using an exchange rate of US$1:0.8106 b Fixed assets investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings are reflected at cost less provisions for any impairment.
c Financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
All financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at transaction price.
If an arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, the financial asset or financial liability is measured at the present value of future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument.
d Impairment of assets Assets, other than those measured at fair value, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
If there is objective evidence of impairment, an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss and the assets is reduced to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
e Share-based payments Cash-settled Cash-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions at each reporting date.
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in liabilities.
Equity-settled The Group operates an equity-settled Long Term Incentive Plan for executives and senior management, settlement is in the form of Coats Group plc shares.
Awards under this plan are subject to both market-based and non-market-based vesting criteria.
The fair value at the date of grant is established by using an appropriate simulation method to reflect the likelihood of market-based performance conditions being met.
As the Long Term Incentive Plan relates to employees of a subsidiary, when there is no recharge of the cost, the fair value is charged to Investments on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with appropriate adjustments being made during this period to reflect expected vesting for non market-based performance conditions and forfeitures.
The corresponding credit is to shareholders funds.
150 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED To satisfy awards under this Plan, shares may be purchased in the market by an Employee Benefit Trust EBT over the vesting period.
Coats Group plc is the sponsoring employer of the EBT and its activities are considered an extension of the Companys activities.
Therefore the shares purchased by the EBT are included as a deduction from shareholders funds and other assets and liabilities of the EBT are recognised as assets and liabilities of Coats Group plc.
f Taxation Provision is made for taxation assessable on the profit or loss for the year as adjusted for disallowable and non-taxable items.
Deferred taxation is provided in full in respect of timing differences which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date, except that deferred tax assets including those attributable to tax losses carried forward are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred taxation is measured on a non-discounted basis.
g Dividends Dividends proposed are recognised in the period in which they are formally approved for payment.
h Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Carrying value of investments: The carrying values of investments are assessed annually for indicators of impairment.
If an impairment review is required judgement is involved in calculating the recoverable amount.
