com Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2017 1.
General information Sanne Group plc the Company, incorporated in Jersey on 26 January 2015, is a registered public company limited by shares with a Listing on the London Stock Exchange.
The registered office and principal place of business is 13 Castle Street, St Helier, Jersey.
The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries collectively the Group is fund, company and trust administration.
In the opinion of the Directors, there is no ultimate controlling party.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently in the current and prior year, other than as set out below.
Adoption of new and revised standards The following standards, amendments and interpretations are relevant to the Group, but were not yet effective.
These standards have not been early adopted by the Group.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
This is a new standard which enhances the ability of investors and other users of financial information to understand the accounting for financial assets and reduces complexity.
IFRS 9 changes the classification and measurement of financial assets and the timing and extent of credit provisioning.
The Group has not adopted the standard early.
The Group has performed a preliminary assessment of the impact on the current reporting of financial instruments, although the possible impact has not been quantified yet.
Under IFRS 9, the financial assets will be categorised as amortised cost, fair value through profit and loss or fair value through other comprehensive income.
The held to maturity, loans and receivables and available for sale categories per IAS 39 have been removed.
The new categories per IFRS 9 are not expected to have a material impact on the financial assets as trade receivables will continue to be carried at amortised cost.
An expected credit loss model replaces the incurred loss model: under IFRS 9 a provision must be recorded for the amount of any loss expected to arise over the life of the financial asset where under IAS 39 credit losses were recognised when they were incurred.
A dual measurement approach applies under the new expected credit loss model, where a financial asset will attract a loss allowance to either 12 month expected credit losses or lifetime expected losses.
This requires an assessment of the likelihood of default and any potential loss that may arise in the event of default.
The Group does not believe that the new standard would cause a material change in the provision for bad debts on trade receivables or any other financial assets because of the short-term nature of the trade receivables and the specific provisions currently being raised for them.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
This standard establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entitys contracts with customers.
Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service.
The standard replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations.
The Group performed an analysis of the new five-step approach to recognise revenue and the impact on the reporting of revenue for the Group.
Based on the analysis performed, the Group found that IFRS 15 will have no significant impact on the recognition and reporting of revenue.
IFRS 16 Leases effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
This is a new standard which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract.
The standard eliminates the classification of leases as either operating or finance leases as required by IAS 17 and instead introduces a single lessee accounting model.
A lessee will be required to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months and depreciated lease assets separately from interest in the income statement.
The standard replaces IAS 17 Leases.
The Group currently recognises operating lease payments as an expense on the straight-line basis with a corresponding asset or liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the straight-line effect.
The asset or liability is released over the lifetime of the lease and this will change with the new standard grossing up the Group's assets and liabilities.
The Group has not performed a full assessment of the impact of the new standard on the reported results from 1 January 2019.
"In the current year, the Group applied a number of amendments to IFRSs and new interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ""IASB"" that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 January 2017."
Their adoption has not had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
indd 91 23 03 2018 16:28:07 Sanne Group plc Annual report for the year ended 31 December 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2017 3.
"Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ""IFRS"" as adopted by the European Union."
"The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ""IASB""."
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis with fair value being applied to derivative financial instruments.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries during each year.
Control is achieved where the Company: Has the power over the investee: Is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee: and Has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control over the subsidiary.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial results of the subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Under Article 105 11 of the Companies Jersey Law 1991, the directors of a holding company need not prepare separate financial statements i. e. company only financial statements.
Standalone financial statements for the Company are not prepared unless required by the members of the Company by ordinary resolution.
The members of the Company had not passed a resolution requiring separate financial statements and, in the Directors' opinion, the Company meets the definition of a holding company.
As permitted by law, the Directors have elected not to prepare separate financial statements.
Going concern The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence at least for the next 12 months.
The Directors have reviewed the Groups financial projections and cash flow forecasts and believe, based on those projections and forecasts, that it is appropriate to prepare the consolidated financial statements of the Group on the going concern basis.
The Group has healthy cash flow and a good pipeline of existing and new customers.
Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Further detail is contained in the viability statement included in the Audit and Risk Committee Report on page 56. Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition date fair values of assets transferred by the Group and liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as non-underlying items within operating expenses.
The acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 2008 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree if any over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes an asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a business combination.
Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill.
"Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the ""measurement period"" which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date."
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified.
Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss.
Significant accounting policies continued Goodwill Goodwill is initially recognised and measured as set out above.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date which is regarded as their cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition, separately intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.
Contract intangibles Contract intangibles consist of the recognition of the legal relationships gained through acquisition.
On initial recognition the values are determined by relevant factors such as business product life cycles, length of notice, ease of movement and general attrition.
This class of intangibles are amortised over their useful lives using the straight-line method, which is estimated at six to eight years, based on managements expectations and client experience.
"The amortisation charge for the year is included in the Consolidated Income Statement under ""operating expenses"" and further identified as non-underlying."
Customer intangibles Customer intangibles consist of the recognition of value attributed to the customer lists through acquisition.
On initial recognition, the values are determined by relevant factors such as the Companys growth pattern and ability to cross-sell to existing clients.
Subsequently, this class of intangibles is amortised over the intangibles' useful lives using the straight-line method, which is estimated at six to ten years, based on managements expectations and client experience.
Interest income Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Rendering of services Revenue is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income at the point in time when the Group has the right to receive payment for its services, on an accruals basis.
Accrued income Accrued income represents the billable provision of services to clients which has not been invoiced at the reporting date.
Accrued income is recorded based on agreed fees billed in arrears and time-based charges at the agreed charge-out rates in force at the work date, less any specific provisions against the value of accrued income where recovery will not be made in full.
Deferred revenue Fees in advance and up front fees in respect of services due under contract are time apportioned to the respective accounting periods, and those billed but not yet earned are included in deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed.
In the event that lease incentives are received on entering into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability.
The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of the rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
Contractual rental increases are straight-lined over the lease term.
indd 93 23 03 2018 16:28:07 Sanne Group plc Annual report for the year ended 31 December 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2017 3.
Significant accounting policies continued Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they arise.
For the purpose of presenting Consolidated Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups operations with a functional currency other than pounds sterling are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the exchange rates at the date of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity in the translation reserve.
On the disposal of a foreign operation i. e. a disposal of the Groups entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, loss of joint control over a jointly controlled entity that includes a foreign operation, or loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation, all of the accumulated exchange differences in respect of that operation attributable to the Group are reclassified to profit or loss.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to contributions.
The Group has a defined benefit retirement obligation in Mauritius due to a regulatory requirement.
The defined benefit obligation is recognised in line with IAS 19.
The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of the defined benefit retirement obligation is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.
The Group has no plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated at half year and year end by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows: Service cost Net interest expense or income: and Remeasurement Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Earnings per share The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share.
In calculating the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, any share restructuring is adjusted by a factor to make it comparable with the other periods.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Both basic and diluted EPS measures are shown for statutory profit position: the Group has also presented an alternative version with profit adjusted for nonunderlying items to provide better understanding of the financial performance of the Group note 8.
Significant accounting policies continued Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement as it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are not taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available, against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Current tax and deferred tax for the year Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination.
Equipment Equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Computer equipment 3 to 5 years Fixtures and equipment 5 to 16 years The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of each reporting period with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell or value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
indd 95 23 03 2018 16:28:07 Sanne Group plc Annual report for the year ended 31 December 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2017 3.
Significant accounting policies continued If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value.
"All financial assets, other than cash and cash equivalents and derivatives, are classified as ""loans and receivables""."
"Loans and receivables Trade and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as ""loans and receivables""."
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
Financial liabilities and equity Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Repurchase of the Company's own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company's own equity instruments.
"Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss ""FVTPL"" or ""other financial liabilities""."
The Group does not hold any financial liabilities at FVTPL.
Other financial liabilities Borrowings are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant year.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter year, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Accrued interest is recorded separately from the associated borrowings within current liabilities.
Significant accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments and embedded derivatives Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not measured at FVTPL.
An embedded derivative is presented as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the hybrid instrument to which the embedded derivative relates is more than 12 months and is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months.
Employee share trust own shares Own shares represent the shares of the Company that are held in treasury and by employee share ownership trusts which is consolidated in the Group financial statements.
Own shares are recorded at cost and deducted from equity.
When shares vest unconditionally, are cancelled or are reissued they are transferred from the own shares reserve at their weighted average cost.
Any consideration paid or received by the employee share trust for the purchase or sale of the Companys own shares is shown as a movement in shareholders equity.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are determined by the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the risks specific to the liability.
Onerous lease provisions are measured at the lower of the net cost to fulfil, or to exit the contract, discounted as appropriate.
Fiduciary activities The assets and liabilities of trusts and companies under administration and held in a fiduciary capacity are not included in these Consolidated Financial Statements.
Share-based payments Employees of the Group receive bonus allocations in the form of share-based payments under Performance Share Plan, Restrictive Stock Awards and Annual Performance Bonuses, whereby eligible employees render services as consideration for equity instruments shares.
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.
The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled sharebased transactions are set out in note 27.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
Non-underlying items Non-underlying items are disclosed and described separately in the Consolidated Financial Statements where it is necessary to do so to provide a better understanding of the financial performance of the Group.
The Group's core business is the administration, reporting and fiduciary services it provides in various jurisdictions.
All acquisition and integration-related costs are disclosed as non-underlying as these fall outside the core business of the Group.
Restricted Share Awards form part of the non-underlying items as they are used as a tool to retain key personnel relating to the acquisitions and recruit senior management to support the acquisitions.
Amortisation of intangible assets recognised through the acquisitions is also included as non-underlying due to their direct link with the acquisitions.
All the non-underlying items are regarded as expense items outside the normal course of business and disclosed seperately to assist users of the financial statements to better analyse the performance of the core business.
In the 2016 year all share-based payments were deemed to be non-underlying.
This was changed in the current year as the PSP and Annual Bonus Plan were deemed to be part of management's normal remuneration and do not form part of non-underlying costs.
The 2016 numbers have been adjusted for this approach.
Further details of the nature of non-underlying items are given in note 8.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies The following are the critical judgements at the balance sheet date that the Directors have made in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in financial statements.
Interpretation of tax legislation The Group has to comply with tax laws and legislation in all jurisdictions in which it operates.
Various tax laws are open for interpretation and management use their best judgement to interpret the tax legislation of the various jurisdictions to comply with the regulations.
The Group consults with tax authorities to clarify the interpretation of tax law, as required.
Where uncertainty exists, the Directors will seek the opinion of professional advisers and apply judgement.
Initial recognition of intangible assets On 1 January 2017, the Group acquired IFS Group.
The business combination gave rise to the recognition of customer and contract intangibles.
The valuation of these intangible assets requires various judgements of which the most significant is the number of years the customer base acquired would generate revenue for the Group.
The valuation was performed using six years which is based on management's best judgement and historical evidence.
The intangible assets recognised through the business acquisition amounts to 50.3 million.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty Probability of vesting of equity instruments granted in terms of share-based schemes The cumulative expense recognised in terms of the Group's share-based payment schemes reflects, in the opinion of the Directors, the number of equity instruments granted that will ultimately vest.
At each reporting date, management adjusts the unvested equity instruments with the forfeited instruments.
Management is of the opinion that this number, adjusted for future attrition rates, represents the most accurate estimate of the number of instruments that will ultimately vest.
Based on current performance, management estimates the future performance of the Group will have an annual growth rate of 12%.
The current year share-based payment charge for the performance share plan is 912k: should the performance of the Group exceed the 12% growth assumption and have 20% growth, then the 2018 financial statements will have an additional charge of 420k in respect of share-based payment catch-up with regards to 2017.
Segmental reporting The reporting units engage in corporate, fund and private client administration, reporting and fiduciary services.
Declared revenue is generated from external customers.
The Groups Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 had nine reportable segments under IFRS 8: Debt, Real Estate, Private Equity, Corporate and Institutional, Executive Incentives, Private Client, Treasury, Hedge and North American Alternatives.
Given the continuing growth of the Group, these nine segments have been reorganised into four segments from 1 January 2017.
The four new segments are EMEA Alternatives EMEA, Asia - Pacific & Mauritius Alternatives APM, North American Alternatives NA and Corporate & Private Client CPC.
No customer represents more than 10% of 2017 revenue.
The comparative numbers for the segmental reporting have been restated to reflect the four new segments created in the current reporting period.
The chief operating decision-maker is considered to be the Board of Directors of Sanne Group plc.
Each segment is defined as a set of business activities generating a revenue stream determined by segmental responsibility and the management information reviewed by the Board of Directors.
The Board evaluates segmental performance on the basis of gross profit, after the deduction of the direct costs of staff, marketing and travel.
No inter-segment sales are made.

i Share-based payments are detailed in note 27.
"All acquisition related share-based payments ""RSA"" plan are disclosed as non-underlying as these are not part of the normal cost of business: these are awarded to employees as part of the acquisitions to retain key workforce and to recruit key management to support the acquisitions."
These costs are recorded as non-underlying to enable Shareholders to assess the core performance of the business.
In the 2016 year all share-based payments were deemed to be nonunderlying.
"This was changed in the current year as the PSP and Annual Bonus Plan ""ABP"" were deemed to be part of management's normal remuneration and do not form part of non-underlying costs."
ii During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group completed the acquisition of the IFS Group as detailed in note 26 and signed a share purchase agreement with LIS Group which completed on 6 February 2018.
The Group also completed four acquisitions during the year ending 31 December 2016.
The Group expensed 1.4 million of acquisition and integration expenditure during the current year and 3.9 million in the prior year.
With acquisitions not being the core ongoing business of the Group, these costs are disclosed as non-underlying to enable Shareholders to assess the core performance of the business.
iii The amortisation charges relates to the amortisation of intangible assets acquired through acquisitions.
As with the acquisition costs, the amortisation of intangibles is directly linked to the acquisitions which do not form part of the core ongoing business of the Group.
These costs are disclosed as non-underlying to enable Shareholders to assess the core performance of the business.
iv During the prior year, as part of the loan restructuring, accelerated amortisation on issuance costs of 245k was expensed, see note 22. v During the prior year, FX forward contracts were taken out to purchase United States dollars at a fixed price at a fixed date to fund the FAS and IFS Group acquisitions.
A net gain of 1.2 million was recognised on these contracts.
Tax 2017 2016 000 000 The tax charge comprises: Current period: Jersey income tax 1,912 1,630 Other foreign tax 3,681 1,282 5,593 2,912 Deferred tax note 23 1,131 276 Total tax charge for the year 4,462 2,636 Adjustments in respect of prior periods: Jersey income tax 442 504 Other foreign tax 257 119 Tax on profit on ordinary activities 4,277 2,013 In addition to the amount charged to the Consolidated Income Statement, the following amounts relating to tax have been recognised in other comprehensive income: Deferred tax: Items that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss: Actuarial loss on pension scheme 12 Total income tax recognised in other comprehensive income 12 The difference between the total current tax shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of Jersey income tax to the profit before tax is as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 Profit on ordinary activities before tax 22,407 14,961 Tax on profit on ordinary activities at standard Jersey income tax rate of 10% 2016: 10% 2,241 1,496 Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 51 466 Non-deductible amortisation 209 167 Depreciation in excess of capital allowances 130 45 1 Deferred tax not recognised - Goodwill 290 48 Net foreign exchange income 17 87 2 Foreign taxes not at Jersey rate 1,219 566 3 Deferred tax not recognised - Taxable losses 884 32 Prior year adjustments 184 624 Total tax 4,277 2,013 1.
Deferred tax not recognised for the tax deductions received in the US on goodwill: during 2016 the US business had only been part of the Group for two months.
With the Jersey tax rate at 10%, the impact of the 2016 and 2017 acquisitions is significant on the tax expense as all the acquired jurisdictions have higher tax rates than 10%.
Deferred tax not recognised refers to jurisdictions where there is doubt that future deferred tax assets would be able to be utilised.
Income tax expense computations are based on the jurisdictions in which profits were earned at prevailing rates in the respective jurisdictions.
The Jersey standard income tax rate is 10%.
With the Company being a Jersey registered entity and the majority of revenue generated in Jersey we reconciled the effective tax rate to 10%.

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary Shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
Earnings per share continued Diluted EPS takes into consideration the Company's dilutive contingently issuable shares as disclosed above.
These arrangements have no impact on the earnings or underlying earnings figures used to calculate diluted EPS.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the diluted calculation is inclusive of the number of shares which are expected to be issued to satisfy the awards when they become due and where the performance criteria, if any, have been deemed to have been met as at 31 December 2017.
Underlying basic EPS and Underlying diluted EPS are calculated on the same basis as Basic EPS and Diluted EPS with the only difference being that the earnings used are the underlying earnings which is the profit for the year adjusted for non-underlying items as detailed in note 8.
No adjustment has been made for the tax impact of the non-underlying items.

Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over fair value of the Group's share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.

The review assesses whether the carrying value of goodwill could be supported by the recoverable amount which is determined through value in use calculations of each cash-generating unit CGU.
The key assumptions applied in the value in use calculations are the discount rates and the projected cash flows.
The goodwill has been allocated to the CGUs as follows: Carrying value 000 Sanne South Africa 9,049 Sanne Netherlands 1,649 Sanne Americas 40,601 Sanne Mauritius 49,088 100,387 The recoverable amounts of all CGUs are based on the same key assumptions.
Discount rates Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money.
In assessing the discount rate applicable to the Group the following factors have been considered: i Long-term treasury bond rate for the relevant jurisdiction.
ii The cost of equity based on an adjusted Beta for the relevant jurisdiction.
iii The risk premium to reflect the increased risk of investing in equities.
Using the above assumptions has resulted in weighted average cost of capital of 17.7% for Sanne South Africa, 13.9% for Sanne Netherlands, 13.0% for Sanne Americas and 15.7% for Sanne Mauritius.
Projected cash flows Projected cash flows are calculated with reference to each CGU's latest budget and business plan which are subject to a rigorous review and challenge process.
Management prepares the budgets through an assessment of historic revenues from existing clients, the pipeline of new projects, historic pricing, and the required resource base needed to service new and existing clients, coupled with their knowledge of wider industry trends and the economic environment.
Projected cash flows are calculated using the prior period actual result and compounding these results by the budgeted numbers.
Sanne Netherlands has a specific growth strategy and revenue growth is based on up to 12.0% and replacement of previous client losses, driven by specific business plans, for all other CGUs we used 7.0%-10.2%.
The terminal value growth rate used is 2.58% and is applied after five years.
Based on the value in use calculations, none of the CGUs show indications of impairment.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount on CGUs.
As part of that subsequent review, triggers for impairment were detected and value in use calculations were performed for the intangible assets relating to the Sorato acquisition.
The trigger related to the Group choosing to terminate a client relationship where the client's risk profile had increased significantly.
A 20k impairment was recognised in operating expenses.
The Group has a contractual commitment for the purchase of LIS Group the purchase accounting for which will include the acquisition of intangible assets.

com Consolidated Financial Statements 26. Business combinations IFS On 1 January 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of International Financial Services Limited and IFS Trustees.
These entities are incorporated in Mauritius and together trade as IFS.

IFS forms the core of the Asia-Pacific & Mauritius Alternatives segment.
The consideration for the acquisition was satisfied through a payment of approximately 74.6 million US$92 million in cash, and the issuance of 5,844,507 consideration shares.

Business combinations continued Fair value of consideration The shares were valued based on the closing share price the day before issuance with this amount appropriately allocated between share capital and share premium.
Transaction costs The Group incurred 319k net of FX gain of 1.5 million of acquisition and integration expense in 2016.
During 2017 the Group incurred integration costs of 152k.
These costs have been expensed within operating expenses in this financial period and have further been identified as non-underlying as detailed in note 8.
Goodwill Goodwill is represented by assets that do not qualify for separate recognition or other factors.
These include the opportunities for new business wins from new customers, the effects of an assembled workforce and synergies from combining operations of the acquiree and the acquirer.
Effect on the results IFS contributed 21.5 million revenue and a profit of 3.17 million to the Groups profit for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
The date of acquisition was 1 January 2017 and therefore there are no differences in the revenue and profit which would have been contributed on a pro rata basis from the start of the period.
Share-based payments 2017 2016 000 000 Sanne Group plc Employee Share Gift award 276 Performance Share Plan 912 676 Restricted Stock Awards 2,015 439 Total share-based payments 2,927 1,391 Employee Shares settled from Employee Benefit Trust 35 8 Net share-based payments 2,892 1,383 Sanne Group Employees' Share Gift award During 2016, 61,576 shares were gifted to employees of the newly acquired businesses to welcome them to the Group.
As such they had no vesting period.
The market value on grant date was charged in full to operating expenses and further identified as non-underlying.
All awards were granted for nil consideration.
"Performance Share Plan During the current and prior years, the Group granted awards over its ordinary shares under the terms of its Performance Share Plan ""PSP""."
The exercise of awards under the PSP is conditional upon the achievement of one or more challenging performance targets set at the time of the grant and measured over a three-year performance period from grant date.
All the awards were granted for a nil consideration.
Further awards were made through the year.
The Group estimates the number of shares to be vested based on the performance targets set to be achieved and the current performance of the Group, and this is then grown by 12% as per market expectation to determine the probable performance at vesting date.
The leavers assumption set by the Group is nil for PSPs as only senior management receive share grants and historical data have shown that senior management do not leave in such a short period.
The vesting periods of the grants are not more than three years.
A summary of the rules for this scheme and the related performance conditions are set out in the remuneration report.
Share-based payments Restricted Stock Awards During the current and prior years, the Group granted awards over its ordinary shares in the form of Restrictive Stock Awards RSA.
The awards are granted as part of the mechanics of an acquisition to act as retentions for staff.
The vesting of the awards is subject to continued employment over an agreed period.
The Group makes use of a leavers assumption for specific jurisdictions where these awards were granted to all staff and not only senior management.
The assumptions are based on historical data.
With these grants also relating to acquisitions or senior management to support the acquisitions they are disclosed as non-underlying.
The number and weighted average exercise prices of share-based payment awards are as follows: Weighted Number of Number of average exercise shares shares price 2017 2016 Performance Share Plan Outstanding at 1 January 757,787 Granted during the year 535,413 833,270 Forfeited during the year 63,920 75,483 Outstanding at 31 December 1,229,280 757,787 Restricted Stock Awards Outstanding at 1 January 935,302 Granted during the year 544,210 1,066,562 Forfeited during the year 32,862 131,260 Vested during the year 7.59 91,096 Outstanding at 31 December 1,355,554 935,302 The fair value of services received in return for share awards granted is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares granted.

Long-term employee benefits Defined contribution plan The Group participates in a defined contribution pension plan to which it makes monthly contributions in specific jurisdictions.
The total contributions during the year were 240k.
Retirement benefit obligation The Group has a retirement benefit obligation in respect of the Mauritius Employment Rights Act 2008 which arose through the IFS acquisition note 26.
In terms of the act in Mauritius, an employer is obligated to pay a lump sum to the employee upon retirement in proportion to the years of service employed at the company.
The Group recognised a net retirement benefit liability of 718k 2016: nil on the balance sheet in respect of amounts that are expected to be paid out to employees under the retirement gratuities Employment Rights Act 2008.
The Group has no specific assets to cover the obligation as it is all selffunded by the Group.
The most recent actuarial valuations of the retirement benefit liability was carried out at 31 December 2017 by the State Insurance Company of Mauritius.

The cost of providing the benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Method.
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of actuarial valuation were as follows: 2017 1 Discount rate 5.5% Future salary increases 3% Future pension increases 3% Withdrawal rate 15% Retirement age 60 years 1.
The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields on bonds.
Significant actuarial assumptions for determination of the retirement benefit obligation are discount rate and expected salary increase.
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period.

Financial instruments The Group's financial instruments comprise bank loans, cash and cash equivalents, trade payables, other payables, trade receivables and other receivables.
2017 2016 Categories of financial instruments Level 000 000 Financial assets Cash and bank balances 1 50,803 108,673 i Loans and receivables 3 29,062 22,643 Financial liabilities Financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost Bank loan 1 64,335 59,518 ii Trade and other payables 3 6,753 6,111 i Includes accrued income but excludes other debtors and prepayments.
ii Excludes other taxes and social security and deferred consideration but includes accrued interest payable.
The fair value measurement of the Group's financial and non-financial assets and liabilities utilises market observable inputs and data as far as possible.
"Inputs used in determining fair value measurements are categorised into different levels based on how observable the inputs used in the valuation technique utilised are the ""fair value hierarchy"" : Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical items: Level 2: Observable direct or indirect inputs other than Level 1 inputs: and Level 3: Unobservable inputs, thus not derived from market data."
The classification of an item into the above levels is based on the lowest level of the inputs used that has a significant effect on the fair value measurement of the item.
Transfers of items between levels are recognised in the period they occur.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to Shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
As disclosed in note 22, in 2016 the Group took a loan which requires it to meet cash flow, leverage and interest cover covenants.
In order to achieve the Groups capital risk management objective, the Group aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to borrowings.
Breaches in meeting the financial covenants would permit the lender to immediately call the loan.
In line with the loan agreement, the Group tests compliance with the financial covenants on a quarterly basis and considers the results in making decisions affecting dividend payments to Shareholders or issue of new shares.
Individual regulated entities within the Group are subject to regulatory requirements to ensure adequate capital and liquidity to meet local requirements in Jersey, UK, Guernsey, Ireland, Netherlands, Luxembourg and South Africa, which are monitored monthly to ensure compliance.
There have been no breaches of applicable regulatory requirements during the year.
Financial risk management objectives The financial risk management policies are discussed by the management of the Group on a regular basis to ensure that these are in line with the overall business strategies and its risk management philosophy.
Management sets policies which seek to minimise the potential adverse effects affecting the financial performance of the Group.
Management provides necessary guidance and instructions to the employees covering specific areas, such as market risk foreign exchange and interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and in investing excess cash.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.

Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates.
The interest rates are directly linked to the LIBOR plus a margin based on the leverage ratio of the Group: the higher the leverage ratio the higher the margin on the LIBOR.
The risk is managed by the Group maintaining an appropriate leverage ratio and through this the interest rate is kept as low as possible.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the floating rate liabilities.
The Group considers a reasonable interest rate movement in LIBOR to be 25 basis points based on historical changes to interest rates.
If interest rates had been higher lower by 25 basis points and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 31 December 2017 would decrease increase by 172k 2016: 63k.
Foreign currency risk management The Group manages exposure to foreign exchange rates by carrying out the majority of its transactions in the functional currency of the Group company in the jurisdiction in which it operates.
The Group entities maintain assets in foreign currencies sufficient for regulatory capital purposes in each jurisdiction.
"The Group continues to appraise the potential impacts of the United Kingdom's referendum on EU membership ""Brexit""."
The volatility of the sterling is due to the uncertainties around the effect it might have but the Group's strong momentum and diverse geographic presence, as well as the favourable underlying trends in the markets in which we operate, give the Directors confidence in the continued management of the possible Brexit effect.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities are as follows: Assets Liabilities 2017 2016 2017 2016 000 000 000 000 1 Euro 30,931 7,422 256 369 2 United States dollar 16,442 78,444 1,130 1,037 South African rand 2,106 1,481 1,031 560 49,479 87,347 2,417 1,966 1 Included in the Euro exposure at 31 December 2017 is 21.2 million cash for the LIS Group acquisition which completed on 6 February 2018 note 31.
Included in the United States dollar exposure during the prior year was 73.8 million cash for the Kestrel acquisition which completed on 1 January 2017.
Where considered necessary, the Group will manage its foreign currency risk through hedging arrangements.
A foreign currency contract was entered into during the current year to buy euro for the LIS acquisition, and this contract was closed by year end.
Foreign currency contracts were also entered into during the prior year to sell sterling and buy United States dollars: these contracts related to the FLSV and IFS Group acquisitions and both these contracts were closed before the 2016 year-end.
Foreign currency risk management sensitivity analysis The principal currency of the Group's financial assets and liabilities is pounds sterling.
The Group, however, does own trading subsidiaries based in the United States of America, South Africa, Mauritius, Asia and Europe which are denominated in a currency other than the principal currency.
The Group therefore faces currency exposures.
The following table illustrates management's assessment on the foreign currency impact on the year-end balance sheet and presents the possible impact on the Group's total comprehensive income for the year and net assets arising from potential changes in the euro, United States dollar or South African rand exchange rates, with all other variables remaining constant.
A strengthening or weakening of sterling by 20% is considered an appropriate variable for the sensitivity analysis given the scale of foreign exchange fluctuations over the last two years.

Financial instruments continued Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Groups principal exposure to credit risk arises from the Groups receivables from clients.
The credit risk on liquid funds and borrowings is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the historical financial information, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other credit enhancements are held.
The Group manages credit risk by review at take-on around: Risk of insolvency or closure of the customer's business: Customer liquidity issues: and General creditworthiness, including past default experience of the customer, and customer types.
Liquidity risk management Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group manages liquidity risk to maintain adequate reserves by regular review around the working capital cycle using information on forecast and actual cash flows.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
Regulation in most jurisdictions also requires the Group to maintain a level of liquidity so the Group does not become exposed.
The Group manages liquidity risk to maintain adequate reserves by regular reporting around the working capital cycle using information on forecast and actual cash.
Liquidity and interest risk tables The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities with agreed repayment years.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.
To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rates at the balance sheet date.
The contractual maturity is based on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay.
