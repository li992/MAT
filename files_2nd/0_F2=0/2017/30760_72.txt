Strategic report Governance IFRS financial statements Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 45 Unallocated divisible surplus An unallocated divisible surplus UDS is established where the nature of policy benefits is such that the division between shareholder reserves and policyholder liabilities is uncertain at the reporting date.
Therefore the expected duration for settlement of the UDS is not defined.
This note shows the movements in the UDS during the year.
2017 2016 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 10,208 8,811 Change in participating fund assets 406 4,977 Change in participating fund liabilities 710 4,596 Other movements 10 Change in liability recognised as an expense 294 381 1 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisition and disposals 1,076 Foreign exchange rate movements 263 1,016 Carrying amount at 31 December 9,101 10,208 Less: Amounts classified as held for sale 19 859 9,082 9,349 1 The movement during 2017 relates to the disposal of Antarius 832 million and majority of Spanish business 244 million.
The amount of UDS at 31 December 2017 has decreased to 9.1 billion 2016: 10.2 billion including amounts classified as held for sale, and 9.1 billion 2016: 9.3 billion excluding amounts classified as held for sale.
The decrease is mainly due to the sale of both Antarius and the majority of Spanish business and a distribution of assets out of UK Lifes UDS in anticipation of a special bonus to policyholders, partly offset by the weakening of sterling against the euro.
The participating assets and liabilities have offsetting impacts across the UK and Europe in 2017.
In Europe they have increased mainly driven by an increase in new business and in the UK they have reduced, mainly driven by an increase in bond yields and the distribution of assets.
In 2016, the impacts did not offset.
The participating assets and liabilities increased across all the markets mainly driven by an increase in new business in Europe and a decrease in bond yields in the UK.
Where the aggregate amount of participating assets is less than the participating liabilities within a fund then the shortfall may be held as negative UDS, subject to recoverability testing as part of the liability adequacy requirements of IFRS 4.
There are no material negative UDS balances at the participating fund-level within each life entity in the current and comparative periods, with the exception of one fund in UK Life in the comparative period 2016: a negative UDS of 16 million.
This negative UDS balance was tested for recoverability and considered to be recoverable by comparing the excess of IFRS participating liabilities over the adjusted Solvency II best estimate liabilities for the relevant contracts.
The Solvency II best estimate liabilities were adjusted where Solvency II does not represent a best estimate of shareholders interests consistent with the impairment test for goodwill for long-term business see note 16 and for AVIF on insurance contracts see note 17.
