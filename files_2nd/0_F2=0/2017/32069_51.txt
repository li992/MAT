FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
As at 30 April 2017, the only financial instruments held at fair value were derivative financial assets and liabilities.
Contracts for difference are classified as Level 1 as the fair value is calculated using quoted prices for listed shares and commodities at contract inception and the year end.
Foreign forward purchase and sales contracts and options are classified as Level 2 as the fair value is calculated using models based on inputs which are observable directly or indirectly at the year-end these inputs include but are not restricted to the following maturity date, quoted forward option prices.
Available-for-sale financial assets are classified as Level 1 as the fair value is calculated using quoted prices, except for House of Fraser UK & Ireland Ltd previously Highland Group Holdings which is classified as Level 3.
House of Fraser Ltd is held at managements estimate of the fair value of the enterprise based on publicly and non-publicly available data, managements assessment is that the fair value should be impaired to the estimated recoverable amount, this charge is reflected in the Income Statement.
Other equity derivatives are calculated using a model with inputs which are directly observable and inputs which are not based on observable market data this includes expected volatility from the shares historical prices.
These are therefore classified as Level 3.
133 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 53 weeks ended 30 April 2017 Other equity derivatives relates to a put option referencing listed company shares - this is calculated using an equity valuation model of which the output is the result of a number of inputs including, the terms of the option, the share price, interest rates, the volatility of the underlying stock, and dividends paid by the underlying company.
The volatility of the underlying stock is a significant input into the valuation model.
Volatility is considered an unobservable input.
Changing one or more of the unobservable inputs, for example the volatility of the underlying stock, in the valuation of the option, to reflect reasonably possible alternative assumptions, would not change the fair value materially.
To the extent that the market price of these shares is less than an agreed price on expiry of the put option, the Group has the right to settle the put option by acquiring ordinary shares.
If the market price of the shares is greater than an agreed price on expiry of the put option the counterparty will not exercise the option and the group will receive the premium.
Sports Direct is required to transfer cash collateral to cover its obligations under the Put Option.
The amount of collateral required during the life of the Put Option can increase or decrease by reference to the underlying market price of the shares.
b DERIVATIVES: FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACTS The most significant exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations relates to purchases made in foreign currencies, principally the US Dollar, and online sales in Euros and Australian dollars.
The Groups policy is to reduce substantially the risk associated with foreign currency spot rates by using forward fixed rate currency purchase contracts, taking into account any foreign currency cash flows.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, however if derivatives, including both forwards and written options, do not qualify for hedge accounting they are accounted for as such and accordingly any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The carrying values of the derivative financial instruments includes foreign currency purchase and sales contracts, written currency options and equity derivative contracts: 30 April 2017 24 April 2016 m m HEDGED Foreign forward purchase and sales contracts - assets 16.2 62.1 UNHEDGED Foreign forward purchase and sales contracts assets 17.9 - Equity derivatives - contracts for difference 8.9 12.8 Equity derivatives - assets - 7.6 Fair value of derivative financial instruments - assets 43.0 82.5 HEDGED Foreign purchase and sales contracts - liabilities 9.7 - UNHEDGED Foreign forward and written options purchase and sales contracts - liabilities 46.1 61.5 Equity derivatives - contracts for difference 3.8 - Equity derivatives liabilities 15.4 - Other 0.2 0.2 FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS LIABILITIES 75.2 61.7 The sterling principal amounts of hedged forward foreign currency purchase contracts and contracted forward rates were as follows: 30 April 2017 24 April 2016 m m US Dollar purchases - 77.7 Contracted rates - 1.46-1.71 30 April 2017 24 April 2016 m m US Dollar sales - 38.5 Contracted rates - 1.5367-1.5808 134 Sports Direct International plc Annual Report 2017 30 April 2017 24 April 2016 m m Euro sales 777.3 703.1 Contracted rates 1.069 1.24 1.14-1.289 30 April 2017 24 April 2016 m m AUD sales 12.5 5.2 Contracted rates 1.6896 1.79 1.84 The sterling principal amounts of unhedged forward foreign currency purchase contracts and contracted forward rates were as follows: 30 April 2017 24 April 2016 m m Euro Sales 302.7 - Contracted rates 1.09-1.24 - Value excludes SWAPS of 260.9m euros which are required for cash management purposes only.

c SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The Groups principal foreign currency exposures are to US Dollars and Euros.
The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and equity to a 10% increase and decrease in the US Dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates at the year-end date, assuming all other variables remain unchanged.
The figures have been calculated by comparing the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at the current exchange rate to those if exchange rates moved as illustrated.
The income statement figures include the profit effect of any relevant derivatives which are not in a designated cash flow hedge.
The impact on US Dollar and Euro related hedging instruments is included in equity.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent company, compromising issued share capital, share premium, retained earnings and cash and borrowings.
It is the Groups policy to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain the development of the business.
In respect of equity, the Board has decided that, in order to maximise flexibility in the near term with regards to a number of inorganic growth opportunities under review, not to return any cash by way of a dividend at this time.
The Board is committed to keeping this policy under review and to looking to evaluate alternative methods of returning cash to shareholders when appropriate.
The objective of the Share Scheme is to encourage employee share ownership and to link employees remuneration to the performance of the Company.
It is not designed as a means of managing capital.
In respect of cash and borrowings the Board regularly monitors the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA, the working capital requirements and forecasted cash flows however no minimum or maximum ratios are set.
The ratio for net debt to reported underlying EBITDA, excluding charges for the Share Schemes, is 0.6 2016: 0.26.
The objective is to keep this figure below 3.0 FY16: 2.5.
Based on this analysis, the Board determines the appropriate return to equity holders whilst ensuring sufficient capital is retained within the Group to meet its strategic objectives, including but not limited to, acquisition opportunities.
These capital management policies have remained unchanged from the prior year.
