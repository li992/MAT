STRATEGIC REPORT OUR GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Operating Segments The Group has two reportable segments, Retail and Car Servicing, which are the Groups strategic business units.
Car Servicing became a reporting segment of the Group as a result of the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010.
The strategic business units offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different operational, technological and marketing strategies.
The operations of the Retail reporting segment comprise the retailing of automotive, leisure and cycling products through retail stores.
The operations of the Car Servicing reporting segment comprise car servicing and repair performed from Autocentres.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Executive Directors.
Internal management reports for each of the segments are reviewed by the Executive Directors on a monthly basis.
Key measures used to evaluate performance are Revenue and Operating Profit.
Management believe that these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions.
The following summary describes the operations in each of the Groups reportable segments.
Performance is measured based on segment operating profit, as included in the management reports that are reviewed by the Executive Directors.
These internal reports are prepared in accordance with IFRS accounting policies consistent with these Group Financial Statements.
All material operations of the reportable segments are carried out in the UK and all material non-current assets are located in the UK.
The Groups revenue is driven by the consolidation of individual small value transactions and as a result Group revenue is not reliant on a major customer or group of customers.
All revenue is from external customers.

This will reduce the Companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax liability at 31 March 2017 has been calculated based on the rate of 17% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
In the Chancellors March 2016 budget he announced plans to further reduce the corporation tax rate to 17% from 1 April 2020: however, during this financial period, the UK corporation tax rate was 20% 2016: 20%.
The effective tax rate of 21.0% 2016: 20.5% is higher than the UK corporation tax rate principally due to the non-deductibility of depreciation charged on capital expenditure and non-deductible amortisation of intangible assets.
The tax charge for the period was 14.9m 2016: 16.3m, including a 0.9m credit 2016: 0.3m credit in respect of tax on non-recurring items.
An income tax credit of 0.5m 2016: 0.4m credit on other comprehensive income relates to the movement in fair valuing forward currency contracts outstanding at the year end.
No other items within other comprehensive income have a tax impact.
In addition to the above, a 0.6m current tax debit 2016: 0.7m credit and a 0.6m deferred tax credit 2016: 1.4m debit is recognised in reserves in relation to employee share options.
The Group engages openly and proactively with tax authorities both in the UK and internationally, where it trades and sources products, and is considered low risk by HM Revenue & Customs HMRC.
The Company is fully committed to complying with all of its tax payment and reporting obligations.
In this period, the Groups contribution from both taxes paid and collected exceeded 160m 2016: 150m with the main taxes including corporation tax 15.3m 2016: 17.2m, net VAT 59.0m 2016: 50.2m, Employment taxes of 48.3m 2016: 45.3m and business rates 37.3m 2016: 36.9m.

It will be paid on 25 August 2017 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 4 August 2017.
Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
The weighted average number of shares excludes shares held by an Employee Benefit Trust see note 23 and has been adjusted for the issue purchase of shares during the period.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the 52 weeks to 31 March 2017.
The Group has also chosen to present an alternative earnings per share measure, underlying earnings per share, with profit adjusted for nonrecurring items because it better reflects the Groups underlying performance.
This measure is defined on page 18.

Acquisition of Subsidiaries On 23 May 2016 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Tredz Limited and Wheelies Direct Limited for initial cash consideration of 19.2m excluding transaction costs.
The acquired business comprises an online retailer of premium bikes and cycling parts, accessories and clothing, which trades UK-wide under the brand Tredz, and the UKs largest provider of bicycle replacement for insurance companies which trades under the brand Wheelies.
The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
Contingent Consideration In addition to the initial consideration, a liability of 5.5m was recognised at fair value in respect of contingent consideration due to the previous shareholders.
The contingent consideration is dependent upon the performance of Tredz for the year ended 28 February 2017.
The range of possible payments under the contingent arrangement is nil to 12.5m.
The acquisition had the following impact on the Groups assets and liabilities: Fair value Final fair Book value adjustment value m m m Tredz and Wheelies net assets at the acquisition date Intangible assets and goodwill 0.8 0.8 Tangible assets 1.3 0.1 1.2 Inventories 5.7 0.1 5.6 Trade and other receivables 1.8 1.8 Cash 1.2 1.2 Trade and other payables 6.1 6.1 Borrowings 0.3 0.3 Current tax liabilities 0.2 0.2 Deferred tax liability 0.2 0.2 Total 4.0 1.0 3.0 Goodwill Goodwill was recognised as a result of the acquisition as follows: m Total consideration 23.9 Less fair value of identifiable assets 3.0 Goodwill and intangible assets 20.9 Intangible Assets: Supplier relationships 7.8 Tredz and Wheelies Brand Names 5.6 Computer Software 0.5 Deferred tax liability 2.5 Goodwill 9.5 None of the goodwill acquired is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The goodwill relates to the assembled workforce of Tredz and Wheelies and future expansion and growth opportunities.
The Tredz and Wheelies businesses contributed 36.7m revenue and a profit of 1.8m to the Groups profit before tax for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
If the acquisition of the Tredz and Wheelies businesses had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the period would have been 6.7m higher and Group profit before tax of the parent would have been 0.5m higher before amortisation of intangible assets arising on consolidation.

Goodwill of 253.1m 2016: 253.1m arose on the acquisition of Halfords Holdings Limited by the Company on 31 August 2002 and is allocated to the Retail segment.
The goodwill relates to a portfolio of sites within the UK which management monitors on an overall basis as a group of cash-generating units being Retail.
Goodwill of 69.7m arose on the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010 and is allocated to the Car Servicing segment.
The goodwill relates to a portfolio of centres within the UK which management monitors on an overall basis as a group of cash-generating units being Car Servicing.
Goodwill of 10.7m arose on the acquisition of Boardman Bikes Limited and Boardman International Limited on 4 June 2014 and is allocated to the Retail segment.
The goodwill relates to the two Boardman entities which management monitors on an overall basis as part of the Retail cash-generating unit.
Goodwill of 9.5m arose on the acquisition of Tredz Limited and Wheelies Direct Limited on 23 May 2016 and is allocated to the Retail segment.
The goodwill relates to the two entities which management monitors on an overall basis as part of the Retail cash-generating unit.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Nationwide Autocentres is attributable to a future income to be generated from new retail, fleet customer contracts and related relationships, b the workforce, c the value of immaterial other intangible assets, and d operating synergies.
The goodwill on acquisition of the Boardman Bikes is attributable to a operating synergies and increased control of operations, b the value of immaterial other intangible assets, and c future income to be generated from new retail customer contracts and related relationships.
The goodwill on acquisition of Tredz and Wheelies is attributable to a assembled workforce and b future expansion and growth opportunities.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on value-in-use calculations for each of the two groups of cash-generating units, being Retail and Car Servicing.
This is the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, which is not higher than the Groups operating segments as reported in note 1.
The value-in-use of the goodwill held at 31 March 2017 and 1 April 2016 is driven by, and is most sensitive to, the key assumptions underlying the recoverable amounts of the Group cash-generating units, which are the discount rate and growth rate.
Cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three to five-year period and after consideration of all available information, incorporating the strategies and risks of each segment.
The growth rates used beyond the range of the budgets are shown on the next page.
Given the maturity of the Retail business, no growth rate has been assumed beyond the budget period.
The discount rate is a pre-tax rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cashgenerating units.
The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use are derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital, as adjusted for the specific risks relating to each cash-generating unit.
The discount rates used are shown on the next page.

Pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections.
Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period.
Sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations has been undertaken, which found that there is a more than adequate amount of headroom before an impairment would be triggered.
The directors are confident that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, including a - 1.0% change in the discount rate, would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed the recoverable amounts.
Overall, the directors have concluded that the recoverable amount of the Groups CGUs exceeded their carrying amount.

Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures Treasury Policy The Groups treasury departments main responsibilities are to: Ensure adequate funding and liquidity for the Group: Manage the interest risk of the Groups debt: Invest surplus cash: Manage the clearing bank operations of the Group, and Manage the foreign exchange risk on its non-sterling cash flows.
Treasury activities are delegated by the Board to the Chief Financial Officer CFO.
The CFO controls policy and performance through the line management structure to the Group Treasurer and by reference to the Treasury Committee.
The Treasury Committee meets regularly to monitor the performance of the Treasury function.
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved policies and procedures, which are reviewed on an annual basis.
The Groups debt management policy is to provide an appropriate level of funding to finance the Business Plan over the medium term at a competitive cost and ensure flexibility to meet the changing needs of the Group.
Details of the Groups current borrowing facilities are contained in note 17.
The key risks that the Group faces from a treasury perspective are as follows: Market Risk The Groups exposure to market risk predominantly relates to interest, currency and commodity risk.
These are discussed further below.
Commodity risk is due to the Groups products being manufactured from metals and other raw materials, subject to price fluctuation.
The Group mitigates this risk through negotiating fixed purchase costs or maintaining flexibility over the specification of finished products produced by its supply chain to meet fluctuations.
Interest Rate Risk The Groups policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of the Business Plan and its financial covenants.
The Groups borrowings are currently subject to floating rate interest rates and the Group will continue to monitor movements in the swap market.
If interest rates on floating rate borrowings i. e. cash and cash equivalents and bank borrowings which attract interest at floating rates were to change by or 1% the impact on the results in the Income Statement and equity would be a decrease increase of 0.4m 2016: 0.4m.
Interest rate movements on deposits, obligations under finance leases, trade payables, trade receivables, and other financial instruments do not present a material exposure to the Groups balance sheet.
Capital Risk Management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group manages capital by operating within a debt ratio, which is calculated as the ratio of net debt to Underlying EBITDA.

Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures continued Fair Value Disclosures The fair values of each class of financial assets and liabilities is the carrying amount, based on the following assumptions: Trade receivables, trade payables and finance lease obligations, The fair value approximates to the carrying amount because of the short short-term deposits and borrowings maturity of these instruments, using an interest rate of 7.1% for long-term finance lease obligations.
Long-term borrowings The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the majority are floating rate where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
Forward currency contracts The fair value is determined using the market forward rates at the reporting date and the outright contract rate.
Fair Value Hierarchy Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are as follows: 2017 2016 m m Cash and cash equivalents 16.5 11.9 Loans and receivables 20.9 20.7 Forward exchange contracts used for hedging assets 3.7 4.2 Total financial assets 41.1 36.8 Trade and other payables held at amortised cost 178.4 154.2 Borrowings at amortised cost 73.1 27.0 Unsecured bank overdraft 18.4 22.7 Finance leases 12.0 11.7 Total financial liabilities 281.9 215.6 Trade and other payables within the scope of IAS 39 include all trade payables, all other payables and 46.0m 2016: 44.4m of accruals and deferred income.
Credit Risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was 41.1m 2016: 36.8m as detailed in the table above.
Foreign Currency Risk The Group has a significant transaction exposure with increasing direct-sourced purchases from its suppliers in the Far East, with most of the trade being in US Dollars.
The Groups policy is to manage the foreign exchange transaction exposures of the business to ensure the actual costs do not exceed the budget costs by more than 10% excluding increases in the base cost of the product.
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling businesses whilst they remain immaterial During the 52 weeks to 31 March 2017, the foreign exchange management policy was to hedge via forward contract purchase between 75% and 80% of the material foreign exchange transaction exposures on a rolling 24-month basis.
Hedging is performed through the use of foreign currency bank accounts and forward foreign exchange contracts.

Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures continued The carrying amount of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date is as follows: 31 March 2017 1 April 2016 USD Other USD Other m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 4.3 0.2 2.3 1.1 Trade and other payables 27.0 0.8 19.4 0.4 22.7 0.6 17.1 1.5 The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates on its US dollar financial instruments, the major currency in which the Groups derivatives are denominated.
2017 2016 Increase Increase decrease decrease in equity in equity m m 10% appreciation of the US dollar 18.3 10.2 10% depreciation of the US dollar 14.9 8.4 A strengthening weakening of Sterling, as indicated, against the USD at 31 March 2017 would have decreased increased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown above.
This analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the Group considered to be reasonably possible at the end of the reporting period.
The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
The movements in equity relates to the fair value movements on the Groups forward contracts that are used to hedge future stock purchases.
Pension Liability Risk The Group has no association with any defined-benefit pension scheme and therefore carries no deferred, current or future liabilities in respect of such a scheme.
The Group operates a number of Group Personal Pension Plans for colleagues.
Liquidity Risk The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when they fall due by ensuring that there is sufficient cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash requirements of the Group for the current Business Plan.
The minimum liquidity level is currently set at 30m, such that under Treasury Policy the maximum drawings would be 140m of the 170m available facility, to include the Overdraft Facility of 20m.
The process to manage the risk is to ensure there are contracts in place for key suppliers, detailing the payment terms, and for providers of debt, the Group ensured that such counterparties used for credit transactions held at least an Acredit rating at the time of amend and extend agreement November 2014.
At the year-end the banks within the banking group maintained a credit rating of Aor above, in line with Treasury policy.
The counterparty credit risk is reviewed in the Treasury report, which is forwarded to the Treasury Committee and the Treasurer reviews credit exposure on a daily basis.
The risk is measured through review of forecast liquidity each month by the Treasurer to determine whether there are sufficient credit facilities to meet forecast requirements, and through monitoring covenants on a regular basis to ensure there are no significant breaches, which would lead to an Event of Default.
Calculations are submitted bi-annually to the Group banking agent.
There have been no breaches of covenants during the reported periods.
The contractual maturities of finance leases are disclosed in note 12.
All trade and other payables are due within one year.

Halfords Company Share Option Scheme The CSOS was introduced in June 2004 and the Company has made annual grants since.
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant.
The contractual life of an option is 10 years.
Options granted before August 2013 will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the achievement of a three-year performance condition.
For grants up to 150% of basic salary the options can only be exercised if the increase in earnings per share EPS over the period is not less than the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 3.5% per year.
In the case of grants in excess of 150% of basic salary, the excess can only be exercised in full if the increase is not less than RPI plus 10% per year.
Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment.
Changes to the performance criteria of the CSOS scheme in relation to the awards granted from August 2013 onwards were made by the Remuneration Committee.
These changes were made in order to create better alignment with Groups three-year strategic priorities following the Moving Up A Gear programme.
The awards are dependent on EBITDA performance and are only exercisable if EBITDA growth exceeds a compound annual growth rate of 2.5% over the three-year performance period, or a total growth rate of 8.4%.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies since the IPO in June 2004.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds.
Options were valued using the BlackScholes option-pricing models.
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.

Halfords Sharesave Scheme The SAYE is open to all employees with eligible employment service.
Options may be exercised under the scheme if the option holder completes their saving contract for a period of three years and then not more than six months thereafter.
Special provisions allow early exercise in the case of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the company or business which employs the option holder is transferred out of the Group, or in the event of a change in control, reconstruction or winding up of the Company.
Performance Share Plan The introduction of a Performance Share Plan PSP was approved at the Annual General Meeting in August 2005 awarding the Executive Directors and certain senior management conditional rights to receive shares.
Annual schemes have been approved for each year from 2005.
The extent to which such rights vest will depend upon the Companys performance over the three-year period following the award date.
The vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the Companys relative total shareholder return TSR performance and the vesting of the other 50% by the Companys absolute EPS performance against RPI.
The Companys TSR performance will be measured against the FTSE 350 general retailers as a comparator group.
No retesting will be permitted.
The TSR element of the options granted under the schemes has been valued using a model developed by Deloitte.
The Deloitte model uses the Groups share price volatility, the correlation between comparator companies and the vesting schedule attaching to the PSP tranche rather than generating a large number of simulations of share price and TSR performance to determine the fair value of the award using a Monte Carlo model.
For 2009 awards onwards, the Committee has recommended the reinvestment of dividends earned on award shares, such shares to invest in proportion to the vesting of the original award shares.
This is in line with best practice as contained in the ABI guidelines on executive remuneration.
Following this recommendation the shares awarded in 2011, 2012 and 2013 under the Performance Share Plan earned final dividends of 9.1p per share and were reinvested in shares at a cost of 4.82 per share.
Shares awarded in 2012, 2013 and 2014 under the PSP earned interim dividends of 5.5p per share and were reinvested in shares at a cost of 4.59 per share.
Changes to the performance criteria of the PSP in relation to the awards granted during 2015 were made by the Remuneration Committee.
These changes were made in order to create better alignment with the Companys three-year strategic priorities following the Getting Into Gear programme.
The awards are weighted 25% towards Group revenue growth targets and 75% towards Group EBITDA growth targets.
The core award remains at 150% of base salary with a multiplier being introduced of 1.55 the core award if exceptional levels of performance are achieved.
The shares vesting as part of this multiplier calculation will attract a retention period of two years.
In order to focus management the awards will be underpinned by a minimum Group EBITDA, and a net debt to EBITDA ratio no greater than 1.55 throughout the three-year performance period.
