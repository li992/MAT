FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 150 ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES When assessing and discussing the Groups reported financial performance, financial position and cash flows, management may make reference to Alternative Performance Measures APMs that are not defined or specified under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
APMs are not uniformly defined by all companies, including those in the Groups industry.
Accordingly, the APMs used by the Group may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures made by other companies.
APMs should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or as superior to, measures of financial performance, financial position or cash flows reported in accordance with IFRS.
Ferrexpo makes reference to the following APMs in the 2017 Annual Report.
C1 cash cost of production Definition: Non-financial measure, which represents the cash costs of production of iron pellets from own ore divided by production volume of own production ore. Non-C1 cost components include non-cash costs such as depreciation, inventory movements and costs of purchased ore and concentrate.
The Group presents the C1 cash cost of production because it believes it is a useful operational measure of its cost competitiveness compared to its peer group.

The underlying EBITDA is presented because it is a useful measure for evaluating the Groups ability to generate cash and its operating performance.
See Note 5 for further details.
Closest equivalent IFRS measure: Profit before tax and finance.
Rationale for adjustment: The Group presents the underlying EBITDA as it is a useful measure for evaluating its ability to generate cash and its operating performance.
It excludes the impact of special items that can mask underlying changes in performance.
Also it aids comparability across peer groups as it is a measurement that is often used.
