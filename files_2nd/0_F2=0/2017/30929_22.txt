com | Stock Code HILS Financial Statements 137 Company Principal Accounting Policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys Financial Statements, except as noted below.
Basis of preparation These Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
In preparing these Financial Statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
Under section s408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own Profit and Loss Account.
As the Consolidated Financial Statements include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures: IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of Group settled share based payments: and The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs.
The Accounting Policies set out on pages 137 to 139 have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Financial Statements.
Measurement convention The Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments, financial instruments classified as fair value through profit or loss or as available-for-sale, investment property and liabilities for cash-settled share-based payments.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings In the Companys Financial Statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are carried at cost, less impairment.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the Companys functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account except for differences arising on the retranslation of qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Financial instruments Trade and other debtors Trade and other debtors are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other creditors Trade and other creditors are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
Fair value hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately in the Profit and Loss Account.
The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair value that is attributable to the risk being hedged even if it is normally carried at cost or amortised cost and any gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account even if those gains would normally be recognised directly in reserves.
com | Stock Code HILS Financial Statements 138 Company Principal Accounting Policies continued Provisions A provision is recognised in the Balance Sheet when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of tangible fixed assets have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of tangible fixed assets.
Leases in which the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases.
Where land and buildings are held under leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings.
Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and less accumulated impairment losses.
Lease payments are accounted for as described below.
Depreciation is charged to the Profit and Loss Account on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of tangible fixed assets.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Leasehold improvements life of the lease Plant, machinery and vehicles 4 to 20 years Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date.
Leases Operating lease payments Payments excluding costs for services and insurance made under operating leases are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Contingent rents are charged as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.
Pension scheme arrangements Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
The Companys net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair values of any plan assets at bid price are deducted.
The Company determines the net interest on the net defined benefit liability asset for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability asset.
The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on bonds that have a credit rating of at least AA that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Companys obligations and that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.
Remeasurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets excluding interest and the effect of the asset ceiling if any, excluding interest.
The Company recognises them immediately in other comprehensive income and all other expenses related to defined benefit plans in employee benefit expenses in profit or loss.
Certain of the Companys employees are members of Group-wide defined benefit schemes.
The net defined benefit cost of the plans is allocated to participating entities based on the contracting entity of the participating employees of the scheme.
The contributions payable by the participating entities are determined on the same basis.
com | Stock Code HILS Financial Statements 139 Share-based payments Share-based payment arrangements in which the Company receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions, regardless of how the equity instruments are obtained by the Company.
The grant date fair value of share-based payments awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
The fair value of the awards granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
Share-based payment transactions in which the Company receives goods or services by incurring a liability to transfer cash or other assets that is based on the price of the Companys equity instruments are accounted for as cash-settled share-based payments.
The fair value of the amount payable to employees is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.
The liability is remeasured at each Balance Sheet date and at settlement date.
Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised as personnel expense in profit or loss.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Ordinary dividends Dividends payable are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Dividends receivable are accounted for on a cash accounting basis.
Financial guarantee contracts Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of subsidiary companies, the Company considers these to be insurance contracts and treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
