Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies a Basis of preparation Basis of accounting The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for items that are required by IFRS to be measured at fair value, principally certain financial instruments.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee of the IASB, as adopted by the European Union IFRS, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The Financial Statements set out on pages 92 to 155 have been prepared using consistent accounting policies, except for the adoption of new accounting standards and interpretations noted below.
No revisions to adopted IFRS that became applicable in 2017 had a significant impact on the Group Financial Statements.
These Financial Statements are presented in millions of Sterling rounded to the nearest one decimal place.
Basis of consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements set out the Groups financial position as at 31 December 2017 and the Groups financial performance for the year ended 31 December 2017, which incorporate the Financial Statements of Spectris plc and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost.
All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance and financial position, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 47.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 28 to 32.
In addition, Note 27 to the Financial Statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups net debt balance at 31 December 2017 was 50.5m 2016: 150.9m, with available undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 406.5m 2016: 406.0m.
The Board has reviewed sensitivity analysis on the Groups forecasts to 30 June 2019, the maturity profile of its financial facilities and liabilities Notes 17 and 28 and the ability of the Group to re-finance these obligations as they fall due.
The principal liquidity risk is mitigated through its financial risk management policies Note 27.
For the foreseeable future, the Board has a high level of confidence that the Group will have the necessary liquid resources to meet its liabilities as they fall due and will be able to sustain its business model, strategy and operations and remain solvent, including the impact of reasonably possible adverse scenarios.
For this reason, it continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group Financial Statements.
There are no key sensitivities identified in relation to this conclusion.
Further information on the going concern of the Group can be found on page 39 in the Viability Statement.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted There are a number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2017 which, therefore, have not been applied in preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Transition to IFRS 9 for the Group will take effect from 1 January 2018 with the half-year results for June 2018 being IFRS 9 compliant, and the first Annual Report published in accordance with IFRS 9 being for the year ended 31 December 2018.
There is no requirement to restate comparatives.
IFRS 9 provides a new impairment model for financial assets, which requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected credit losses rather than incurred credit losses as is the case under IAS 39.
This requires the Group to record expected credit losses on all of its trade receivables, either on a 12-month or lifetime basis.
The Group will apply the simplified approach and record lifetime expected losses on all trade receivables.
Overall, the Group expects no material impact on its statement of financial position and equity from applying the impairment requirements of IFRS 9.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The Group has adopted IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' using the modified retrospective approach, which means that the cumulative impact on adoption will be recognised in retained earnings as of 1 January 2018 with the half-year results for June 2018 being IFRS 15 compliant, and the first Annual Report published in accordance with IFRS 15 being for the year ended 31 December 2018.
Comparatives will not be restated.
IFRS 15 provides a single, principles-based, five-step model to be applied to all sales contracts, based on the transfer of control of goods and services to customers, and it replaces the separate model for goods and services of IAS 18 Revenue.
Spectris plc 97 Spectris plc 97 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies continued Management carried out a comprehensive impact assessment which included scoping the Groups revenues to identify different revenue streams and performing sample contract reviews to determine the appropriate revenue recognition treatment under IFRS 15.
To ensure a consistent approach across the Group, the exercise was supported centrally through setting the approach to transition and providing the appropriate tools and guidance.
Revenue is derived from a single performance obligation which is either the sale of goods or the provision of services.
Under IFRS 15, revenue from the sale of goods, where the goods are not required to be installed, will continue to be recognised when legal title transfers to the customer on delivery.
When the sale of goods is combined with installation, revenue recognition depends upon the nature of the installation.
Simple installations are those which the customer perceives as a separate obligation within the overall contract to deliver goods, whereas complex installations are those for which the installation is an integral part of the delivery of the goods.
Revenue will be recognised for simple installations separately from the delivery of goods, and only when the installation has occurred.
For complex installations, revenue recognition on the delivery of the goods will be deferred until installation is complete.
Revenue from the provision of services, including ongoing support, servicing and maintenance, will continue to be recognised in line with the delivery of the service.
For contracts which combine sale of goods and provision of services, the contracts revenue will continue to be allocated across the individual components in line with the relative value and accounted for as described above.
The overall impact on transition on 1 January 2018 for the Group is expected to be as follows: Decrease in Increase in retained deferred earnings income Segment m m Materials Analysis 22.6 30.8 Test and Measurement In-line Instrumentation 0.3 0.7 Industrial Controls 0.1 Group 22.9 31.6 If the Group had applied IFRS 15 from 1 January 2017, the impact on reported revenue for 2017 would have been a decrease of 7.1m 0.5%.
The adoption of IFRS 15 will also have an impact on the phasing of revenue between the first and second halves of the year with an increase in revenue recognised in the first half of the year driven by later recognition of revenues from the peak sales month of December to January under IFRS 15.
IFRS 16 Leases Transition to IFRS 16 for the Group will take effect from 1 January 2019 with the half-year results for June 2019 being IFRS 16 compliant, with the first Annual Report published in accordance with IFRS 16 being for the year ended 31 December 2019.
IFRS 16 provides a single model for lessees which recognises a right of use asset and lease liability for all leases which are longer than one year or which are not classified as low value.
The impact of IFRS 16 will be to recognise a lease liability and a corresponding asset in the Statement of Financial Position for leases currently classified as operating leases.
The most significant impact will be that the Groups land, building and car leases will be recognised on the balance sheet.
Further assessment of other leases is ongoing.
The Groups future lease commitments for land, building and car leases as at 31 December 2017, which provides an indicator of the value to be recognised on the balance sheet, was 66.4m.
There are no other standards that are not yet effective and that would be expected to have a material impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates In determining and applying accounting policies, judgement is often required where the choice of specific policy, assumption or accounting estimate to be followed could materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, should it later be determined that a different choice be more appropriate.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
In the course of preparing these Financial Statements in accordance with the Groups accounting policies, no judgements that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements have been made, other than those involving estimation.
Management considers the following to be key areas of estimation uncertainty for the Group due to the possibility of material change in the next year.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty i Taxation The Group operates in a number of countries and is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
Significant estimation is required in determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment is often by its nature complex, and cannot be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority which may take several years to conclude.
Amounts provided are accrued based on managements interpretation of country-specific tax laws and the likelihood of settlement.
Actual liabilities could differ from the amount provided which could have a consequent adverse impact on the results and net position of the Group.
The assumptions and estimates which have been applied in the determination of taxation are detailed in Note 9.
Details of the accounting policies applied in respect of taxation are set out on page 100.
98 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 98 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 ii Retirement benefit plans Accounting for retirement benefit plans under IAS 19 revised requires an assessment of the future benefits payable in accordance with actuarial assumptions.
The discount rate and rate of retail price inflation RPI assumptions applied in the calculation of plan liabilities, which are set out in Note 20, represent a key source of estimation uncertainty for the Group.
Details of the accounting policies applied in respect of retirement benefit plans are set out on page 102. b Summary of significant accounting policies The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently by Group entities to all years presented in these Financial Statements.
Business combinations and goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration for the interests in subsidiary undertakings over the net fair value to the Group of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Where the fair value of the Groups share of identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration, the difference is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Contingent consideration is initially recognised as a liability with changes to estimates of contingent consideration reflected in operating profit unless they occur during the 12-month measurement period, in which situation the amount of goodwill recognised on the acquisition is adjusted.
Adjustments to contingent consideration are treated as an adjusting item for the purposes of alternative performance measures see Note 2.
Transaction costs on a business combination are expensed as incurred in the Consolidated Income Statement and treated as an adjusting item for the purposes of alternative performance measures see Note 2.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business is tested annually for impairment.
Goodwill is not amortised, and any impairment losses are not subsequently reversed.
The net book value of goodwill at the date of transition to IFRS has been treated as deemed cost.
On the subsequent disposal or discontinuance of a previously acquired business, the relevant goodwill is dealt with in the Consolidated Income Statement except for the goodwill already charged to reserves.
From 1 January 2004, goodwill is allocated on acquisition to cash-generating units that are anticipated to benefit from the combination.
Goodwill is tested for impairment by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates and comparing it against the net book value.
This estimate of recoverable amount is determined annually and additionally when there is an indication that a cash-generating unit may be impaired.
The Groups identified cashgenerating units are smaller than the reportable operating segments in Note 3.
The estimate of recoverable amount requires significant assumptions to be made and is based on a number of factors such as the near-term business outlook for the cash-generating unit, including both its operating profit and operating cash flow performance.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Intangible assets and amortisation The cost of acquiring software including associated implementation costs where applicable that is not specific to an item of property, plant and equipment is classified as an intangible asset.
Self-funded research and development costs are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the year in which they are incurred unless development expenditure meets certain strict criteria for capitalisation.
These criteria include demonstration of the technical feasibility and intent of completing a new intangible asset that will be available for sale and that the asset will generate probable future economic benefits.
From the point where expenditure meets the criteria, development costs are capitalised and amortised over the useful economic lives of the assets to which they relate.
The Directors consider that, due to the nature of projects undertaken, the proportion of development costs incurred that meets the criteria for capitalisation is immaterial.
Intangible assets arising from a business combination that are separable from goodwill are recognised initially at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Other acquired intangible assets including software not specific to an item of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost plus any associated implementation costs where applicable.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits, otherwise it is expensed as incurred.
Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful economic life determined on an asset-by-asset basis or underlying contractual life.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Software 3 to 5 years.
Patents, contractual rights and technology up to 10 years, dependent upon the nature of the underlying contractual right.
Customer-related and trade names 3 to 20 years, dependent upon the underlying contractual arrangements and specific circumstances such as customer retention experience.
Property, plant and equipment and depreciation Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost comprises the purchase price paid and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use.
Tangible assets arising from a business combination are recognised initially at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Spectris plc 99 Spectris plc 99 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies continued Depreciation is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the estimated residual value which is reviewed annually, of property, plant and equipment over its estimated useful economic life.
Depreciation commences on the date the assets are available for use within the business and the asset carrying values are reviewed for impairment when there is an indication that they may be impaired.
The depreciation charge is revised where useful lives are different from those previously estimated, or where technically obsolete assets are required to be written down.
Where parts of an item of plant and equipment have separate lives, they are accounted for and depreciated as separate items.
Estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold and long leasehold property and automotive testing tracks 20 to 40 years.
Short leasehold property over the period of the lease.
Plant and equipment 3 to 20 years.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective asset.
Inventories Inventories and work in progress are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Inventory acquired as part of business combinations is valued at fair value less cost to sell.
Cost represents direct costs incurred and, where appropriate, production or conversion costs and other costs to bring the inventory to its existing location and condition.
In the case of manufacturing inventory and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.
Inventory is accounted for on a first-in, first-out basis or, in some cases, a weighted-average basis, if deemed more appropriate for the business.
Provisions are made to write down slow-moving, excess and obsolete items to net realisable value, based on an assessment of technological and market developments and on an analysis of historical and projected usage with regard to quantities on hand.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount which is considered a reasonable proxy for fair value and are subsequently held at amortised cost less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the transactions.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the original carrying amount and the recoverable amount, being the present value of expected cash flows receivable.
The movement in the provision is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits held on call or with maturities of less than three months at inception.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash equivalents for the purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Assets and liabilities held for sale Assets, liabilities and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Assets, liabilities and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition and when management is committed to the sale which is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised at the amounts expected to be paid to counterparties and subsequently held at amortised cost.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources, that can be reliably measured, will be required to settle the obligation.
In respect of warranties, a provision is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold.
Provisions are recognised at an amount equal to the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Groups liability.
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation will only be confirmed by future events or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability.
Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefit is probable.
Obligations arising from restructuring plans are recognised when detailed formal plans have been established and when there is a valid expectation that such a plan will be carried out.
Leasing Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises both current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case tax is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of prior years.
Tax positions are reviewed to assess whether a provision should be made based on prevailing circumstances.
Tax provisions are included within Current taxation payable.
100 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 100 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Deferred taxation is provided on taxable temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and their corresponding tax bases.
No provision is made for deferred tax which would become payable on the distribution of retained profits by overseas subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability settled based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
Deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of intra-group dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.
Foreign currency translation The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined with reference to the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date.
Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions are determined using the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or the translation of monetary assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates, and are charged credited to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
On consolidation, the Income Statement items of subsidiaries are translated into Sterling at average rates of exchange.
Statement of Financial Position items are translated into Sterling at year-end exchange rates.
Exchange differences on the retranslation are taken to the translation reserve within equity.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
All other exchange differences are charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement in the year in which they arise.
On disposal of an overseas subsidiary, any cumulative exchange movements relating to that subsidiary held in the translation reserve are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Derivative financial instruments may be purchased to hedge the Groups exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates.
The accounting policies applied in these circumstances are described below.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are measured at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective-interest basis.
Financial instruments Recognition The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities on its Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Measurement When financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised, they are measured at fair value, being the consideration given or received plus directly attributable transaction costs.
In determining estimated fair value, investments are valued at quoted bid prices on the trade date.
When quoted prices on an active market are not available, fair value is determined by reference to price quotations for similar instruments traded.
Originated loans and receivables are initially recognised in accordance with the policy stated above and subsequently re-measured at amortised cost using the effective-interest method.
Allowance for impairment is estimated on a case-by-case basis.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge risks associated with foreign exchange fluctuations.
These are designated as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are reclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, in the same line of the Consolidated Income Statement as the recognised hedged item.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.
Spectris plc 101 Spectris plc 101 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies continued Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Derecognition A financial asset is derecognised when the Group loses control over the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset.
This occurs when the rights are realised, expire or are surrendered.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired.
Originated loans and receivables are derecognised on the date they are transferred by the Group.
Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each Consolidated Statement of Financial Position reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset, or group of financial assets, is impaired.
A financial asset, or group of financial assets, is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset an incurred loss event and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Net investment hedge accounting The Group uses Euro-denominated borrowings as a hedge against the translation exposure on the Groups net investment in overseas companies.
To the extent that the hedge is effective at hedging the variability in the net assets of such companies, caused by changes in foreign exchange rates, the changes in the value of the borrowings are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The ineffective part of any change in value caused by changes in foreign exchange rates is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Employee benefits The Group operates defined benefit post-retirement plans and defined contribution pension plans.
Defined benefit plans The Groups net obligation recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan as the present value of the plans liabilities less the fair value of the plans assets.
The operating and financing costs of defined benefit plans are recognised separately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Operating costs comprise the current service cost, plan administrative expense, any gains or losses on settlement or curtailments, and past service costs where benefits have vested.
Finance items comprise the unwinding of the discount on the net asset surplus deficit.
Actuarial gains or losses comprising changes in plans liabilities due to experience and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The amount of any pension fund asset recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is limited to any future refunds from the plan or the present value of reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
In certain countries, the Group participates in industry-wide defined benefit-type pension arrangements.
In such circumstances, it is not possible to determine the amount of any surplus or deficit attributable to the Group and the pension costs are accounted for as if the arrangements were defined contribution plans.
These are not material to the Group and, accordingly, no additional disclosures are provided.
Short-term benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share-based payments Certain employees of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value of share awards with market-related vesting conditions is determined by an external consultant and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each Consolidated Statement of Financial Position reporting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual outcome of awards which have vested.
No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
Where it is not possible to incentivise managers of the Groups operating companies with equity-settled options, they are issued with cashsettled options.
The charge for these awards is adjusted to reflect the expected and actual levels of options that vest and the fair value is based on either the share price at date of exercise or the share price at the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date if sooner.
102 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 102 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Own shares Own equity instruments which are re-acquired own shares are recognised at cost and deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration paid to acquire such equity instruments is recognised within equity.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by shareholders.
Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of the right to consideration and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business to external customers net of returns and discounts, excluding value added tax and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
This is typically on delivery when legal title transfers to the customer.
If it is probable that discounts will be granted and the amount can be measured reliably, then the discount is recognised as a reduction of revenue as the sales are recognised.
For contracts that involve a significant element of installation or testing of equipment, revenue is recognised at the point of customer acceptance.
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in proportion to the measurement of the stage of completion of services rendered as at the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date.
This is assessed by reference to the amount of time incurred in proportion to the total expected time to be taken to deliver the service.
Occasionally, the initial contract covers both the supply of goods and ongoing support, servicing and maintenance.
For such contracts revenue is allocated across each of the individual components in line with their relative value and each element is accounted for as described above.
Interest payable and receivable Interest payable comprises the interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest method and the unwinding of the discount factor on deferred or contingent consideration.
Interest receivable comprises interest income on cash and invested funds and is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as it accrues.
Alternative performance measures Policy Spectris uses adjusted figures as key performance measures in addition to those reported under IFRS, as management believe these measures enable management and stakeholders to assess the underlying trading performance of the businesses as they exclude certain non-operational items, foreign exchange movements and the impact of acquisitions and disposals.
The adjusted performance measures APMs are consistent with how the businesses performance is planned and reported within the internal management reporting to the Board and Operating Committees.
Some of these measures are used for the purpose of setting remuneration targets.
The key APMs that the Group uses include like-for-like LFL organic performance measures and Adjusted measures for the income statement together with adjusted financial position and cash flow measures.
Explanations of how they are calculated and how they are reconciled to an IFRS statutory measure are set out below.
Adjusted measures The Groups policy is to exclude items that are considered to be significant in nature and or quantum and where treatment as an adjusted item provides stakeholders with additional useful information to assess the period-on-period trading performance of the Group.
On this basis, adjusted figures exclude certain non-operational items that are predominantly acquisitionor disposal-related items which management have defined as: Amortisation and impairment of acquisition-related goodwill and other intangible assets: Bargain purchase on acquisition: Depreciation of acquisition-related fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment: Acquisition-related costs, deferred and contingent consideration fair value adjustments: Profits or losses on termination or disposal of businesses: Unwinding of the discount factor on deferred and contingent consideration: Unrealised changes in the fair value of financial instruments: Gains or losses on retranslation of short-term inter-company loan balances: and Related tax effects on the above and other tax items which do not form part of the underlying tax rate see Note 9.
Spectris plc 103 Spectris plc 103 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts continued 2.
Alternative performance measures continued LFL measures The Board reviews and compares current and prior year segmental sales and adjusted profit at constant exchange rates and excludes the impact of acquisitions and disposals during the year.
In addition, Project Uplift programme implementation costs are excluded from adjusted profit to better reflect year-on-year operating performance.
The constant exchange rate comparison uses the current year reported segmental information, stated in each operating entitys functional currency, and translates the results into its presentation currency using the prior year's monthly exchange rates, irrespective of the underlying transactional currency.
Within the In-line Instrumentation segment, the BTG business has large functional currency mismatches against its underlying transaction currencies which distort LFL comparison at times of significant currency movements.
Accordingly, we have modified the basis on which BTGs LFL results are translated into Sterling by using the actual underlying transaction currency mix for determining transactional gains losses to provide more accurate and reliable information on BTGs underlying performance.
The incremental impact of business acquisitions is excluded for the first 12 months of ownership from the month of purchase.
For business disposals, comparative figures for segmental sales and adjusted operating profit are adjusted to reflect the comparable periods of ownership.
The Microscan business was disposed of on 2 October 2017 and the segmental sales and adjusted profit for 2016 exclude the trading results of the last three months of 2016.
The LFL measure is presented as a means of eliminating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on the period-on-period reported results as well as allowing the Board to assess the underlying trading performance of the businesses on a LFL basis for both sales and operating profit.
Based on the above policy, the adjusted performance measures are derived from the reported figures as follows: Income statement measures a LFL and adjusted sales by segment Materials Test and In-line Industrial 2017 Analysis Measurement Instrumentation Controls Total Sales by segment m m m m m Reported sales 464.9 487.3 310.9 262.5 1,525.6 Constant exchange rate adjustment 16.8 21.5 12.8 13.1 64.2 Acquisitions 0.9 38.2 5.1 44.2 LFL adjusted sales 447.2 427.6 293.0 249.4 1,417.2 Materials Test and In-line Industrial 2016 Analysis Measurement Instrumentation Controls Total Sales by segment m m m m m Reported sales 418.9 404.5 275.6 246.8 1,345.8 Disposal of business 11.3 11.3 LFL adjusted sales 418.9 404.5 275.6 235.5 1,334.5 104 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 104 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 b LFL and adjusted operating profit and margin by segment and EBITDA Materials Test and In-line Industrial 2017 Analysis Measurement Instrumentation Controls Total Adjusted operating profit by segment m m m m m Reported operating profit 68.6 55.6 29.5 28.7 182.4 Net acquisition-related costs and fair value adjustments 1.8 0.1 0.4 1.7 0.4 Depreciation of acquisition-related fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment 0.7 0.7 Amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets 12.7 14.6 3.3 11.3 41.9 Bargain purchase on acquisition 1.9 1.9 Adjusted operating profit 83.1 68.9 33.2 38.3 223.5 Project Uplift costs 4.2 5.3 2.8 3.5 15.8 Adjusted operating profit before Project Uplift costs 87.3 74.2 36.0 41.8 239.3 Constant exchange rate adjustment 1.0 2.1 1.1 1.7 5.9 Acquisitions 0.1 3.9 2.0 2.0 LFL adjusted operating profit before Project Uplift costs 86.2 68.2 36.9 40.1 231.4 Materials Test and In-line Industrial 2016 Analysis Measurement Instrumentation Controls Total Adjusted operating profit by segment m m m m m Reported operating profit 66.2 26.7 37.6 92.2 38.3 Net acquisition-related costs and fair value adjustments 0.2 2.1 0.3 7.5 10.1 Depreciation of acquisition-related fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment 0.2 0.2 Amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets 9.8 11.9 3.3 11.9 36.9 Impairment of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets 20.9 94.4 115.3 Adjusted operating profit 76.2 61.8 41.2 21.6 200.8 Project Uplift costs 0.9 1.2 0.6 0.5 3.2 Adjusted operating profit before Project Uplift costs 77.1 63.0 41.8 22.1 204.0 Disposal of business 1.7 1.7 LFL adjusted operating profit before Project Uplift costs 77.1 63.0 41.8 20.4 202.3 Materials Test and In-line Industrial 2017 Analysis Measurement Instrumentation Controls Total Operating margin % % % % % Reported operating profit 14.8 11.4 9.5 10.9 12.0 Adjusted operating profit 17.9 14.1 10.7 14.6 14.7 LFL adjusted operating profit before Project Uplift costs 19.3 16.0 12.6 16.1 16.3 Materials Test and In-line Industrial 2016 Analysis Measurement Instrumentation Controls Total Operating margin % % % % % Reported operating profit 15.8 6.6 13.6 37.4 2.8 Adjusted operating profit 18.2 15.3 15.0 8.7 14.9 LFL adjusted operating profit before Project Uplift costs 18.4 15.6 15.2 8.7 15.2 Spectris plc 105 Spectris plc 105 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts continued 2.

'Tax credits and incentives' above refers principally to research and development tax credits and other reliefs for innovation such as the UK Patent Box regime and Dutch Innovation Box regime, as well as tax reliefs available for manufacturing activities located in the USA.
Factors that may affect the future tax charge The Group's tax charge in future years is likely to be affected by the proportion of profits arising, and the effective tax rates, in the various territories in which the Group operates, as well as changes in the tax law affecting future periods, such as the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

The Group is potentially subject to tax audits in many jurisdictions.
By their nature these are often complex and could take a significant period of time to be agreed with the tax authorities.
Judgement is therefore applied based on the interpretation of country-specific tax legislation and the likelihood of settlement.
The Group estimates and accrues taxes that will ultimately be payable when reviews or audits by tax authorities of tax returns are completed.
These estimates include judgements about the position expected to be taken by each tax authority.
The Group applies judgement in respect of possible tax audit adjustments primarily in respect of transfer pricing as well as in respect of financing arrangements and tax credits and incentives.
In respect of transfer pricing, the level of provision is determined by reference to management judgements of the adjustments that would arise in the event that certain intra-group transactions are successfully challenged as not being at arms length.
Management estimates of the level of risk arising from tax audit may change in the next year as a result of changes in legislation or tax authority practice or correspondence with tax authorities during a specific tax audit.
It is not possible to quantify the impact that such future developments may have on the Groups tax positions.
Actual outcomes and settlements may differ significantly from the estimates recorded in these Consolidated Financial Statements.
Further detail is provided below in relation to tax provisions that are known to be potentially material.
Judgement is also applied relating to the recognition of deferred tax assets which are dependent on an assessment of the generation of future taxable income in the countries concerned in which temporary differences become deductible or in which tax losses can be utilised.
These estimates may change in the next year if there are changes in the forecast profitability of the relevant company.
The UKs dividend taxation regime prior to July 2009 is the subject of long-running litigation between HMRC and other taxpayers in relation to the tax charge on dividends received from EU-based companies.
The outcome of this dispute is likely to be relevant to the Group in respect of certain dividends received by UK Group companies before that date.
Pending resolution in the courts, an amount of 7.5m 2016: 7.5m continues to be held as a current tax liability for the potential tax liabilities arising if the final decision is in HMRCs favour.
Following an IFRIC Agenda decision during the year, an amount of 5.1m relating to accrued interest on the potential tax liabilities, which in previous years was held as a current tax liability, has now been reclassified as a provision see Note 19.
In October 2017 the EU Commission opened a formal State Aid investigation into an exemption within the UKs current Controlled Foreign Company CFC regime introduced in 2013 for certain finance income.
The investigation is ongoing, but if the Commission ultimately concludes that the provisions do constitute State Aid then they would require the UK to recover any such aid from affected parties.
The Group has claimed the benefit of this exemption, and therefore may be adversely affected by the outcome of the investigation.
If the Commission were to conclude that the finance exemption with the UKs CFC regime constitutes State Aid and no other exemptions were available to the Group then, as at 31 December 2017, an additional liability of 14.0m in respect of tax and 0.3m in respect of interest would arise unless such a decision could be successfully challenged in the EU Courts.
However, no provision has been made in respect of this investigation since we believe that it is more likely than not that no additional tax will ultimately be due.
Within the tax charge for 2016 is a credit of 3.1m relating to recognition of the net benefit of unused tax losses arising from the acquisition of Spectraseis AG in 2015.
The ultimate utilisation of these losses is now considered probable as a result of the post-acquisition restructuring of the business.

The Groups identified cash-generating units are smaller than the four reportable segments, being the 12 operating companies.
Goodwill arising on a bolt-on acquisition is combined with the goodwill in the existing Group company and is not considered separately for impairment purposes, since such acquisitions are quickly integrated.
On 1 January 2017, two of the Groups operating companies in the Materials Analysis segment, Malvern Instruments and PANalytical, merged their activities to form Malvern Panalytical.
Both companies were previously identified as separate cash-generating units.
Subsequent to the merger, the two operating companies have been reviewed, managed and budgeted for as one operating company for internal purposes therefore for annual impairment review purposes in 2017 they have been reviewed as one cash-generating unit.
Included within Other are three 2016: four cash-generating units in which none of the goodwill balances is considered to be individually significant.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
As part of the annual impairment review, the carrying amount of goodwill has been assessed with reference to its recoverable amount, determined based on value in use.
In assessing value in use, the forecast projected cash flows of each cash-generating unit, which are based on actual operating results, the most recent budget for the next financial year as approved by the Board, detailed strategic review projections and an assumed long-term growth rate to perpetuity, are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating unit.
The key assumptions on which the value in use calculations are based on relate to future business performance over the forecast period generally three years, projected long-term growth rates and the discount rates applied.
The forecast cash flows include managements latest estimates on sales volumes and pricing, production and other costs.
The key estimates applied in the impairment review are the forecast level of revenue, operating margins and the proportion of operating profit converted to cash in each year.
A long-term growth rate of 2.0% 2016: 2.0% has been consistently applied in the impairment review for all cash-generating units based on current forecast global industrial production growth rates, and long-term GDP growth rates for the Groups primary markets.
The cash flow projections have been discounted using cash-generating unit specific pre-tax discount rates of between 10.7% and 13.8% 2016: 10.8% and 17.8%.
These rates have been determined by taking into account the size of business and specific geographical and industry risk factors.
As a result of the annual impairment review, no goodwill impairment charge has been recognised within operating profit in the Consolidated Income Statement 2016: charge of 114.3m in respect of Omega and ESG Solutions ESG goodwill.
Sensitivity analysis The results of the Groups impairment tests are dependent upon estimates, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above.
Sensitivity analysis to potential changes in the key assumptions has been undertaken based on the following sensitivities in isolation: Key assumption change: a two percentage point pp increase in the pre-tax discount rate applied to each cash-generating unit: if the long-term growth rate assumption is reduced by 1.0pp to 1%: and if the cash flow projections for cash-generating units are reduced by 25% in each of the next two years.
For each cash-generating unit, the Directors do not consider that there are any reasonably possible sensitivities for the business that could arise in the next 12 months that could result in an impairment charge being recognised.

The Group has no internally-generated intangible assets from development expenditure in either 2017 or 2016 as the criteria for the recognition as an asset under IAS 38 Intangible Assets have not been met.
The trade names and technology assets recognised on the acquisition of Omega Engineering in 2011, and included within the Industrial Controls reportable segment, are considered significant by the Directors as they represent 42.5% 2016: 43.9% of total customer-related and trade names, and 19.6% 2016: 20.0% of total patents, contractual rights and technology, respectively.
The carrying amount of trade name intangible assets at 31 December 2017 is 50.3m 2016: 59.3m and is being amortised over 20 years with the remaining amortisation period being 13.8 years.

Provisions continued Reorganisation Reorganisation provisions relate to committed restructuring plans in place within the business.
Costs are expected to be incurred within one year and there is little judgement in determining the amount.
Product warranty Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business and included within the Group's standard terms and conditions.
Warranty commitments typically apply for a 12-month period, but can extend to 36 months.
These extended warranties are not significant.
Legal, contractual and other Legal, contractual and other provisions mainly comprise amounts provided against open legal and contractual disputes arising in the normal course of business.
The Company has on occasion been required to take legal or other actions to protect its intellectual property rights, to enforce commercial contracts or otherwise and similarly to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties.
Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent managements best estimate of the most likely outcome.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is frequently uncertain, reflecting the complexity of issues and the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations.
Contractual and other provisions represent the Directors' best estimate of the cost of settling current obligations although there is a higher degree of judgement involved.
The increase during the year relates to 5.1m of interest related to tax provisions which was transferred from current tax liabilities during the year see Note 9.
No provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties against Group companies unless management, taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is probable that such proceedings may be successful.
Contingent liabilities associated with such proceedings have been identified, but the Directors are of the opinion that any associated claims that might be brought can be defeated successfully and, therefore, the possibility of any material outflow in settlement is assessed as remote.
Retirement benefit plans Spectris plc operates funded defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for the Groups qualifying employees in the UK.
In addition, 14 overseas subsidiaries 2016: 14 in three overseas countries provide defined benefit plans.
Other UK and overseas subsidiaries have their own defined contribution plans invested in independent funds.
Defined benefit plans The UK, German, Dutch and Swiss plans provide pensions in retirement, death in service and in some cases disability benefits to members.
The pension benefit is linked to members final salary at retirement and their service life.
Since 31 December 2009, the UK plan has been closed to all service accruals.
The German and Dutch plans are closed to new members.
The UK plan is administered by a pension fund, but the Swiss and Dutch plans are held by insurance companies that are legally separate from the Group.
The majority of the overseas plan assets are insurance policies held in the Swiss plans, which are not matching in nature.
The UK plan is managed by a Board of Trustees that represents both employees and employer, who is required to act in the best interest of the plans participants and is responsible for setting certain policies e. g. investment, contribution and indexation policies of the various funds.
The plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
Inflation and interest rate hedges are taken out to mitigate against risks arising on the UK plan and some reinsurance exists in respect of the overseas plans.
The overseas plans are funded by the Groups overseas subsidiaries, and the UK plan has been funded in the past by both the Groups UK subsidiaries and the Company.
The assets of the UK plan are invested in accordance with Section 40 of the Pensions Act 1995.
Although the Act permits 5% of the plans assets to be invested in employer-related investments, the Trustees have elected that none of the plan assets are to be invested directly in Spectris plc shares.
The Trustees also hold interest rate and inflation swaps to help protect against the impact of changes in prevailing interest rates and price inflation, which in conjunction with the corporate bond portfolio aims to fully hedge against interest and inflation rate risks on the basis used by the Trustee to fund the plan.
Trustee investment in derivatives is only made in so far as they contribute to the reduction of investment risks or facilitate efficient portfolio management and are managed such as to avoid excessive risk exposure to a single counterparty or other derivative operations.
The funding requirements are based on the individual funds actuarial measurement framework set out in the funding policies of the various plans.
The Group has determined that, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the defined benefit plans, and in accordance with statutory requirements including minimum funding requirements of the plans of the respective jurisdictions, the present value of the refunds or reductions in future contributions is not lower than the balance of the total fair value of the plan assets less the total present value of obligations.
This determination has been made on a plan-by-plan basis.
As such, no decrease in the defined benefit asset was necessary at 31 December 2017.
The last full actuarial valuation for the UK plan was 31 December 2014 and for the overseas plans was 31 December 2017.
Where applicable, the valuations were updated to 31 December 2017 for IAS 19 Revised Employee Benefits purposes by qualified independent actuaries.

It is likely that the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries would qualify for the UK dividend exemption such that no UK tax would be due upon remitting these earnings to the UK.
However, 54.7m 2016: 68.2m of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of the dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
These tax liabilities are not expected to exceed 3.2m 2016: 3.3m, of which only 1.4m 2016: 1.3m has been provided for as the Group is able to control the timing of the dividends.
It is not expected that further amounts will crystallise in the foreseeable future.

The retained earnings reserve also includes own shares purchased by the Company and treated as treasury shares see Note 23.
The nature and purpose of other reserves forming part of equity are as follows: Translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation into Sterling of the Financial Statements of foreign subsidiaries, including gains or losses arising on net investment hedges.
Hedging reserve This reserve records the cumulative net change in the fair value of forward exchange contracts where they are designated as effective cash flow hedge relationships.
Merger reserve This reserve arose on the acquisition of Servomex in 1999, a purchase satisfied substantially by the issue of share capital and therefore eligible for merger relief under the provisions of Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.
Capital redemption reserve This reserve records the historical repurchase of the Company's own shares.
Treasury shares At 31 December 2017, the Group held 5,747,360 treasury shares 2016: 5,840,513.
During the year 93,153 2016: 58,395 of these shares were issued to satisfy options exercised by employees which were granted under the Groups share schemes.
No shares were repurchased by the Group during the year 2016: nil and no shares were cancelled during the year 2016: nil.
Share-based payments The Spectris Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE provides UK employees with options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company following a three-year vesting period.
Options may be exercised during a six-month period following the vesting date.
The exercise price is determined according to the mid-market closing share price prevailing on the day before the date of grant.
There are no performance criteria associated with options granted under SAYE.
Under the Performance Share Plan 'PSP' the exercise price is the nominal cost of the Companys shares.
From 2014, awards to Spectris plc Executive Directors have been subject to the following performance criteria: 33.33% of the award being based on fulfilment of an adjusted earnings per share growth target EPS, 33.33% of the award subject to a total shareholder return target TSR and 33.33% of the award being based on fulfilment of an economic profit 'EP' target.
Awards to other members of the Spectris plc Executive Committee were subject to the same performance criteria up to 2016.
For 2017 onwards, awards to the Executive Committee are subject to the following performance criteria: 33.33% of the award being based on fulfilment of EPS, 33.33% of the award being based on EP target and 33.33% of the award being subject to continued employment for the three-year vesting term.
Awards to other senior managers were until 2016 subject to EPS for 50% of the award and TSR for the remaining 50%.
From 2017, these awards to senior management are 66.67% subject to EPS and 33.33% subject to continued employment over the three-year vesting period.
Awards made to executives and senior managers of the Groups operating companies in 2008 2009 were subject to EPS in respect of 50% of the award and operating company profit targets in respect of 50% of the award.
Awards made between 2009 and 2013 were entirely subject to operating company profit targets.
In 2016, the performance criteria was EPS in respect of 33.33% of the award and operating company profit targets in respect of 66.67% of the award and for 2017 onwards, the performance criteria was operating company profit targets in respect of 66.67% of the award and continued employment within the Group during the three-year vesting period for 33.33% of the award.
All PSP awards vest after a period of three years and must be exercised during the seven-year period following vesting.
Since 2011, PSP options have also been granted to UK employees as tax-advantaged share options as defined by HMRC.
The performance criteria and vesting conditions are consistent with the PSP options granted described above.
The tax-advantaged share options are linked to the PSP share options in order to benefit from the tax-exempt status of the tax-advantaged share option grants to an aggregate value not exceeding 30,000.
Should there be a gain on exercise under the tax-advantaged options, such gain will cause a proportionate reduction in the number and value of the linked PSP options.
Should there be no gain on exercise under the tax-advantaged options, these options are then forfeited and the linked PSP options may be exercised in full, to the extent their performance criteria are met.
128 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 128 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 From 2014, awards were made under the Restricted Shares Plan 'RSP' to selected employees.
Awards vest three years from grant and are cash-settled on vesting.
The RSP is subject to the same rules as the PSP but gives flexibility as to whether or not awards are subject to performance criteria.
Awards under the RSP may be granted to an employee of the Group, but may not be granted to an Executive Director of Spectris plc.

Acquisitions On 6 February 2017, the Group acquired 99% of the share capital of Pixirad Imaging Counters S. r. l. Pixirad, a supplier based in Italy, for a total consideration of 2.8m.
The company develops and distributes high performance X-ray detectors.
The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired is represented by the following intangible assets: technology and goodwill of 1.1m and 1.7m, respectively.
The goodwill arising is attributable to the acquired workforce and synergies from leveraging the customer base to optimise the sales potential of Pixirad and Spectris products.
Goodwill includes an amount of 0.3m representing the requirement to recognise a net deferred tax liability on the fair value adjustments.
The business is being integrated into the Materials Analysis segment.
The remaining 1% of share capital was purchased on 24 July 2017.
On 15 May 2017, the Group acquired the trade and certain assets of Setpoint, a US business, for a total consideration of 8.0m.
This extends the Groups capabilities in the condition monitoring market.
The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired is represented by the following intangible assets: customer-related customer relations, technology and goodwill of 0.3m, 2.4m and 4.6m, respectively.
The goodwill arising is attributable to the acquired workforce, opportunities expected from the extension of the Groups product offerings leveraging its stronger position in vibration and condition monitoring solutions, and sharing capabilities and technologies in value-added solutions.
The business is being integrated into the In-line Instrumentation segment.
On 1 July 2017, the Group acquired the trade and certain assets of CSA Leyland, a UK business, for no consideration.
This extends the Groups capabilities in the automotive testing services market.
The excess of the fair value of net tangible assets acquired has resulted in a gain on purchase, as a consequence of buying the business in a troubled state, amounting to 1.9m and is disclosed in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The business is being integrated into the Test and Measurement segment.
On 2 October 2017, the Group acquired the shares of Omnicon Group Inc. a US company, for a total consideration of 23.8m including 1.4m deferred consideration.
This extends the Groups capabilities in engineering services to support the design of reliability electronic and software systems.
The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired is represented by the following intangible assets: customer-related customer relations, contractual rights, trade name and goodwill of 7.6m, 2.1m, 2.4m and 10.5m, respectively.
The goodwill arising is attributable to the acquired workforce and synergies from leveraging the customer base to optimise the sales potential of Omnicon and Spectris services.
The assets and liabilities acquired with the above acquisitions, together with the total purchase consideration, are summarised in the table below.
The revenue and operating profit contribution from the acquisitions in the year to the Groups results for the year were 6.6m and 3.5 m, respectively.
Group revenue and operating profit would have been 1,534.9m and 182.1m, respectively adjusted operating profit: 222.6m, had each of these acquisitions taken place on the first day of the financial year.
132 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 132 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The following fair value table is provisional, reflecting the timing of the acquisitions, and is expected to be finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date: 2017 Provisional Book value Adjustments fair value Net assets acquired under 2017 acquisitions Note m m m Intangible assets 12 0.1 15.8 15.9 Property, plant and equipment 13 3.1 3.1 Inventories 0.2 0.1 0.1 Trade and other receivables 1.9 1.9 Cash and cash equivalents 0.8 0.8 Trade and other payables 1.5 0.3 1.8 Deferred tax liabilities 21 0.3 0.3 Net assets acquired 4.6 15.1 19.7 Goodwill 12 16.8 Bargain purchase on acquisition 5 1.9 Total consideration in respect of 2017 acquisitions 34.6 Total consideration 34.6 Adjustment for cash acquired 0.8 Net consideration in respect of 2017 acquisitions 33.8 Analysis of cash outflow in Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows Total consideration in respect of 2017 acquisitions 34.6 Adjustment for net cash acquired on 2017 acquisitions 0.8 Deferred and contingent consideration on 2017 acquisitions to be paid in future years 1.4 Cash paid in 2017 in respect of 2017 acquisitions 32.4 Acquisitions prior to 2017 Deferred and contingent consideration in relation to prior years' acquisitions: Accrued at 31 December 2016 4.1 Cash paid in 2017 in respect of prior years' acquisitions 4.1 Net cash outflow relating to acquisitions 36.5 Where appropriate, a detailed exercise has been undertaken to assess the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, supported by the use of third-party experts.
The valuation of the above intangible and tangible assets requires the use of assumptions and estimates.
Intangible asset assumptions consist of future growth rates, expected inflation and attrition rates, discount rates used and useful economic lives.
The fair value of contingent consideration on the 2017 acquisitions amounts to 1.4m.
The contingent consideration payable on financial milestones could range from nil to 5.3m, dependent on incremental future revenues, and the total contingent consideration is sensitive to risk-adjusted discount rates.
Due to their contractual due dates, the fair value of receivables acquired approximates to the gross contractual amounts receivable.
The amount of gross contractual receivables not expected to be recovered is immaterial.

Assets and liabilities held for sale On 14 December 2017, the Group signed an agreement with Macquarie Corporate Holdings Pty Limited for them to acquire 50% of the Group's environmental monitoring business, EMS Brel & Kjr, for a total cash consideration of AUD$76.6m, subject to closing adjustments.
The sale is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018, subject to regulatory approvals in China, the European Union and South Korea.
The net proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce net debt, thereby increasing the Groups financial flexibility for future capital deployment.
As at 31 December 2017, assets and liabilities of this business are presented in the Group's Financial Statements as held for sale and are stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.
There was no gain or loss as a result of the classification as held for sale.
This business is part of the Test and Measurement segment.

Financial risk management The Groups multinational operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed.
Financial risk management policies are set by the Board of Directors.
These policies are implemented by a central treasury department that has formal procedures to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk, including, where appropriate, the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Group has clearly defined authority and approval limits.
The central treasury department operates as a service centre to the Group and not as a profit centre.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Such instruments are only used to manage the risks arising from operating or financial assets or liabilities or highly probable future transactions.
The quantitative analysis of financial risk is included in Note 28.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk arises both where sale or purchase transactions are undertaken in currencies other than the respective functional currencies of Group companies transactional exposures and where the results of overseas companies are consolidated into the Groups reporting currency of Sterling translational exposures.
The Group has operations around the world which record their results in a variety of different local functional currencies.
In countries where the Group does not have operations, it invariably has some customers or suppliers that transact in a foreign currency.
The Group is therefore exposed to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates between a number of different currencies but the Groups primary exposures relate to the US Dollar, Euro, Danish Krone, Swiss Franc and Japanese Yen.
Where appropriate, the Group manages its foreign currency exposures using derivative financial instruments.
The Group manages its transactional exposures to foreign currency risks through the use of forward exchange contracts.
Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge highly probable transactions which can be forecast to occur typically up to 18 months into the future.
The Groups translational exposures to foreign currency risks can relate both to the Consolidated Income Statement and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
The Groups policy is not to hedge the translational exposure that arises on consolidation of the Consolidated Income Statement of overseas subsidiaries.
The Group finances overseas company investments partly through the use of foreign currency borrowings in order to provide a natural hedge of foreign currency risk arising on translation of the Groups foreign currency subsidiaries.
The quantitative analysis of foreign currency risk is included in Note 28.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises both the interest rate price risk that results from borrowing at fixed rates of interest and also the interest cash flow risk that results from borrowing at variable rates.
Where appropriate, interest rate swaps are used to manage the Groups interest rate profile.
Spectris plc 135 Spectris plc 135 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts continued 27.
Financial risk management continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing this risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group manages this risk through the use of regularly updated cash flow and covenant compliance forecasts and a liquidity headroom analysis which is used to determine funding requirements.
Adequate committed lines of funding are maintained from high-quality investment grade lenders.
The facilities committed to the Group as at 31 December 2017 are set out in Note 17. Credit risk Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its obligations.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets such as cash balances, derivative financial instruments and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are net of appropriate allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on whether receivables are past due based on contractual terms, payment history and other available evidence of collectability.
Trade receivables are subject to credit limits and control and approval procedures in the operating companies.
Due to its large geographical base and number of customers, the Group is not exposed to material concentrations of credit risk on its trade receivables.
The quantitative analysis of credit risk relating to receivables is included in Note 15. Credit risk associated with cash balances and derivative financial instruments is managed centrally by transacting with existing relationship banks with strong investment grade ratings.
Accordingly, the Groups associated credit risk is limited.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, as shown in Note 28.
Capital management The Board considers equity shareholders funds, together with committed debt facilities, as capital for the purposes of funding the Groups operations.
Total managed capital at 31 December is: 2017 2016 m m Equity shareholders' funds 1,204.1 1,067.4 Committed debt facilities 593.7 628.1 1,797.8 1,695.5 Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.
The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain the future development of the business.
The Board of Directors monitors both the geographic spread of shareholders and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company.
This is carried out through a SAYE option scheme in the UK, as well as performance and restricted share plans.
Full details of these schemes are given in Note 24.
The main financial covenants in the Companys debt facilities are the ratio of net debt to adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and the ratio of finance charges to adjusted earnings before interest, tax, amortisation and impairment.
Covenant testing is completed twice a year based on the half-year and year-end Financial Statements.
At 31 December 2017, the Company had, and is expected to continue to have, significant headroom under these financial covenant ratios.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares in the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
Buy and sell decisions are made on a specific transaction basis by the Board.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is subject to externally-imposed capital requirements.
Financial instruments The following tables show the fair value measurement of financial instruments by level following the fair value hierarchy: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: inputs for assets and liabilities derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents including held for sale, receivables and payables approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of floating rate borrowings approximates to the carrying amount because interest rates are at floating rates where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
The fair value of fixed rate borrowings is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using appropriate yield curves, to the net present values.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined using discounted cash flow techniques based on readily available market data.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding as at 31 December 2017 is a net asset of 0.9m 2016: net liability 4.2m, of which 0.7m has been credited to the hedging reserve 2016: 3.4m charged and 0.2m credited to the Consolidated Income Statement 2016: 0.8m charged.
These contracts mature over periods typically not exceeding 18 months.
A summary of the movements in the hedging reserve during the year is presented below.
All of the cash flow hedges in 2017 and 2016 were deemed to be effective.

Financial instruments continued The fair value of deferred and contingent consideration is determined by considering the performance expectations of the acquired entity or the likelihood of non-financial integration milestones whilst applying the entity-specific discount rates.
The unobservable inputs are the projected forecast measures that are assessed on an annual basis.
Changes in the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration relating to updated projected forecast performance measures are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period that the change occurs.
Deferred and contingent consideration relates to financial 2017: 4.6m, 2016: 10.4m and non-financial 2017: 6.5m, 2016: 5.8m milestones on current and prior year acquisitions, as disclosed in Note 25.
The financial milestones are mainly sensitive to risk-adjusted discount rates and annual future revenue targets.

The following table shows the total outstanding contractual forward exchange contracts hedging designated transactional exposures split by currencies which have been sold back into the functional currency of the underlying business.

Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies The separate Financial Statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
As permitted by that Act, the separate Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
In accordance with the exemption provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own income statement or statement of comprehensive income.
a Basis of preparation These Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
The Companys shareholders were notified in 2015 of the use of the EU-adopted IFRS disclosure exemptions and there were no objections to the adoption of FRS 101.
In preparing these Financial Statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRSs, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
The Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: A Cash Flow Statement and related notes.
Comparative period reconciliations for share capital, tangible fixed assets and intangible assets.
Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries.
Disclosures in respect of capital management.
The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs.
Disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel.
As the Consolidated Financial Statements of Spectris plc pages 92 to 141 include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures: IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of Group-settled share-based payments.
Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures.
The Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
The principal accounting policies are set out below.
As permitted by s408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account or statement of comprehensive income for the year.
The profit attributable to the Company is disclosed in the footnote to the Company's balance sheet.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Financial Statements.
In the course of preparing these Financial Statements in accordance with the Companys accounting policies, no judgements that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements have been made, other than those involving estimation.
Management considers the following to be key areas of estimation for the Company due to greater complexity and or are particularly subject to uncertainty.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty Retirement benefit plans Accounting for retirement benefit plans under IAS 19 revised requires an assessment of the future benefits payable in accordance with actuarial assumptions.
The discount rate and rate of retail price inflation RPI assumptions applied in the calculation of plan liabilities, which are set out in Note 20, represent a key source of estimation uncertainty for the Company.
b Summary of significant accounting policies Intangible assets Intangible assets purchased by the Company are capitalised at their cost.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The estimated useful economic lives are as follows: Software 3 to 5 years.
144 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 144 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognised in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the estimated residual value which is reviewed annually, of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful economic life.
Depreciation commences on the date the assets are ready for use within the business and the asset carrying values are reviewed for impairment when there is an indication that they may be impaired.
Estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold property 25 years.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are stated at historical cost, less provision for any impairment in value.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are carried at original invoice amount which is considered a reasonable proxy for fair value and are subsequently held at amortised cost less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the transactions.
Cash and cash equivalents This comprises cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits held on call or with maturities of less than three months at inception.
Tax is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of prior years.
Deferred taxation is provided on taxable temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and their corresponding tax bases.
Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability settled based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised or that they will reverse.
Foreign currency translation The functional currency of the Company is Pounds Sterling and is determined with reference to the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions are translated at the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or the translation of monetary assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates, and are charged credited to the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments Recognition The Company recognises financial assets and liabilities on its balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Originated loans and debtors are initially recognised in accordance with the policy stated above and subsequently re-measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge risks associated with foreign exchange fluctuations.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Company documents Spectris plc 145 Spectris plc 145 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts continued 35.
Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies continued whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are reclassified to the Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the Income Statement, in the same line of the Income Statement as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Company revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Income Statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Derecognition A financial asset is derecognised when the Company loses control over the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Originated loans and debtors are derecognised on the date they are transferred by the Company.
Impairment of financial assets The Company assesses at each balance sheet reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset, or group of financial assets, is impaired.
A financial asset, or group of financial assets, is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset an incurred loss event and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Employee benefits The Company operates a defined benefit post-retirement benefit plan and a defined contribution pension plan.
Defined benefit plan The Companys net obligation recognised in the balance sheet in respect of its defined benefit plan is calculated as the present value of the plans liabilities less the fair value of the plans assets.
The operating and financing costs of the defined benefit plan are recognised separately in the Income Statement.
Operating costs comprise the current service cost, scheme administrative expense, any gains or losses on settlement or curtailments, and past service costs where benefits have vested.
Finance items comprise the unwinding of the discount on the net asset deficit.
Actuarial gains or losses comprising changes in plan liabilities due to experience and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The amount of any pension fund asset recognised in the balance sheet is limited to any future refunds from the plan or the present value of reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Defined contribution plan A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised in the Income Statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share-based payments Certain employees of the Company receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The fair value of share awards with market-related vesting conditions is determined by an external consultant and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet reporting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual outcome of awards which have vested.
Where it is not possible to incentivise managers of the Company with equity-settled options, they are issued with cash-settled options.
The charge for these awards is adjusted to reflect the expected and actual levels of options that vest and the fair value is based on either the share price at date of exercise or the share price at the balance sheet date if sooner.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries, it recognises an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in the subsidiarys Financial Statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
In cases where a subsidiary is recharged for the share-based payment expense, no such increase in investment is recognised which may result in a credit in a particular year.
146 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 146 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by shareholders.
Treasury shares Shares held in treasury are treated as a deduction from equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental costs and related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's equity shareholders.
