Details on the sensitivity of scheme liabilities to changes in assumptions are provided below: The impact of a 50 basis point reduction in discount rate would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2017 to increase by approximately 92.0m.
The impact of a 10 basis point increase in inflation and salary inflation rates would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2017 to increase by approximately 16.0m.
The impact of assuming every scheme member were to live for an additional year would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2017 to increase by approximately 28.0m.
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in a single assumption while keeping all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method of calculating the defined benefit obligation has been used as when calculating the retirement benefit obligations recognised on the balance sheet.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysisare consistent with the previous year.
No change has been considered necessary to sensitivity levels, given recent past experience.
The weighted average duration of the UK scheme defined benefit obligation is 19.7 years.
