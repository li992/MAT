For the year we had healthy Group interest cover of 6.2 times 2016: 6.0 times based on free cash flow pre working capital movements against interest paid.
Our financing policy is to fund our current needs through a mix of debt, equity and cash flow to allow us to selectively build out our development pipeline and achieve our strategic growth objectives, which we believe improves returns for shareholders.
We aim to ensure that there are sufficient medium-term facilities in place to finance our committed development programme, secured against the freehold portfolio, with debt serviced by our strong operational cash flows.
Treasury continues to be closely monitored and its policy approved by the Board.
We maintain a keen watch on medium and long-term rates and the Groups policy in respect of interest rates is to maintain a balance between flexibility and hedging of interest rate risk.
