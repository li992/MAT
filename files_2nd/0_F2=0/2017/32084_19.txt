Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 April 2017 continued 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED p Key Estimates and Assumptions Estimates and assumptions used in preparing the Financial Statements are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The results of these estimates and assumptions form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The only estimates and assumptions that may cause material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities relate to the valuation of unquoted investments and investments for which there is an inactive market.
These are valued in accordance with the techniques set out in note 1 f. At the year end, such investments represent 0.1% of net assets.
