152 FINANCIALS Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2017 3 Non-statutory profit measures Headline profit measures The Company seeks to present a measure of trading performance which is not impacted by material non-recurring items or items considered non-operational in nature.
This measure is described as headline and used by management to measure and monitor performance.
See the disclosures on presentation of results in accounting policies for an explanation of the excluded items, which are referred to as non-headline.
Headline revenue The agreement to sell Smiths Medicals Wallace product line included an obligation to continue manufacturing products for the acquirer for 12 months after the date of disposal.
In the Interim results to 31 January 2017, revenue arising from this activity was treated as non-headline because it was not expected to contribute to Smiths Medicals ongoing business.
This treatment was reviewed in response to developments in the commercial relationship with CooperSurgical, Inc. and the activity is now being reported within headline activity.
Headline operating profit The non-headline items included in statutory operating profit are as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2017 31 July 2016 Notes m m Restructuring programmes 37 37 Acquisition costs 19 6 Provision for Titeflex Corporation subrogation claims 22 4 11 Provision for John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation 22 15 23 Cost recovery for John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation 6 16 Post-retirement benefits changes to schemes and administration costs 8 9 16 Impairment of goodwill, property, plant and equipment and trade investments 31 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 10 17 15 Unwind of fair value uplift of inventory on the acquisition balance sheet 3 Profit on disposal of businesses 28 175 Non-headline items in operating profit 85 123 Items for the year ended 31 July 2017 Restructuring costs include 33m in respect of Fuel for Growth.
This programme, which involves redundancy, relocation and consolidation of manufacturing, is considered a material non-recurring item by virtue of its size.
No further costs are expected in respect of this program.
In addition, there are 4m of initial costs in respect of the integration of Morpho Detection and the existing Smiths Detection business.
The integration is expected to take two years.
The total costs over the two years are projected to be material and non-recurring.
Acquisition costs have been treated as non-headline because they depend on the level of acquisition activity in the year.
Only incremental costs directly linked to the transaction are reported as non-headline.
They do not include the costs of the employees working on transactions.
See note 22 for details of the costs, and cost recoveries relating to Titeflex Corporation subrogation claims and John Crane, Inc asbestos litigation.
These costs and recoveries have been treated as non-headline because the provision were treated as non-headline when they were originally recognised and the subrogation claims and litigation relate to products that the Group no longer sells in these markets.
Post-retirement benefit changes and costs relate to closed schemes, so the costs are a legacy of previous employee pension arrangements.
The impacts of business combination fair value adjustments, including amortisation of intangible assets, impairment or unwinding, have been excluded from headline measures on the basis that these charges result from acquisition accounting and do not relate to current trading activity.
See note 28 for a breakdown of the profit by transaction.
It is non-headline since the profit and cash impact is material and non-recurring.
Items for the year ended 31 July 2016 Restructuring costs comprise 37m in respect of Fuel for Growth.
The 9m charge relating to post-retirement benefits comprises the 10m settlement cost for the buy-out of retiree liabilities completed by the US pension scheme on 14 August 2015, net of a 1m settlement gain on closing a small scheme in Holland.
Impairments comprise 23m goodwill write-downs see note 11, 6m on property plant and equipment and 2m on trade investments.

The fair value gain realised on contributing government bonds to Smiths Industries Pension Scheme was excluded from headline finance costs because it was a large, one-off item relating to funding previous employee pension arrangements.
Other financing gains and losses represent the potentially volatile gains and losses on derivatives, loans inside the group and other financial instruments which are not hedge accounted under IAS 39.
They have been excluded from headline finance costs because they do not accurately reflect the aggregate risks of the group, since offsetting gains have been recognised in reserves or deferred in assets and liabilities which are not held at fair value.
Financing credits relating to retirement benefits are excluded from headline finance costs because the ongoing costs and credits are a legacy of previous employee pension arrangements.

For the year ended 31 July 2017, zero options 2016: 223,993 were excluded from this calculation because their effect was anti-dilutive for continuing operations.

This note only provides information about corporate income taxes under IFRS.
Smiths companies operate in over 50 countries across the world.
They pay and collect many different taxes in addition to corporate income taxes including: payroll taxes: value added and sales taxes: property taxes: product-specific taxes and environmental taxes.
The costs associated with these other taxes are included in profit before tax.

The difference is reconciled as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2017 31 July 2016 m m Profit before taxation 602 346 Notional taxation expense at UK rate of 19.7% 2016: 20.0% 118 69 Different tax rates on non-UK profits and losses 55 24 Non-deductible expenses 14 16 Tax credits and non-taxable income 15 11 Non-headline recognition of UK deferred tax 69 Other adjustments to unrecognised deferred tax 23 2 Current and deferred benefits from closed financing arrangement 19 15 Effect of non-taxable profits on business disposals 35 Prior year true-up 3 Tax on discontinued activities 3 26 85 Comprising taxation on headline profit 140 113 tax on non-headline loss 27 34 change in deferred tax recognition treated as non-headline 84 6 taxation on discontinued operation 3 Taxation expense in the consolidated income statement 26 85 The head office of Smiths Group is domiciled in the UK, so the tax charge has been reconciled to UK tax rates.
In recent years, Smiths has made substantial payments to its UK defined benefit pension plans, which generated significant UK tax losses.
This resulted in the non-recognition of deferred tax on UK losses and other temporary differences.
The current position of the UK pension schemes has significantly improved and the pension contributions envisaged going forwards are significantly reduced.
Reduced pension contributions and increased trading and investing profits have made the UK tax group structurally profitable, resulting in the recognition of all UK deferred tax assets and generating a non-headline credit of 69m in the current year.
Included in other adjustments to unrecognised deferred tax is recognition of 17m deferred tax following the reorganisation of a US business.
As a result of changes in tax legislation and the reorganisation of finance activities, the credit for closed financing arrangements will not be repeated in future years.

Management judgement is used to determine the amount of such provisions based on an understanding of the relevant local tax law, taking into account the differences of interpretation that can arise on a wide variety of issues, depending on the prevailing circumstances, including the nature of current tax audits and the experience of previous enquiries.

In 2012 UK deferred tax was written off as a deteriorating position in legacy pension plans made UK activities structurally loss making.
As a result of an improvement in the UK pension position and restructuring financing activities, the UK is now expected to earn taxable profits and a 69m deferred tax asset has been recognised as a non-headline gain in the period.
The closing deferred tax balance related to UK activities at 31 July 2017, including the benefit of losses brought forward and deferred tax liabilities on UK pension schemes, amounted to 64m.
Deferred tax relating to provisions includes 79m 2016: 84m relating to the John Crane, Inc. litigation provision, and 33m 2016: 36m relating to Titeflex Corporation.
See note 22 for additional information on provisions: and Included in other deferred tax balances above is a deferred tax asset of 14m 2016: 25m relating to inventory where current tax relief is only available when the inventory is sold.
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax relating to deductible temporary differences in the UK amounting to nil 2016: 402m and non-UK losses amounting to 68m 2016: 93m.
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the law of the various territories in which the losses arise.

The court cases and appeals are nearing the end and some claimants, with different fact patterns, have received payments.
Smiths claims amount to around 30m after deducting 45% withholding tax.
However, there are further relevant legal actions that could impact the claims.
The benefit of this claim has not been recognised in the current or previous financial statements due to the uncertainty of the eventual outcome.

For all schemes, pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
These valuations have been updated by independent qualified actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 July 2017.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values.
Contributions to the schemes are made on the advice of the actuaries, in accordance with local funding requirements.

Scheme trustees need to obtain regular actuarial valuations to assess the scheme against this funding objective.
The trustees and sponsoring companies need to agree funding plans to improve the position of a scheme, when it is below the acceptable funding level.
The UK Pensions Regulator has extensive powers to protect the benefits of members, promote good administration and reduce the risk of situations arising which may require compensation to be paid from the Pension Protection Fund.
These powers include imposing a schedule of contributions or the calculation of the technical provisions, where a trustee and company fail to agree appropriate calculations.
Smiths Industries Pension Scheme SIPS This scheme was closed to future accrual effective 1 November 2009.
SIPS provides index-linked pension benefits based on final earnings at date of closure.
SIPS is governed by a corporate trustee SI Trustee Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Smiths Group plc.
The board of trustee directors comprises five company-nominated trustees and four member-nominated trustees, with an independent chairman selected by Smiths Group plc.
Trustee Directors are responsible for the management, administration, funding and investment strategy of the scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuation of this scheme has been performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 31 March 2015, and experience gains and losses identified during this valuation have been incorporated into the IAS 19 valuation.
Under the funding plan for SIPS agreed in November 2015 Smiths pays cash contributions of 2m a month until June 2020.
As part of this agreement, Smiths contributed the index-linked gilts previously held in an escrow account.
Under the governing documentation of the SIPS, any future surplus would be returnable to Smiths Group plc by refund, assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the scheme.
SIPS will implement Guaranteed Minimum Pensions equalisation in respect of members contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pensions Scheme prior to 6 April 1997, once the government has completed its consultations and confirmed an approach.
It is not yet possible to reliably quantify the impact of this adjustment.
The duration of the SIPS liabilities is around 23 years 2016: 23 years for active deferred members, 22 years 2016: 24 years for deferred members and 11 years 2016: 12 years for pensioners and dependants.

TIGPS provides index-linked pension benefits based on final earnings at the date of closure.
TIGPS is governed by a corporate trustee TI Pension Trustee Limited, an independent company.
The board of trustee directors comprises five company-nominated trustees and four member-nominated trustees, with an independent trustee director selected by the Trustee.
The Trustee is responsible for the management, administration, funding and investment strategy of the scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuation of this scheme has been performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 5 April 2015.
Under the funding plan for TIGPS agreed in March 2016 Smiths pays cash contributions of 3m a year until April 2018.
Under the governing documentation of the TIGPS, any future surplus would be returnable to Smiths Group plc by refund, assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the scheme.
TIGPS will implement Guaranteed Minimum Pensions equalisation in respect of members contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pensions Scheme prior to 6 April 1997, once the government has completed its consultations and confirmed an approach.
The duration of the TIGPS liabilities is around 24 years 2016: 25 years for active deferred members, 22 years 2016: 24 years for deferred members and 11 years 2016: 11 years for pensioners and dependants.
US pension plans The most recent valuations of the principal US pension and post-retirement healthcare plans were performed at 1 January 2017.
The pension plans were closed with effect from 30 April 2009 and benefits were calculated as at that date and are not revalued.
Governance of the US pension plans is managed by a Settlor Committee appointed by Smiths Group Services Corp, a wholly owned subsidiary.
The duration of the liabilities for the largest US plan is around 19 years 2016: 20 years for active deferred members, 19 years 2016: 20 years for deferred members and 12 years 2016: 12 years for pensioners and dependants.
Last year the US funded plans completed a buy-out of retiree liabilities for $527m, transferring the obligation to pay pensions to Voya Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company.
A settlement loss of 10m was recognised on this transaction see note 3.
Risk management The pensions schemes are exposed to risks that: investment returns are below expectations, leaving the scheme with insufficient assets in future to pay all its pension obligations: members and dependants live longer than expected, increasing the value of the pensions the scheme has to pay: inflation rates are higher than expected, so amounts payable under index-linked pensions are higher than expected: and increased contributions may be required to meet regulatory funding targets if lower interest rates increase the current value of liabilities.
These risks are managed separately for each pension scheme.
However Smiths has adopted a common approach of closing defined benefit schemes to cap members entitlements and supporting trustees in adopting investment strategies which match assets to future obligations, after allowing for the funding position of the scheme.
TI Group Pension Scheme TIGPS TIGPS with a mature member profile, and a strong funding position, has been able to progress its matching strategy to the point where roughly 50% of liabilities are covered by matching annuities, eliminating investment return, longevity, inflation and funding risks.
Smiths Industries Pension Scheme SIPS In August 2014 SIPS adjusted the scheme investment strategy.
The scheme has investments in diversified growth funds and a portfolio of exchange traded equity index futures managed by BlackRock.
The risk and return characteristics of equity index futures are similar to physical equities, but provide the scheme with improved liquidity.
As at 31 July 2017 the SIPS portfolio of exchange traded equity index futures generated a 73m 2016: 163m exposure to equities.
Following the company contribution of 152m UK government bonds to SIPS in December 2015 and the resulting improvement in the funding position, the trustees have adopted a leveraged liability matching strategy.
The scheme uses repurchase arrangements, total return swaps, inflation swaps and interest rate swaps to hedge the interest and inflation risks of the scheme liabilities.
Repurchase agreements exchange government bonds held by the scheme for cash with an obligation to buy back the asset at a fixed future date and price.
The cash is invested in liability matching assets, reducing funding risk.
A total return swap exchanges the return on a specified asset for example an index-linked bond and an interest payment fixed or floating.
Contracts are spread across a panel of banks.
To minimise the risk that counterparties fail to settle obligations, positions are collateralised.
For repurchase agreements, collateral is the difference between the present value of the repurchase obligation and the value of the asset exchanged.
For swaps, collateral is based on market values.
At 31 July 2017 scheme assets were net of 773m 2016: 720m repurchase obligations, and nominal exposure from interest rate swaps of 340m 2016: 293m, inflation swaps of 293m 2016: 263m and total return swaps of 14m 2016: 14m.

The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
For countries outside the UK and USA assumptions are disclosed as a weighted average.
Discount rate assumptions The UK schemes use a discount rate based on the yield on the iBOXX over 15-year AA-rated corporate bond index, adjusted if necessary to better reflect the shape of the yield curve considering the Aon Hewitt GBP Select AA curve.
For the USA, the discount rate is based on the Towers Watson cash-flow matching models and set with reference to Moodys Aa annualised yield, the Citigroup High Grade Index and the Merrill Lynch 15 years High Quality Index.
Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions used in the principal UK schemes are based on the new SAPS S2 All Birth year tables with relevant scaling factors based on the recent experience of the schemes.
The assumption allows for future improvements in life expectancy in line with the 2016 CMI projections, blended to a long-term rate of 1.25%.
The mortality assumptions used in the principal US schemes are based on the RP-2014 table adjusted backward to 2006 with MP-2014 and projected forward using MP-2016 as of 31 July 2017.
The table selected allows for future mortality improvements and applies an adjustment for job classification blue collar versus white collar.

The value of the scheme assets is affected by changes in mortality rates, inflation and discounting because they affect the carrying value of the insurance assets.
Asset valuation Liquidity funds, equities and bonds are valued using quoted market prices in active markets.
Exchange traded equity index futures are valued at market prices.
Total return, interest and inflation swaps are bilateral agreements between counterparties and do not have observable market prices.
These derivative contracts are valued using observable market inputs.
Insured liabilities comprise annuity policies matching the scheme obligation to identified groups of pensioners.
These assets are valued at the actuarial valuation of the corresponding liability, reflecting this matching relationship.
Property is valued by specialists applying recognised property valuation methods incorporating current market data on rental yields and transaction prices.

164 FINANCIALS Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2017 9 Employee share schemes The Group operates share schemes and plans for the benefit of employees.
The nature of the principal schemes and plans, including general conditions, is set out below: Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP is a share plan under which an award over a capped number of shares will vest after the end of the three-year performance period if performance conditions are met.
LTIP awards are made to selected senior executives, including the executive directors.
Awards made prior to 2016 were made with different targets for corporate executives and divisional executives.
Since 2016 all LTIP awards have had one set of targets.
LTIP performance conditions Each performance condition has a threshold below which no shares vest and a maximum performance target at or above which the award vests in full.
For performance between threshold and maximum, awards vest on a straight-line sliding scale.
The performance conditions are assessed separately, so performance on one condition does not affect the vesting of the other elements of the award.
To the extent that the performance targets are not met over the three-year performance period, awards will lapse.
There is no re-testing of the performance conditions.
Group LTIP awards have performance conditions relating to underlying revenue growth, growth in headline EPS adjusted to exclude tax, ROCE, cash conversion and, for awards made before 2015, TSR relative to the FTSE 100 excluding financial services companies.
Divisional LTIP awards have performance conditions relating to divisional performance against headline KPIs, including underlying revenue and operating profit growth, operating margins, ROCE, operating cash conversion, employee engagement and quality metrics.
Smiths Group Co-Investment Plan CIP and Smiths Share Matching Plan SMP In 2015 the CIP was replaced by the SMP.
Under the CIP and SMP participants are required to invest between 25% and 50% of their post-tax bonus purchasing the Companys shares at the prevailing market price.
At the end of a three-year period, if the executive is still in office and provided the performance test is passed, matching shares will be awarded in respect of any invested shares retained for that period.
The number of matching shares to be awarded is determined by the Remuneration Committee at the end of the year in which the bonus is earned by reference to annual bonus, and other corporate financial criteria.
The maximum award will not exceed the value, before tax, of the bonus or salary invested in shares by the executive.
For the CIP, vesting of matching shares will occur, and the matching shares will be released, at the end of the three-year period if the Groups Return on Capital Employed ROCE over the performance period exceeds the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC over the performance period by an average margin of at least 1% per annum.
If ROCE exceeds WACC by an average margin of 3% per annum, the enhanced performance condition is met, and a second matching share will be issued for every purchased share.
For the SMP, vesting of matching shares will occur, and the matching shares will be released, at the end of the three-year period depending on the performance of the Group LTIP issued for the same performance period.
The first matching share is awarded if the Group LTIP vests under any performance condition.
No future awards will be made under the CIP or SMP.
Smiths Excellence Plan SEP In September 2016 the Smiths Excellence plan SEP was introduced.
The SEP is designed to reinforce value creation over the medium term by focusing on specific objectives in key areas of operational performance.
Awards vest after two years, depending on performance on the operational objectives during the first year and continued employment with the Group.
There is no retesting of performance.
However the Remuneration Committee has discretion to adjust vesting rates if material misstatements in reported performance are subsequently identified and awards are subject to clawback provisions in the event of mis-conduct.
Directors are not eligible to participate in the SEP.
Restricted stock The restricted stock is used by the Remuneration Committee, as a part of the recruitment strategy, to make awards in recognition of incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
If an award is considered appropriate, the award will take account of relevant factors including the fair value of awards forfeited, any performance conditions attached, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
The average closing share price over the financial year was 1,499.95p 2016: 1,049.61p.
There has been no change to the effective option price of any of the outstanding options during the period.

The key assumptions used in the models for 2017 and 2016 are volatility of 20% to 25% 2016: 25% to 30% and dividend yield of 3.50% 2016: 3.75%, based on historical data, for the period corresponding with the vesting period of the option.

Value in use or fair value less cost to sell calculations are used to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill held allocated to each group of cash generating units CGU.
Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted cash-flows of the CGU.
These forecast cash-flows are based on the 2018 budget, the five-year strategic plan approved by the Board and detailed divisional strategic projections, where these have been prepared and approved by the Board.
Fair value less cost to sell is calculated using available information on past and expected future profitability, valuation multiples for comparable quoted companies and similar transactions adjusted as required for significant differences and information on costs of similar transactions.
Fair value less costs to sell models are used when trading projections in the strategic plan cannot be adjusted to eliminate the impact of a major restructuring.
Goodwill is allocated by division as follows: 2017 2016 2017 Number of 2016 Number of m CGUs m CGUs John Crane 111 1 108 3 Smiths Medical 561 1 591 1 Smiths Detection 629 2 410 1 Smiths Interconnect 242 2 381 5 Flex-Tek 27 2 27 2 1,570 8 1,517 12 Following the disposal of the John Crane Artificial Lift business see note 28 and a restructuring to integrate China into the global John Crane management structure, John Crane is now a single CGU.
Impairment testing has been completed on this basis for 2017.
Morpho Detection was acquired in April 2017 see note 26.
At 31 July 2017 a single management team was in place covering Continuing Smiths Detection and Morpho Detection.
However, the integration of the two businesses was not sufficiently advanced to support treating them as a single CGU for impairment testing.
Based on the current integration plan, it is anticipated that there will be a single CGU in 2018.
Following the disposal of Smiths Interconnect Power and Smiths Interconnect Microwave Telecoms see note 28 and the integration of Smiths Interconnect Connectors and Smiths Interconnect Microwave Components, Smiths Interconnect now has two CGUs, Smiths Interconnect Connectors and Components and Smiths Interconnect Microwave Subsystems.
167 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2017 N O TE S T O TH E A C C O U NTS C O NTI N U E D 11 Impairment testing continued Goodwill continued Impairment testing assumptions John Crane and Smiths Medical have strong aftermarket and consumables businesses, with consistent sales trends.
Smiths Detection and Smiths Interconnect have greater sales and margin volatility due to lower levels of recurring revenue and involvement in government-funded programmes, particularly defence, and customer-led technology innovation.
The key assumptions used in value in use calculations are: Sales: projected sales are built up with reference to markets and product categories.
They incorporate past performance, historical growth rates and projections of developments in key markets.
Margins: projected margins reflect historical performance and the impact of all completed projects to improve operational efficiency and leverage scale.
The projections do not include the impact of future restructuring projects to which the Group is not yet committed.
Discount rate: the discount rates have been calculated based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital and risks specific to the CGU being tested.
The discount rates disclosed incorporate risk adjustments where the projected sales and margins are affected by significant delivery risks.
Pre-tax rates of 12.2% to 16.9% 2016: 11.0% to 14.3% have been used for the impairment testing.
Long-term growth rates: as required by IAS 36, growth rates for the period after the detailed forecasts are based on the long-term GDP projections of the primary market for the CGU.
The average growth rate used in the testing was 2.1% 2016: 2.2%.
These rates do not reflect the long-term assumptions used by the Group for investment planning.
The assumptions used in the impairment testing of significant CGUs are as follows: Year ended 31 July 2017 John Crane Smiths Medical Smiths Detection Smiths Interconnect Original Smiths Morpho Microwave Connectors and Detection Detection Subsystems Components Net book value of goodwill m 111 561 429 200 75 167 Fair value less Basis of valuation Value in use Value in use Value in use costs to sell Value in use Value in use Discount rate 14.9% 12.2% 14.1% n a 12.2% 16.9% Period covered by management projections 5 years 5 years 5 years 1 year 5 years 5 years Long-term growth rates 2.2% 2.1% 2.0% n a 2.2% 2.1% The discount rate for Smiths Interconnect Connectors and Components includes a risk adjustment.

Sensitivity analysis Morpho Detection explosive detection business Morpho Detections fair value less costs to sell exceeds its carrying value by 38m.
Fair value was calculated using a level 3 valuation model.
Sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that for Morpho Detection, the following changes in assumptions in isolation, would cause the fair value less costs to sell to fall below the carrying value.
The business was acquired in the year, so there are no comparatives.
Year ended 31 July 2017 Change required to trigger impairment Forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 8% reduction in EBITDA Valuation multiple 0.9 reduction in multiple Forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation have been projected using: expected future sales, based on orders, projected sales under framework agreements, sales opportunities and current contract win rates: current cost structure and production capacity: and adjustments to profit which a market participant would normally make in assessing a business of this nature, including market participant synergies.
The valuation multiple has been estimated using current share prices for similar listed companies, multiples paid in recent transactions and advice on current market pricing.
168 FINANCIALS Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2017 Other CGUs For the other CGUs, sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that no reasonable changes in key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of any of the CGUs to exceed their respective recoverable amounts.
Goodwill impairment No impairment charges have been incurred 2016: 23m.
In 2016 the following goodwill impairments were recognised: 5m for John Crane Production Solutions, 7m for Smiths Interconnect Microwave Components and 11m for Smiths Interconnect Microwave Telecoms.
All three of these businesses were sold in the current year, see note 28.
Other intangible assets The Group has no indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill.
During the year impairment tests were carried out for development projects which have not yet started to be amortised and acquired intangibles where there were indications of impairment.
Value in use calculations were used to determine the recoverable values of these assets.
No impairment charges have been incurred 2016: nil.
Property, plant and equipment Impairment charges of 5m for John Crane Production Solutions, principally relating to property, and 1m for sites affected by the Fuel for Growth restructuring were recognised in 2016.

Trade receivables do not carry interest.
Management considers that the carrying value of trade and other receivables approximates to the fair value.
Trade and other receivables, including prepayments, accrued income and other receivables qualifying as financial instruments are classified as loans and receivables.

Trade receivables are disclosed net of provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
The provisions for bad and doubtful debts are based on specific risk assessment and reference to past default experience.
Credit risk is managed separately for each customer and, where appropriate, a credit limit is set for the customer based on previous experience of the customer and third party credit ratings.

Treasury and risk management policies are set by the Board.
The policy sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of financial instruments to manage risk.
The instruments and techniques used to manage exposures include foreign currency derivatives, debt and other interest rate derivatives.
The central treasury function monitors financial risks and compliance with risk management policies.
The management of operational credit risk is discussed in note 14. a Foreign exchange risk Transactional currency exposure The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional currency.
It is Group policy that, when the net foreign exchange exposure to known future sales and purchases is material, this exposure is hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The net exposure is calculated by adjusting the expected cash-flow for payments or receipts in the same currency linked to the sale or purchase.
This policy minimises the risk that the profits generated from the transaction will be affected by foreign exchange movements which occur after the price has been determined.
Hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing are only undertaken if it is cost effective.

Cash-flow hedging The Group uses foreign currency contracts to hedge future foreign currency sales and purchases.
At 31 July 2017 contracts with a nominal value of 407m 2016: 393m were designated as hedging instruments.
In addition, the Group had outstanding foreign currency contracts with a nominal value of 243m 2016: 529m which were being used to manage transactional foreign exchange exposures, but were not accounted for as cash-flow hedges.
The fair value of the contracts is disclosed in note 19.
The majority of hedged transactions will be recognised in the consolidated income statement in the same period that the cash flows are expected to occur, with the only differences arising because of normal commercial credit terms on sales and purchases.
Of the foreign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments 86% are for periods of 12 months or less 2016: 91%.
The movements in the cash-flow hedge reserve during the period are summarised in the table below: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2017 31 July 2016 m m Brought forward cash-flow hedge reserve at start of year 7 3 Gains losses on effective cash-flow hedges recognised in equity 3 10 Amounts removed from the hedge reserve and recognised in the following lines on the income statement revenue 9 1 cost of sales 4 1 Carried forward cash-flow hedge reserve at end of year 1 7 173 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2017 N O TE S T O TH E A C C O U NTS C O NTI N U E D 18 Financial risk management continued a Foreign exchange risk continued Translational currency exposure The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in the United States and Europe.
As a result, the sterling value of the Groups balance sheet can be significantly affected by movements in exchange rates.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of these translational currency exposures by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies, except where significant adverse interest differentials or other factors would render the cost of such hedging activity uneconomic.
This is achieved by borrowing primarily in the relevant currency or in some cases indirectly using forward foreign exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps.

The cross-currency swap contracts are non-current.
Swaps generating 327m of the US dollar exposure 2016: 358m will mature in April 2023 and swaps generating 241m of the US dollar exposure 2016: nil will mature in February 2027.

Based on the hedging instruments in place at the year-end, if the specified currencies were to strengthen 10% while all other market rates remained constant, it would have the following effect: Loss Loss recognised recognised in hedge in hedge reserve reserve 31 July 2017 31 July 2016 m m US dollar 132 98 Euro 53 35 These movements would be fully offset by an opposite movement on the retranslation of the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries.
These sensitivities were calculated before adjusting for tax.
174 FINANCIALS Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2017 b Interest rate risk The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
The Groups current policy is to require interest rates to be fixed for greater than 70% of the level of gross debt.
This is achieved through fixed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps.
At 31 July 2017 57% 2016: 59% of the Groups gross borrowings were at fixed interest rates, after adjusting for interest rate swaps and the impact of short maturity derivatives designated as net investment hedges.
The Group monitors its fixed rate risk profile against both gross and net debt.
For medium-term planning, it now focuses on gross debt to eliminate the fluctuations of variable cash levels over the cycle.
The weighted average interest rate on borrowings and cross-currency swaps at 31 July 2017, after interest rate swaps, is 3.52% 2016: 3.68%.
Interest rate profile of financial assets and liabilities and the fair value of borrowings The following table shows the interest rate risk exposure of investments, cash and borrowings, with the borrowings adjusted for the impact of interest rate hedging.

At 31 July 2017 the Group has designated the following hedge against variability in the fair value of borrowings arising from fluctuations in base rates and exchange rates: the fixed floating and exchange exposure of 300m of US$ interest rate swaps which mature on 23 February 2027 partially hedging the 2027 Eurobond.
The fair values of the hedging instruments are disclosed in note 19.
The effect of the swaps is to convert 741m 2016: 552m debt from fixed rate to floating rate.
Sensitivity of interest charges to interest rate movements The Group has exposure to sterling, US dollar and euro interest rates.
However the Group does not have a significant exposure to interest rate movements for any individual currency.
Based on the composition of net debt and investments at 31 July 2017, and taking into consideration all fixed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps in place, a one percentage point 100 basis points change in average floating interest rates for all three currencies would have less than 1m impact 2016: impact of 2m on the Groups profit before tax.

Credit risk is mitigated by the Board-approved policy of only placing cash deposits with highly rated relationship bank counterparties within counterparty limits established by reference to their Standard & Poors long-term debt rating.
In the normal course of business, the Group operates cash pooling systems, where a legal right of set-off applies.

Netting International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA master netting agreements are in place with derivative counterparties except for contracts traded on a dedicated international electronic trading platform used for operational foreign exchange hedging.
Under these agreements if a credit event occurs, all outstanding transactions under the ISDA are terminated and only a single net amount per counterparty is payable in settlement of all transactions.
The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting, since the offsetting is enforceable only if specific events occur in the future, and there is no intention to settle the contracts on a net basis.

Trading Warranty provision and product liability At 31 July 2017 there are warranty and product liability provisions of 28m 2016: 29m.
Warranties over the Groups products typically cover periods of between one and three years.
Provision is made for the likely cost of after-sales support based on the recent past experience of individual businesses.
Commercial disputes and litigation in respect of ongoing business activities The Group has on occasion been required to take legal action to protect its intellectual property and other rights against infringement.
It has also had to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties, including product liability and insurance subrogation claims.
Provision is made for any expected costs and liabilities in relation to these proceedings where appropriate, though there can be no guarantee that such provisions which may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time will accurately predict the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred.
Contingent liabilities In the ordinary course of its business, the Group is subject to commercial disputes and litigation such as government price audits, product liability claims, employee disputes and other kinds of lawsuits, and faces different types of legal issues in different jurisdictions.
The high level of activity in the US, for example, exposes the Group to the likelihood of various types of litigation commonplace in that country, such as mass tort and class action litigation, legal challenges to the scope and validity of patents, and product liability and insurance subrogation claims.
These types of proceedings or the threat of them are also used to create pressure to encourage negotiated settlement of disputes.
Any claim brought against the Group with or without merit, could be costly to defend.
These matters are inherently difficult to quantify.
In appropriate cases a provision is recognised based on best estimates and management judgement but there can be no guarantee that these provisions which may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred.
There are also contingent liabilities in respect of litigation for which no provisions are made.
The Group operates in some markets where the risk of unethical or corrupt behaviour is material and has procedures, including an employee Ethics Alertline, to help it identify potential issues.
Such procedures will, from time to time, give rise to internal investigations, sometimes conducted with external support, to ensure that Smiths Group properly understands risks and concerns and can take steps both to manage immediate issues and to improve its practices and procedures for the future.
The Group also co-operates with relevant authorities in investigating business conduct issues whenever requested to.
The Group is not aware of any issues which are expected to generate material financial exposures.
Non-headline and legacy John Crane, Inc. John Crane, Inc. JCI is one of many co-defendants in numerous lawsuits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are claiming damages arising from alleged exposure to, or use of, products previously manufactured which contained asbestos.
Until 2006, the awards, the related interest and all material defence costs were met directly by insurers.
In 2007, JCI secured the commutation of certain insurance policies in respect of product liability.
Provision is made in respect of the expected costs of defending known and predicted future claims and of adverse judgments in relation thereto, to the extent that such costs can be reliably estimated.
The JCI products generally referred to in these cases consist of industrial sealing product, primarily packing and gaskets.
The asbestos was encapsulated within these products in such a manner that causes JCI to believe, based on tests conducted on its behalf, that the products were safe.
JCI ceased manufacturing products containing asbestos in 1985.
180 FINANCIALS Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2017 JCI continues to actively monitor the conduct and effect of its current and expected asbestos litigation, including the most efficacious presentation of its safe product defence, and intends to continue to resist these asbestos claims based upon this defence.
The table below summarises the JCI claims experience over the last 38 years since the start of this litigation: Year ended Year ended Year ended Year ended Year ended 31 July 2017 31 July 2016 31 July 2015 31 July 2014 31 July 2013 JCI claims experience Claims against JCI that have been dismissed 273,000 247,000 242,000 235,000 230,000 Claims JCI is currently a defendant in 50,000 74,000 76,000 80,000 81,000 Cumulative final judgments, after appeals, against JCI since 1979 138 137 133 131 121 Cumulative value of awards $m since 1979 160 158 153 149 120 The number of claims outstanding at 31 July 2017 reflects the benefit of 26,000 claims being dismissed in the year.
JCI has also incurred significant additional defence costs.
The litigation involves claims for a number of allegedly asbestos related diseases, with awards, when made, for mesothelioma tending to be larger than those for the other diseases.
JCIs ability to defend mesothelioma cases successfully is, therefore, likely to have a significant impact on its annual aggregate adverse judgment and defence costs.
John Crane, Inc. litigation provision The provision is based on past history of JCI claims and well-established tables of asbestos-related disease incidence projections.
The provision is determined using advice from asbestos valuation experts, Bates White LLC.
The assumptions made in assessing the appropriate level of provision include: the period over which the expenditure can be reliably estimated: the future trend of legal costs: the rate of future claims filed: the rate of successful resolution of claims: and the average amount of judgments awarded.
Established incidence curves can be used to estimate the likely future pattern of asbestos related disease.
However, JCIs claims experience is also significantly impacted by other factors which influence the US litigation environment.
These can include: changing approaches on the part of the plaintiffs bar: changing attitudes amongst the judiciary at both trial and appellate levels in specific jurisdictions which move the balance of risk and opportunity for claimants: and legislative and procedural changes in both the state and federal court systems.
The build-up of assets in trusts established by asbestos defendants in Chapter 11 restructuring 524 g trusts will increase the influence of these trusts on the behaviour of claimants.
Developments in the Garlock Sealing Technologies LLC Chapter 11 proceedings have provided additional data on plaintiff claims to 524 g trusts.
Given the evidence that emerged of inconsistent duplicate claims, there is a significant likelihood that this will lead to changes in the pattern of claims made in the future, and the costs arising from claims.
The projections use a limited time horizon on the basis that Bates White LLC consider that there is substantial uncertainty in the asbestos litigation environment so probable expenditures are not reasonably estimable beyond this time horizon.
Asbestos is the longest running mass tort litigation in American history which is constantly evolving in ways that cannot be anticipated.
JCIs defence strategy also generates a significantly different pattern of legal costs and settlement expenses from other defendants, so JCI is in an extremely rare position, and evidence from other litigation cannot be used to improve the reliability of the projections.
A ten year 2016: ten years time horizon has been used based on past experience regarding significant changes in the litigation environment that have occurred every few years and on the amount of time taken in the past for some of those changes to impact the broader asbestos litigation environment, and recent events, like the Garlock Sealing Technologies LLC Chapter 11 proceedings, which may lead to further major changes.
The rate of future claims filed has been estimated using well-established tables of asbestos incidence projections to determine the likely population of potential claimants, and JCIs past experience to determine what proportion of this population will make a claim against JCI.
The JCI products generally referred to in claims had industrial and marine applications.
As a result, the incidence curve used for JCI projections excludes construction workers, and is a composite of the curves that predict asbestos exposure-related disease from shipyards and other occupations.
This is consistent with JCIs litigation history.
The rate of successful resolution of claims and the average amount of any judgments awarded are projected based on the past history of JCI claims, since this is the best available evidence, given JCIs unusual strategy of defending all claims.
The future trend of legal costs is estimated based on JCIs past experience, adjusted to reflect the assumed levels of claims and trial activity, since the number of trials is a key driver of legal costs.
John Crane, Inc. litigation insurance recoveries While JCI has excess liability insurance, the availability of such insurance and scope of the cover are currently the subject of litigation in the United States.
Pending the outcome of that litigation, JCI has met defence costs directly.
The calculation of the provision does not take account of any potential recoveries from insurers.
181 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2017 N O TE S T O TH E A C C O U NTS C O NTI N U E D 22 Provisions and contingent liabilities continued Non-headline and legacy continued John Crane, Inc. continued John Crane, Inc. litigation provision history The JCI asbestos litigation provision has developed over the last five years as follows: Year ended Year ended Year ended Year ended Year ended 31 July 2017 31 July 2016 31 July 2015 31 July 2014 31 July 2013 m m m m m John Crane, Inc. litigation provision Gross provision 260 267 236 227 233 Discount 23 15 20 23 23 Discounted provision 237 252 216 204 210 Operating profit charge credit Increased provisions for adverse judgments and legal defence costs 17 8 14 49 23 Change in US risk free rates 13 7 1 2 9 Litigation management, legal fees in connection with litigation against insurers and defence strategy 11 8 4 1 Recoveries from insurers 6 16 Operating profit charge 9 7 19 48 14 Cash-flow Provision utilisation 24 22 24 36 27 John Crane, Inc. litigation spend 32 32 27 25 29 The reduction in 2017 is due to increasing US dollar discount rates, with no material movement in the gross provision.
The significant increase in the provision in 2016 is primarily due to the weakening of Smiths reporting currency against the US dollar 39m increase in the provision and lower US discount rates 7m charge to the income statement.
The operating charge for John Crane, Inc. litigation comprises: a charge of 17m 2016: 8m in respect of the net increased provision for adverse judgments and legal defence costs, a credit of 13m arising from an increase in US risk free rates 2016: charge of 7m, and 11m 2016: 8m costs for litigation management, defence strategy and legal fees in connection with litigation against insurers.
In the year ended 31 July 2016 JCI recognised the recovery of 16m through a settlement with an insurer.
This agreement does not provide any cover for future costs, so there is no material impact on the closing litigation provision.
A further settlement was agreed in the current year.
John Crane, Inc. litigation provision sensitivities The provision may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time if new information becomes available as a result of future events.
There can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred because of the significant uncertainty associated with the future level of asbestos claims and of the costs arising out of related litigation.
Statistical reliability of projections over the ten year time horizon In order to evaluate the statistical reliability of the projections, a population of outcomes is modelled using randomised verdict outcomes.
This generated a distribution of outcomes with future spend at the 5th percentile of 231m and future spend at the 95th percentile of 304m 2016: 236m and 311m, respectively.
Statistical analysis of the distribution of these outcomes indicates that there is a 50% probability that the total future spend will fall between 243m and 272m 2016: between 250m and 280m, compared to the gross provision value of 260m 2016: 267m.
Sensitivity of the projections to changes in the time horizon used If the asbestos litigation environment becomes more volatile and uncertain, for example if defendants are successful in legal cases against plaintiff law firms and this impacts the nature of claims filed, the time horizon over which the provision can be calculated may reduce.
Conversely, if the environment became more stable, or JCI changed approach and committed to long term settlement arrangements, the time period covered by the provision might be extended.
The projections use a 10 year time horizon.
Reducing the time horizon by one year would reduce the provision by 17m 2016: 18m and reducing it by five years would reduce the provision by 98m 2016: 107m.
We consider, after obtaining advice from Bates White LLC, that to forecast beyond ten years requires that the litigation environment remains largely unchanged with respect to the historical experience used for estimating future asbestos expenditures.
Historically, the asbestos litigation environment has undergone significant changes more often than every ten years.
If one assumed that the asbestos litigation environment would remain unchanged for longer and extended the time horizon by one year it would increase the provision by 14m 2016: 16m and extending it by five years would increase the provision by 58m 2016: 67m.
However, there are also reasonable scenarios that, given certain recent events in the US asbestos litigation environment, would result in no additional asbestos litigation for JCI beyond ten years.
At this time, how the asbestos litigation environment may evolve beyond 10 years is not reasonably estimable.
182 FINANCIALS Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2017 John Crane, Inc. contingent liabilities Provision has been made for future defence costs and the cost of adverse judgments expected to occur.
JCIs claims experience is significantly impacted by other factors which influence the US litigation environment.
These can include: changing approaches on the part of the plaintiffs bar: changing attitudes amongst the judiciary at both trial and appellate levels: and legislative and procedural changes in both the state and federal court systems.
As a result, whilst the Group anticipates that asbestos litigation will continue beyond the period covered by the provision, the uncertainty surrounding the US litigation environment beyond this point is such that the costs cannot be reliably estimated.
Although the methodology used to calculate the JCI litigation provision can in theory be applied to show claims and costs for longer periods, the Directors consider, based on advice from Bates White LLC, that the level of uncertainty regarding the factors used in estimating future costs is too great to provide for reasonable estimation of the numbers of future claims, the nature of such claims or the cost to resolve them for years beyond the 10 year time horizon.
Titeflex Corporation In recent years Titeflex Corporation, a subsidiary of the Group in the Flex-Tek division, has received a number of claims from insurance companies seeking recompense on a subrogated basis for the effects of damage allegedly caused by lightning strikes in relation to its flexible gas piping product.
It has also received a number of product liability claims regarding this product, some in the form of purported class actions.
Titeflex Corporation believes that its products are a safe and effective means of delivering gas when installed in accordance with the manufacturers instructions and local and national codes: however some claims have been settled on an individual basis without admission of liability.
Equivalent third-party products in the US marketplace face similar challenges.
Titeflex Corporation litigation provision The continuing progress of claims and the pattern of settlement, together with the recent market place activity, provide sufficient evidence to recognise a liability in the accounts.
Therefore provision has been made for the costs which the Group is expected to incur in respect of future claims to the extent that such costs can be reliably estimated.
Titeflex Corporation sells flexible gas piping with extensive installation and safety guidance revised in 2008 designed to assure the safety of the product and minimise the risk of damage associated with lightning strikes.
The assumptions made in assessing the appropriate level of provision, which are based on past experience, include: the period over which expenditure can be reliably estimated: the number of future settlements: the average amount of settlements: and the impact of statutes of repose and safe installation initiatives on the expected number of future claims.
The provision of 84m 2016: 94m is a discounted pre-tax provision using discount rates, being the risk-free rate on US debt instruments for the appropriate period.
The deferred tax asset related to this provision is shown within the deferred tax balance note 6.

The offsetting provision release of 13m is principally due to increasing discount rates.
In 2016, a 1m overprovision for the costs of settling claims was released, generating a net charge for the year of 11m.
Titeflex Corporation litigation provision sensitivities However, because of the significant uncertainty associated with the future level of claims and of the costs arising out of related litigation, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred and, as a result, the provision may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time if new information becomes available as a result of future events.
The projections incorporate a long-term assumption about the impact of safe installation initiatives on the level of future claims.
If the assumed annual benefit of bonding and grounding initiatives was 0.5% higher the provision would be 5m 2016: 6m lower, and if the benefit was 0.5% lower, the provision would increase by 5m 2016: 7m.

Capital management Capital employed comprises total equity adjusted for goodwill recognised directly in reserves, net post-retirement benefit related assets and liabilities, net litigation provisions relating to non-headline items and net debt.
The efficiency of the allocation of the capital to the divisions is monitored through the return on capital employed ROCE.
This ratio is calculated over a rolling 12-month period and is the percentage that headline operating profit comprises of monthly average capital employed.
The capital structure is based on the directors judgement of the balance required to maintain flexibility while achieving an efficient cost of capital.
The ratio of net debt to headline EBITDA of 1.4 2016: 1.6 is within the Groups stated policy of 2.0 or less over the medium term.
The Groups robust balance sheet and record of strong cash generation is more than able to fund the immediate investment needs and other legacy obligations.
See note 30 for the definition of headline EBITDA and the calculation of this ratio.

26 Acquisitions The Group acquired the Morpho Detection business from Safran S. A. on 6 April 2017.
The terms of the competition clearance for this transaction required the Group to sell the Morpho Detection explosive trace detection business.
Consequently, the Morpho Detection explosive trace detection business was treated as a business acquired for resale, and the trading result during the period of ownership and the loss on disposal have been reported in discontinued operations, see note 27.
The intangible assets recognised on this acquisition comprise technology, in process research and development, customer and service relationships and the order book on acquisition.
Goodwill represents the potential future technology developments and the cost savings that can be realised by integrating Morpho Detection with the continuing Smiths Detection business.
The goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
From the date of acquisition to 31 July 2017, Morpho Detection, excluding its explosive trace detection business, contributed 62m to revenue, 5m to headline profit before taxation and a loss of 24m to profit before taxation due to the unwind of inventory fair value adjustments 3m, the amortisation of acquired intangible assets 8m and integration and acquisition costs 18m.
If Smiths had acquired Morpho Detection at the beginning of the financial period, the acquisition, excluding its explosive trace detection business, would have contributed 184m to revenue, 19m to headline profit before taxation and a loss of 22m to profit before taxation.

The Group began marketing this business for sale once the terms of the competition clearance were known.
Consequently, this business was treated as a business acquired for resale, and the assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale during the period the business was owned by the Group.
The sale was completed on 7 July 2017 for a cash consideration of 63m.
A loss after tax of 8m 2016: nil was generated by discontinued operations, giving a loss per share from discontinued operations, basic and diluted, of 2.0p 2016: nil.
Cash invested in financial assets includes 7m 2016: nil relating to discontinued operations.
There were no assets or businesses held for sale at 31 July 2017.
At 31 July 2016 the assets and liabilities of the John Crane Artificial lift business were disclosed as held for sale.
No impairment loss was recognised on writing these assets down to fair value less disposal costs although impairments were recognised earlier in the year relating to this business, see note 11.
