Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED b Basis of preparation The Company a Obtains funds from one or more investors for the purpose of providing those investor s with investment management services: b Commits to its investor s that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from investment income, capital appreciation, or both: and c Measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis.
Consequently, the Company does not consolidate its subsidiaries or apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations when it obtains control of another entity as it is considered to be an Investment Entity under IFRS.
Instead, the Company measures its investment in its subsidiary at fair value through profit or loss.
The financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company only.
The Company recognises its investment in its direct subsidiary, JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. at fair value through profit or loss.
The fair value estimate of JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. includes the fair value of both this company and all of the Companys subsidiaries and PPP investments.
The Company invests solely for capital appreciation, investment income, or both.
Consequently, the Company does not plan to hold its investments indefinitely.
The Company has an exit strategy for the portfolio of investments held indirectly.
JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. is itself an investment entity.
Consequently, the Company need not have an exit strategy for its investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. Similarly, any other subsidiaries that are investment entities themselves do not require an exit strategy to meet the denition of an investment entity.
Each investment indirectly held subordinated debt together with equity has a nite life.
The subordinated debt will mature towards the end of the concession and at the end of the concession the investment will be liquidated.
The exit strategy is that investments will normally be held to liquidation at the end of the concession unless the Company sees an opportunity in the market to dispose of investments.
John Laing Capital Management Limited the Investment Adviser and the JLIF Board regularly consider whether any disposals should be made.
c Going concern The Directors, in their consideration of going concern have reviewed comprehensive cash ow forecasts prepared by the Investment Adviser, which are based on prudent market data and past experience and consider, based on those forecasts and an assessment of the Companys and the Groups committed banking facilities, that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the Company on the going concern basis.
In arriving at their conclusion that the Group has adequate financial resources, the Directors were mindful that the Group had unrestricted cash of 40.4 million including 1.9 million for the Company and a five-year banking facility available for investment in new or existing projects and working capital of 180.0 million, which expires in August 2020, and an accordion facility of 150.0 million which expires in June 2019.
As at 31 December 2017, there was the equivalent of 186.6 million drawn under the facilities which was used to acquire investments in the year.
All key financial covenants are forecast to continue to be complied with.
The Company, through its intermediate holding companies, holds investments in 65 infrastructure PPP project companies which yield annual interest, dividends and loan repayments.
The cash ow yields from the projects cover the Groups expected cash ow requirements for overheads and targeted dividend distribution policy.
The Company and its intermediate holding companies have sufficient financial resources together with their PPP investments public-sector long-term contracts across a range of infrastructure projects.
As a consequence, the Directors consider that the Company and its intermediate holdings companies are well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
Certain risks and uncertainties, as detailed in note 17, have been considered by the Board.
The Board has concluded that these do not represent a significant threat to the Company and the Group as the Groups income is generated from a portfolio of PPP concessions which are supported by government-backed cash ows and are forecast to cover the Groups committed costs.
The Directors, at the time of approving the financial statements, are satisfied that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report.
Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these annual financial statements.
d Revenue recognition Operating income Operating income in the income statement represents the combination of the income from and the movement in the fair value of the Companys investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. Refer to note 9 for details.

For the purpose of the financial statements, the results and financial position of the Company and the underlying fair valued financial position of JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. are expressed in Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the Company, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each Balance Sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
g Taxation Under the current system of taxation in Guernsey, the Company is exempt from paying taxes on income, profits or capital gains.
Dividend income and interest income received by the Group may be subject to withholding tax imposed in the country of origin of such income.
The underlying project companies in which the Group invests provide for and pay taxation at the appropriate rates in the countries in which they operate.
h Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Companys Statement of Financial Position when the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash ows from the instrument expire or the asset is transferred and the transfer qualies for derecognition in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS13 Fair Value Measurement.
i Financial assets The Company classies its financial assets in the following categories: fair value through profit or loss and loans and receivables.
The classication depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
The Company determines the classication of its financial assets at initial recognition.
a Investments at fair value through profit or loss Investments at fair value through profit or loss are designated upon initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
In these financial statements, investment at fair value through profit or loss is the fair value of the Companys direct subsidiary, JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. which comprises the fair value of JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. all the intermediate holding companies and the Portfolio.
JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. and the intermediate holding companies net assets are mainly composed of cash and working capital and an outstanding loan balance of 186.6 million comprising 46.9 million 41.7 million and 144.9 million and are recognised at fair value which is equivalent to their net assets.
The Companys investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. comprises both equity and a profit Participating Agreement PPA.
Both elements are exposed to the same primary risk, being performance risk.
This performance risk is taken into consideration when determining the discount rate applied to the forecast cash ows.
In determining fair value, the Board considered observable market transactions and have measured fair value using assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset including assumptions regarding risk.
The PPA and equity are considered to have the same risk characteristics and as such the PPA and equity form a single class of financial instrument for the purposes of disclosure.
The Company measures its investment as a single class of financial asset at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
b Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that are non-derivative financial assets and that have xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classied as loans and other receivables.
Loans and other receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
They are included in current assets, except where maturities are greater than 12 months after the Balance Sheet date which are classied as Non-Current Assets.
The Companys loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the Statement of Financial Position.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED h Financial instruments continued ii Financial liabilities and equity Debt and equity instruments are classied as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
a Equity instruments share capital and share premium Ordinary shares are classied as equity.
Costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or associated with the establishment of the Company that would otherwise have been avoided are written off against the balance of the Share Premium Account.
b Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classied as other financial liabilities, comprising: Loans and borrowings which are recognised initially at fair value of the consideration received, less transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, loan and borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis: and Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses.
iii Effective interest rate method The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the relevant assets carrying amount.
iv Fair value estimation The Companys investments at fair value are not traded in active markets.
Investments at fair value through profit or loss are designated upon initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The fair value of the Portfolio is calculated by discounting at an appropriate discount rate future cash ows expected to be received by the Groups intermediate holdings, from investments in both equity dividends and equity redemptions and subordinated loans interest and repayments.
The discount rates are relevant and in the range of those applied in the market for similar projects.
The basis of discount rates are long run average government bond rates adjusted for an appropriate premium to reect PPP specic risk.
Risk premia are then added to this adjusted base gilt rate depending on the phase of the project and any specic risks to which the project is exposed.
The discount rates that have been applied to value the projects comprising the Portfolio at 31 December 2017 were in the range 7.00% to 9.50% 31 December 2016: 7.02% to 9.00%.
Refer to note 9 for details of the areas of estimation in the calculation of the fair value.
JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. and the intermediate holding companies net assets are mainly composed of cash and working capital and loan balances and are recognised at fair value which is equivalent to their net assets.
i Segmental reporting In the financial statements, the Company recognises one investment in its 100% owned subsidiary JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. The Directors consider and analyse the performance of the Company by considering the Groups main activity which is to invest in PPP projects through its intermediate holding companies.
Information reported to the Companys Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance is focused on the sector risk associated within the Group.
The Group has investments in the Health, Education, Justice & Emergency Services, Transport, Regeneration & Social Housing, Government Buildings and Street Lighting sectors and therefore these form the Groups reportable segments under IFRS 8.
The Directors also consider and analyse the performance of the Group by Geography as the Group predominately invests in the UK, but also has investments in Continental Europe, North America, as well as administration functions in Guernsey.
Geographical segments therefore form part of the Groups reportable segments under IFRS 8. j Statement of compliance Pursuant to the Protection of Investors Bailiwick of Guernsey Law, 1987 the Company is a Registered Closed-Ended Investment Scheme.
As an authorised scheme, the Company is subject to certain ongoing obligations.

Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 3.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS In the application of the Companys accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the fair value of assets and liabilities that affect reported amounts.
Fair value of PPP investments Fair values for those investments for which a market quote is not available are determined using the income approach which discounts the expected cash ows at the appropriate rate.
The Directors have applied their judgement in determining this valuation methodology and concluded that this is the most appropriate valuation method given the predictability and nature of the underlying cash ows generated from the investments.
Key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty Estimates such as future cash ows are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
These cash ows also contain various assumptions, most signicantly the ination rate, deposit rate and tax rates used in forecasting the expected cash ows for each period.
Sensitivities to these critical assumptions and their impact on the fair value of investments at fair value through profit and loss are disclosed in note 9.
In determining the discount rate, management applies their judgement in determining the appropriate risk-free rates and specic risks, and consider the evidence of recent transactions.
Management deems the discount rate to be one of the most significant unobservable inputs and any change in it could have a material impact on the fair value of the investments.
Underlying assumptions and discount rates are disclosed in note 9.
Investment entities The Directors have satisfied themselves that the PPP investments share the same investment characteristics and as such constitute a single asset class for IFRS 7 disclosure purposes.
OPERATING SEGMENTS Information reported to the Companys Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance is focused on the sector risk associated within the Group.
The Board reviews the Portfolio Valuation analysis by sector and the Directors, Investment Advisers and Asset Management teams monitor the business considering sector split.
Currently the Company, via its 100% owned subsidiary JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. has investments in the Health, Education, Justice & Emergency Services, Transport, Regeneration & Social Housing, Government Buildings and Street Lighting sectors and therefore these form the Companys reportable segments under IFRS 8.

As part of the Finance Bill No.
2 2017, the UK Government published on 13 July 2017 an updated legislation on Corporate Interest Restriction CIR.
Following agreement by both Houses the Bill received Royal Assent on 16 November 2017 and is now an Act of Parliament law.
JLIF considers that these rules do not represent a significant risk to the Group.
JLIF does not expect the introduction of this legislation to have a material impact on the valuation of the Portfolio.
JLIF will continue to monitor any further proposed legislation in relation to the OECD G20s Base Erosion and profit Shifting BEPS initiative, both in the UK and in other territories in which JLIF operates, and the potential impact on the valuation of the Groups interests.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty of the Company, its intermediate holding companies or its PPP project companies will default on the contractual obligations they entered into.
Credit risk is subsumed within the overall Companys performance risk.
The Company, its 100% owned direct subsidiary and the intermediate holding companies rely on the performance of their main counterparties where credit risk arises, mainly from the Groups investments in PPP projects.
The performance risk arises from the PPP investments inability to pay the forecast distributions as the Group relies on its project companies to perform adequately and return the expected yields.
Several factors could hinder this ability such as poor operational performance, exceptional expenditures, major maintenance overspend or an event that would affect the PPP project companys cover ratios.
The Groups PPP investments are also dependent on the performance of their main operational contractors.
The Group regularly monitors the contractors concentration and financial strength.
The Directors and Investment Adviser regularly assess the returns forecast from the Portfolio through the update of cash ow forecasts and by monitoring the operational and financial performance of these investments with regular performance meetings.
The Groups project companies receive regular, long-term, index-linked revenue from government departments, public-sector or local authority clients or directly from the public via real tolls, providing a stable and low-risk income stream.
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
The Group mitigates its risk on cash investments and derivative transactions by only transacting with banking counterparties with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies a minimum of Standard and Poors A-1.
The Directors believe that the Group is not signicantly exposed to credit risk and that its investments underlying risks are monitored and sufciently mitigated for the investments to deliver the expected return to the Group.
The Directors have considered the above factors and the discount rate sensitivities disclosed in note 9 and does not consider it appropriate to present a separate analysis of credit risk.
Market risk ination risk Each of the Groups PPP investments will typically have part of its revenue and costs linked to a specic ination index at inception of the project.
In most cases this creates a natural hedge, meaning a derivative does not need to be entered into in order to mitigate ination risk.
However, in a minority of cases where the investment has index-linked cash ows that fall outside of this natural hedge, the ination risk is hedged using RPI ination swaps.
For a sensitivity analysis of investments at fair value through profit or loss, refer to note 9.
Market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk The Company has one investment in its direct subsidiary, JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. which has exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk through holding Euro cash balances and contracting with service providers paid in Euros.
The level of these balances and expenditures are marginal and do not pose a significant risk to the value recognised in the Companys Statement of Financial Position.
As at 31 December 2017, the fair value of the Companys investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. includes nine 2016: nine overseas investments.
The Company and its subsidiaries foreign currency exchange rate risk policy is not to hedge automatically on an individual project basis but to determine the total Group exposure to individual currencies.
At 31 December 2017, the Companys investment at fair value through profit or loss includes any foreign exchange forward contracts with a fair value of 0.3 million 31 December 2016: nil.
The Company and its subsidiaries are mainly exposed to uctuations in the Euro, US Dollar and Canadian Dollar exchange rates.
The amount of the Companys investments fair value foreign currency denominated assets at the reporting date was as follows: 31 December 31 December 2017 2016 000s 000s Canadian Dollar 87,926 91,651 Euro 211,617 211,357 US Dollar 86,711 91,617 386,254 394,625 JLIF Limited 86.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The following table details the Companys sensitivity to a 10% increase or decrease in Sterling against relevant foreign currencies.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency-denominated monetary items fair valued within the Companys investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. and reects a 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates.
A positive number below indicates an increase in profit from operations where the relevant currency strengthens by 10% against Sterling.
For a 10% weakening of the relevant currency against Sterling, there would be an approximately equal and opposite impact on profit from operations, and the positive balances below would be negative.
31 December 2017 profit Investments before tax at fair value Effect on operating profit and investments at fair value of relevant currency strengthening by 10% against Sterling: 000s 000s Canadian Dollar 8,793 8,793 Euro 21,162 21,162 US Dollar 8,671 8,671 38,626 38,626 31 December 2016 profit Investments before tax at fair value Effect on operating profit and investments at fair value of relevant currency strengthening by 10% against Sterling: 000s 000s Canadian Dollar 9,164 9,164 Euro 21,135 21,135 US Dollar 9,162 9,162 39,461 39,461 While JLIFs stated policy since launch in November 2010 has been not to hedge the balance sheet value of its non-Sterling assets, JLIF does make prudent use of foreign exchange hedging instruments to hedge non-Sterling cash ows.
Furthermore, JLIFs investment policy requires that at least 50% of the Portfolio be UK-based at any time.
JLIF is also able to draw on its revolving credit facility in the local currency and repay borrowings in the same currency from its portfolio of assets denominated in the same currency, thereby creating a natural hedge.
Market risk interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises on the credit facility borrowings and oating rate deposits.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to variability of interest payment cash ows.
Each PPP investment hedges its interest rate risk at the inception of a project.
This will either be done by issuing a xed rate bond or, if the project is bank nanced, with xed rate bank debt or variable rate debt which will be swapped into xed rate by the use of interest rate swaps.
The uctuations in interest rates impact the return from oating rate deposits and hence the income from investments at fair value through profit or loss.
A 1% increase or decrease represents the Directors assessment of a reasonable possible change in interest rates.
At 31 December 2017, the Group was in a positive cash position of 40.4 million and had outstanding debt of 186.6 million at the balance sheet date 31 December 2016: cash position of 32.7 million, 171.4 million outstanding debt.
The interest rate sensitivity of the Groups assets and liabilities does not have a material impact.
The Company held the following financial instruments at fair value at 31 December 2017.
There have been no transfers of financial instruments between levels of the fair value hierarchy.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements.

There were no Level 1 or 2 assets or liabilities during the year 2016: none.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2, Level 1 and 3 or Level 2 and 3 during the year 2016: none.
In the table above, financial instruments are held at carrying value as an approximation to fair value unless stated otherwise.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities An analysis of the movement between opening to closing balances of the investments at fair value through profit or loss is given in note 9.
The investments at fair value through profit or loss, whose fair values include the use of Level 3 inputs, include the fair value of the Companys 100% owned subsidiary JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. the intermediate holding companies and the Groups Portfolio.
The fair value of the Companys direct subsidiary and the intermediate holding companies mainly comprises cash and working capital and an outstanding loan balance of 186.6 million.
The fair values of these companies are equivalent to their Net Assets.
The Groups Portfolio is valued by discounting future cash ows from investments in both equity dividends and equity redemptions and subordinated loans interest and repayments to the Group at an appropriate discount rate.
The basis of each discount rate, which is a weighted average cost of capital, is the long run average government bond rates adjusted by an appropriate premium to reect PPP specic risk, phase of the project e. g. steady-state operations, early stage operations or in construction and counterparty credit risk, amongst other factors.
The weighted average discount rate applied was 7.74% 31 December 2016: 7.87%.
The discount rate is considered the most significant unobservable input through which an increase or decrease would have a material impact on the fair value of the investments at fair value through profit or loss.
An absolute increase of 1% in the discount rate would cause a decrease in fair value of the Portfolio of 114.6 million 31 December 2016: 96.7 million.
An absolute decrease of 1% could cause an increase in fair value of the Portfolio of 134.2 million 31 December 2016: 111.7 million.
For a sensitivity analysis of Financial Assets at fair value through profit or loss, refer to note 9.
The Directors consider that the carrying value amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements are approximately equal to their fair values.

GUARANTEES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS The Company has provided a guarantee under the JLIF Limited Partnerships 180 million multicurrency revolving credit facility which expires in August 2020, and under the accordion facility of 150 million which expires in June 2019.
As at 31 December 2017, 186.6 million was drawn across the facilities.
The fair value of the guarantee is considered to be immaterial to the Company accounts as the probability of the guarantee being called upon is considered to be extremely unlikely.
In making this assessment, consideration has been given to the proximity of the current and forecast metrics to default.
EVENTS AFTER BALANCE SHEET DATE In January 2018, Carillion plc announced its compulsory liquidation.
As was announced by JLIF at the time, it had nine operational PPP projects where Carillion was the facilities management provider, including four education projects, one road project and four justice and emergency services projects.
Together these projects represented 8.5% of the Portfolio Value as at 31 December 2017.
The Investment Adviser had been aware of the issues facing Carillion plc for some time and therefore had in place contingency plans to ensure minimal service disruption and minimal additional cost to the affected projects.
In addition, JLIF has one project where Carillion was the construction contractor where it remained liable for any latent construction defects and where cost allowances for rectification had not already been made.
With the construction phases having completed over ten years ago, a recently completed routine defects survey did not identify any significant areas of concern.
The latest status regarding the nine projects at which Carillion plc provided facilities management services can be found in the Investment Adviser Report.
DISCLOSURE SERVICE CONCESSION ARRANGEMENTS The Group holds investments in 65 service concession arrangements in the Health, Education, Justice and Emergency Services, Government Buildings, Regeneration and Social Housing, Transport and Street Lighting sectors.
The concessions vary on the obligations required, but typically require the construction and operation of an asset during the concession period.
The concession may require the acquisition or replacement of an existing asset or the construction of a new asset.
The operation of the asset may include the provision of facilities management services such as cleaning, catering, caretaking, and major maintenance.
As at 31 December 2017, for all but four 2016: all but four of the Companys investments, the residual interest will be transferred to the relevant government public authorities at the end of each concession term.
For these four 2016: four concessions the head lease will be retained by the concession provider at the end of the concession period.
The value of these head leases is not considered to be material.
As at 31 December 2017 all of the service concessions apart from one Intercity Express Programme Phase 1 were fully operational 31 December 2016: all apart from one.
The rights of both the concession provider and concession operator are stated within the specic project agreement.
The standard rights of the public-sector client to terminate the project include poor performance and in the event of force majeure.
The operators rights to terminate include the failure of the public-sector client to make payment under the agreement, a material breach of contract and relevant changes of law which would render it impossible for the service company to full its requirements.
In the event of voluntary termination, equity investors benefit from compensation provisions that, in the majority of cases, ensure that market value is received.
As at 31 December 2017, JLIF estimates it would receive approximately 87% of its UK portfolio value in the extreme event that all of its UK projects were voluntarily terminated.
JLIFs UK portfolio comprises 56 projects spread across seven sectors and approximately 50 different public sector counterparties.
Each of JLIFs UK acute hospital projects benefit from contracts where the voluntary termination provisions dictate market value be paid to investors.
Any voluntary termination of a project by the public-sector client would also require the repayment of senior debt as well as the cost of the make whole or Spens clauses attached to the senior debt.
The approximate par value of the senior debt across JLIFs UK portfolio at 31 December 2017 was 4.7 billion.
