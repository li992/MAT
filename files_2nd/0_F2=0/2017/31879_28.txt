There is no intention to sell the brand in the foreseeable future and, therefore, it is not anticipated that any of the deferred tax liability in respect of brands will reverse in the 12 months following the balance sheet date.
The deferred tax asset in respect of share schemes represents an estimate of the future tax deduction available on the exercise or vesting of awards under those schemes.
Whilst it is anticipated that an element of the remaining deferred tax assets and liabilities will reverse during the 12 months following the balance sheet date, at present it is not possible to accurately quantify the value of all of these reversals.
In addition to the deferred tax liability shown above, the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 2.0m 2016: 2.1m in respect of capital and other losses amounting to 11.5m 2016: 11.6m because these are not considered recoverable in the foreseeable future.

The estimation of future sales prices and costs to complete included zero net Working capital inflation 2016: zero net inflation for the first three years and then low single digit inflation thereafter.

A 5% reduction in forecast average selling prices would result in additional impairment of inventories, however this would not be material.

During the year the Group has conducted six-monthly reviews of the net realisable value of specific sites identified as at high risk of impairment, based upon a number of criteria including low site profit margins and sites with no forecast completions.
Where the estimated net realisable value of a site was less than its current carrying value within the Balance Sheet, theGroup has impaired the land and work in progress value.
