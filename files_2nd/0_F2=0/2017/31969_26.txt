Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash-generating unit expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cashgenerating units to which goodwill has been allocated are reviewed for impairment at least annually as a matter of course, and whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs which indicates potential impairment.
The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

The Group has prepared financial forecasts for the business for the period to June 2020 that show the Group as a whole and HLAS, will remain profitable and cash generative.
HLAS is profit-making and has a net asset position as at 30 June 2017, as a result there are no factors indicating goodwill is impaired.
108 Hargreaves Lansdown Report and Financial Statements 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 2.2 Other intangible assets Intangible assets excluding goodwill Other intangible assets comprise customer lists, computer software and the Groups key operating system, which are stated at cost less amortisation and any recognised impairment loss.
Amortisation is provided, where material, on all intangible assets excluding goodwill at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly using a straight-line method over its estimated useful life as follows: Customer list eight years The customer list relates to an acquired book of business and does not include internally generated client lists.
The carrying value of the asset is reviewed for impairment at least every 12 months, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Computer software over three to eight years Computer software relates to purchases of licences and software, as well as internally generated systems improvements.
The carrying values of computer software are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Included in computer software are IT development costs that are capitalised only to the extent that they lead to the creation of an enduring asset, which delivers benefits at least as great as the amount capitalised and in accordance with the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible assets.
Development work has been undertaken in-house by IT staff and management to enhance the key operating systems.
In accordance with the provisions of IAS 38 the costs are capitalised as an intangible asset and subsequently amortised over the estimated useful life of the system of eight years.
This key operating system is fundamental to the operation of the platform, which holds client assets, enabling revenue to be earned.
Where such costs relate to an asset that is not yet fully available for use by the business, they have been separately classified as assets under construction, they are reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Assets under construction Hargreaves Lansdown Savings Limited In-house development work has also been undertaken in Hargreaves Lansdown Savings Limited to develop a digital cash savings product.
Demand, and the feasibility for these services, was established in the year to 30 June 2015, and subsequently, a business plan was constructed that formed part of the strategic initiatives approved by the Board.
Development commenced in the year to 30 June 2016 and the Group is committed to the completion and launch of the services in the next financial year and is committed to providing the financial resources required to see it through to expected profitability.
In accordance with IAS 38 the development costs are being capitalised and are recognised initially at cost.
Impairment of intangible assets excluding goodwill At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the loss.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows, independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, less costs to sell, and value in use.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.

110 Hargreaves Lansdown Report and Financial Statements 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 2.3 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is charged based on the estimates of useful economic lives and expected residual values, which are reviewed annually, for all plant and equipment.
Management determines the useful lives and residual values for assets when they are acquired, based on experience with similar assets and taking into account other relevant factors, such as any expected changes in technology.
The charge is calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly using a straight-line method over its estimated useful life as follows: computer hardware over three to ten years office equipment which includes fixtures and leasehold improvements over three to ten years.
The carrying values of plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
A loss of 0.3 million was recognised in the consolidated income statement.
111 Hargreaves Lansdown Report and Financial Statements 2017 Section 2: Assets and liabilities Notes to the Group financial statements consolidated statement of financial position 2.4 Investments Investments are recognised in the Groups statement of financial position, on trade date, when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of an instrument and are initially measured at cost.
Investments that are designated as being held at fair value through profit or loss are carried at fair value, being the quoted market price of the listed investment, with any gain or loss reported within the income statement.
An investment is classified in this category if it is held principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term.
Available-for-sale assets are included at cost upon initial recognition and have been subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Where it is not possible to determine a fair value through the use of a quoted market price or other valuation technique, available-for-sale investments are carried at cost.
The Group derecognises financial assets only when the contractual rights to the cash flows, or substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership from the asset are transferred or expire.
On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the assets carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable, as well as the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, is recognised in profit or loss.

The resulting gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
