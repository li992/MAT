In 2016, the Groups share of the market value was 27,275 million 8,051 ITC Ltd. Groups share of the market value is 11,036 million 2016: 10,430 million 1,527 1,394 Other listed associates Groups share of the market value is 184 million 2016: 142 million 18 17 Unlisted associates 32 45 1,577 9,507 On 25 July 2017, the Group announced the completion of the acquisition of the remaining 57.8% of RAI the Group did not already own.
As at this date RAI ceased to be reported as an associate and has become a fully owned subsidiary.
Accordingly, as at that date, RAI has been consolidated in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
Included in the 30,521 million is the gain arising on the deemed disposal of RAI of 23,288 million.
This gain includes amounts restated in accordance with IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates see note 19.
Prior to 25 July 2017, the Group accounted for RAI as an associate, having concluded that it did not have fide facto control of RAI because of the operation of the governance agreement between the Group and RAI which ensured that the Group did not have the practical ability to direct relevant activities of RAI.
During 2016, the Group entered into an agreement with Tisaks parent Agrokor d. d. Agrokor to convert certain outstanding trading balances into long term loans and an additional shareholding in Tisak.
As part of the agreement, Agrokor has the right to reacquire the additional shareholding in Tisak.
As a consequence of this, while the Group has legal ownership of the additional shareholding, it does not consider the shares to provide any additional equity interest and continues to account for 26% of the equity of Tisak.
In 2017, due to the financial difficulties of Agrokor and Tisak, the Group has recognised the legal ownership of Tisak and subsequently impaired this investment.
This resulted in a charge of 27 million to the income statement that has been reported as an adjusting item in note 5.
Included within the dividends amount of 688 million 2016: 1,024 million are 477 million 2016: 773 million attributable to dividends declared by RAI and 204 million 2016: 245 million attributable to dividends declared by ITC.
The principal associate undertaking of the Group is ITC Ltd. ITC as shown under associates undertakings and joint ventures.
