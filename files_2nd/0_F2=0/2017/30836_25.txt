This facility, along with the existing term loans at 1 January 2017, was repaid in full on 5 May 2017, when the Group undertook a renancing exercise.
The new nancing structure consists of 550 million of high-yield, publicly traded bonds listed on the Luxembourg exchange.
This includes 350 million 4.25% xed rate notes and 200 million floating rate notes of 4.00% above LIBOR, which all mature in April 2022.
On the same day, the Group entered into a 350 million Facility comprised of a revolving credit facility RCF with a value of 315 million 2016: 400 million and an index-linked term loan of 35 million.
The RCF matures in April 2021, with an option to extend by one year, and has a margin of 150 basis points over LIBOR.
At 31 December 2017, the RCF had been utilised to draw down letters of credit with a total value of 35.7 million 2016: 57.9 million.
The Group also has access to a $25 million revolving 30 day facility in the US business.
This facility was fully drawn down at 31 December 2017 and had a Sterling equivalent value of 18.5 million at that date.
The term loan was fully drawn at inception and remains fully drawn at 31 December 2017 2016: term loans of 325 million fully drawn.
The Group has no other undrawn debt facilities, although it does have access to certain non-recourse trade receivable finance facilities as described on note 4.4 which are utilised to accelerate working capital cash flows.
Accounting policy The Group measures all debt instruments whether financial assets or financial liabilities initially at fair value, which equates to the principal value of the consideration paid or received.
Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Transaction costs any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instrument are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are amortised through the income statement over the life of the instrument.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down.
Where this is the case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.

The table below makes adjustments for any non-cash accounting items to reconcile our net profit for the year to the amount of cash we have generated from our operations.
Years ended 31 December 2017 2016 m m Loss profit for the year 151.1 193.9 Adjustments for: Interest payable and similar charges 66.3 7.0 Interest receivable 0.2 0.6 Tax credit charge 32.1 3.2 Depreciation and amortisation 167.2 109.5 Losses on disposal 14.5 3.8 Unrealised losses gains on derivative contracts 156.1 176.8 Other losses 0.4 Dened benefit pension scheme current service cost 7.3 6.0 Non-cash charge for share-based payments 6.1 5.2 1 Close out of currency contracts 9.8 14.0 Operating cash flows before movement in working capital 224.7 165.2 Changes in working capital: Decrease increase in inventories 15.4 63.5 Decrease in receivables 60.6 28.6 Decrease increase in payables 22.4 73.7 Decrease in carbon assets 0.6 11.1 Decrease in ROC assets 112.1 12.5 Total cash released from working capital 166.3 62.4 Dened benefit pension scheme contributions 15.3 14.5 Cash generated from operations 375.7 213.1 Note: 1 During 2016 we closed out a number of in-the-money forward foreign currency purchase contracts with a total value of 14 million.
As these contracts were designated into hedge accounting relationships under IAS 39, the benefit is being recognised in the income statement in the period the hedged transaction occurs.
The net loss for 2017 includes 10 million of income in relation to the unwinding of this position, for which the cash was received in 2016.
The Group has access to a facility that enables it to accelerate the cash flows associated with trade receivables arising from B2B Energy Supply sales on a non-recourse basis.
The net cash benefit derived from this facility during 2017 was 110 million 2016: 74 million and is recognised as a reduction in receivables in the table above.
We estimate that approximately 30% of this cash would have been received in the ordinary course of business by 31 December 2017 had the facility not been in place.
The Group also has access to similar non-recourse facilities to accelerate cash flows on ROC receivables.
No ROC receivables have been sold through these facilities in 2017 2016: net cash benefit of 111 million.
The reduction in ROCs in the table above reflects a reduction in the number of generation units that give rise to ROCs following the approval of the CfD contract for one of our biomass-fuelled units in December 2016.
