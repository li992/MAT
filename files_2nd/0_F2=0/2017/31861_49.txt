Disclosures regarding financial instruments measured at fair value continued 3 Inputs are unobservable ie: for which market data is unavailable for the asset or liability If the market for the asset is not active and recent transactions of an identical asset on their own are not a good estimate of fair value, an entity estimates the fair value by using a valuation technique.
The objective of using a valuation technique is to estimate what the transaction price would have been on the measurement date in an arms length exchange motivated by normal business considerations.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset.
Details of the valuation techniques used by the Company are given in note 1 b on page 48.
The following table sets out the fair value measurements using the FRS 102 hierarchy at 30th June.
2017 2016 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities 000 000 000 000 Level 1 1,109,292 901,025 There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 during the year 2016: same.
Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the Features page.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These financial risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close cooperation with the Board and the Manager, coordinates the Companys risk management policy.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys classes of financial instruments are as follows: investments in equity shares of overseas companies, which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: cash held within a liquidity fund: and short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market risk is given in parts i to iii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.

ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 EMIT pp48-64 05 10 2017 16:21 Page 59 i Currency risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling which is the Companys functional currency and presentation currency.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least four occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of this exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company may use short term forward currency contracts to manage working capital requirements.
It is currently not the Company's policy to hedge against foreign currency risk.
Foreign currency exposure The fair value of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 30th June are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
Cash held in the JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund has fluctuated between nil and 40,795,000 during the year 2016: 22,250,000 and 36,999,000.

The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and the income receivable in foreign currency and assumes a 10% 2016: 10% appreciation or depreciation in sterling against the currencies to which the Company is exposed to, which is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.

ii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and the liquidity fund.
Management of interest rate risk The Company does not normally hold significant cash balances.
Short term borrowings are used when required.
Interest rate exposure The exposure of financial assets and liabilities to floating interest rates using the year end figures, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are reset, is shown below.
2017 2016 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and short term deposits 3,871 697 JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund 6,709 30,355 Total net exposure 10,580 31,052 Interest receivable on cash balances is at a margin below LIBOR 2016: same.
The target interest earned on the JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund is the 7 day US Dollar London Interbank Bid Rate.

This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the balance sheet date with all other variables held constant.

iii Other price risk Other price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, which may affect the value of equity investments.
Management of other price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risk exposure The Companys total exposure to changes in market prices at 30th June comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 Equity investments held at fair value through profit or loss 1,109,292 901,025 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to other price risk during the current and comparative year.
Concentration of exposure to other price risk An analysis of the Companys investments is given on pages 14 to 19.
This shows that the investments value is in a broad spread of countries with no concentration of exposure to any one country.
However, it should also be noted that an investment may not be entirely exposed to the economic conditions in its country of domicile or of listing.

Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Liquidity risk exposure Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: 2017 2016 Within Within one year Total one year Total 000 000 000 000 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Repurchase of the Companys own shares awaiting settlement 1,833 1,833 Other creditors and accruals 340 340 206 206 Derivative financial liabilities 2 2 2,175 2,175 206 206 The liabilities shown above represent future contractual payments and therefore may differ from the amounts shown in the Statement of Financial Position.
c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction fails to discharge its obligations under that transaction which could result in loss to the Company.
Management of credit risk Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate DVP Delivery Versus Payment settlement.
The process of DVP mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during the settlement process.
The Manager continuously monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, a process that involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.
