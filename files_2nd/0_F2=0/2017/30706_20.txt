The tax assessed for the year is lower than that resulting from applying the effective standard rate of corporation tax in the UK for a large company.
The difference is explained below.

No provision has been made for deferred tax on income outstanding at the end of the year as this will be covered by unrelieved business charges and eligible unrelieved foreign tax 2016: nil.
7.4 Factors that may affect future tax charges At 31 December 2017, the Company had excess expenses of 218,091,000 2016: 197,142,000 carried forward.
This sum has arisen due to cumulative deductible expenses having exceeded income over the life of the Company.
It is considered too uncertain that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which these expenses can be offset and, therefore, in accordance with IAS 12, a deferred tax asset of 37,076,000 2016: 33,542,000 in respect of unrelieved loan relationship deficit and unrelieved management expenses based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 17% 2016: 17% has not been recognised.
The reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax was substantively enacted on 15 September 2016 and will be effective 1 April 2020.
Provided the Company continues to maintain its current investment profile, it is unlikely that the expenses will be utilised and that the Company will obtain any benefit from this asset.

14 Financial instruments Risk management policies and procedures As an investment company, Witan invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objective as stated on the inside front cover.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Group is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Groups net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
These risks, primarily market risk comprising price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, and the directors approach to the management of them, are set out below.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to manage the risks, as set out below, have not changed from the previous accounting period, although in some instances additional resources have been allocated to some areas.
14.1 Market risk The fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Group may fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises: price risk see note 14.2, currency risk see note 14.3 and interest rate risk see note 14.4.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, which policies have remained substantially unchanged from those applying in the year ended 31 December 2016.
The investment managers assess the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitor the overall level of market risk on the whole of their investment portfolios on an ongoing basis.
14.2 Price risk Price risks i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted and the unquoted investments.
80 Witan Investment Trust PLC Annual Report 2017 Management of the risk The Board manages the risks inherent in the investment portfolios by regularly reviewing relevant information from the investment managers.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance.
The Board monitors the managers compliance with their mandates and also whether each mandate and asset allocation is compatible with the Companys objective.
When appropriate, the Company has the ability to manage its exposure to risk through the controlled use of derivatives.
The Groups exposure to other changes in market prices at 31 December on its quoted equity investments, and on index futures and investments, was as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss 1,884,037 2,149, 267 Nominal futures exposure long position 23,256 20,853 Concentration of exposure to price risks An analysis of the Groups investment portfolio is shown on page 25.
This shows that the greater geographical weighting is to UK companies, with significant exposure also to North America, Asia and Continental Europe.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of expsoure to those regions, although an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
Price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the value of the shareholders funds to an increase or decrease of 15% in the fair values of the Groups equity investments including exposure through futures contracts.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of market conditions and historical trends.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups equities and equity exposure through options and futures at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
The results of these example calculations are significant but not unreasonable, given that most of the Groups assets are equity investments.

As a consequence, movements in exchange rates affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of the risk The investment managers monitor their exposure to currencies as part of their normal investment processes.
The Board receives a monthly report on the currency exposures of the entire fund.
Annual Report 2017 Witan Investment Trust PLC 81 Other Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Directors Report Strategic Report Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2017 14 Financial instruments continued Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Group does not normally use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Groups monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31 December are shown below.
Where the Groups equity investments which are not monetary items are denominated in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after tax for the year and the Groups equity in regard to the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities and the exchange rates for the US dollar, Euro and Japanese yen.
The results of these example calculations are significant but not unreasonable in the context of the majority of the Groups assets being invested overseas.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: US dollar - 15% 2016: 15% Euro - 15% 2016: 15% Japanese yen - 15% 2016: 15% The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups foreign currency financial instruments held at the balance sheet date and takes account of any forward foreign exchange contracts that offset the effects of changes in currency exchange.

Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions.
The Group holds cash balances, partly to meet payments as they fall due but also when appropriate to offset the long-term borrowings that it has in place.
The Group finances part of its activities through preference shares that do not have redemption dates and through secured bonds and notes that were issued as part of the Companys planned gearing.
Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 December 2017 of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates: when the interest rate is due to be re-set: and fixed interest rates: when the financial instrument is due to be repaid.
The Groups exposure to floating interest rates on assets liabilities is 2,326,000 2016: 20,444,000.
This represents cash holdings minus variable rate borrowing.
The Groups exposure to fixed interest rates on assets is 7,940,000 2016: 29,056,000.
This represents investments in bonds.
The Groups exposure to fixed interest rates on liabilities is 170,365,000 2016: 140,492,000.
This represents fixed rate borrowing.
Annual Report 2017 Witan Investment Trust PLC 83 Other Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Directors Report Strategic Report Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2017 14 Financial instruments continued Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts and loans, is at margin under over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2016: same : the finance charge on the preference shares is at a weighted average interest rate of 3.3% 2016: 3.3% : the finance charge on the secured bonds is at a weighted average interest rate of 6.125% 2016: 6.125% : and the finance charge on the secured notes is at a weighted average interest rate of 3.23% for an average period of 28.1 years 2016: 3.41% for an average period of 25.7 years.
The above year-end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure changes as investments are made in fixed interest securities, long-term debt is partially redeemed and as the level of cash balances varies during the year.
In the context of the Groups balance sheet, the exposure to interest rate risk is not considered to be material.
Interest rate sensitivity Based on the Groups monetary financial instruments at each balance sheet date, an increase or decrease of 200 basis points in interest rates would decrease or increase revenue after tax by 1, 151,000 2016: 656,000, capital return after tax by 1,095,000 2016: 1,065,000, and total profit after tax and shareholders funds by 1 56,000 2016: 409,000.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
This is not representative of the year as a whole, since the exposure changes as investments are made.
In the context of the Groups balance sheet, the outcome is not considered to be material.
14.5 Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Groups assets are investments in quoted equities and other quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Group has borrowed 63,174,000 by its issue in 2000 of 6.125 per cent Secured Bonds due 2025.
During 2015, the Group issued 3.47% and 3.29% secured notes for 54,000,000 and 21,000,000 respectively.
During 2017, the Group issued 2.74% secured notes for 30,000,000.
The Group is able to draw short-term borrowings of up to the sterling equivalent of 125m from its secured and committed multi-currency borrowing facility with BNP Paribas, London Branch expiring 5 December 2018.
73,000,000 was drawn down under the facility at 31 December 2017.
The figures also include the capital to be repaid.
The figures in the More than 5 years columns do not include the ongoing annual finance cost of 83,000.
The Board gives guidance to the investment managers as to the maximum amount of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
The investment managers may hold cash from time to time but the Groups overall equity exposure is unlikely to fall below 80% in normal conditions.
84 Witan Investment Trust PLC Annual Report 2017 14.6 Credit risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Group suffering a loss.
Management of the risk The risk is managed as follows: interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts and loans, is at margin under over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent: transactions involving derivatives are entered into only with investment banks, the credit rating of which is taken into account so as to minimise the risk to the Group of default: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit standard is reviewed periodically by the investment managers, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: stock lending transactions are carried out with a number of approved counterparties, the credit ratings of which are reviewed periodically, and limits are set on the amount that may be sent to any one counterparty.
Other than stock lending, none of the Companys financial assets or liabilities is secured by collateral or other credit enhancements: and cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.
None of the Groups financial liabilities is past its due date or impaired.
Credit risk exposure The table below summarises the credit risk exposure of the Group as at the year end.

Level 1 Financial liabilities The Companys preference shares, debenture stock and secured bonds are actively traded on a recognised stock exchange.
Their fair value has therefore been deemed Level 1.
The carrying values are disclosed in note 13.
Level 3 Financial liabilities The Companys secured notes are not traded on a recognised stock exchange and so the fair value is calculated by using a discount rate which reflects the yield on a UK gilt of similar maturity plus a credit spread of 1.10% 2016: 1.15%.
Their fair value has therefore been deemed Level 3.

Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The valuation techniques used by the Group are explained in the accounting policies in note 1 h. There were no transfers during the year between Level 1 and Level 2.

Level 3 Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurement of financial assets There were no Level 3 investments at 31 December 2017 or 31 December 2016.
Capital management The Groups capital management objectives are: to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern: and to maximise the income and capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate balance of equity capital and debt.
Annual Report 2017 Witan Investment Trust PLC 87 Other Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Directors Report Strategic Report Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2017 14 Financial instruments continued Gearing The Groups policy is to manage the effective gearing in the portfolio to be below 20%, other than temporarily in exceptional circumstances.
Effective gearing is defined as the difference between shareholders funds and the total market value of the investments including the nominal value effective underlying exposure of futures positions which were 23,256,000 long at 31 December 2017 2016: 20,853,000 long expressed as a percentage of shareholders funds.
At 31 December 2017 effective gearing was 9.7% 2016: 10.3% and the calculation is set out below: 2017 2016 000 000 Value of investments per the Balance Sheet 1,884,037 2,149, 267 Add: Nominal exposure of futures 23,256 20,853 Adjusted gross value of investments including futures nominal exposure 2,172, 523 1,904,890 Shareholders funds per the Balance Sheet A 1,980, 521 1,726,637 Excess of gross value of investments over shareholders funds B 19 2,002 178,253 Effective gearing B as a percentage of A 9.7% 10.3% The Board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Groups capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Chief Executive Officers view on the market: the opportunity to buy back equity shares, which takes account of the difference between the net asset value per share and the share price ie: the level of share price discount or premium : and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
The Company is subject to several externally imposed capital requirements: the terms of issue of the Companys secured bonds and notes require the aggregate amount outstanding in respect of borrowings, measured in accordance with the policies used to prepare the annual financial statements, not to exceed a sum equal to the Companys capital and reserves at any time: as a public company, the Company has a minimum issued share capital of 50,000: and in order to be able to pay dividends out of profits available for distribution by way of dividends, the Company has to be able to meet one of the two capital restriction tests imposed on investment companies by company law.
These requirements are unchanged since the previous year end and the Company has complied with them.
All of the shares were placed in treasury.
Shares held in treasury do not carry a right to receive a dividend.
In the event of a poll at a general meeting of the Company, an ordinary shareholder who is present in person or by proxy has one vote for every 1 nominal value of shares registered in their name.
Accordingly, on a poll each ordinary shareholder has one vote for every four shares held.
