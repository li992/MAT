Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2017 Riverstone Energy Limited Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 1.
General information Riverstone Energy Limited is a company limited by shares, which was incorporated on 23 May 2013 in Guernsey with an unlimited life and registered with the GFSC as a Registered Closed-ended Collective Investment Scheme pursuant to the POI Law.
The Companys ordinary shares were admitted to the premium segment of the UK Listing Authoritys Official List and to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange as part of its IPO which completed on 29 October 2013.
The registered office of the Company is Heritage Hall, PO Box 225, Le Marchant Street, St Peter Port, Guernsey, GY1 4HY, Channel Islands.
The Company makes its investments through the Partnership, a Cayman Islands registered exempted limited partnership, in which the Company is the sole limited partner.
The principal place of business of the Partnership is the Cayman Islands.
Both the Company and the Partnership are subject to the Investment Management Agreement with the Investment Manager, a company registered in the Cayman Islands.
The Partnership invests alongside Private Riverstone Funds in all Qualifying Investments in which the Private Riverstone Funds participate.
These funds are managed and advised by affiliates of the Investment Manager.
Further detail of these investments is provided in the Investment Managers Report.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and with the Companies Law.
In the preparation of these Financial Statements, the Company followed the same accounting policies and methods of computation as compared with those applied in the previous year.
The new standards or amendments to existing standards and interpretations, effective from 1 January 2017, did not have a material impact of the Companys Financial Statements.
New and amended standards and interpretations not applied by the Company The following are new and amended standards and interpretations in issue effective from 1 January 2018: New standards IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 Amended standards and interpretations IAS 28 Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures Amendments resulting from the Annual Improvements: 2014-2016 cycle 1 January 2018 IAS 28 Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures Amendments regarding long-term interests in associates and joint ventures 1 January 2019 IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Translations and Advance Consideration 1 January 2018 IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments 1 January 2019 The Company has not early adopted IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 which are effective from 1 January 2018.
The impact of these standards is not expected to be significant as disclosed below: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: replaces IAS 39 - Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement Nature and scope of new or amended pronouncement IFRS 9 introduces a new approach to the classification of financial assets, which is driven by the business model in which the asset is held and their cash flow characteristics.
A new business model was introduced which does allow certain financial assets to be categorised as fair value through other comprehensive income in certain circumstances.
The requirements for financial liabilities are mostly carried forward unchanged from IAS 39.
However, some changes were made to the fair value option for financial liabilities to address the issue of own credit risk.
Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2017 Riverstone Energy Limited Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 2.
Accounting policies continued The new model introduces a single impairment model being applied to all financial instruments, as well as an expected credit loss model for the measurement of financial assets.
IFRS 9 contains a new model for hedge accounting that aligns the accounting treatment with the risk management activities of an entity, in addition enhanced disclosures will provide better information about risk management and the effect of hedge accounting on the Financial Statements.
IFRS 9 carries forward the derecognition requirements of financial assets and liabilities from IAS 39.
Effect on the Financial Statements The standard is effective on or after 1 January 2018 and will be adopted for the year ending 31 December 2018.
The Companys financial instruments, including the investment in the Partnership, will continue to be classified as fair value through profit or loss.
Due to the cash flow characteristics of such financial instruments, on application of IFRS 9, they will continue to be classified as fair value through profit or loss.
Although early adoption is permitted the Company has established that the impact will be immaterial to the Financial Statements.
It is anticipated that this application of IFRS 9 will not change the measurement and presentation of the current financial instruments.
IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers The Company considers that it does not have any material revenue that falls within the scope of IFRS 15 and hence that the implementation of IFRS 15 will not have a material impact on its Financial Statements.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of the Company is U. S. Dollars reflecting the primary economic environment in which the Company operates, that being the exploration and production and midstream energy sectors, where most transactions are expected to take place in U. S. Dollars.
The Company has chosen U. S. Dollars as its presentation currency for financial reporting purposes.
Transactions during the year, including purchases and sales of investments, income and expenses are translated into U. S. Dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than U. S. Dollars are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a currency other than U. S. Dollars are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a currency other than U. S. Dollars are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses on financial instruments classified as at fair value through profit or loss are included in profit or loss in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as part of the Change in fair value of investments through profit or loss.
Exchange differences on other financial instruments are included in profit or loss in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as Foreign exchange loss.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Companys Statement of Financial Position when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are only offset and the net amount reported in the Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Comprehensive Income when there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and the Company intends to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and liability simultaneously.
Riverstone Energy Limited Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 2.
Accounting policies continued Financial assets When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
a Investment at fair value through profit or loss i.
Classification The Company has elected to classify its investment in the Partnership as at fair value through profit or loss.
Measurement Investments made by the Company in the Partnership are measured at fair value.
Fair value estimation A summary of the more relevant aspects of IPEV valuations is set out below: Marketable Listed Securities where an active market exists for the security, the value is stated at the bid price on the last trading day in the period.
Marketability discounts are not generally applied unless there is some contractual, governmental or other legally enforceable restriction preventing realisation at the reporting date.
Unlisted Investments are carried at such fair value as the Investment Manager considers appropriate, and as approved or adjusted by the Board, taking into account the performance of each investee company and the exercise of ratchets, options or other incentive schemes.
Methodologies used in arriving at the fair value include prices of recent investment, earnings multiples, net assets, discounted cash flows analysis and industry valuation benchmarks.
Valuations may be derived by reference to observable valuation measures for comparable companies or transactions examples include discount rates, forward oil prices, production multiples and multiplying a key performance metric of the investee company such as EBITDA by a relevant valuation multiple observed in the range of comparable companies or transactions, adjusted for differences between the investment and the referenced comparable.
Privately held investments may also be valued at cost for a period of time not exceeding one year after an acquisition as the best indicator of fair value.
The Company has determined that the fair value of its investment in the Partnership is $1,742 million 31 December 2016: $1,695 million and is calculated in accordance with applicable IFRS accounting standards and IPEV Valuation Guidelines.
b Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
A financial asset is derecognised in whole or in part either: when the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership: or when it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards and when it no longer has control over the assets or a portion of the asset: or when the contractual right to receive cash flow has expired.
Accounting policies continued Equity The Companys Ordinary Shares are classified as equity and upon issuance, the fair value of the consideration received is included in equity, net of share issue costs excluding share issue costs of the IPO.
All formation and initial expenses of the Company, including the share issue costs of its IPO, which are otherwise chargeable to equity, have been borne by the Investment Manager.
In the event that the Investment Management Agreement terminates, the Company would become liable for those costs.
For further details please see Note 9.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
Finance income Interest income is recognised on a time apportioned basis using the effective interest method.
Expenses Expenses include legal, accounting, auditing and other operating expenses.
They are recognised on an accruals basis in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they are incurred.
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Judgements In the process of applying the Companys accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements: Assessment as an Investment Entity The Company meets the definition of an investment entity on the basis of the following criteria: 1. the Company obtains funds from multiple investors for the purpose of providing those investors with investment management services: 2. the Company commits to its investors that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income, or both: and 3. the Company measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis.
To determine that the Company meets the definition of an investment entity, further consideration is given to the characteristics of an investment entity that are demonstrated by the Company.
Assessment of control over the Partnership The Company makes its investments through the Partnership in which it is the sole limited partner.
The Board has assessed whether the Company has all the elements of control as prescribed by IFRS 10 in relation to the Companys investment in the Partnership and has concluded that although the Company is the sole limited partner, it does not control the Partnership but instead has significant influence and therefore accounts for the Partnership as an investment in associate at fair value in accordance with IAS 28.
Assessment of the Partnership as a structured entity The Company considers the Partnership to be a structured entity under IFRS 12.
Transfer of funds by the Partnership to the Company is determined by the General Partner see Note 10.
The risks associated with the Companys investment in the Partnership are disclosed in Note 11.
The summarised financial information for the Companys investment in the Partnership is disclosed in Note 6.
Riverstone Energy Limited Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 3.
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions continued Going concern The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered budgeted and projected results of the business, including projected cash flows, and the risks that could impact the Companys liquidity over the next 12 months from the date of approval of the Financial Statements.
Estimates and assumptions The area involving a high degree of judgement or complexity and where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Financial Statements has been identified as the risk of misstatement of the valuation of the investment in the Partnership see Note 5.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The Boards determination that no discount or premium should be applied to the net asset value of the Partnership involves a degree of judgement due to the nature of the Partnerships investments and other assets and liabilities see Note 2: Financial assets a iii.
and the valuation techniques and procedures adopted by the Partnership.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Taxation The Company has made an election to, and currently expects to conduct its activities so as to be treated as a partnership for U. S. federal income tax purposes.
Therefore, the Company expects that it generally will not be liable for U. S. federal income taxes.
In the normal course of business, REL may form wholly owned subsidiaries, to be treated as C Corporations for U. S. tax purposes.
The C Corporations serve to protect RELs public investors from incurring U. S. ECI.
The C Corporations file U. S. corporate tax returns with the U. S. IRS and pay U. S. corporate taxes on its income.
Each of the Companys Shareholders who are liable for U. S. taxes will take into account its respective share of the Companys items of income, gain, loss and deduction in computing its U. S. federal income tax liability as if such Shareholder had earned such income directly, even if no cash distributions are made to the Shareholder.
The Company is exempt from taxation in Guernsey under the provisions of the Income Tax Exempt Bodies Guernsey Ordinance, 2008 and is charged an annual exemption fee of 1,200.
The Cayman Islands at present impose no taxes on profit, income, capital gains or appreciations in value of the Partnership.
There are also currently no taxes imposed in the Cayman Islands by withholding or otherwise on the Company as a limited partner of the Partnership on profit, income, capital gains or appreciations in respect of its partnership interest nor any taxes on the Company as a limited partner of the Partnership in the nature of estate duty, inheritance or capital transfer tax.
Local taxes may apply at the jurisdictional level on profits arising in operating entity investments.
Further taxes may apply on distributions from such operating entity investments.
The company is structured, and has structured its investments, to eliminate the incurrence of ECI by RELs investors.
Based upon the current commitments and investments in Liberty II, Eagle II, Rock Oil, Fieldwood, Castex 2014, Castex 2005, Three Rivers III, Carrier II, ILX III, and Centennial, the future U. S. tax liability on profits is expected to be in the range of 21 to 27.5 per cent.
The decrease in the Partnerships provision for taxation year over year see Note 6 is due primarily to the reduction in the U. S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 per cent.
as well as a decrease in the fair value of the Partnerships U. S. -based investments.
Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2017 Riverstone Energy Limited Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 5.
Fair value IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement requires disclosure of fair value measurement by level.
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the financial assets or financial liabilities are categorised is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement, adjusted if necessary.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety into only one of the three levels.
Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : Level 3 inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The Companys only financial instrument carried at fair value is its investment in the Partnership which has been classified within Level 3 as it is derived using unobservable inputs.
Amounts classified under Level 3 for the year ended 31 December 2017 were $1,742 million 31 December 2016: $1,695 million.
The fair value of all other financial instruments approximates to their carrying value.
Transfers during the period There have been no transfers between levels during the year ended 31 December 2017.
Any transfers between the levels will be accounted for on the last day of each financial period.
Due to the nature of the investment in the Partnership, it is always expected to be classified under Level 3.
Valuation methodology and process The Directors base the fair value of the investment in the Partnership on the value of its limited partnership capital account received from the General Partner, which is determined on the basis of the fair value of its assets and liabilities, adjusted if necessary, to reflect liquidity, future commitments, and other specific factors of the Partnership and Investment Manager.
This is based on the components within the Partnership, principally the value of the Partnerships investments in addition to cash and short-term money market fixed deposits.
Any fluctuation in the value of the Partnerships investments in addition to cash and short-term money market fixed deposits held will directly impact on the value of the Companys investment in the Partnership.
The Partnerships investments are valued using the techniques described in the Companys valuation policy.
The Investment Managers assessment of fair value of investments held by the Partnership, through Investment Undertakings, is determined in accordance with IPEV Valuation Guidelines.
When valuing the Partnerships investments, the Investment Manager reviews information provided by the underlying investee companies and other business partners and applies IPEV methodologies, to estimate a fair value as at the date of the Statement of Financial Position, subject to Board approval.
It is the opinion of the Directors, that the IPEV valuation methodology used in deriving a fair value is generally not different from the fair value requirements of IFRS 13.
In the event that there is a difference, the requirements of IFRS 13 override the IPEV requirements.
Initially, acquisitions are valued at the price of recent investment.
Subsequently, and as appropriate, the Investment Manager values the investments on a quarterly basis using common industry valuation techniques, including comparable public market valuation, comparable merger and acquisition transaction valuation and discounted cash flow valuation.
For early stage private investments, Riverstones investment due diligence process includes assumptions about short-term financial results in determining the appropriate purchase price for the investment.
The techniques used in determining the fair value of the Companys investments through the Partnership are selected on an investment by investment basis so as to maximise the use of market based observable inputs.
RELs valuation policy is compliant with both IFRS and IPEV Valuation Guidelines and is applied consistently from period to period.
As the Companys investments are generally not publicly quoted, valuations require meaningful judgment to establish a range of values, and the ultimate value at which an investment is realised may differ from its most recent valuation and the difference may be significant.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the valuations of the Companys investments, through the Partnership, are detailed in the Investment Managers Report.

The Board reviews and considers the fair value of each of the Partnerships investments arrived at by the Investment Manager before incorporating such values into the fair value of the Partnership.
The variety of valuation bases adopted, quality of management information provided by the underlying investee companies and the lack of liquid markets for the investments mean that there are inherent difficulties in determining the fair value of these investments and such difficulties cannot be eliminated.
Therefore the amounts realised on the sale of investments may differ from the fair values reflected in these Financial Statements and the differences may be significant.
The Board approves the valuations performed by the Investment Manager and monitors the range of reasonably possible changes in significant observable inputs on a regular basis.
The Directors have considered whether a discount or premium should be applied to the net asset value of the Partnership.
In view of the investment in the Partnership and the nature of the Partnerships assets, no adjustment to the net asset value of the Partnership has been deemed to be necessary see Note 3.

Investment at fair value through profit or loss The movement in fair value is derived from the fair value movements in the underlying investments held by the Partnership, net of income and expenses of the Partnership and its related Investment Undertakings, including any Performance Allocation and applicable taxes.
REL US Centennial Holdings, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership, has borrowed $100 million under the terms of the Margin Loan Agreement to finance the Companys additional investment in Centennial, through the Partnership.
The Margin Loan Agreement, dated 27 December 2016, is for a term of 18 months to 27 June 2018 and has an annual interest rate cost of 3 month LIBOR plus 3.25 per cent.. A security interest has been granted by REL US Centennial Holdings, LLC over the shares in Centennial, as collateral for any amounts which may become due under the Margin Loan Agreement.
As at 31 December 2017, there is no going concern issue regarding the Partnerships ability to repay the Margin Loan by utilising cash on hand and or proceeds from a partial sale of the shares in Centennial.

Financial risk management Financial risk management objectives The Companys investing activities, through its investment in the Partnership, intentionally expose it to various types of risks that are associated with the underlying investee companies of the Partnership.
The Company makes the investment in order to generate returns in accordance with its investment policy and objectives.
The most important types of financial risks to which the Company is exposed are market risk including price, interest rate and foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the determination of the Companys risk management and sets policy to manage that risk at an acceptable level to achieve those objectives.
The policy and process for measuring and mitigating each of the main risks are described below.
The Investment Manager and the Administrator provide advice to the Company which allows it to monitor and manage financial risks relating to its operations through internal risk reports which analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks.
The Investment Manager and the Administrator report to the Board on a quarterly basis.
Categories of financial instruments 31 December 31 December 2017 2016 $000 $000 Financial assets Investment at fair value through profit or loss: Investment in the Partnership 1,742,457 1,695,406 Loans and receivables: Cash and cash equivalents 789 3,230 Trade and other receivables 545 545 Financial liabilities Financial liabilities: Trade and other payables 612 623 Capital risk management The Company manages its capital to ensure that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the capital return to Shareholders.
The capital structure of the Company consists of issued share capital and retained earnings, as stated in the Statement of Financial Position.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may buy back shares or issue new shares.
There are no external capital requirements imposed on the Company.
During the year ended 31 December 2017 and 2016, the Company itself had no borrowings.
However, as disclosed in Note 6, REL US Centennial Holdings, LLC has borrowed $100 million under the terms of the Margin Loan Agreement.
The Companys investment policy is set out in the Investment Policy section of the Annual Report.
Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2017 Riverstone Energy Limited Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 11.
Financial risk management continued Market risk Market risk includes price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
a Price risk The underlying investments held by the Partnership present a potential risk of loss of capital to the Partnership and hence to the Company.
The Company invests through the Partnership.
Price risk arises from uncertainty about future prices of underlying financial investments held by the Partnership, which at year end was $1,886,673 31 December 2016: $1,785,325.
The Partnership is exposed to a variety of risks which may have an impact on the carrying value of the Companys investment in the Partnership.
The Partnerships risk factors are set out in a i to a iii below.
i Not actively traded The Partnerships investments are not generally traded in an active market but are indirectly exposed to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of the investments held.
The underlying investments of the Partnership vary as to industry sub-sector, geographic distribution of operations and size, all of which may impact the susceptibility of their valuation to uncertainty.
Although the investments are in the same industry, this risk is managed through careful selection of investments within the specified limits of the investment policy.
The investments are monitored on a regular basis by the Investment Manager.
ii Concentration The Company, through the Partnership, invests in the global energy sector, with a particular focus on businesses that engage in oil and gas exploration and production and midstream investments in that sector.
This means that the Company is exposed to the concentration risk of only making investments in the global energy sector, which concentration risk may further relate to sub-sector, geography, and the relative size of an investment or other factors.
Whilst the Company is subject to the investment and diversification restrictions in its investment policy, within those limits, material concentrations of investments have arisen.
The Board and the Investment Manager monitor the concentration of the investment in the Partnership on a quarterly basis to ensure compliance with the investment policy.
iii Liquidity The Companys underlying investments through the Partnership are dynamic in nature.
The Partnership will maintain flexibility in funding by keeping sufficient liquidity in cash and cash equivalents which may be invested on a temporary basis in line with the cash management policy as agreed by the Board from time to time.
As at 31 December 2017, $147 million or 8.4 per cent.
of the Partnerships financial assets, including those held by its wholly-owned subsidiaries, REL US Corp and REL US Centennial Holdings, LLC, were money market fixed deposits and cash balances held on deposit with several, A or higher rated, banks.
All of these assets have maturities of less than one year.
Riverstone Energy Limited Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 11.
Financial risk management continued b Foreign currency risk The Company has exposure to foreign currency risk due to the payment of some expenses in Pounds Sterling.
Consequently, the Company is exposed to risks that the exchange rate of its currency relative to other foreign currencies may change in a manner that has an adverse effect on the value of that portion of the Companys assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U. S. Dollar.
The following tables sets out, in U. S. Dollars, the Companys total exposure to foreign currency risk and the net exposure to foreign currencies of the monetary assets and liabilities: $ Total As at 31 December 2017 $000 $000 $000 $000 Assets Non-current assets 1 Investment in the Partnership 1,742,457 1,742,457 Total non-current assets 1,742,457 1,742,457 Current assets Trade and other receivables 545 545 Cash and cash equivalents 667 122 789 Total current assets 1,212 122 1,334 Current liabilities Trade and other payables 128 454 30 612 Total current liabilities 128 454 30 612 Total net assets 1,743,541 332 30 1,743,179 $ Total As at 31 December 2016 $000 $000 $000 $000 Assets Non-current assets 1 Investment in the Partnership 1,695,406 1,695,406 Total non-current assets 1,695,406 1,695,406 Current assets Trade and other receivables 545 545 Cash and cash equivalents 1,801 1,429 3,230 Total current assets 2,346 1,429 3,775 Current liabilities Trade and other payables 215 408 623 Total current liabilities 215 408 623 Total net assets 1,697,537 1,021 1,698,558 The Directors do not consider that the foreign currency exchange risk at the balance sheet date is significant or material and therefore sensitivity analysis for the foreign currency risk has not been provided.
1 Includes the fair value of two investments, Hammerhead and CNOR, denominated in CAD and therefore subject to foreign currency risk.
These two investments had an aggregate fair value of $621.5 million as at 31 December 2017 31 December 2016: $520.8 million.
Financial risk management continued c Interest Rate Risk The Companys exposure to interest rate risk relates to the Companys cash and cash equivalents held through the Partnership and the Margin Loan held through REL US Centennial Holdings, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership see Note 6.
The Company is subject to risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.
Any excess cash and cash equivalents are invested at short-term market interest rates.
As at the date of the Statement of Financial Position, the majority of the Companys cash and cash equivalents were held on interest bearing fixed deposit accounts at the Partnership.
The Company has no other interest-bearing assets or liabilities as at the reporting date.
As a consequence, the Company is only exposed to variable market interest rate risk.
Management does not expect any significant change in interest rates that would have a material impact on the financial performance of the Company in the near future, therefore sensitivity analysis for the interest rate risk has not been provided.
31 December 31 December 2017 2016 $000 $000 Non-interest bearing Cash and cash equivalents 789 3,230 Liquidity risk Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors.
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company may not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
The Company adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management and through the preparation of budgets and cash flow forecasts maintains sufficient cash reserves to meet its obligations.
The Company received distributions of $5.5 million and $1.1 million from the Partnership in Q1 2016 and Q1 2017, respectively, to meet its forecasted liabilities.
In accordance with section 4.1 a of the Partnership Agreement, in the event of the Company requiring additional funds for working capital, it is entitled to receive another distribution from the Partnership.
Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Company.
The carrying value of the investment in the Partnership as at 31 December 2017 was $1,742 million 31 December 2016: $1,695 million.
Financial assets mainly consist of cash and cash equivalents and investments at fair value through profit or loss.
The Companys risk on liquid funds is reduced because it can only deposit monies with institutions with a minimum credit rating of single A.
The Company mitigates its credit risk exposure on its investment at fair value through profit or loss by the exercise of due diligence on the counterparties of the Partnership, its General Partner and the Investment Manager.
The table below shows the material cash balances and the credit rating for the counterparties used at the year end date: 31 December 31 December 2017 2016 Counterparty Location Rating $000 $000 ABN Amro Guernsey Limited Guernsey A 789 3,230 Riverstone Energy Limited Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 11.
Financial risk management continued The Companys maximum exposure to loss of capital at the year end is shown below: Carrying Value and Maximum exposure 31 December 2017 $000 Investment at fair value through profit or loss: Investment in the Partnership 1,742,457 Loans and receivables including cash and cash equivalents but excluding prepayments 789 Carrying Value and Maximum exposure 31 December 2016 $000 Investment at fair value through profit or loss: Investment in the Partnership 1,695,406 Loans and receivables including cash and cash equivalents but excluding prepayments 3,230 Gearing As at the date of these Financial Statements the Company itself has no gearing: however, the Partnership had approximately $11 million of letter of credit outstanding as part of a $200 million line of credit agreement and REL US Centennial Holdings, LLC has borrowed $100 million under the terms of the Margin Loan Agreement.
The Company may have additional indirect gearing through the operations of the underlying investee companies.
Segmental reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board of Directors, as a whole.
The key measure of performance used by the Board to assess the Companys performance and to allocate resources is the Total Return on the Companys Net Asset Value, and therefore no reconciliation is required between the measure of profit or loss used by the Board and that contained in the Financial Statements.
For management purposes, the Company is organised into one main operating segment, which invests in one limited partnership.
All of the Companys income is derived from within Guernsey and the Cayman Islands.
All of the Companys non-current assets are located in the Cayman Islands.
Due to the Companys nature, it has no customers.

Subsequent Events In February 2018, REL announced the sale of Three Rivers III.
Under the terms of the transaction, the Companys investment, through the Partnership, will realise gross cash proceeds of approximately $205 million, representing 1 1 a Gross MOIC of 2.2x Net MOIC of 1.9x on the $94 million investment and a Gross IRR of 49 per cent.
This represents a gross profit of $111 million, which will be subject to a performance fee upon closing of the sale, which is expected to occur in April 2018 and is subject to customary closing conditions.
The realised gain from this transaction was fully offset by net operating losses from prior years, with the tax effect of the transaction fully reflected in the tax component of the valuation of the Companys investment in the Partnership, resulting in no tax due.
In February 2018, Fieldwood filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
The Chapter 11 plan of reorganisation encompasses a comprehensive restructuring of the companys balance sheet through reducing current debt by approximately $1.6 billion and raising capital of approximately $525 million through an equity rights offering.
In addition, Fieldwood is expected to acquire the deepwater Gulf of Mexico oil and gas assets of Noble Energy, Inc. which complement and enhance the companys existing asset base and operations.
The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018, subject to court approval.
The effects of both transactions are fully reflected in the valuation of the Companys investment in the Partnership at the year end.

carried interest on gross profits without a hurdle rate.
Since there is no netting of losses against gains, the effective carried interest rate on the portfolio as a whole will be greater than 20 per cent..
In addition, there is a management fee of 1.5 per cent.
of net assets per annum and other expenses.
Given these costs, fees and expenses are in aggregate expected to be considerable, Net MOIC and Net IRR will be materially less than the Gross MOIC and Gross IRR.
Local taxes, primarily on U. S. assets, may apply at the jurisdictional level on profits arising in operating entity investments.
Further withholding taxes may apply on distributions from such operating entity investments.
In the normal course of business, REL may form wholly-owned subsidiaries, to be treated as C Corporations for U. S. tax purposes.
The C Corporations file U. S. corporate tax returns with the U. S. IRS and pay U. S. corporate taxes on its taxable income
