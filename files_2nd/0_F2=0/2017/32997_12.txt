General information The Renewables Infrastructure Group Limited TRIG or the Company is a closed ended investment company incorporated in Guernsey under Section 20 of the Companies Guernsey Law, 2008.
The shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange under a premium listing.
Through its subsidiaries, The Renewables Infrastructure Group UK Limited TRIG UK, and The Renewables Infrastructure Group UK Investments Limited TRIG UK I, TRIG invests in operational renewable energy generation projects, predominantly in onshore wind and solar PV segments, across the UK and Northern Europe.
The Company, TRIG UK and its portfolio of investments are known as the Group.
These financial statements are for the year ended 31 December 2017 and comprise only the results of the Company as all of its subsidiaries are measured at fair value as explained below in Note 2 a.
Key accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 19 February 2018.
The financial statements, which give a true and fair view, have been prepared in compliance with the Companies Guernsey Law, 2008 and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU using the historical cost basis, except that the financial instruments classied at fair value through profit or loss are stated at their fair values.
All accounting policies have been applied consistently in these financial statements.
The financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional currency.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in this note.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the EU requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Note 3 shows critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions.
b Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report and also commented on in the Viability Statement contained in the Directors Report on page 56.
The financial position of the Group, its cash ows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Results on pages 33 to 39.
In addition, Notes 1 to 4 of the financial statements include the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has a range of long-term contracts with various major UK and European utilities and well-established suppliers across a range of infrastructure projects.
In addition, the Company maintains a prudent level of leverage, limited to 30% of portfolio value, and the Groups project-level nancing, limited to 50% of Gross Portfolio Value, is non-recourse to the Company.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
c Basis of consolidation The Company applies IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, and as an investment entity is required to measure all of its subsidiaries at fair value.
The financial statements therefore comprise the results of the Company only.
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company.
The Company has control of an investee, when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee as dened in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Directors believe it is appropriate and relevant to the investor to account for the investment portfolio at fair value, where consolidating it would not be.

Key accounting policies continued The Companys subsidiaries, TRIG UK and TRIG UK I, carry out investment activities and incur overheads and borrowings on behalf of the Group.
The Directors therefore provide an alternative presentation of the Companys results in the Strategic Report on pages 33 to 37 prepared under the Expanded basis, which includes the consolidation of TRIG UK and TRIG UK I.
An entity shall consider all facts and circumstances when assessing whether it is an investment entity, including its purpose and design.
Under the denition of an investment entity, as set out in paragraph 27 in the standard, the entity must satisfy all three of the following tests: I.
Obtains funds from one or more investors for the purpose of providing those investors with investment management services: and II.
Commits to its investors that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income, or both including having an exit strategy for investments : and III.
Measure and evaluate the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis.
Being investment entities, TRIG UK and TRIG UK I are measured at fair value as opposed to being consolidated on a lineby-line basis, meaning its cash, debt and working capital balances are included in the fair value of investments rather than the Groups current assets.
The Directors are of the opinion that the Company has all the typical characteristics of an investment entity and meets the denition in the standard.
d Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash ows from the instrument expire or the asset is transferred and the transfer qualies for derecognition in accordance with IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement.
Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value including directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described below.
Investments in equity and debt securities Investments in the equity and loanstock of entities engaged in renewable energy activities are designated at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group manages these investments and makes purchase and sale decisions based on their fair value.
The initial difference between the transaction price and the fair value, derived from using the discounted cash ows methodology at the date of acquisition, is recognised only when observable market data indicates there is a change in a factor that market participants would consider in setting the price of that investment.
After initial recognition, investments at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement.
The Directors consider the equity and loanstock to share the same investment characteristics and risks and they are therefore treated as a single unit of account for valuation purposes and a single class for disclosure purposes.
e Impairment Financial assets Financial assets, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash ows of that asset.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount, and the present value of the estimated future cash ows discounted at the original effective interest rate.
significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis.
The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics.
All impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
For financial assets measured at amortised cost the reversal is recognised in the income statement.

Key accounting policies continued f Share capital and share premium Ordinary Shares are classied as equity.
Costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or associated with the establishment of the Company that would otherwise have been avoided are written off against the value of the ordinary share premium.
g Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances, deposits held on call with banks and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash ow statement.
h Investment income Income from investments relates solely to returns from the Companys subsidiaries, TRIG UK and TRIG UK I.
This is recognised when the right to receive interest income is determined on an accruals basis and dividends when these are received.
i Income tax Under the current system of taxation in Guernsey, the Company is exempt from paying taxes on non-Guernsey source, profits or capitalgains.
j Foreign exchange gains and losses Transactions entered into by the Company in a currency other than its functional currency are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in the income statement.
k Segmental reporting The Chief Operating Decision Maker the CODM is of the opinion that the Group is engaged in a single segment of business, being investment in renewable infrastructure to generate investment returns while preserving capital.
The financial information used by the CODM to allocate resources and manage the Group presents the business as a single segment comprising a homogeneous portfolio.
l Fund expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
The Companys investment management and administration fees refer to Note 7, finance costs and all other expenses are charged through the income statement.
m Acquisition costs In line with IFRS 3 Revised, acquisition costs are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
n Dividends Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends, this is when they are paid.
For scrip dividends, where the Company issues shares with an equal value to the cash dividend amount as an alternative to the cash dividend, a credit to equity is recognised when the shares are issued.
o Statement of compliance Pursuant to the Protection of Investors Bailiwick of Guernsey Law, 1987 the Company is a Registered Closed-Ended Investment Scheme.
As an authorised scheme, the Company is subject to certain ongoing obligations to the Guernsey Financial Services Commission and meets its compliance requirements.
p Share-based payments Equity-settled share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees are measured at the fair value of the goods or services received, except where the fair value cannot be estimated reliably, in which case they are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at that date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders the service.
q New and revised standards At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, The Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective from 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and the related clarifications effective from 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases effective from 1 January 2019 TRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017 83 248194 Renewable R&A pp081-imp.
qxp Layout 1 2 19 18 9:49 PM Page 84 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2017 2.
Key accounting policies continued The directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company on future periods, as outlined below: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 replaces the classication and measurement models for financial instruments in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement with three classication categories: amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss and fair value through other comprehensive income.
Due to the Companys limited use of complex financial instruments, IFRS 9 is not expected to have a material impact on its reported results.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers IFRS 15 establishes a single, principles-based revenue recognition model to be applied to all contracts with customers.
Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benets from the good or service.
IFRS 15 replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations.
New disclosure requirements are also introduced.
The majority of the Companys revenue is derived from fair valuation movements on investments and interest income which are both not within the scope of IFRS 15.
As a result, it is not anticipated that the new standard will have a material impact on the Companys reported results.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 Leases and requires all operating leases in excess of one year, where the Company is the lessee, to be included on the Companys balance sheet, and recognise a right-of-use asset and a related lease liability representing the obligation to make lease payments.
The right-of-use asset will be assessed for impairment annually incorporating any onerous lease assessments and amortised on a straight-line basis, with the lease liability being amortised using the effective interest method.
Lessor accounting is unchanged from previous guidance.
As the Company itself does not have any leases it is not anticipated that the new standard will have a material impact on the Companys reported results.
The change in accounting treatment for the leases in the subsidiaries is not expected to have a significant cash impact over time and therefore does not impact the overall valuation of the Companys investment in the subsidiaries.
Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect reported amounts.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period are outlined below.
Key source of estimation uncertainty: Investments at fair value through profit or loss IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures about fair value measurements.
Fair value is dened as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The Board base the fair value of the investments on information received from the Investment Manager.
Fair value is calculated on a discounted cash ow basis.
Fair values for those investments for which a market quote is not available, in this instance being all investments, are determined using the income approach, which discounts the expected cash ows at the appropriate rate.
In determining the discount rate, regard is had to relevant long-term government bond yields, specic risks associated with the technology on-shore wind and solar and geographic location of the underlying investment, and the evidence of recent transactions.
The investments at fair value through profit or loss, whose fair values include the use of level 3 inputs, are valued by discounting future cash ows from investments in both equity dividends and equity redemptions and subordinated loans interest and repayments to the Group at an appropriate discount rate.
The weighted average discount rate applied in the December 2017 valuation was 8.0% 2016: 8.4%.
The discount rate is considered one of the most significant unobservable inputs through which an increase or decrease would have a material impact on the fair value of the investments at fair value through profit or loss.
The other material impacts on the measurement of fair value are the forward looking power price curve and energy yields which are further discussed in Note 4 under sensitivities.
By virtue of the Companys status as an investment fund, and in conjunction IFRS 10 for investment entities, investments are designated upon initial recognition to be accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
The Directors consider that the carrying value amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statement are approximately equal to their fair values.

Financial instruments Financial risk management The objective of the Groups financial risk management is to manage and control the risk exposures of its investment portfolio.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for overseeing the management of financial risks, however the review and management of financial risks are delegated to the Investment Manager, which has documented procedures designed to identify, monitor and manage the financial risks to which the Group is exposed.
Note 4 presents information about the Groups exposure to financial risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing risk and the Groups management of its financial resources.
Through its subsidiaries, TRIG UK and TRIG UK I, the Company invests in a portfolio of investments predominantly in the subordinated loanstock and ordinary equity of project finance companies.
These companies are structured at the outset to minimise financial risks where possible, and the Investment Manager primarily focuses their risk management on the direct financial risks of acquiring and holding the portfolio but continues to monitor the indirect financial risks of the underlying projects through representation, where appropriate, on the Boards of the project companies, and the receipt of regular financial and operational performance reports.
Interest rate risk The Group invests in subordinated loanstock of project companies, usually with xed interest rate coupons.
The portfolios cash ows are continually monitored and forecasted, both over the near future and the long-term, to analyse the cash ow returns from investments.
The Group may use borrowings to finance the acquisition of investments and the forecasts are used to monitor the impact of changes in borrowing rates against cash ow returns from investments as increases in borrowing rates will reduce net interest margins.
The Groups policy is to ensure that interest rates are sufciently hedged to protect the Groups net interest margins from significant uctuations when entering into material medium long-term borrowings.
This includes engaging in interest rate swaps or other interest rate derivative contracts.
The Company has an indirect exposure to changes in interest rates through its investment in project companies, many of which are nanced by senior debt.
Senior debt nancing of project companies is generally either through oating rate debt, xed rate bonds or index linked bonds.
Where senior debt is oating rate, the projects typically have similar length hedging arrangements in place, which are monitored by the project companies managers, finance parties and boards of directors.
Ination risk The Groups project companies are generally structured so that contractual income and costs are either wholly or partially linked to specic ination, where possible, to minimise the risks of mismatch between income and costs due to movements in ination indexes.
The Groups overall cash ows vary with ination, although they are not directly correlated as not all ows are indexed.
The effects of these ination changes do not always immediately ow through to the Groups cash ows, particularly where a projects loanstock debt carries a xed coupon and the ination changes ow through by way of changes to dividends in future periods.
The sensitivity of the portfolio valuation is shown further on in Note 4.
Market risk Returns from the Groups investments are affected by the price at which the investments are acquired.
The value of these investments will be a function of the discounted value of their expected future cash ows, and as such will vary with, inter alia, movements in interest rates, market prices and the competition for such assets.
Currency risk The projects, in which the Group invests, all conduct their business and pay interest, dividends and principal in sterling, with the exception of the euro-denominated investments which at 31 December 2017 comprised 13% 2016: 15% of the portfolio by value.
The sensitivity of the portfolio valuation is shown in this note.
The Group monitors its foreign exchange exposures using its near-term and long-term cash ow forecasts.
Its policy is to use foreign exchange hedging to provide protection to the level of sterling distributions that the Company aims to pay over the medium-term, where considered appropriate.
This may involve the use of forward exchange.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty of the Group will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Group.

qxp Layout 1 2 19 18 9:49 PM Page 86 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2017 4.
Financial instruments continued The credit standing of subcontractors is reviewed, and the risk of default estimated for each significant counterparty position.
Monitoring is on-going, and period end positions are reported to the Board on a quarterly basis.
The Groups largest credit risk exposure to a project at 31 December 2017 was to the Garreg Lwyd project, representing 10% 2016:Crystal Rig II project, representing 11% of the portfolio by value, and the largest subcontractor counterparty risk exposure was to Siemens who provided turbine maintenance services in respect of 41% 2016: Siemens 45% of the portfolio byvalue.
The Groups investments enter into Power Price Agreements PPA with a range of providers through which electricity is sold.
The largest PPA provider to the portfolio at 31 December 2017 was Statkraft who provided PPAs to projects in respect of 24% 2016: EDF 25% of the portfolio by value.
At 31 December 2017, there were no loans and other receivables considered impaired for the Company or the Group.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk over financial assets is the carrying value of those assets in the balance sheet.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to meets its liabilities when due.
The Group ensures it maintains adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash ows and matching the maturity proles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups investments are predominantly funded by share capital and medium-term debt funding.
The Groups investments are generally in private companies, in which there is no listed market and therefore such investment would take time to realise, and there is no assurance that the valuations placed on the investments would be achieved from any such sale process.
The Groups investments have borrowings which rank senior and have priority over the Groups own investments into the companies.
This senior debt is structured such that, under normal operating conditions, it will be repaid within the expected life of the projects.
Debt raised by the investment companies from third parties is without recourse to the Group.
At 31 December 2017, the Company itself did not have any outstanding debt.
The Groups revolving acquisition facility, which was 106.4m drawn at 31 December 2017, is held by TRIG UK and TRIG UK I, is guaranteed by the Company.
The facility is in place until September 2019.
Capital management TRIG UK, the Companys subsidiary, entered into an 80m revolving acquisition facility on 20 February 2014, which was extended to 120m on 3 February 2015 and further to 150m on 25 June 2015.
The facility was renewed on 23 April 2016 and was 106.4m drawn at 31 December 2017 2016: nil.
The Facility was further extended to 240m on 16 January 2018.
The Group makes prudent use of its leverage.
Under the investment policy, borrowings, including any financial guarantees to support outstanding subscription obligations but excluding internal Group borrowings of the Groups underlying investments, are limited to 30% of the portfolio value.
In order to assist in the narrowing of any discount to the Net Asset Value at which the Ordinary Shares may trade, from time to time the Company may at the sole discretion of the Directors: make market purchases of up to 14.99% per annum of its issued Ordinary Shares: and make tender offers for the Ordinary Shares.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Fair value estimation The following summarises the significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: Non-derivative financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
86 TRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017 248194 Renewable R&A pp081-imp.
Financial instruments continued The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques.
The Group uses the income approach, which discounts the expected cash ows attributable to each asset at an appropriate rate to arrive at fair values.
In determining the discount rate, regard is had to relevant long-term government bond yields, the specic risks of each investment and the evidence of recent transactions.
Derivative financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments inputs other than quoted prices traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price.
Note 2 discloses the methods used in determining fair values on a specic asset liability basis.
Where applicable, further information about the assumptions used in determining fair value is disclosed in the notes specic to that asset orliability.

Other financial assets liabilities represent the fair value of foreign exchange forward agreements in place at the year end.
Fair value hierarchy The fair value hierarchy is dened as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

Level 2 Valuation methodology Fair value is based on price quotations from financial institutions active in the relevant market.
The key inputs to the discounted cash ow methodology used to derive fair value include foreign currency exchange rates and foreign currency forward curves.
Valuations are performed on a six monthly basis every June and December for all financial assets and all financial liabilities.
Level 3 Valuation methodology The Investment Manager has carried out fair market valuations of the investments as at 31 December 2017 and the Directors have satisfied themselves as to the methodology used, the discount rates and key assumptions applied, and the valuation.
All investments are at fair value through profit or loss and are valued using a discounted cash ow methodology.
