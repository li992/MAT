Scottish Mortgage discount premium after deducting borrowings at NAV fair return fair value Share price return Scottish Mortgage discount premium after deducting borrowings at par The discount premium is the difference between Scottish Mortgages quoted share price and its underlying net asset value calculated on one of two bases: Borrowings are either deducted at par redemption value or at fair value the current market worth.
As borrowings have a current market value above par, the effect of valuing the borrowings at fair value reduces both the NAV and any resultant discount but increases any resultant premium.
Past performance is not a guide to future performance.
