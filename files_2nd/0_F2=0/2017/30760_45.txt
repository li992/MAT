There was no impairment of goodwill in 2016.
Impairment tests on goodwill were conducted as described in note 16 b. b Goodwill allocation and impairment testing A summary of the goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives allocated to groups of cash generating units is presented below.

The recoverable amount is the value in use of the cash generating unit unless otherwise stated.
In 2017, following the classification of the Groups two businesses in Italy, its remaining life insurance businesses in Spain, and FPI in Asia as held for sale see note 3 c, the Group measured the recoverable amount of those business units at their estimated fair value less costs to sell.
Long-term business Following the cessation of full MCEV reporting from 1 January 2016, value in use has been calculated based on a shareholder value of the business calculated in accordance with Solvency II principles, adjusted where Solvency II does not represent a best estimate of shareholders interests.
The principal adjustments relate to the exclusion of the benefit of transitional measures on technical provisions and the volatility adjustment under Solvency II, modification of the Solvency II risk margin to an economic view and removal of restrictions on contract boundaries or business scope.
Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2017 136 Strategic report Governance IFRS financial statements Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 16 Goodwill continued The present value of expected profits arising from future new business may be included within the shareholder value and is calculated on an adjusted Solvency II basis, using profit projections based on the most recent three year business plans approved by management.
These plans reflect managements best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the relevant cash generating unit.
The underlying assumptions of these projections include market share, customer numbers, mortality, morbidity and persistency.
Future new business profits beyond the initial three years are extrapolated using a steady growth rate.
Growth rates and expected future profits are set with regards to management estimates, past experience and relevant available market statistics.
Expected profits from future new business are discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate.
The discount rate is a combination of a risk-free rate and a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years for new business may differ from that assumed.
Key Assumptions The Solvency II non-economic assumptions in relation to mortality, morbidity, persistency and expenses and other items are derived actively, based on managements best estimate assumptions.
Economic assumptions are based on market data as at the end of each reporting period.
The basic risk-free rate curves used to value the technical provisions reflect the curves, credit risk adjustment and fundamental spread for the matching adjustment published by EIOPA on their website.
For the purposes of calculating value in use, the Solvency II risk margin has been modified to an economic view, with a cost of capital rate of 2%.
For the goodwill in the UK Life long-term business that arose on the Friends Life acquisition, the value of the business was sufficient to demonstrate goodwill recoverability on its own.
As such it was not necessary to estimate the present value of expected profits from future new business.
For the goodwill in the Italian long-term business and the goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset of the remaining Spanish longterm business, the recoverable amount of the related cash generating units in 2017 was based on their fair value less costs to sell.
The basis for the estimate of the fair value less costs to sell was the agreed consideration between the bancassurance partners see note 3 c i and iv for more information.
In 2016 the recoverable amount for the aforementioned businesses was based on a value in use calculation as explained above with the key underlying assumptions presented in the table that follows.

The calculation uses cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering a three year period.
The underlying assumptions of these projections include market share, customer numbers, premium rate and fee income changes, claims inflation and commission rates.
Cash flows beyond that three year period are extrapolated using a steady growth rate.
Growth rates and expected future profits are set with regards to past experience and relevant available market statistics.
Future profits are discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate.

The fair value less costs to sell was determined based on the quoted market value of Avivas share of the subsidiary to which it relates.
Spain The recoverable amount of the indefinite life intangible asset relating to the remaining Spanish business has been assessed using consistent assumptions with those for Spain long-term business goodwill impairment testing as explained above for the years 2017 and 2016 respectively.
