EARNINGS PERSHARE CONTINUED Adjusted earnings is a performance measure used by the Board to assess the level of the Groups dividend payments.
The metric reduces EPRA earnings by interest paid to service debt that was capitalised and removes other non-cash items credited or charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Licence fees receivable during the year are added to earnings on the basis noted below as the Board sees these cash flows as supportive of dividend payments.
The Board compares the Adjusted earnings to the available distributable reserves when considering the level of dividend topay.
The adjustment for licence fee receivable is calculated by reference to the fraction of the total period of completed construction during the year, multiplied by the total licence fee receivable on a given forward fundedasset.
Licence fees will convert into rental income once practical completion has occurred and therefore the rental income will flow into Adjusted earnings from this point.
Fixed rental uplift adjustments relate to adjustments to net rental income on leases with fixed or minimum uplifts embedded within their review profiles.
The total minimum income recognised over the lease term is recognised on a straight line basis and therefore not supported by cash flows during the early term of the lease, but this reverses towards the end of the lease.
