In the Investment basis accounts we have disaggregated these line items to analyse our total return as if these Investment entity subsidiaries were fully consolidated, consistent with prior years.
The adjustments simply reclassify the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income of the Group, and the total return is equal under theInvestment basis and the IFRS basis.
2 Realised profits, unrealised profits, and portfolio income shown in the IFRS accounts only relate to portfolio companies that are held directly by 3i Group plc and not those portfolio companies held through Investment entity subsidiaries.
Realised profits, unrealised profits, and portfolio income in relation to portfolio companies held through Investment entity subsidiaries are aggregated into the single Fair value movement on investment entity subsidiaries line.
This is the most significant reduction of information in our IFRS accounts.
3 Foreign exchange movements have been reclassied under the Investment basis as foreign currency asset and liability movements.
Movements within the Investment entity subsidiaries areincluded within Fair value movements on investment entities.
4 Other items also aggregated into the Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries line include fees receivable from external funds, audit fees, administration expenses, carriedinterest and tax.
5 Comparatives for the year ended 31 March 2016 have been re-presented to reect the classication of the Groups Debt Management business sold to Investcorp as discontinued operations.
See Note 31 to the IFRS financial statements.
6 The IFRS basis is audited and the Investment basis is unaudited.

In the Investment basis we have disaggregated these items to analyse our net assets as if the Investment entity subsidiaries were consolidated.
The adjustment reclassies items in the Consolidated statement of financial position.
There is no change to the net assets, although for reasons explained below, gross assets and gross liabilities are different.
The disclosure relating to portfolio companies is signicantly reduced by the aggregation, as the fair value of all investments held by Investment entity subsidiaries is aggregated into theInvestments in investment entities line.
We have disaggregated this fair value and disclosed the underlying portfolio holding in the relevant line item, ie, quoted equity investments orunquoted equity investments.
Other items which may be aggregated are carried interest and other payables, and the Investment basis presentation again disaggregates these items.
2 Intercompany balances between Investment entity subsidiaries and trading subsidiaries also impact the transparency of our results under the IFRS basis.
If an Investment entity subsidiary hasan intercompany balance with a consolidated trading subsidiary of the Group, then the asset or liability of the Investment entity subsidiary will be aggregated into its fair value, while the asset or liability of the consolidated trading subsidiary will be disclosed as an asset or liability in the Consolidated statement of financial position for the Group.
3 Investment basis financial statements are prepared for performance measurement and therefore reserves are not analysed separately under this basis.
4 The IFRS basis is audited and the Investment basis is unaudited.

Therefore in our Investment basis financial statements, we have disclosed our cash ow statement on a look through basis, in order to reect the underlying sources and uses of cash ows and disclose the underlying investment activity.
2 There is a difference between the change in cash and cash equivalents of the Investment basis financial statements and the IFRS financial statements because there are cash balances held in Investment entity subsidiary vehicles.
Cash held within Investment entity subsidiaries will not be shown in the IFRS statements but will be seen in the Investment basis statements.
3 The IFRS basis is audited and the Investment basis is unaudited.
