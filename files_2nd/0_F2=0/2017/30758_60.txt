STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 21.
INTEREST RATEDERIVATIVES To mitigate the interest rate risk that arises as a result of entering into variable rate loans, the Group has entered into a number of interest rate derivatives.
A number of interest rate caps and one interest rate swap have been taken out in respect of the Groups variable rate debt to fix or cap the rate to which 3 month Libor can rise.
Each runs coterminous to the initial term of the respectiveloans.
The weighted average capped rate, excluding any margin payable, for the Group as at the year end was 1.26% 2016: 1.39%, which effectively caps the level to which Libor can rise to, therefore limiting any effect on the Group of an interest rate rise.
The interest rate derivatives mean that the Groups borrowing facilities at the year end have an all-inclusive interest rate payable of 2.66% 2016: 2.82%.
The total premium payable in the year towards securing the interest rate caps was 1.07million 2016: 1.69million.
