Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Merger reserve The merger reserve was created in accordance with the merger relief provisions under section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 as amended and section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 relating to the accounting for business combinations involving the issue of shares at a premium.
Merger relief provided relief from the requirement to create a share premium account in a parent companys balance sheet.
In preparing consolidated financial statements, the amount by which the fair value of the shares issued exceeded their nominal value was recorded within a merger reserve on consolidation, rather than in a share premium account.
This merger reserve was retained upon transition to IFRS, as allowed under UK law.
The merger reserve, which is included in other reserves, was created as a result of the purchase by the Group of interests in two entities.
Sports Internet Group SIG was purchased on 12 July 2000, where consideration was paid by the issue of equity shares in the Company.
BiB was purchased between 28 June 2001 and 11 November 2002, where consideration was paid by the issue of equity shares in the Company.
Following the Groups disposal of a controlling stake in Sky Bet, the merger reserve in relation to the purchase of SIG was transferred to retained earnings.
At 30 June 2017, the Groups merger reserve was 125 million 2016: 125 million.
