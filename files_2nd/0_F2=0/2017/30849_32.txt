These assets and liabilities are not regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors in the reportable segment format.
There is an asymmetrical allocation of assets and income to the reportable segments, in that the interest earned on cash and cash equivalent assets deployed in the UK Insurance, Price Comparison and International Car Insurance segments is not allocated in arriving at segment profits.
This is consistent with regular reporting to the Board of Directors.
Eliminations represent inter-segment funding and balances included in insurance and other receivables.

Premium, claims and profit commissions 5a.
Accounting policies i Revenue premiums Premiums relating to insurance contracts are recognised as revenue, net of insurance premium tax, proportionally over the period of cover.
Premiums with an inception date after the end of the period are held in the statement of financial position as deferred revenue.
Outstanding collections from policyholders are recognised within policyholder receivables.
ii Revenue profit commission Under some of the co-insurance and reinsurance contracts under which motor premiums are shared or ceded, profit commission may be earned on a particular year of account, which is usually subject to performance criteria such as loss ratios and expense ratios.
The commission is dependent on the ultimate outcome of any year, with revenue being recognised when loss and expense ratios used in the preparation of the financial statements move below a contractual threshold.
Profit commission receivable from reinsurance contracts is accounted for in line with IFRS 4, whereas profit commission receivable from co-insurance contracts is in line with IAS 18.
Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 105 Financial Statements: Notes to the Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2017 5.
Premium, claims and profit commissions continued 5a.
Accounting policies continued iii Insurance contracts and reinsurance assets Premiums The proportion of premium receivable on in-force policies relating to unexpired risks is reported in insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance assets as the unearned premium provision gross and reinsurers share respectively.
Claims Claims and claims handling expenses are charged as incurred, based on the estimated direct and indirect costs of settling all liabilities arising on events occurring up to the balance sheet date.
The provision for claims outstanding comprises provisions for the estimated cost of settling all claims incurred but unpaid at the balance sheet date, whether reported or not.
Anticipated reinsurance recoveries are disclosed separately as assets.
Whilst the Directors consider that the gross provisions for claims and the related reinsurance recoveries are fairly stated on the basis of the information currently available to them, the ultimate liability will vary as a result of subsequent information and events and may result in significant adjustments to the amounts provided.
Adjustments to the amounts of claims provisions established in prior years are reflected in the income statement for the period in which the adjustments are made and disclosed separately if material.
The methods used, and the estimates made, are reviewed regularly.
Provision for unexpired risks is made where necessary for the estimated amount required over and above unearned premiums net of deferred acquisition costs to meet future claims and related expenses.
Co-insurance The Group has entered into certain co-insurance contracts under which insurance risks are shared on a proportional basis, with the co-insurer taking a specific percentage of premium written and being responsible for the same proportion of each claim.
The co-insurer therefore takes direct insurance risk from the policyholder and is subsequently directly responsible to the claimant for its proportion of the claim.
As the contractual liability is several and not joint, neither the premiums nor claims relating to the co-insurance are included in the income statement.
Under the terms of these agreements the co-insurers reimburse the Group for the same proportionate share of the costs of acquiring and administering the business.
Reinsurance assets Contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers under which the Group is compensated for losses on the insurance contracts issued by the Group are classified as reinsurance contracts.
A contract is only accounted for as a reinsurance contract where there is significant insurance risk transfer between the insured and the insurer.
Reinsurance assets are comprised of balances due from reinsurance companies for ceded insurance liabilities.
Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a consistent manner with the outstanding claims provisions or settled claims associated with the reinsured policies and in accordance with the relevant reinsurance contract.
The Group assesses its reinsurance assets for impairment on a regular basis, and in detail every six months.
If there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, then the carrying value will be written down to its recoverable amount.
On the commutation of reinsurance contracts, the reinsurer is discharged from all obligations relating to the contract.
Reinsurance assets and liabilities relating to the commuted contracts are settled in the period in which the commutation agreement is signed.

Reinsurance assets and insurance contract liabilities i Objectives, policies and procedures for the management of insurance risk The Groups primary business is the issuance of insurance contracts that transfer risk from policyholders to the Group and its coinsurance partners.
Insurance risk involves uncertainty over the occurrence, amount or timing of claims arising on insurance contracts issued.
It is primarily comprised of Reserve risk: the risk that the value of insurance liabilities established is insufficient to cover the ultimate cost of claims incurred at the balance sheet date, and Premium risk: the risk that the claims experience on business written but not earned is higher than allowed for in the premiums charged to policyholders.
The Board of Directors is responsible for the management of insurance risk, although as mentioned in note 6, it has delegated the detailed oversight of risk management to the Group Risk Committee.
The Group also has a Reserving Committee which comprises senior managers within the finance, claims, pricing and actuarial functions.
The Reserving Committee primarily recommends the approach for UK Car Insurance reserving but also reviews the systems and controls in place to support accurate reserving and material reserving issues such as Periodic Payment Order PPO and claims inflation, which represent the key uncertainties in the amount or timing of claims settlements.
The Board implements certain policies in order to mitigate and control the level of insurance risk accepted by the Group.
These include pricing policies and claims management and administration processes, in addition to reserving policies and coand reinsurance arrangements as detailed below.

The key processes are as follows: Regular management and internal actuarial review of individual and aggregate case claim reserves, including regular reporting of management information and exception reporting of significant movements Regular management and internal actuarial review of large claims, including claims settled or potentially settled by PPOs for which the uncertainty is increased by factors such as the lifetime of the claimant and movements in the indexation for the cost of future care of the claimant: Bi-annual external actuarial review of best estimate claims reserves using a variety of recognised actuarial techniques Internal actuarial analysis of reserve uncertainty through qualitative analysis, scenario testing and a range of stochastic reserving techniques Ad hoc external reviews of reserving related processes and assumptions Use of a reserving methodology which informs managements reserving decisions for the purposes of the Groups financial statements.
As described in note 3, critical accounting judgements and estimates, the methodology determines that reserves should be set within a range above projected best estimate outcomes to allow for unforeseen adverse claims development.
As noted above, the Group shares a significant amount of the motor insurance business generated with external underwriters.
As well as these proportional arrangements, an excess of loss reinsurance programme is also purchased to protect the Group against very large individual claims and catastrophe losses.
Claims reserving As previously disclosed, Admirals reserving policy both within the claims function and in the financial statements is initially to reserve conservatively, above internal and independent projections of actuarial best estimates.
This is designed to create a margin held in reserves to allow for unforeseen adverse development in open claims and typically results in Admiral making above industry average reserve releases.
Admirals booked claims reserves continue to include a significant margin above projected best estimates of ultimate claims costs.
Admiral continues to develop and enhance its methodology in setting the margin held above actuarial best estimates.
A wide range of factors inform managements recommendation which is subject to approval from the Groups Reserving and Audit Committees, including: Reserve KPIs such as the level of margin as a percentage of the ultimate reserve Results of stress testing of key assumptions underpinning key actuarial assumptions within best estimate reserves A review of a number of individual and aggregated reserve scenarios which may result in future adverse variance to the ultimate best estimate reserve Qualitative assessment of the level of uncertainty and volatility within the reserves and the change in that assessment compared to previous periods.
In addition, the internal reserve risk distribution is used to determine the approximate confidence level of the recommended booked reserve position which enables comparison of the reserve strength to previous periods and demonstration of the compliance with IFRS 4.
As at 31 December 2017, the level of reserve margin is lower than at 31 December 2016, although remains very prudent when measured against the internal reserve risk distribution and other market benchmarks.
The reduction in the level of reserve margin since 2016 is partly due to the increased level of confidence over the impact of the Ogden rate change to -0.75%.
As profit commission income is recognised in the income statement in line with loss ratios accounted for on Admirals own claims reserves, the reserving policy also results in profit commission income being deferred and recognised over time.
Premium Risk As noted above, the Group defines Premium risk as the risk that claims cost on business written but not yet earned is higher than allowed for in the premiums charged to policyholders.
This also includes catastrophe risk: the risk of incurring significant losses as a result of the occurrence of man-made catastrophe or natural weather events.
Key processes and controls operating to mitigate premium risk are as follows: Experienced and focused senior management and teams in relevant business areas including pricing and claims management A data-driven and analytical approach to regular monitoring of claims and underwriting performance Capability to identify and resolve underperformance promptly through changes to key performance drivers, in particular pricing.
108 Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Introduction Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information In addition, as mentioned above, an excess of loss reinsurance programme is also purchased to protect the Group against very large individual claims and catastrophe losses.
Other elements of insurance risk include reinsurance risk: the risk of placement of ineffective reinsurance arrangements, or the economic risk of reduced availability of co-insurance and reinsurance arrangements in future periods.
The Group mitigates these risks by ensuring that it has a diverse range of financially secure reinsurance partners, including a long-term relationship with Munich Re and a number of other high profile reinsurers.
Concentration of insurance risk The Directors do not believe there are significant concentrations of insurance risk.
This is because, although the Group has historically written only one significant line of UK insurance business, the risks are spread across a large number of people and a wide regional base.
The introduction of the international car insurance businesses in recent years and the launch of UK household business in 2012 will further contribute to the diversification of the Groups insurance risk as these businesses grow.
ii Sensitivity of recognised amounts to changes in assumptions Ogden discount rate As noted above, the gross and reinsurers share of insurance liabilities in these financial statements are prepared on the basis of an Ogden discount rate of minus 0.75%.
On 7 September 2017, the Lord Chancellor announced draft legislation to change the way in which the Ogden discount rate is set, with initial indications being that the new discount rate could be set between 0% and 1%.
The sensitivity of a change in this assumption by 75 basis points both an increase and decrease is shown in the table below.
The impact is presented is the total impact of the change on the Groups pre-tax profit on an ultimate basis.
It should be noted that not all of the ultimate impact would necessarily be recognised immediately.

Accounting policies i Investment income and finance costs Investment income from financial assets comprises distributions as well as net realised and unrealised gains on financial assets classified as fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, interest income and net realised gains from assets classified as available for sale AFS, and interest income on holdings in deposits and gilts.
Finance costs from financial liabilities comprise interest expense on subordinated notes, calculated on the effective interest rate method.
The effective interest rate method calculates the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability or group of financial assets or financial liabilities and allocates the interest income or expense over the expected life of the asset or liability.
ii Financial assets investments and receivables Initial recognition Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at FVTPL, AFS assets, loans and receivables or held to maturity investments.
At initial recognition assets are recognised at fair value and classified according to the purpose for which they were acquired.
The Groups investments in investment funds are designated as FVTPL at inception.
This designation is permitted under IAS 39, as the investments in money market funds are managed as a group of assets and internal performance evaluation of this group is conducted on a fair value basis.
The Groups holdings in Fixed Income and Asset Backed Securities are classified as AFS investments, which is consistent with the intention for which they were purchased.
Government gilts are also classified as AFS investments, in line with IAS 39, due to a reclassification in the period following the disposal of a portion of the holding.
Deposits held with credit institutions are classified as loans and receivables, in line with the nature of these deposits, with 2016 comparatives restated to reflect this more appropriate classification of these assets.
Transaction costs associated with the purchase of all financial assets are expensed within the income statement as incurred.
Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 115 Financial Statements: Notes to the Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2017 6.
Accounting policies continued Subsequent measurement Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant realised or unrealised gain or loss recognised through the income statement.
Investments classified as available for sale are stated at fair value.
Unrealised changes in the fair value of these assets are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income OCI.
Interest income is recognised within profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.
Loans and receivables are stated at their amortised cost less impairment using the effective interest method.
Impairment losses are recognised through the income statement.
Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any financial assets or groups of financial assets held at fair value or amortised cost are impaired.
Financial assets are impaired where there is evidence that one or more events occurring after the initial recognition of the asset, may lead to a reduction in the estimated future cash flows arising from the asset.
Objective evidence of impairment may include default on cash flows due from the asset and reported financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty.
Identified impairments of financial assets are recognised in the income statement, except in the case of assets classified as AFS where unrealised gains have been recognised through OCI.
In this instance, impairments of the asset are first set against the unrealised gain in OCI with any excess being recognised in the income statement.
fide-recognition of financial assets A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from that asset have expired, or when the Group transfers the asset and all the attached substantial risks and rewards relating to the asset to a third party.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
All cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost.
iii Financial liabilities Initial recognition The Groups financial liabilities comprise subordinated notes and other financial liabilities initially recognised at fair value received, net of transaction costs incurred.
Subsequent measurement Subsequent measurement is at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Movements in the amortised cost are recognised through the income statement.
fide-recognition of financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under that liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
iv Fair value measurement of assets held at amortised cost The fair value of gilts and subordinated notes held at amortised cost is calculated with reference to quoted market valuations.
See note 6d for a comparison of fair value and carrying value at the statement of financial position date.
The Groups deposits are held with well rated institutions: as such the fair value approximates to the book value of the investment based on the interest rates of the instruments, credit risk movements and durations of the assets.
The amortised cost carrying amount of receivables is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Financial liabilities are inclusive of 200 million subordinated notes issued on 25 July 2014 at a fixed rate of 5.5% with a redemption date of 25 July 2024.
The notes are unsecured subordinated obligations of the Group and rank pari passu without any preference among themselves.
In the event of a winding-up or bankruptcy, they are to be repaid only after the claims of all other creditors have been met.
There have been no defaults on any of the notes during the year.
The Group has the option to defer interest payments on the notes but to date has not exercised this right.
The aggregate fair value of subordinated dated notes at the balance sheet date is disclosed in the table below.
The Group holds two revolving credit facilities of 100 million each.
As at 31 December 2017, 20 million 2016: 20 million was drawn under these agreements as shown within other borrowings in the table above.
118 Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Introduction Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Fair value measurement The measurement of investments at the end of the period, for the majority of investments held at fair value and those classified as available for sale, is based on active quoted market values level one.
An immaterial amount of investments held at fair value are measured at level three of the fair value hierarchy.
No further information is provided due to the immateriality of the balance at 31 December 2017.
Deposits are held with well rated institutions: as such the approximate fair value is the book value of the investment as impairment of the capital is not expected.
There is no quoted market for these holdings and as such a level two valuation is used.
The book value of deposits is 130.0 million 2016: 170.0 million.

The Board of Directors has delegated the task of supervising risk management and internal control to the Group Risk Committee.
There is also an Investment Committee that makes recommendations to the Board on the Groups investment strategy.
There are several key elements to the risk management environment throughout the Group.
These are detailed in full in the Corporate Governance Statement.
Specific considerations for the risks arising from financial assets and liabilities are detailed below.
Credit risk The Group defines credit risk as the risk of loss if another party fails to perform its obligations.
The key areas of exposure to credit risk for the Group result through its reinsurance programme, investments, bank deposits and policyholder receivables.
The Directors consider counterparty exposure frequently and in significant detail.
The Directors consider that the policies and procedures in place to manage credit exposure continue to be appropriate for the Groups risk appetite and, during 2017 and historically, no material credit losses have been experienced by the Group.
There are no specific concentrations of credit risk with respect to investment counterparties due to the structure of the liquidity funds and the parameters set for managing the Fixed Income Mandates.
Both forms of investment hold a wide range of very short duration, high quality securities.
Cash balances and deposits are placed only with highly rated credit institutions.
The detailed holdings are reviewed regularly by the Investment Committee.
To mitigate the risk arising from exposure to reinsurers in the form of reinsurance recoveries and profit commissions, the Group only conducts business with companies of appropriate financial strength ratings.
In addition, many reinsurance contracts are operated on a funds withheld basis, which substantially reduces credit risk, as the Group withholds the cash received as collateral.
120 Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Introduction Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information The other principal form of credit risk is in respect of amounts due from policyholders, largely due to the potential for default by instalment payers.
The impact of this is mitigated by the large customer base and low average level of balance recoverable.
There is also mitigation by the operation of numerous highand low-level controls in this area, including payment on policy acceptance as opposed to inception and automated cancellation procedures for policies in default.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2017 is 3,723.8 million 2016: 3,263.0 million, being the carrying value of financial investments and cash, and the excess of reinsurance assets over amounts owed to reinsurers under funds withheld arrangements.
The Group does not use credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate exposure.
The amount of bad debt expense relating to policyholder debt charged to the income statement in 2017 and 2016 is insignificant.
1.0m was charged to the income statement in respect of loans and advances to customers.
There were no significant financial assets that were past due at the close of either 2017 or 2016.
The Groups credit risk exposure to assets with external ratings is as follows: 31 December 2017 31 December 2016 Rating m m Financial institutions Credit institutions AAA 210.7 269.3 Financial institutions Credit institutions AA 650.3 733.8 Financial institutions Credit institutions A 1,737.0 1,305.6 Financial institutions Credit institutions BBB and below 249.7 236.0 UK Government gilts AA 173.8 197.4 Reinsurers AA 355.7 295.6 Reinsurers A 256.4 141.6 Interest rate risk The Group considers interest rate risk to be the risk that unfavourable movements in interest rates could adversely impact on the capital values of financial assets and liabilities.
As noted above, the Group invests the following asset types: Money market liquidity funds and cash plus liquidity funds, which in turn invest in a mixture of short dated fixed and variable rate securities, such as cash deposits, certificates of deposits, floating rate notes and other commercial paper.
Deposits with well rated institutions are short in duration one to five years.
These are classified as loans and receivables and valued at amortised cost.
Therefore neither the carrying value of the asset, nor the interest return will be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.
Available for sale debt securities.
These securities are held within two segregated mandates.
The guidelines of the investments retain a similar credit quality of the investment funds all holdings are investment grade.
The duration of the securities is relatively short and similar to the duration of the on book claims liabilities the average duration is three years.
These are classified as available for sale due to a sale of a portion of the assets in 2017.
The Group also holds a financial liability in the form of 200 million of subordinated notes with a ten year maturity and fixed rate coupon of 5.5%.
This liability is valued at amortised cost and therefore neither the carrying value of the deposits, nor the interest payable, will be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.
No sensitivity analysis to interest rates has been presented on the grounds of materiality.
Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 121 Financial Statements: Notes to the Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2017 6.
Financial assets and liabilities continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group does not have sufficient, available financial resources to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost.
The Group is strongly cash-generative due to the large proportion of revenue arising from non-underwriting activity.
Further, as noted above, a significant portion of insurance funds are invested in money market liquidity funds with same day liquidity, meaning that a large proportion of the Group cash and investments is immediately available.
A breakdown of the Groups other financial liabilities, trade payables and other payables is shown in note 10.
The subordinated notes have a ten year maturity whereas all trade and other payables will mature within three to six months of the balance sheet date.
Refer to the maturity profile at the start of this note for further detail.
In practice, the Groups Directors expect actual cash flows to be consistent with this maturity profile except for amounts owed to co-insurers and reinsurers.
Of the total amounts owed to co-insurers and reinsurers of 1,157.5 million 2016: 938.0 million, 938.4 million 2016: 610.1 million is held under funds withheld arrangements and therefore not expected to be settled within 12 months.
A maturity analysis for insurance contract liabilities is included in note 5.
The maturity profile for financial assets is included at the start of this note.
The Groups Directors believe that the cash flows arising from these assets will be consistent with this profile.
Liquidity risk is not, therefore, considered to be significant.
Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk arises from unfavourable movements in foreign exchange rates that could adversely impact the valuation of overseas assets and liabilities.
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its operations overseas.
Although the relative size of the international operations means that the risks are relatively small, increasingly volatile foreign exchange rates could result in larger potential gains or losses.
Assets held to fund insurance liabilities are held in the currency of the liabilities: however, surplus assets held as regulatory capital in foreign currencies remain exposed.
The Groups exposure to net assets and profits in currencies other than the reporting currency is immaterial other than for US dollars.
The Groups exposure to net assets held in dollars at the balance sheet date was 55.1million 2016: 70.5 million.
The loss before tax derived from business carried out in the US was 23.4 million 2016: 39.1 million.
If the Sterling rates with US dollars had strengthened weakened by 10%, the Groups profit before tax for the year would increase decrease by 2.2 million 2016: 3.6 million.
Fair value For cash at bank and cash deposits and other receivables, the fair value approximates to the book value due to their short maturity.
For assets held at fair value through profit and loss and AFS their value equates to level one quoted prices in active markets of the fair value hierarchy.
For subordinated notes, the fair value is calculated with reference to the quoted market valuation.
This is compared to carrying value earlier in this note.

Accounting policy i Contribution from additional products and fees and other revenue Contribution from additional products and fees and other revenue includes revenue earned on the sale of products supplementing the core motor, van and household insurance policies, administration and other charges paid by the policyholder, referral fees, revenue from policies paid by instalments and vehicle commission charges paid by coand reinsurers.
Revenue is credited to the income statement over the period matching the Groups obligations to provide services.
Where the Group has no remaining contractual obligations, the revenue is recognised immediately.
An allowance is made for expected cancellations where the customer may be entitled to a refund of amounts charged.
Commission from price comparison activities and broking commission earned by Gladiator is credited to revenue on the sale of the underlying insurance policy.

Accounting policies i Acquisition costs and operating expenses Acquisition costs incurred in obtaining new and renewal business are charged to the income statement over the period in which those premiums are earned.
All other operating expenses are charged to the income statement in the period that they are incurred.
ii Employee benefits Pensions The Group contributes to defined contribution personal pension plans for its employees.
The contributions payable to these schemes are charged in the accounting period to which they relate.
Employee share schemes The Group operates a number of equity and cash settled compensation schemes for its employees.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of free shares under the equity settled schemes is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity.
For cash settled schemes, the fair value of services received are also recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liability.
For equity settled schemes, the total charge expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the free shares granted as determined at the grant date excluding the impact of non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market conditions such as profitability targets as well as staff attrition rates are included in assumptions over the number of free shares to vest under the applicable scheme.
For cash settled schemes, the total charge expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the closing Admiral Group share price at the end of the period.
Prior to the vesting of each scheme, the closing share price at the end of the reporting period is used as an approximation for the closing share price at the end of the vesting period.
As with equity settled schemes, non-market vesting conditions also impact on the total charge expensed over the vesting period.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its assumptions on the number of shares to be granted with the impact of any change in the assumptions recognised through income.
Refer to note 8f for further details on share schemes.

Accounting policies continued iii Leases Operating leases Leases which do not transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased items are classified as operating leases.
The Group has entered into a number of non-cancellable operating lease arrangements for properties and other assets.
The leases have varying terms, escalation values and renewal rights.
Operating lease payments, including the effects of any lease incentives, are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straightline basis over the lease term.
Contingent rentals are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

i The Approved Share Incentive Plan the SIP Eligible employees qualified for awards under the SIP based upon the performance of the Group in each half-year period.
The maximum award for each year is 3,600 per employee.
The awards are made with reference to the Groups performance against prior year profit before tax.
Employees must remain in employment for the holding period three years from the date of award otherwise the shares are forfeited.
The fair value of shares awarded is the share price at the date of award.
Awards under the SIP are entitled to receive dividends, and, hence, no adjustment has been made to this fair value.
ii The Discretionary Free Share Scheme the DFSS Under the DFSS, details of which are contained in the remuneration policy section of the Directors Remuneration Report, individuals receive an award of free shares at no charge.
Staff must remain in employment until the vesting date in order to receive shares.
The maximum number of shares that can vest relating to the 2017 scheme is 3,205,433 2016 scheme: 3,247,136.
The amount of 2017 award that actually vests is based on the growth in the Companys earnings per share EPS relative to a risk free return RFR, for which LIBOR has been selected as a benchmark.
This performance is measured over the three year period the award applies to.
For the 2017 scheme, 50% of the shares awarded at the start of the three year vesting period are subject to these performance conditions.
126 Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Introduction Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information The range of awards is as follows: If the growth in EPS is less than the RFR, no awards vest.
EPS growth is equal to RFR 10% of maximum award vests.
To achieve the maximum award, EPS growth has to be 36 points higher than RFR over the three year period.
Between 10% and 100% of the maximum awards, a linear relationship exists.
For awards in 2016 and onwards there are now three performance conditions which the 50% not guaranteed to vest are subject to.
These are three-year EPS growth vs. LIBOR, TSR vs. FTSE 350 excluding investment companies, and ROE, weighted equally.
Performance range Performance measure Threshold Maximum EPS growth vs. LIBOR Growth in line with LIBOR Growth of 10% p. a. in excess of LIBOR TSR vs. FTSE 350 excluding investment companies Median Upper Quartile ROE 25% 55% Awards under the DFSS are not eligible for dividends although a discretionary bonus is currently paid equivalent to the dividend that would have been paid on the respective shareholding and hence the fair value of free shares to be awarded under this scheme has been revised downwards to take account of these distributions.

Accounting policy Income tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax.
i Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and includes any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Current tax related to items recognised in other comprehensive income is also recognised in other comprehensive income and not in the income statement.
ii Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
It is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
The principal temporary differences arise from carried forward losses, depreciation of property and equipment and share scheme charges.
The resulting deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except in relation to share scheme charges where the amount of tax benefit credited to the income statement is limited to an equivalent credit calculated on the accounting charge.
Any excess is recognised directly in equity.
Deferred tax assets relating to carried forward losses are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised.
The probability of the availability of future taxable profits is determined by a combination of the classification of the status of the businesses holding cumulative tax losses and the business plan profit projections for that business, subject to appropriate stress testing.

The UK corporation tax rate reduced from 20% to 19% on 1 April 2017.
A further reduction to the main rate of corporation tax to 17% effective from 1 April 2020 was enacted on 15 September 2016.
This will reduce the Groups future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2017 has been calculated based on the rate at which each timing difference is most likely to reverse.
The deferred tax asset relating to carried forward losses of 13.9 million relates to losses incurred in the Groups US price comparison business Compare.
com, and is calculated at the local US rate of tax of 21% 2016: 35%.
The recognised asset has been limited to the amount supported by forecast cash flows over the next five years.
The forecasts and underlying assumptions have been reviewed and approved by the Board.
In addition, the forecasts have been stressed for both revenue and profit reductions and the asset remains recoverable under the stressed scenarios.
At 31 December 2017 the Group had unused tax losses amounting to 166.1 million 2016: 142.7 million, relating to the Groups US businesses Elephant Auto and Compare.
com, for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.

Other assets and other liabilities 10a.
Accounting policy i Property and equipment, and depreciation All property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method to write off the cost less residual values of the assets over their useful economic lives.
These useful economic lives are as follows: Improvements to short leasehold buildings four to ten years Computer equipment two to four years Office equipment four years Furniture and fittings four years Motor vehicles four years ii Impairment of property and equipment In the case of property and equipment, carrying values are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there are any indications of impairment.
If any such indications exist, the assets recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying value.
The carrying value is the higher of the fair value of the asset less costs to sell, and the assets value in use.
iii Leased assets The rental costs relating to assets held under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classed as finance leases.
Assets acquired under finance leases are included in property and equipment at fair value on acquisition and are depreciated in the same manner as equivalent owned assets.
Finance lease and hire purchase obligations are included in creditors and the finance costs are spread over the periods of the agreements based on the net amount outstanding.
iv Intangible assets Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
Goodwill has been recognised in acquisitions of subsidiaries, and represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
The classification and accounting treatment of acquisitions occurring before 1 January 2004 have not been reconsidered in preparing the Groups opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004 due to the exemption available in IFRS 1 First time adoption.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included at the transition date on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP, which was tested for impairment at the transition date.
On transition, amortisation of goodwill has ceased as required by IAS 38.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units CGUs according to business segment and is reviewed annually for impairment.
The goodwill held on the balance sheet at 31 December 2017 is allocated solely to the UK Car Insurance segment.
130 Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Introduction Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Impairment of goodwill The annual impairment review involves comparing the carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount by allocating the goodwill to CGUs and recognising an impairment loss if the recoverable amount is lower.
Impairment losses are recognised through the income statement and are not subsequently reversed.
The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value of the asset less costs to sell and the value in use of the CGU.
The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three year period.
Cash flows beyond this period are considered, but not included in the calculation.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are those regarding growth rates and expected changes in pricing and expenses incurred during the period.
Management estimates growth rates and changes in pricing based on past practices and expected future changes in the market.
The headroom above the goodwill carrying value is very significant, and there is no foreseeable event that would eliminate this margin.
Deferred acquisition costs Acquisition costs comprise all direct and indirect costs arising from the conclusion of insurance contracts.
Deferred acquisition costs represent the proportion of acquisition costs incurred that correspond to the unearned premiums provision at the balance sheet date.
This balance is held as an intangible asset.
It is amortised over the term of the contract as premium is earned.
Software Purchased software is recognised as an intangible asset and amortised over its expected useful life generally the licence term.
Internally generated software is recognised as an intangible asset, with directly attributable costs incurred in the development stage capitalised.
The internally generated software assets are amortised over the expected useful life of the systems and amortisation commences when the software is available for use.
The carrying value of software is reviewed every six months for evidence of impairment, with the value being written down if any impairment exists.
Impairment may be reversed if conditions subsequently improve.
iv Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets Provisions are recognised when a legal or constructive obligation arises as a result of an event that occurred before the balance sheet date, when a cash-outflow relating to this obligation is probable and when the amount can be estimated reliably.
Where an obligation exists, but the likelihood of a cash out-flow or the amount is uncertain, or where there is a possible obligation arising from a past event that is contingent on a future event, a contingent liability is disclosed.
Contingent assets are possible assets that arise from past events, whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or nonoccurrence of future events.
Where it is probable that a cash-inflow will arise from a contingent asset, this is disclosed.

As described in the accounting policies, the amortisation of this asset ceased on transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004.
All annual impairment reviews since the transition date have indicated that the estimated recoverable value of the asset is greater than the carrying amount and therefore no impairment losses have been recognised.

At the same point, the Group began charging its panel of coand reinsurers a vehicle commission.
The substance of these changes meant that the total premiums written increased by the amount of revenue that was previously earned from the sale of nonoptional legal protection policies.
The vehicle commission included within other revenue is therefore eliminated from the turnover measure to avoid double counting.
