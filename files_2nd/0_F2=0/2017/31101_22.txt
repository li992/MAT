140 140 Capco Capco Annual R Annual Re eport & port & Accounts 2017 Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Alternative performance measures For the year ended 31 December 2017 The Group has applied the European Securities and Markets Authority ESMA guidelines on alternative performance measures APMs in these annual results.
An APM is a financial measure of historical or future finance performance, position or cash flow of the Group which is not a measure defined or specified in IFRS.
Set out below is a summary of the APMs used in this Annual Report.
Many of the APMs included are based on the EPRA Best Practice Recommendations reporting framework, a set of standard disclosures for the property industry, which aims to improve the transparency, comparability and relevance of published results of public real estate companies in Europe.
The Group also uses underlying earnings, property portfolio and financial debt ratios APMs.
The Group considers the presentation of underlying earnings to be useful supplementary information as it removes unrealised and certain other items and therefore represents the recurring, underlying performance of the business.
The property portfolio presents the Group share of property market value which is the economic value attributable to the owners of the Parent.
Financial debt ratios are supplementary ratios which we believe are useful in monitoring the capital structure of the Group.
Additionally loan to value and interest cover are covenants within many of the Groups borrowing facilities.
Internally, the Board focuses on and reviews information and reports prepared on a Group share basis, which includes the Groups share of joint ventures but excludes the non-controlling interest share of our subsidiaries.
