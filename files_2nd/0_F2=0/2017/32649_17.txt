The Groups policy is to minimise the impact of adverse interest rate movements through the use of interest rate management tools.
Any interest rate management tools are to be aligned with timescales of current and forecast net debt for which underlying projections can be made with an appropriate degree of accuracy.
During the period, the Group entered into interest rate swap agreements, fixing a portion of the floating rate net debt.
The interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group are as follows: FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES SUBJECT TO GROUP COMPANY GROUP COMPANY INTEREST RATE RISK 28 JANUARY 28 JANUARY 30 JANUARY 30 JANUARY 2017 2017 2016 2016 000 000 000 000 Sterling 83,780 2,238 92,545 615 US Dollar 6,897 - 57 - Euro 5,900 - 2,607 - Other 5,661 - 5,324 - 65,322 2,238 84,671 615 The above table does not include the notional value of net debt for which interest rate swaps are in place.

120 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS E CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base, defined as total shareholders equity, totalling 210,544,000 at 28 January 2017 2016: 172,599,000, so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
From time to time the Company purchases its own shares on the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
Primarily the shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Group and Companys share option and award programmes.
Buy and sell decisions are made on a specific transaction basis by the Board: the Group and Company do not have a defined share buy-back plan.
It is the Boards intention to achieve a dividend cover ratio of 2 times every year.
There were no changes in the Group and Companys approach to capital management during the period.
RELATED PARTIES The Group considers its Executive and Non-Executive Directors as key management and their compensation therefore comprises a related-party transaction.
