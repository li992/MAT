The remaining balance of 2m 2015 16: 7m, 2014 15: 9m was held in escrow accounts, or in commercial arrangements akin to escrow.
The classification of the items noted above represents a change in our definition of restricted cash.
We previously included in our definition cash held in countries where capital or exchange controls imposed local compliance obligations upon the group.
Upon further review, we have concluded these controls do not necessarily restrict access providing these obligations are satisfied.
We now also include cash balances held in arrangements akin to escrow as well as balances physically held in escrow accounts.
We have updated the comparative balances to reflect this change by reducing reported restricted cash by 50m in 2015 16 and 61m in 2014 15.
Cash equivalents are classified as loans and receivables and are held on the group balance sheet at amortised cost which equates to fair value.
Loans and other borrowings Whats our capital management policy?
The objective of our capital management policy is to target an overall level of debt consistent with our credit rating target while investing in the business, supporting the pension scheme and paying progressive dividends.
In order to meet this objective, we may issue or repay debt, issue new shares, repurchase shares, or adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders.
Wemanage the capital structure and make adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the group.
The Board regularly reviews the capital structure.
No changes were made to these objectives and processes during 2016 17, 2015 16 or 2014 15.
For details of share issues and repurchases in the year see note 21.
Our capital structure consists of net debt and shareholders equity.
The analysis below summarises the components which we manage as capital.

Loans and other borrowings continued Net debt Net debt consists of loans and other borrowings both current and non-current, less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
Loansand other borrowings are measured at the net proceeds raised, adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt.
For the purpose of this measure, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to Sterling at swapped rates where hedged.
Net debt is considered to be an alternative performance measure as it is not defined in IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure is the aggregate of loans and other borrowings currentand non-current, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
A reconciliation from the most directly comparable IFRS measure to net debt is given below.
b The in terest rate payable on this bond attracts an additional 0.25% for a downgrade by one credit rating by either Moodys or S&P to the groups senior unsecured debt below A3 A respectively.
In addition, if Moodys or S&P subsequently increase the ratings then the interest rate will be decreased by 0.25% for each rating category upgrade by each rating agency.
In no event will the interest rate be reduced below the minimum rate reflected in the above table.
Annual Report 2017 BT Group plc 219 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25.
Loans and other borrowings continued Unless previously designated in a fair value hedge relationship, all loans and other borrowings are carried on our balance sheet at amortised cost and in the table on page 219.
The fair value of our bonds and other long-term borrowings is estimated on the basis of quoted market prices, based on the same or similar issues where they exist.
Where the same or similar issues do not exist, the fair value is estimated based on the calculation of future cash flows using blended discount rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
The carrying amount of other loans and bank overdrafts equates to fair value due to the short maturity of these items.
The interest rates payable on loans and borrowings disclosed above reflect the coupons on the underlying issued loans and borrowings and not the interest rates achieved through applying associated cross-currency and interest rate swaps in hedge arrangements.
Loans and other borrowings are analysed as follows: 2017 2016 2015 At 31 March m m m Current liabilities Listed bonds 1,539 2,013 1,422 Finance leases 15 8 13 Bank loans 352 Syndicated loan facilities 619 a Other loans and bank overdrafts 726 1,096 879 Total current liabilities 2,632 3,736 2,314 Non-current liabilities Listed bonds 9,866 10,444 7,642 Finance leases 214 225 219 Bank loans 354 Other loans 1 2 1 Total non-current liabilities 10,081 11,025 7,862 Total 12,713 14,761 10,176 a Includes collateral received on swaps of 702m 2015 16: 553m, 2014 15: 437m.
The carrying values disclosed in the above table reflect balances at amortised cost adjusted for accrued interest and fair value adjustments to the relevant loans or borrowings.
These do not reflect the final principal repayments that will arise after taking account of the relevant derivatives in hedging relationships which are reflected in the table below.
Apart from finance leases, all borrowings as at 31 March 2017, 2016 and 2015 were unsecured.
