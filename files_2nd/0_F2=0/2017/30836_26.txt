148 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 SECTION 5 Other assets and liabilities This section provides information on the assets and liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet that are not covered in other sections, including goodwill, other intangible assets and the provision for reinstatement.
5.1 ACQUISITIONS Accounting policy Acquisitions of businesses are recognised at the point the Group obtains control of the target the acquisition date.
The consideration transferred and the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair value on the acquisition date.
The assets and liabilities acquired are recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet and the profits of the acquired business are recognised in the Consolidated income statement from the acquisition date.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement in the period the acquisition occurs in the transaction costs line.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identiable net assets acquired.
Acquisition of Opus Energy Group Limited Opus Energy The acquisition of Opus Energy was approved by shareholders on 8 February 2017 and subsequently completed on 10 February 2017: the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital on this date.
Opus Energy is a well-established B2B energy supply business serving business customers principally in the SME market, providing diversication of our retail offering and a robust platform for growth in line with our strategy.
Opus Energy has contributed positively to earnings and cash flow immediately following the acquisition.
The purchase consideration was 340 million plus interest calculated on the amount of Opus Energys net assets from 31 March 2016 to theacquisition date.
The total consideration of 367 million was funded by a combination of existing cash reserves 167million and partial drawing of a 375 million acquisition facility 200 million.
This facility was repaid as part of the renancing described in note 4.3.
Acquisition-related costs amounted to 7.8 million.
Following a detailed exercise to review the assets and liabilities, including intangible assets, the fair values acquired were as follows: Opus Energy m Financial assets 213.3 Property, plant and equipment 6.7 Financial liabilities 195.4 Intangible assets Customer-related assets 211.0 Brand 11.3 Software 1.9 Total identiable intangible assets 224.2 Deferred tax liability 40.7 Total identiable net assets 208.1 Goodwill 159.2 Fair value of consideration payable 367.3 The revenue and results of Opus Energy from the date of acquisition to the year end were as follows: Income statement items for the period from 10 February to 31 December 2017 Revenue 610.7 EBITDA 28.9 profit 22.5 The gures above have changed from those disclosed in the interim financial statements published on 19 July 2017.
The Group has continued to review and align estimates for the B2B Energy Supply business.
This process resulted in a number of remeasurements reducing the fair value of the net assets acquired by 4.4 million, with a corresponding increase in goodwill.
The values shown above are now final.
Following the acquisition, the Group has been able to identify and measure the fair value of existing customer contracts, the Opus Energy brand and software.
The assets will be amortised over their useful economic lives as follows: Existing customer contracts 11 years reducing balance Brand 10 years straight line Software 3 years straight line Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 149 5.1 ACQUISITIONS CONTINUED The fair value measurement of the existing customer contracts requires assumptions to be made, in particular regarding margins on current customer contracts, future contract renewal rates and future margins on renewed contracts.
The goodwill of 159 million recognised on acquisition is largely reflective of potential customer contracts and growth opportunities together with the assembled workforce.
None of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.
The financial assets acquired include 130 million of receivables, the majority of which reflect trade receivables for energy supplied to customers.
By virtue of their short tenor, the fair value of these receivables is considered to be the contractual amounts receivable less any provision for doubtful debts.
The provision for doubtful debts as at the acquisition date was 20 million.
Additional financial information The consolidated results of the Group, assuming Opus Energy had been acquired at the beginning of the year, would show revenue of 3,775.7 million compared to reported revenue of 3,685.2 million, EBITDA of 231.6 million compared to the reported EBITDA of 228.9 million and a loss after taxation of 149.0 million compared to a reported loss after taxation of 151.1 million.
This information includes the revenue and profits made by Opus Energy between 1 January 2017 and 10 February 2017, without accounting policy alignments and or the impact of fair value uplifts resulting from acquisition accounting adjustments.
This information is not necessarily indicative of the results of the combined Group that would have occurred had the acquisition actually been made at the beginning of the year, or indicative of the future results of the combined Group.
5.2 GOODWILL Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired.
During 2017, we recognised additional goodwill on the purchase of Opus Energy see note 5.1, and wrote off goodwill of 3.8 million in respect of Billington Bioenergy following the sale of the business.
Accounting policy Goodwill is initially recognised and measured at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for impairment at least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the CGU to which it relates and the recoverable amount for that CGU assessed.
The table below shows movements and balances: Goodwill m Cost and carrying amount: At 1 January 2016, 31 December 2016 and 1 January 2017 14.5 Acquisition of Opus Energy 159.2 Disposal of Billington Bioenergy 3.8 At 31 December 2017 169.9 Goodwill Total goodwill in the Consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2017 was 170 million, with 11 million arising on the acquisition of Haven Power in 2009 attributed to the Haven Power CGU and 159 million arising on the acquisition of Opus Energy in the year see note 5.1 attributed to the Opus Energy CGU.
The recoverable amount of the Haven Power and Opus Energy CGUs is measured annually, based on a value-in-use calculation using the Group's established planning model.
The elements reflected in this calculation are the same as those used for the wider asset impairment review conducted by the Group as at 31 December 2017 and are disclosed in note 2.4.
Cash flows beyond the business plan period are inflated into perpetuity using a growth rate of 1%.
The carrying amount of the Haven Power CGU at 31 December 2017 was 23 million.
The expected future cash flows of the CGU were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 8.1% calculated based on independent analysis commissioned by the Group, adjusted to the specic circumstances and risk factors affecting the Group's B2B Energy Supply business.
We believe that this rate reflects the prospects for a well-established B2B Energy Supply business.
The value in use of the Haven Power CGU, including the goodwill, was signicantly in excess of its carrying amount.
The carrying amount of the Opus Energy CGU at 31 December 2017 was 366 million, including intangible assets with a net book value of 186 million as described in note 5.3.
Following the acquisition in 2017, the appropriate discount rate was assessed as being higher for Opus Energy than for Haven Power.
The expected future cash flows were discounted using a range of discount rates from the Group's central B2B Energy Supply assumption 8.1% to the rate used in the valuation of Opus Energy at the acquisition date 10.7% see note 5.3.
The application of discount rates across this range does not result in a recoverable amount for Opus Energy below its carrying amount.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis of the estimates of future cash flows of each CGU.
This analysis indicates that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, which are customer margins and supply volumes, would not cause an impairment loss in respect of goodwill.
150 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 SECTION 5: OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 5.3 INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets are not physical in nature but are identiable and separable from other assets.
Intangible assets can be acquired in business combinations such as the acquisition of Opus Energy during 2017 or purchased separately.
The Group routinely purchases computer software and carbon emissions allowances, which are considered intangible assets.
Accounting policy Intangibles acquired in business combinations are measured at fair value on the acquisition date.
Other intangible assets are measured at cost.
Cost comprises the purchase price net of any discount or rebate and any directly attributable costs to bring the asset into the condition and location required for use as intended by management.
Intangible assets are amortised over their anticipated useful lives.
Useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
No changes to useful lives were made as at 31 December 2017.
Amortisation calculations are specic to each category of assets and are explained in further detail below.
Carrying amounts are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
The customer-related assets and brand are attributed to the Opus Energy CGU and details of the impairment test relating to this CGU are included in note 5.2. significant estimation uncertainty The valuation of the intangible assets recognised on the acquisition of Opus Energy is dependent upon a number of assumptions.
The most significant of these assumptions are explained under each of the asset headings below.
CustomerComputer Development related assets Brand software assets Carbon Total m m m m m m Cost and carrying amount: At 1 January 2016 11.8 11.8 Utilised in period 11.8 11.8 Additions at cost 0.7 0.7 Acquisition of OCGT projects 21.0 21.0 At 1 January 2017 21.0 0.7 21.7 Transferred from PPE 39.4 39.4 Utilised in period 0.7 0.7 Additions at cost 16.0 16.0 Acquisition of Opus Energy note 5.1 211.0 11.3 2.6 224.9 At 31 December 2017 211.0 11.3 58.0 21.0 301.3 Accumulated amortisation At 1 January 2016 Charge for period At 1 January 2017 Transferred from PPE 25.0 25.0 Acquisition of Opus Energy 0.7 0.7 Charge for period 35.6 1.1 6.9 43.6 At 31 December 2017 35.6 1.1 32.6 69.3 Net book value At 31 December 2016 21.0 0.7 21.7 At 31 December 2017 175.4 10.2 25.4 21.0 232.0 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 151 5.3 INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED Customer-related assets Customer-related assets reflect the value of customer contracts acquired on the acquisition of Opus Energy in February 2017, which provided the Group with access to a broad customer base with contracted cash flows.
The asset valuation of 211 million reflects the estimated acquisition-date value of the future cash flows associated with this customer base and is dependent upon estimates of both current and expected future contract margins and assumed customer retention rates.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.7%.
The asset has a useful life of 11 years, calculated based on customer churn-rate analysis, and is being amortised on a reducing balance basis to reflect the diminishing rate of contract renewals over time.
Opus Energy brand The Opus Energy brand was acquired as part of the acquisition in February 2017 and valued at 11 million on a relief-from-royalty method.
Thebrand is being amortised on a straight-line basis over its assumed 10 year useful life.
Computer software In light of continued investment and the increased signicance of the carrying amount, the Groups software assets are presented separately within intangible assets 2016: included within tangible xed assets, see note 3.1.
Additions in the period include assets acquired in the Opus Energy acquisition in addition to those in the ordinary course of business, which principally reflect ongoing investment in business systems to support the B2B Energy Supply segment.
Software assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging between three and five years.
Computer software assets in the course of construction of 11.1 million at 31 December 2017 2016: nil were capitalised in the year.
Development assets The development assets arose on the acquisition of four Open Cycle Gas Turbine projects in December 2016 and reflect the value of planning and consents acquired as part of that transaction.
Until operations commence, the assets are considered to have an indefinite life and thus are not amortised and will be subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date.
At 31 December 2017, the recoverable amount of the development assets was established using a value-in-use calculation derived from the Group's established planning model, consistent with the approach described in note 2.4.
The assessment incorporated assumptions related to likely capacity market clearing prices, construction costs, the ongoing revenues to be derived from the projects once constructed and the direct costs of generating those revenues.
The analysis indicated a recoverable amount for the development assets in excess of their carrying amount.
Carbon assets Carbon assets arise on the purchase of CO emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated under the Emissions Trading Scheme 2 and required for the current financial year, and are measured at cost, net of any impairment.
Given their short tenor, carbon assets are not amortised.
The charge to the income statement, within fuel costs, reflects the cost of emissions allowances required to satisfy the obligation for the current year and takes into account generation and market purchases allocated to the current financial year, and to the extent further purchases are required, the market price at the balance sheet date.
Post balance sheet events The 2021 T-4 capacity market auction closed in February 2018 at a clearing price of 8.40 KW.
The Group secured agreements to provide a total of 1,217MW of capacity from two existing coal units, worth a total of 10 million for the period October 2021 to September 2022.
Two of the Groups Open Cycle Gas Turbine OCGT projects also participated in the auction but exited above the clearing price.
The Group will continue to develop these options with an expectation that they will go on to participate in the next T-4 auction.
This outcome does not change the Groups view of the recoverable amount of the existing investments in the OCGT projects see above or the fair value of the contingent consideration that may become payable following future capacity market outcomes see note 3.6.
152 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 SECTION 5: OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 5.4 PROVISIONS We make provision for reinstatement to cover the estimated costs of decommissioning and demolishing our generation assets and remediating the site at the end of the useful economic lives of the assets.
The amount represents the present value of the expected costs.
Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Specically, provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Groups generating assets, when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis.
The amount provided represents the present value of the expected costs.
In view of the uncertainty of assessing the amount of any proceeds from the disposal of the assets at the decommissioning date, no reduction in the provision is made for any such proceeds.
The discount rate used is a risk-free pre-tax rate of 1.8% 2016: 1.9%, reflecting the fact that the estimated future cash flows have built-in risks specic to the liability.
An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets.
The unwinding of the discount is included in interest payable and similar charges.
The balance also includes a small provision in respect of dilapidation provisions for leased ofces acquired in the Opus Energy transaction in 2017.
Provisions m Carrying amount: At 1 January 2017 35.0 Additions 0.3 Acquisition of Opus Energy 0.3 Adjustment for changes in assumptions 0.1 Unwinding of discount 0.6 At 31 December 2017 36.3 The decommissioning provision is based on the assumption that the decommissioning and reinstatement will take place at the end of the expected useful life of the power station in 2039, and has been estimated using existing technology at current prices based on independent third-party advice, updated on a triennial basis.
The most recent update took place in December 2017.
Post balance sheet events Subsequent to the year end, on 8 February 2018 the Group announced its intention to close the headquarters of the Pellet Production business in Atlanta, Georgia and move these functions to a location closer to the operational sites in Monroe, Louisiana.
No amounts have been included in respect of this decision in these financial statements.
