Exceptional items continued Other property losses Property impairment relates to the situation in which, owing to poor trading performance, pubs are unlikely to generate sufficient cash in the future to justify their current book value.
In the year, an exceptional charge of 1,703,000 2016: 2,163,000 was incurred in respect of the impairment of assets as required under IAS 36.
This comprises an impairment charge of 2,530,000 2016: 2,513,000, offset by impairment reversals of 827,000 2016: 350,000.
The onerous lease provision relates to pubs for which future trading profits, or income from subleases, are not expected to cover the rent.
The provision takes several factors into account, including the expected future profitability of the pub and also the amount estimated as payable on surrender of the lease, where this is a likely outcome.
In the year, 380,000 2016: 28,000 was charged net in respect of onerous leases.
All exceptional items listed above generated a net cash inflow of 12,214,000 2016: inflow of 13,959,000.
Exceptional finance income During the year, the company transferred two of its interest-rate swaps to other banks.
Transferring the swaps has not changed, in any way, the terms, conditions or future cash flows of the swaps.
The bank which originally issued the swaps paid the company 402,000 compensation for agreeing to the transfer.

Income tax expense continued b Reconciliation of the total tax charge The tax expense after exceptional items in the income statement for the year is higher 2016: higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19.67% 2016: 20%, owing largely to less expenditure qualifying for capital allowances.
On 6 September 2016, the UK corporate tax rate of 17% for 1 April 2020 onwards was substantively enacted.
As a result, the deferred tax liability which predominantly unwinds in periods on or after 1 April 2020 has been remeasured from 18% to 17%.
This has resulted in a one-off credit of 4.2m.

The Finance Act 2016 reduced the rate further to 17% for the financial year beginning 1 April 2020.
These changes have been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are consequently included in these financial statements.

Assumptions are used about sales, costs and profit, using a pre-tax discount rate for future years of 8% 2016: 8%.
If the value, based on the higher of future anticipated cash flows and fair value, is lower than the book value, the difference is written off as property impairment.
As a result of this exercise, a net impairment loss of 7,607,000 2016: 4,809,000 was charged to property losses in the income statement, as described in note 4.
Management believes that a reasonable change in any of the key assumptions, for example the discount rate applied to each pub, could cause the carrying value of the pub to exceed its recoverable amount, but that the change would be immaterial.

Capital risk management The companys capital structure comprises shareholders equity and loans.
The objective of capital management is to ensure that the company is able to continue as a going concern and provide shareholders with returns on their investment, while managing risk.
The company does not have a specific measure for managing capital structure: instead, the company plans its capital requirements and manages its loans, dividends and share buybacks accordingly.
The company measures loans using a ratio of net debt to EBITDA which was 3.39 times 2016: 3.47 times at the year end.
Section 2, on page 42, discusses the financial risks associated with financial instruments, including credit risk and liquidity risk.
Fair values In some cases, payments which are due to be made in the future by the company or due to be received by the company have to be given a fair value.
The table below highlights any differences between book value and fair value of financial instruments.
