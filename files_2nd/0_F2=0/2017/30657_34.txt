This is higher than the equivalent underlying effective tax rate of 24.6% forthe year ended 31 December 2016.
The effective tax rate in 2017 has benefited from the reassessment of deferred tax balances primarily in Australia and Brazil, partially offset by the reassessment of withholding tax provisions primarily in relation to Chile and South Africa, and the impact of the relative levels of profits arising in the Groups operating jurisdictions.
In future periods, it is expected that the underlying effective tax rate will remain above the United Kingdom statutory tax rate.

There are no such inclusions in the year ended 31 December 2017.
The special items and remeasurements reconciling item of $89 million 2016: $111 million relates to the net tax impact of total special items and remeasurements before tax calculated at the United Kingdom corporation tax rate less the associated tax recorded against these items and tax special items and remeasurements.

Accounting judgement The Groups tax affairs are governed by complex domestic tax legislations, international tax treaties between countries and the interpretation of these by taxauthorities and courts.
Given the many uncertainties that could arise from these factors, judgement is often required in determining the tax that is due.
Where management is aware of potential uncertainties that are judged more likely than not to result in a liability for additional tax, a provision is made for managements best estimate of the liability, determined with reference to similar transactions and, in some cases, reports from independent experts.

Cash flow projections are based on financial budgets and Life of Mine Plans 7.

132 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2017 Financial statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ITEMS iii Key sources of estimation uncertainty For assets where indicators of impairment or impairment reversal are identified, the Group performs impairment reviews to assess the recoverable amount of its operating assets principally with reference to fair value less costs of disposal, assessed using discounted cash flow models.
Mining operations are large, complex assets requiring significant technical and financial resources to operate.
Their value may be sensitive to a range of characteristics unique to each asset.
Management applies judgement in determining the assumptions that are considered to be reasonable and consistent with those that would be applied by market participants as outlined in note 38D.
Sishen The Sishen iron ore mine Iron Ore and Manganese is located in the Northern Cape Province in South Africa.
It was impaired at year end 2015 by $0.5 billion based on a recoverable amount of $1.3 billion, as a result of a deterioration in the long-term outlook for iron ore prices, which led to a reconfiguration of the Sishen pit shell to improve cash flows.
During 2017, Sishen has achieved improved levels of production and operating efficiencies.
Additionally, whilst the long-term outlook for iron ore has remained broadly unchanged since 2015, the outlook for market conditions in the nearer term has improved.
Consequently, the valuation of the Sishen mine has been assessed and the previous impairment has been reversed to the carrying value of $2.1 billion that would have been determined had no impairment loss been previously recognised, resulting in a gain of $468 million $216 million after tax and non-controlling interests.
Of the impairment reversal, $175 million has been recorded against plant and equipment, $169 million against mining properties and leases, $55 million against land and buildings and $69 million against capital works in progress, with an associated tax charge of $129 million.
The valuation, based on discounted cash flows, is sensitive to changes in input assumptions particularly in relation to future iron ore prices and South African rand foreign exchange rates.
For example, a $5 tonne increase in the long-term price forecast for iron ore equates to a $0.3 billion increase in the valuation.
The recoverable amount has been assessed under a range of valuation scenarios, incorporating downside adjustments to both operating and economic assumptions, all of which indicate headroom over the revised carrying value of $2.1 billion.
For example, under the most conservative downside case considered the headroom is $0.4 billion.
Minas-Rio The Minas-Rio iron ore project Minas-Rio Iron Ore and Manganese in Brazil was acquired in two separate transactions in 2007 and 2008.
Prior to 2016, impairment charges totalling $11.3 billion before tax were recorded against the carrying value of Minas-Rio.
The valuation was reassessed as at 31 December 2017 and the recoverable amount was considered to be in line with the carrying value of $4.2 billion.
The valuation remains sensitive to economic and operational factors that provide both upside and downside risk, including price and the scheduling of required permits and licences.
For example, a $5 tonne change in the long-term price forecast for iron ore, withall other valuation assumptions remaining the same, would change the valuation by $0.7 billion.
El Soldado In 2016, an impairment of $200 million was recorded to fully impair El Soldado Copper, following the suspension of mining operations in February 2017 due to licensing uncertainty.
In March 2017, the Group was notified that ElSoldados mine permit application had been rejected by the Chilean mining authorities.
Following an appeal, the mining permit was approved and mining operations were resumed in April 2017.
As a result of the receipt of the permit, an impairment reversal of $194 million $65 million after tax and noncontrolling interests has been recorded.

Where the amount to be capitalised cannot be specifically identified it is determined based on the volume of waste extracted compared with expected volume for the identified component of the orebody.
This determination is dependent on an individual mines design and Life of Mine Plan and therefore changes to the design or Life ofMine Plan will result in changes to these estimates.

INVENTORIES Overview Inventories represent goods held for sale in the ordinary course of business finished products, ore being processed into a saleable condition work in progress and spares, raw materials and consumables to be used in the production process raw materials and consumables.
US$ million 2017 2016 Raw materials and consumables 817 882 Work in progress 1,703 1,220 Finished products 1,921 1,625 4,441 3,727 Further information The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in cost of sales amounted to $16,264 million 2016: $14,006 million.
The write-down of inventories to net realisable value net of revaluation of provisionally priced purchases amounted to $105 million 2016: $96 million.
Accounting judgements Accounting for inventory involves the use of judgements and estimates, particularly related to the measurement and valuation of work in progress inventory within the production process.
Certain estimates, including expected metal recoveries and work in progress volumes, are calculated by engineers using available industry, engineering and scientific data.
Estimates used are periodically reassessed by the Group taking into account technical analysis and historical performance.
Accounting policy See note 38E for the Groups accounting policy on inventories.
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES Overview Trade receivables are amounts due from the Groups customers for commodities and services the Group has provided.
Many of the Groups sales are provisionally priced, which means that the price is finalised at a date after the sale takes place.
When there is uncertainty about the final amount that will be received, the receivable is marked to market based on the forward price.
This balance also includes amounts receivable for VAT and other indirect taxes, prepaid expenses and amounts receivable from others for non-sale transactions.

The overdue debtor ageing profile is typical of the industry in which certain of the Groups businesses operate.
Given this, theuse of payment security instruments including letters of credit from acceptable financial institutions, and the nature of the related counterparties, these amounts areconsidered recoverable.
The historical level of customer default is minimal and as a result the credit quality of year end trade receivables is considered tobe high.
Trade receivables do not incur any interest, are principally short-term in nature and are measured at their nominal value with the exception of receivables relating to provisionally priced sales, as set out in the revenue recognition accounting policy, see note 38C, net of appropriate provision for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Such provisions are raised based on an assessment of debtor ageing, past experience or known customer circumstances.

TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES Overview Trade and other payables include amounts owed to suppliers, tax authorities and other parties that are typically due to be settled within 12 months.
The total also includes deferred income, which represents monies received from customers but for which we have not yet delivered the associated service.
These amounts are recognised as revenue when the service is provided.
Other payables includes deferred consideration in respect of business combinations, dividends payable to non-controlling interests and employee-related payables.

BORROWINGS Overview The Group accesses borrowings mostly in capital markets through bonds issued under the Euro Medium Term Note EMTN programme, the South African Domestic Medium Term Note DMTN programme, the Australian Medium Term Note AMTN programme and through accessing the US bond markets.
The Group uses interest rate and cross currency swaps to ensure that the majority of the Groups borrowings are floating rate US dollar denominated.
In March 2017, the Group completed a bond buyback transaction consisting of Euro and Sterling denominated bonds with maturities from April 2018 toJune2019.
The Group used $1.27 billion of cash to retire $1.25 billion of contractual repayment obligations including derivatives hedging the bonds.
In April 2017, the Group issued $300 million 3.75% senior notes due 2022 and $700 million 4.75% senior notes due 2027 through accessing the USbondmarkets.
In September 2017, the Group completed a bond buyback transaction consisting of Euro and US dollar denominated bonds with maturities from September 2018 to November 2020.
The Group used $1.93 billion of cash to retire $1.86 billion of contractual repayment obligations including derivatives hedging thebonds.
In September 2017, the Group issued $650 million 3.625% senior notes due 2024 and $650 million 4% senior notes due 2027 through accessing the US bond markets.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES Financial instruments overview For financial assets and liabilities which are traded on an active market, such as listed investments or listed debt instruments, fair value is determined by reference to market value.
For non-traded financial assets and liabilities, fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows, considered to be reasonable and consistent with those that would be used by a market participant, and based on observable market data where available for example forward exchange rate, interest rate or commodity price curve, unless carrying value is considered to approximate fair value.
Where discounted cash flow models based on managements assumptions are used, the resulting fair value measurements are considered to be at level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, as defined in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, as they depend to a significant extent on unobservable valuation inputs.
All derivatives that have been designated into hedge relationships have been separately disclosed.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES continued Fair value hierarchy Valuation technique Level 1 Valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.
This category includes listed equity shares and quoted futures.
Level 2 Instruments in this category are valued using valuation techniques where all of the inputs that have a significant effect onthe valuation are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.
This category includes provisionally priced trade receivables and payables and over-the-counter derivatives.
Level 3 Instruments in this category have been valued using a valuation technique where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data.
Where inputs can be observed from market data without undue cost and effort, the observed input is used.
Otherwise, management determines a reasonable estimate for the input.
This category includes contingent consideration, receivables relating to disposals and unlisted equity investments.
The movements in the fair value of the level 3 financial assets and liabilities are shown as follows: Assets Liabilities US$ million 2017 2016 2017 2016 At 1 January 270 109 125 555 Net profit loss recorded in the income statement 2 3 17 39 Net profit recorded in the statement of comprehensive income 34 31 Additions 19 131 136 Settlements and disposals 59 526 Currency movements 18 2 4 1 At 31 December 284 270 112 125 For the level 3 financial assets and liabilities, changing certain estimated inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions does not change the fair value significantly.
Further information on financial instruments Borrowings designated in fair value hedges represent listed debt which is held at amortised cost, adjusted for the fair value of the hedged interest rate risk.
Thefair value of these borrowings is $11,900 million 2016: $12,405 million, which is measured using quoted indicative broker prices and consequently categorised as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The carrying value of the remaining borrowings at amortised cost of $475 million 2016: $832 million, principally comprising bank borrowings, is considered to approximate the fair value.
Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities The Group offsets financial assets and liabilities and presents them on a net basis in the Consolidated balance sheet only where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, and the Group intends to either settle the recognised amounts on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
At 31 December 2017, certain over-the-counter derivatives entered into by the Group and recognised at fair value through profit and loss are both subject toenforceable ISDA master netting arrangements and intended to be settled on a net basis.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, the positions of these derivatives have been offset: those in an asset position totalling $62 million 2016: $45 million were offset against those in a liability position totalling $165 million 2016: $57 million.
The net liability position of $103 million 2016: $12 million is presented within derivative liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet.
Derivatives overview The Group utilises derivative instruments to manage certain market risk exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes, however it may choose not to designate certain derivatives as hedges for accounting purposes.
Such derivatives are classified as Held for trading and fair value movements are recorded in the Consolidated income statement.
The use of derivative instruments is subject to limits and the positions are regularly monitored and reported to senior management.
Fair value hedges The majority of interest rate swaps taken out to swap the Groups fixed rate borrowings to floating rate, in accordance with the Groups policy have been designated as fair value hedges.
The carrying value of the hedged debt is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the impact on its fair value of changes in market interest rates.
Changes in the fair value of the hedged debt are offset against fair value changes in the interest rate swap and recognised in the Consolidated income statement as financing remeasurements.
Recognised in the Consolidated income statement is a gain on fair value hedged items of $203million 2016: $98 million, offset by a loss on fair value hedging instruments of $213million 2016:$106 million.
Held for trading The Group may choose not to designate certain derivatives as hedges.
This may occur where the Group is economically hedged but IAS 39 hedge accounting cannot be achieved or where gains and losses on both the derivative and hedged item naturally offset in the Consolidated income statement, as is the case for certain cross currency swaps of non-US dollar debt.
Fair value changes on these derivatives are recognised in the Consolidated income statement as remeasurements or within underlying earnings in accordance with the policy set out in note 8.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES continued Further information on derivatives Fair value of derivative positions The fair value of the Groups open derivative positions at 31 December excluding normal purchase and sale contracts held off balance sheet, recorded within Derivative financial assets and Derivative financial liabilities, is as follows: Current Non-current 2017 2016 2017 2016 US$ million Asset Liability Asset Liability Asset Liability Asset Liability Derivatives hedging net debt Fair value hedge Interest rate swaps 21 9 286 58 474 10 Held for trading Forward foreign currency contracts 7 10 10 9 Cross currency swaps 209 178 23 409 1,665 Debit valuation adjustment to derivative liabilities 1 9 72 28 219 19 186 309 458 474 1,603 Other derivatives 53 117 90 86 2 10 Total derivatives 81 336 109 272 309 460 484 1,603 Other derivatives primarily relate to forward foreign currency contracts hedging capital expenditure, forward commodity contracts and other commodity contracts that are accounted for as Held fortrading.
These marked to market valuations are not predictive of the future value of the hedged position, nor of the future impact on the profit of the Group.
The valuations represent the cost of closing all hedge contracts at 31 December, at market prices and rates available at the time.
Accounting judgement Fair value of financial instruments Certain of the Groups financial instruments, principally derivatives, are required to be measured on the balance sheet at fair value.
Where a quoted market price for an identical instrument is not available, a valuation model is used to estimate the fair value based on the net present value of the expected cash flows under the contract.
Valuation assumptions are usually based on observable market data for example forward foreign exchange rate, interest rate or commodity price curves where available.
Accounting policies See notes 38D and 38F for the Groups accounting policies on financial asset investments, impairment of financial assets, derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting.
New IFRS accounting standards not yet adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments The impact of applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments for the year ended 31 December 2017 would have been to reduce the Groups opening retained earnings at 1January 2017 by $18 million, to decrease the Groups operating costs by $17 million and increase the Groups profit before tax and underlying earnings by $17million for the year ended 31 December 2017.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Overview The Board approves and monitors the risk management processes, including documented treasury policies, counterparty limits and controlling and reporting structures.
The risk management processes of the Groups independently listed subsidiaries are in line with the Groups own policy.
The types of risk exposure, the way in which such exposure is managed and quantification of the level of exposure in the Consolidated balance sheet at 31December is as follows: liquidityrisk: credit risk: commodity price risk: foreign exchange risk: and interest rate risk.
Liquidity risk The Group ensures that there are sufficient committed loan facilities including refinancing, where necessary in order to meet short-term business requirements, after taking into account cash flows from operations and its holding of cash and cash equivalents, as well as any Group distribution restrictions that exist.
In addition, certain projects may be financed by means of limited recourse project finance, if appropriate.
Certain borrowing facilities within the Group are the subject of financial covenants that vary from facility to facility, but which would be considered normal for such facilities, such as the ratio of net debt to tangible net worth, and the respective borrower was in compliance with these facilities throughout 2017.
The expected undiscounted cash flows of the Groups net debt related and other financial liabilities, by remaining contractual maturity, based on conditions existing at the balance sheet date are as follows: 2017 Net debt related financial liabilities Expected Derivatives Other future interest hedging financial US$ million Borrowings payments net debt liabilities Total Amount due for repayment within one year 1,174 469 195 3,985 5,823 Greater than one year, less than two years 1,338 382 19 22 1,761 Greater than two years, less than three years 1,450 321 39 1,810 Greater than three years, less than four years 1,592 280 72 1,944 Greater than four years, less than five years 1,811 222 65 2,098 Greater than five years 4,313 513 79 228 5,133 Total due for repayment after more than one year 10,504 1,718 274 250 12,746 Total 11,678 2,187 469 4,235 18,569 2016 Net debt related financial liabilities Expected Derivatives Other future interest hedging financial US$ million Borrowings payments net debt liabilities Total Amount due for repayment within one year 1,801 466 150 3,164 5,581 Greater than one year, less than two years 1,895 460 556 31 2,942 Greater than two years, less than three years 1,686 350 121 2,157 Greater than three years, less than four years 3,090 268 180 3,538 Greater than four years, less than five years 1,460 153 166 1,779 Greater than five years 2,900 252 374 304 3,830 Total due for repayment after more than one year 11,031 1,483 1,397 335 14,246 Total 12,832 1,949 1,547 3,499 19,827 The Group had the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December: US$ million 2017 2016 Expiry date Within one year 490 660 Greater than one year, less than two years 598 1,446 Greater than two years, less than three years 7,676 1,175 Greater than three years, less than four years 6,203 Greater than four years, less than five years 244 223 9,008 9,707 Undrawn committed borrowing facilities expiring within one year include undrawn South African rand facilities equivalent to $0.3 billion 2016: $0.5 billion in respect of facilities with a 364 day maturity which roll automatically on a daily basis, unless notice isserved.
150 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2017 Financial statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NET DEBT AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 23.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will cause a loss to the Group by failing to pay its obligation.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash, trade and other receivables, investments and derivative financial instruments.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk primarily arises from these financial assets and is as follows: 2016 US$ million 2017 Cash and cash equivalents 7,800 6,051 Trade and other receivables 2,152 2,289 Financial asset investments 446 701 Derivative financial assets 390 593 10,788 9,634 The Group limits credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments through diversification of exposures with a range of financial institutions approved by the Board.
Counterparty limits are set for each financial institution with reference to credit ratings assigned by Standard & Poors, Moodys and Fitch Ratings, shareholder equity in case of relationship banks and fund size in case of asset managers.
Given the diverse nature of the Groups operations both in relation to commodity markets and geographically, and the use of payment security instruments including letters of credit from financial institutions, it does not have significant concentration of credit risk in respect of trade receivables, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The classification of trade and other receivables exclude prepayments and tax receivables and the classification of financial asset investments exclude available for sale investments.
C. Commodity price risk The Groups earnings are exposed to movements in the prices of the commodities it produces.
The Groups policy is to sell its products at prevailing market prices and is generally not to hedge commodity price risk, although some hedging may be undertaken for strategic reasons.
In such cases, the Group generally uses forward contracts and other derivative instruments to hedge the price risk.
Certain of the Groups sales and purchases are provisionally priced, meaning that the selling price is determined normally 30 to 180 days after delivery to the customer, based on quoted market prices stipulated in the contract, and as a result are susceptible to future price movements.
The exposure of the Groups financial assets and liabilities to commodity price risk is as follows: 2017 2016 Commodity price linked Commodity price linked Not Not Subject to linked to Subject to linked to price Fixed commodity price Fixed commodity US$ million movements price price Total movements price price Total Total net financial instruments excluding derivatives 262 378 6,167 5,527 421 464 8,159 7,274 Derivatives 86 320 406 28 1,254 1,282 176 378 6,487 5,933 393 464 9,413 8,556 Commodity price linked financial instruments subject to price movements include provisionally priced trade receivables and trade payables.
Commodity price linked financial instruments at fixed price include receivables and payables for commodity sales and purchases not subject to price adjustment at the balance sheet date.
D. Foreign exchange risk As a global business, the Group is exposed to many currencies principally as a result of non-US dollar operating costs and, to a lesser extent, from non-US dollar revenue.
The South African rand, Brazilian real and Australian dollar are the most significant non-US dollar currencies influencing costs.
A strengthening of the US dollar against the currencies to which the Group is exposed has a positive effect on the Groups earnings.
The Groups policy is generally not to hedge such exposures given the correlation, over the longer term, with commodity prices and the diversified nature of the Group, although exceptions can be approved bythe Group Management Committee.
In addition, currency exposures exist in respect of non-US dollar approved capital expenditure projects and non-US dollar borrowings in US dollar functional currency entities.
The Groups policy is that such exposures should be hedged subject to a review of the specific circumstances of the exposure.
Net otherfinancial liabilities excluding net debt related balances and cash in disposal groups, but including the debit valuation adjustment attributable to derivatives hedging net debt are $1,432 million.
This includes net assets of $208 million denominated in Brazilian real, and net liabilities of $217 million denominated in US dollars, $295 million denominated in Australian dollars, $305 million denominated in Chilean pesos and $568 million denominated in South African rand.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2017 151 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NET DEBT AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 23.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued E. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises due to fluctuations in interest rates which impact on the value of short-term investments and financing activities.
The Group is principally exposed to US and South African interest rates.
The Groups policy is to borrow funds at floating rates of interest given the link with economic output and therefore the correlation, over the longer term, with commodity prices.
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its debt.
In respect of financial assets, the Groups policy is to invest cash at floating rates of interest and to maintain cash reserves in short-term investments less than one year in order to maintain liquidity.
Analysis of interest rate risk associated with net debt balances and the impact of derivatives to hedge against this risk is included within the table below.
Netother financial liabilities excluding net debt related balances and cash in disposal groups, but including the debit valuation adjustment attributable to derivatives hedging net debt of $1,432 million 2016: $72 million are primarily non-interest bearing.
The table below reflects the exposure of the Groups net debt to currency and interest rate risk.

Defined benefit pension plans and post employment medical plans Characteristics of plans The majority of the defined benefit pension plans are funded.
The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group, in independently administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or local practice in the relevant jurisdiction.
The responsibility for the governance of the funded retirement benefit plans, including investment and funding decisions, lies with the Trustees of each scheme.
The unfunded liabilities are principally in relation totermination indemnity plans in Chile.
South Africa The pension plans in South Africa are in surplus.
All pension plans in South Africa are closed to new members and the majority of plans are closed to future benefit accrual.
As the plans are in surplus no employer contributions are currently being made.
The Groups provision of anti-retroviral therapy to HIV positive staff does not significantly impact the post employment medical plan liability.
United Kingdom The Group operates funded pension plans in the United Kingdom.
These plans are closed to new members and to the future accrual of benefits.
The Group iscommitted to make payments to certain United Kingdom pension plans under deficit funding plans agreed with the respective Trustees.
Other Other pension and post employment medical plans primarily comprise obligations in Chile where legislation requires employers to provide for a termination indemnity, entitling employees to a cash payment made on the termination of an employment contract.
Contributions Employer contributions are made in accordance with the terms of each plan and may vary from year to year.
Employer contributions made to funded pension plans inthe year ended 31December 2017 were $100million 2016: $105 million.
In addition, $11 million 2016: $24 million of benefits were paid to unfunded pension plans and $25 million 2016: $21 million of benefits were paid in relation topost employment medical plans.

The fair value of the assets of the funded plans was sufficient to cover 111% 2016:105% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected increases in future earnings and pensions.
The present value of unfunded obligations includes $178 million 2016: $166 million relating to active members.
All material investments are quoted.
In South Africa the asset recognised is restricted to the amount in the Employer Surplus Account.
The Employer Surplus Account is the amount that the Group is entitled to by way of a refund, taking into consideration any contingency reserves as recommended by the funds actuaries.
Actuarial assumptions The principal assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and pension charges and credits are detailed below shown as weighted averages : 2017 2016 South United South United Africa Kingdom Other Africa Kingdom Other Defined benefit pension plans Average discount rate for plan liabilities 9.6% 2.6% 5.7% 9.5% 2.6% 5.5% Average rate of inflation 6.7% 3.2% 3.0% 7.0% 3.3% 3.3% Average rate of increase of pensions in payment 6.7% 3.2% 2.8% 7.0% 3.3% 3.0% Post employment medical plans Average discount rate for plan liabilities 9.6% n a 8.0% 9.4% 2.6% 6.9% Average rate of inflation 6.7% n a 5.6% 7.0% 3.3% 5.2% Expected average increase in healthcare costs 8.4% n a 8.0% 8.8% 7.8% 8.0% The weighted average duration of the South African plans is 10 years 2016: 11 years, United Kingdom plans is 19years 2016: 19 years and plans in other regions is 13 years 2016: 14 years.
This represents the average period over which future benefit payments are expected to be made.
Mortality assumptions are determined based on standard mortality tables with adjustments, as appropriate, to reflect experience of conditions locally.
InSouth Africa, the PA90 tables are used.
The main plans in the United Kingdom use CMI tables or Club Vita models with plan specific adjustments based onmortality investigations.
Themortality tables used imply that a male or female aged 60 at the balance sheet date has the following future life expectancy shown as weighted averages : Male Female Years 2017 2016 2017 2016 South Africa 20.0 19.9 24.8 24.7 United Kingdom 27.6 28.1 29.0 29.8 Other 22.7 21.9 26.6 26.0 The table below summarises the expected life expectancy from the age of 60 for a male or female aged 45 at the balance sheet date.
When viewed together with the respective life expectancy at age 60 in the table above this indicates the anticipated improvement in life expectancy shown as weighted averages : Male Female Years 2017 2016 2017 2016 South Africa 20.0 19.9 24.8 24.7 United Kingdom 28.3 29.9 30.2 32.2 Other 24.7 23.9 28.5 27.9 158 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2017 Financial statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS EMPLOYEES 27.
RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued Risks of plans The Group has identified the main risk to its defined benefit pension schemes as being interest rate risk due to the impact on the UK discount rate assumption: Risk Description Mitigation Interest rate risk A fall in longer-term real and nominal The Trustees investment strategies vary by plan for the UK and include investing, with the interest rates expectations causes gilt intention of counter-balancing the movements in the liabilities, in fully owned fully funded yields and corporate bond yields to physical credit and gilts, and by gaining unfunded exposure to gilts via gilt repurchase decrease, which results in a lower agreements and other fixed income based derivatives to match the real and nominal interest discount rate being applied to the UK rate sensitivity of the pension scheme liabilities.
pension liabilities and so, with all else Approximately 75-100% depending on the scheme of the pension scheme liabilities are being held equal, the value of the currently hedged against movements in real and nominal interest rates.
The Trustees hedging strategies are typically designed to protect the respective schemes If the pension scheme assets do not funding plans against volatility in market yields.
Thediscount rate used to calculate any funding increase by the same amount as the requirement for the schemes is linked to gilt yields rather than to corporate bond yields as increase in the pension scheme required under IAS19.
Consequently the valuation of the net retirement benefit obligation liabilities caused by the fall in interest foraccounting purposes remains susceptible to movements in value due to the difference rates then, all else being equal, this between corporate bond and gilt yields.
In addition, since corporate bond yields are typically will result in a worsening of the higher than gilt yields, this can result in therecognition of accounting surpluses in respect of pension scheme funding position.
schemes where cash contributions continue to be made to meet funding shortfalls.
Sensitivity analysis Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of pension and medical plan liabilities are the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality.
The sensitivity analysis below has been provided by local actuaries on an approximate basis based on changes in the assumptions occurring at the end of the year, assuming that all other assumptions are held constant and the effect of interrelationships is excluded.
The effect on plan liabilities is as follows: 2017 South United US$ million Africa Kingdom Other Total Discount rate 0.5% decrease 61 398 19 478 Inflation rate pension plans 0.5% increase 42 153 11 206 Inflation rate medical plans 0.5% increase 18 4 22 Life expectancy increase by 1 year 59 178 5 242 Independent qualified actuaries carry out full valuations at least every three years using the projected unit credit method.
The actuaries have updated the valuations to 31 December 2017.
Assumptions are set after consultation with the qualified actuaries.
While management believes the assumptions used are appropriate, achange in the assumptions used would impact the Groups other comprehensive income.

EVENTS OCCURRING AFTER END OF YEAR With the exception of the completion of the sale transaction for the Union platinum mine detailed in note 32, the redemption of a bond detailed in note 21 and the proposed final dividend for 2017, there have been no reportable events since 31 December 2017.
COMMITMENTS Overview A commitment is a contractual obligation to make a payment in the future which is not provided for in the balance sheet.
The Group also has purchase obligations relating to take or pay agreements which are legally binding and enforceable.
Capital commitments for subsidiaries and joint operations relating to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment are $1,444 million 2016: $1,317million, ofwhich 50% 2016: 45% relate to expenditure to be incurred within the next year.
The Groups outstanding commitments relating to take or pay agreements are $14,698 million 2016: $15,494 million, of which 11% 2016: 8% relate to expenditure to be incurred within the next year.

Accounting policy See note 38C for the Groups accounting policy on leases.
New IFRS accounting standards not yet adopted IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 Leases will be effective for the Group from 1 January 2019.

Further information is provided in note 38A.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Overview The Group is subject to various claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
Additionally, the Group has provided indemnities against certain liabilities as part of agreements for the sale or other disposal of business operations.
Having taken appropriate legal advice, the Group believes that a material liability arising from the indemnities provided is remote.
The Group is required to provide guarantees in several jurisdictions in respect of environmental restoration and decommissioning obligations.
The Group has provided for the estimated cost of these activities.
Accounting judgement A provision is recognised where, based on the Groups legal views and, in some cases, independent advice, it is considered probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle a present obligation that can be measured reliably.

Accounting judgements Joint arrangements Joint arrangements are classified as joint operations or joint ventures according to the rights and obligations of the parties, as described in note 38I.
Judgement is required in determining this classification through an evaluation of the facts and circumstances arising from each individual arrangement.
When a joint arrangement has been structured through a separate vehicle, consideration has been given to the legal form of the separate vehicle, the terms of the contractual arrangement and, when relevant, other facts and circumstances.
When the activities of an arrangement are primarily designed for the provision of output to the parties and, the parties are substantially the only source of cash flows contributing to the continuity of the operations of the arrangement, this indicates that the parties to the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities.
Certain joint arrangements that are structured through separate vehicles including Collahuasi, Debswana and Namdeb are accounted for as joint operations.
These arrangements are primarily designed for the provision of output to the parties sharing joint control, indicating that the parties have rights to substantially all the economic benefits of the assets.
The liabilities of the arrangements are in substance satisfied by cash flows received from the parties: this dependence indicates that the parties effectively have obligations for the liabilities.
It is primarily these facts and circumstances that give rise to the classification as joint operations.
