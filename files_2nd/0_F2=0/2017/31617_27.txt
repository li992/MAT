Risk appetite is approved for balance sheet risks by the Board, with authority delegated to ALCO for subsequent implementation and monitoring.
The Board has established a range of measures of risk appetite for capital including CET1, leverage and minimum holdings of capital.
Measures for funding and liquidity risks consider the structure of the balance sheet and include, among others, measures relating to the proportion of customer funding, the Groups overall funding profile and an overall liquidity adequacy rule OLAR.
The OLAR covers the Boards appetite in relation to regulatory liquidity requirements and also covers the need to maintain access to liquidity resources sufficient to accommodate outflows of funds in a range of stress scenarios over a threemonth period.

The Group is currently excluded from the full reporting requirements of the UK leverage ratio framework.
The leverage ratio is monitored against a Board set RAS with the responsibility for managing the ratio delegated to ALCO, which monitors it on a monthly basis.
CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 159 Risk report Balance sheet and prudential regulation risks The leverage ratio is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to total exposure, defined as: capital: Tier 1 capital defined according to CRD IV on an end point basis assuming the full impact of CRD IV requirements on Tier 1 capital were in force with no transitional provisions : and exposures: total onand off-balance sheet exposures subject to credit conversion factors as defined in the delegated act amending CRR article 429 Calculation of the Leverage Ratio, which includes deductions applied to Tier 1 capital.
Other regulatory adjustments consist of adjustments that are required under CRD IV to be deducted from Tier 1 capital.
The removal of these from the exposure measure ensures consistency is maintained between the capital and exposure components of the ratio.
The Groups leverage ratio is 6.3% which exceeds the Basel Committees proposed minimum of 3%, applicable from 2018.
The UK leverage ratio framework, which came in to force on 1 January 2016, is relevant to PRA regulated banks and building societies with consolidated retail deposits equal to or greater than 50bn.
The Group is currently excluded from these requirements.
On 3 October 2017, the PRA published a policy statement UK Leverage Ratio treatment of claims on central banks.
The PRA Rulebook has been amended to: align with its July 2016 modification by consent to exclude central bank claims matched by deposits in the same currency and of identical or longer maturity from the definition of the total leverage exposure measure in the UK leverage ratio framework: increase the minimum leverage ratio requirement from 3% to 3.25% of total exposures: and align the UK leverage ratio reporting and disclosure requirements to the proposed definition of the total exposure measure and 3.25% minimum leverage ratio requirement.
If these modifications are applied to the Group, this results in an increase in the leverage ratio from 6.3% under CRD IV to 7.4% on the PRA modified basis as a result of the Groups significant exposures to central banks within its liquid asset portfolio and Note cover.
Funding and liquidity risk Funding risk relates to the impact on the Groups strategy of being unable to raise funds from customers and the wholesale markets of sufficient quantity and of appropriate mix and tenor.
An inability to raise sufficient funds may lead to a reduction in lending growth or a requirement to raise the price paid for deposits, both outcomes having an adverse effect on shareholder value.
Where funding risk manifests itself in an adverse effect on mix and tenor, for example, a high proportion of short-term wholesale deposits, there is an increased liquidity risk to the Group.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its current and future financial obligations as they fall due at acceptable cost.
These obligations include the repayment of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity dates, the repayment of borrowings and loan capital as they mature, the payment of operating expenses and tax, the payment of dividends and the ability to fund new and existing loan commitments.
Risk assessment The framework for the Groups approach to funding risk leads to the development of a Group funding plan that is subject to approval by the Board and is consistent with risk appetite and the Groups strategic objectives.
The development of the Groups funding plan is informed by the requirements of the Groups Balance Sheet Risk Policy Standards.
Liquidity risk exposures are subject to assessment under both regulatory and internal requirements.
Exposures relate to the outflow of funds under a series of stress scenarios less the impact of inflows from assets, liquidation of high-quality liquid assets or through other actions instigated by the Group.
Liquidity within the Group is managed in accordance with the ILAAP that is approved by the Board.
The ILAAP documents the manner in which the Group meets its OLAR which covers all regulatory and internal liquidity requirements.
In addition, the Group has a policy standard which details, among other items, the control standards and risk measurement requirements for liquidity, authorities and responsibilities.
Oversight of liquidity risk is undertaken by ALCO.
To meet the requirements of regulatory authorities the liquidity of the Group is managed on a daily basis using a combination of cumulative cash flow mismatch, scenario analysis and stress tests to ensure that normal daily cash requirements are met and to ensure adequate sources of liquidity are available to support unforeseen cash outflows.
ALCO delegates daily management responsibilities to the Treasury function within agreed tolerances.
All balance sheet risks are subject to independent oversight from the second line balance sheet and liquidity risk oversight function.
160 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information Stress testing of the Groups liquidity risk is undertaken on a frequent basis and results are provided to ALCO and the Board.
The ILAAP is used to establish key risk drivers and assumptions for liquidity risk and these provide the framework for ongoing stress testing.
Stress testing considers the impact of severe yet plausible scenarios to consider the potential impact on the Groups funding and liquidity profile.
The Group holds a portfolio of high-quality assets that acts as a buffer against the impact of liquidity risk.
Funding plans take a long-term view and these consider the impact of prolonged periods of market disruption in order to identify potential vulnerabilities in the profile of the Groups funding.
A Contingency Funding Plan has been established for management of an escalated liquidity requirement if the Group experiences either restricted access to wholesale funding or a large increase in the withdrawal of funds.
The plan identifies triggers for escalation, details the action required, allocates the key tasks to individuals, provides a time frame and defines a management committee to manage the action plan.
The Group has a number of different sources of funding which are considered to be well diversified in terms of the type of instrument and product, counterparty, term structure and market.
The Group can source funding through a range of channels including the following: customer deposits: access to short-term money market funding: term structured funding through Lanark residential mortgage securitisation programme owner occupied : Lannraig BTL mortgage securitisation programme: regulated covered bond RCB programme: senior unsecured funding: and access to facilities within the BoE Sterling Monetary Framework and the TFS the TFS closes to new drawings in February 2018.
The Groups securitisation and covered bond programmes offer investors the opportunity to purchase mortgage-backed debt.
These sources are focused on a range of different investors and depositors with a range of maturities.
Funding is typically raised in GBP, USD and EUR and is swapped back to GBP to fund the predominantly GBP balance sheet.
Monitoring The Treasury function is responsible for the development and execution of strategy subject to oversight from the risk management function.
In relation to funding and liquidity risk, the primary management committee is ALCO.
ALCO meets monthly and reports to the Executive Risk Committee.
The Group continues to have a strong funding and liquidity position and seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between profitability and liquidity risk.
Funding is predominantly provided by Retail and SME customers and this is supported by medium-term secured funding issuance from the Groups Lanark and Lannraig securitisation programmes, and its RCB platform and TFS.
These funding programmes are a source of strength for the Group and leverage the Groups high-quality mortgage book as a source of collateral for secured funding.
The Group monitors liquidity and funding with reference to a number of measures including LCR, LDR and NSFR see financial results section.

At 30 September 2017, the Group had a funding requirement of 39,722m 2016: 36,111m with the primary funding requirement being to support loans and advances to customers.
Due to customers The majority of the Groups funding requirement was met by customer deposits of 27,718m 2016: 27,090m.
Customer deposits are comprised of non-interest bearing demand deposits, interest bearing deposits and term deposits from a range of sources including Retail, SME and other corporate customers.
The increase of 628m in 2017 was predominantly due to growth in non-interest bearing deposits 388m and term deposits 503m offset by a managed reduction in higher rate interest bearing deposits 198m.
Due to other banks and debt securities in issue wholesale funding Due to other banks of 3,817m 2016: 1,309m was primarily comprised of: 1,864m of securities sold under agreement to repurchase: and 1,901m of drawings under the TFS.
Debt securities in issue of 4,785m 2016: 4,501m was primarily comprised of: 2,834m of residential mortgage-backed securities issued through the Groups Lanark programme: 327m of securities issued through the Groups BTL securitisation programme Lannraig : 700m of regulated covered bonds: 300m of senior debt: and 475m of subordinated debt.
Equity Equity of 3,402m 2016: 3,211m was also used to meet the Groups funding requirement.
Equity is comprised of ordinary share capital, retained earnings, other equity investments and a number of other reserves.
For full details on equity refer to section 4 of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.
External credit ratings The Groups credit ratings have remained unchanged over the past year.
S&P assigns a long-term credit rating of BBBto the Group, two notches below that of Clydesdale Bank PLC, reflecting their non-operating holding company methodology.
Fitch assigns an issuer default rating of BBB, in line with that of Clydesdale Bank PLC, again reflecting their holding company methodology.
Fitch announced the outcome of their annual review of Clydesdale Bank PLC and CYBG PLC ratings on 7 September 2017.
All current ratings were affirmed, with a stable outlook.
On 15 September 2017, Moodys placed the long-term ratings of Clydesdale Bank PLC on review for upgrade.
The review will focus on progress in the execution of the Groups strategic plan as well as the extent to which enhancements in management, risk and control frameworks and processes have been embedded.
On 15 November 2017, S&P moved the outlook on Clydesdale Bank PLC and CYBG PLC back to stable from negative as a result of an update to an industry-wide exercise following the EU referendum.

Additional collateral to be provided in the event of a notch downgrade The Group monitors the movements in its credit ratings and the related requirement to post collateral for payment systems and clearing houses.
These figures are not considered material compared to the volume of unencumbered liquid assets.
Liquid assets The quantity and quality of the Groups liquid assets are calibrated to the Boards view of liquidity risk appetite and remain at a prudent level above regulatory requirements.
The Group was compliant with all internal and regulatory liquidity metrics at 30 September 2017.
The liquid asset portfolio provides a buffer against sudden and potentially sharp outflows of funds and liquid assets must therefore be of a high quality so they can be realised for cash and cannot be encumbered for any other purpose e. g. to provide collateral for payments systems.
Details on encumbered assets are provided in the following section.
The liquid asset portfolio is primarily comprised of cash at the BoE, UK Government Securities Gilts and listed securities e. g. bonds issued by supra-nationals and AAA rated covered bonds.

Market risk Market risk is the risk associated with adverse changes in the fair value, or accrual income and expense, of assets and liabilities held by the Group as a result of movements in market factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, volatility and credit spreads.
The Groups balance sheet is predominantly UK based and is denominated in GBP, therefore foreign exchange risk is not a major part of the Groups risk profile.
Structural interest rate risk comprises the sensitivity of the Groups current and future net interest income and economic value to movements in market interest rates.
The major contributors to interest rate risk are: the investment of non-interest bearing deposits and equity into interest-bearing assets: the mismatch between repricing dates of interest-bearing assets and liabilities: basis risk, for example, the inability of the pricing basis for customer asset and liability products to be replicated in the financial markets or the risk arising from changing relationships between different interest rate yield curves: and customer optionality, e. g. the right to repay borrowing in advance of contract maturity dates.
CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 167 Risk report Balance sheet and prudential regulation risks Exposures The focus of the Groups activity is to provide high-quality banking services to its customers.
These services include the provision of foreign exchange products and derivative products to enable customers to manage risks within their businesses.
As a result of these activities, the Group may be exposed to forms of market risk that would arise from movements in price on these products.
Controls include the hedging of these products as and when they arise.
Measurement Interest rate risk in the banking book IRRBB is measured, monitored, and managed from both an internal management and regulatory perspective.
The RMF incorporates both market valuation and earnings-based approaches.
In accordance with the Group IRRBB Policy Standard.
risk measurement techniques include: basis point sensitivity: value at risk VaR, earnings at risk EaR, interest rate risk stress testing, repricing analysis, cash flow analysis, and scenario analysis.
The key features of the internal interest rate risk management model are: the use of basis point sensitivity analysis: VaR and EaR are measured on a statistical basis: 99% confidence level with appropriate holding periods depending on varying risk types: historical simulation approach utilising instantaneous interest rate shocks including parallel rate movements and twists in the yield curve to explore risks around exposures to movements in shortor long-term interest rates: static balance sheet i. e. any new business is assumed to be matched, hedged or subject to immediate repricing : investment term for capital is modelled with a benchmark term agreed by ALCO: investment term for core non-interest bearing assets and liabilities is modelled on a behavioural basis with a benchmark term agreed by ALCO: and assumptions covering the behavioural life of products and customer behaviour for optionality are reviewed and approved by ALCO.
Foreign exchange risk is assessed based on the absolute exposure in each currency.
Mitigation measures Market risks are overseen by ALCO with delegation for day-to-day management given to Treasury.
Treasury use a number of techniques and products to manage market risks including interest rate swaps, cash flow netting and foreign exchange.
Basis risk is managed through a combination of wholesale market basis risk management products, pricing strategies and product innovation.
As part of an objective to secure stable and optimal net interest income over both a 12-month period and over the long term, mismatch risk can be minimised with the investment of equity and non-interest bearing deposits targeting the stability of net interest income.
The use of derivatives gives rise to the need to apportion transactions into hedge relationships.
Fair value hedges The Group hedges part of its existing interest rate risk, resulting from potential movements in the fair value of fixed rate assets and liabilities.
The fair value of these swaps is disclosed in note 3.18.
There were no transactions for which fair value hedge accounting had to be discontinued in the year.
Cash flow hedges The Group hedges a portion of the variability in future cash flows attributable to interest rate and foreign currency risk.
The interest and foreign currency risk arise from variable interest rate assets and liabilities which are hedged using cross currency and interest rate swaps, and material non-GBP denominated assets which are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts.
There were no transactions for which cash flow hedge accounting had to be discontinued in the period as a result of the highly probable cash flows no longer being expected to occur.
The fair value of derivatives is disclosed in note 3.18.

Material changes require the approval of ALCO.
Oversight of market risk is conducted by the Groups balance sheet and liquidity risk oversight team that is independent of the Treasury function.
The Board and Executive Risk Committee, through ALCOs oversight, monitors risk to ensure it remains within approved policy limits and Board requirements.

Clydesdale Bank PLC is the Schemes principal employer and there are no other participating employers.
Following a consultation process the Scheme was closed to future accrual on 1 August 2017 for the majority of members.
A small number of members elected to keep DB accruals subject to making an increased contribution to the Scheme and to also forego other remuneration benefits.
DB pension schemes provide a promise to pay members a pre-determined level of income at retirement which is independent of the contributions and investment returns assets used to fund these benefit promises collectively the liabilities.
As such, there are significant risks associated with managing a DB scheme.
These risks will continue until the Scheme is formally wound up, either in the event that all the liabilities are transferred to a third party for example an insurer or once all individual member benefits are paid.
The Schemes assets are held under a separate trust and the Scheme is managed by a corporate Trustee Board independently of the Group, per the Scheme Trust Deed and Rules.
Therefore, the Groups ability to directly manage the Scheme is limited to certain powers within the governing documentation.
Aside from the Groups role to sponsor the Scheme to ensure there are sufficient assets to meet benefit payments as they fall due, the Groups focus is directed on mitigating the impact on capital and earnings through working with the trustee to implement risk reduction initiatives.
Several activities have been implemented since 2003 with the specific aim of reducing risk in the Scheme, including a fide-risking journey plan, benefit reforms and the outcome of the 2017 consultation on future accruals.
The principal cause of risk within the Scheme is the difference between the assets and the liabilities.
The assets are exposed to market valuation movements, within and between asset classes, while the liabilities are more sensitive to interest rate and inflation rate changes, and changes in other actuarial assumptions which may not be borne out in experience, for example life expectancy.
There are various bases, with differing assumptions, for measuring the Scheme liabilities whereas Scheme assets are consistently valued at current market values.
The two key bases used to value DB scheme liabilities are IAS 19, a standardised accounting measure which is the basis for income statement, balance sheet and capital reporting, and the Trustees Technical Provisions basis which determines the cash funding contributions to the Scheme to repair any deficit agreed as part of a triennial valuation.
The IAS 19 valuation is disclosed in note 3.16.
The rate used to discount the liabilities on the IAS 19 basis is a key driver of volatility and, as prescribed by IAS 19, is based on yields on high-quality corporate bonds.
Therefore, the IAS 19 valuation can move adversely because of low rates and narrowing credit spreads.
Inflation is another key source of volatility.
This is because member benefits have an element of index linking and therefore the liabilities increase with rises in long-term inflation assumptions, although in practice, over the long term, the relationship between interest and inflation rates tends to be negatively correlated resulting in a degree of risk offset.
The triennial valuation the valuation uses the Trustees actuarial assumptions and a liability discount rate based on gilt yields.
The last formal valuation indicated a deficit of 290m as at 30 September 2016 after allowing for changes to future accrual from 1 August 2017, a reduction from the 30 September 2013 reported deficit of 450m.
There has been no change to the deficit reduction schedule agreed with the Trustees in June 2014, with a further payment of 50m in May 2017, to be followed by payments of 50m in each year ending 31 March 2019, 31 March 2020, 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2022.
A payment of 55m is due in the year ending 31 March 2023.
Details of retirement benefit obligations are included in section 3.16 of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.
