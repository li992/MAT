Underlying adjusted operating cash flow makes further adjustments for foreign exchange and the commodity price movements that most impact the Group, which are outside its control, along with other material one-off items, to provide a comparable year-on-year measure of cash generation that more closely reflects business performance.
The calculation has been amended to make adjustments to rebase adjusted operating cash flow to reflect the prevailing foreign exchange andcommodity prices in 2015 rather than those in the current reporting period.
This provides a fixed reference point and prevents the need tocontinually recalculate the comparative periods and allows management to measure underlying adjusted operating cash flow growth since 2015, the announcement of the Strategic Review.

In 2015, the commodity price has been adjusted to exclude the impacts of hedging prior to 2015 to ensure the operating cash flow reflects the prevailing average commodity price in 2015. ii The foreign exchange movement has been calculated by applying the average 2015 rate to the 2017 and 2016 adjusted operating cash flow net of taxation of entities with functional currencies other than GBP.
Underlying adjusted operating cash flow is adjusted operating cash flow as defined in note 2 and reconciled in note 4 f. It has been adjusted for the impacts of commodity price movements on Exploration & Production E&P and nuclear assets and foreign exchange movements.
Ithas also been adjusted for one-off working capital movements in UK Business.
This follows billing performance issues after the implementation of a new system in 2014, impacting the Groups ability to collect cash from customers and therefore its adjusted operating cash flow.
As a consequence, the working capital movement for UK Business has been removed from underlying adjusted operating cash flow.
