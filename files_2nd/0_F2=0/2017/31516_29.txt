MERLIN ENTERTAINMENTS PLC 101 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS SECTION I BASIS OF PREPARATION 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016 1.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION Merlin Entertainments plc the Company is a public company limited by shares which is incorporated in the United Kingdom and its registered office is Link House, 25 West Street, Poole, Dorset BH15 1LD.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRS and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company continues to prepare its parent Company financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
This section sets out the Groups accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole.
Where an accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy is described in the note to which it relates.
The accounting policies have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and have been applied consistently by all subsidiaries and joint ventures.
The Group prepares its annual consolidated financial statements on a 52 or 53 week basis.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments and certain investments which are measured at their fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling.
All values are stated in million m except where otherwise indicated.
Going concern The Group reported a profit for the year of 209 million 2016: 211 million and generated operating cash inflows of 413 million 2016: 433 million.
The Group is funded by senior unsecured bank facilities due for repayment in 2020 and senior unsecured notes due for repayment in 2022.
During the year an additional 200 million of the Groups notes were issued at 103.5% of their nominal value 178 million with the proceeds partly used to repay 50 million 43 million of the term debt.
It is likely in the next 18 months that the Group will look to refinance the bank facilities due for repayment in 2020.
The Groups forecasts show that it is expected to be able to operate within the terms of these facilities.
Further details of these facilities are provided in note 4.2.
After reviewing the Groups and Companys statement of financial position, available facilities, cash flow forecasts and trading budgets, including various downside sensitivities, the Directors believe the Group to be operationally and financially sound and have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the next 12 months.
Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Merlin Entertainments plc and its subsidiaries at the end of each reporting period and include its share of its joint ventures results using the equity method.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns through its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated.
Where subsidiaries enter into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, these are considered to be insurance arrangements and accounted for as such.
In this respect, the subsidiary concerned treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that it will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying net investment hedges.
The results and financial position of those Group companies that do not have a Sterling functional currency are translated into Sterling as follows: Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the end of the reporting period.
Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period.
All resulting exchange differences are recognised in equity in the translation reserve.
The reporting date foreign exchange rates by major currency are provided in note 4.3.
102 MERLIN ENTERTAINMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS SECTION I BASIS OF PREPARATION CONTINUED 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016 1.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION CONTINUED Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group Financial instruments can consist of a combination of debt and equity and the Group has to decide how to attribute values to each.
They are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: i they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group: and ii where the instrument will or may be settled in the Groups own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Groups own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Group exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability, and the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance costs.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
Judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Judgements Management consider the following areas to be the judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
They are explained in more detail in the related notes: Useful life of brands note 3.2 where a brand has been recognised as part of an acquisition they have been assessed as having indefinite useful lives.
Goodwill impairment reviews note 3.3 the level at which goodwill is initially allocated and thereafter monitored.
Estimates Management consider the following area to involve a significant degree of estimation uncertainty: Valuation of Resort Theme Parks Operating Group RTP assets and impairment note 3.3 estimation of discounted cash flows when calculating the value in use of assets.
Other non-significant areas that include a degree of estimation uncertainty are: Valuation of assets and impairment, excluding RTP note 3.3 estimation of discounted cash flows when calculating the value in use of assets.
Taxation note 2.4 recognition of deferred tax balances and accounting for tax risks.
Provisions note 3.5 estimated outflow to settle the obligation and, where relevant, the appropriate discount and inflation rates to apply.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings note 4.2 expected period of borrowings when calculating the effective interest rate on those borrowings.
Share-based payment transactions note 4.6 estimation of future performance when estimating vesting rates on share schemes.
Investments note 5.1 expected period of and eventual return on investments when calculating the effective interest rate.
Employee benefits note 5.2 assumed discount rate, inflation rate and mortality when valuing defined benefit liabilities.
While these areas do not present a significant risk resulting in a material adjustment, they are areas of focus for management.
New standards and interpretations A full list of new accounting standards and interpretations can be found in note 5.5.
This includes standards that have been implemented in the year, which have had no significant impact.
It also includes those standards that will be implemented next year or in future years, including our assessment of the potential impacts of IFRS 9 Financial instruments, IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers and IFRS 16 Leases.

106 MERLIN ENTERTAINMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS SECTION 2 RESULTS FOR THE YEAR CONTINUED 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016 2.4 TAXATION Accounting policies The tax charge for the year is recognised in the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income, according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided on certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and taxation purposes respectively.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
After considering forecast future profits, deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those assets can be utilised.
This assessment is made after considering a number of factors, including the Groups future trading expectations.
A current tax provision is recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Tax provisions are based on managements estimate of the amount of tax payable and the likelihood of settlement in relation to matters which have yet to be concluded.
These include matters arising from ongoing audits, as well as other uncertain positions.
A combination of in-house tax experts, previous experience and professional firms is used when assessing tax risks.
Current provisions represent a number of different matters arising across the various jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
It is currently unclear when these matters will be settled, but certain matters have been open for several years and may not be resolved in the coming year.

The difference between the reported ETR of 22.9% and the UK standard tax rate of 19.3% is largely attributable to the Groups geographic mix of profits and reflects higher rates in certain jurisdictions, particularly the USA, in relation to the current and prior year.
In addition, the reported rate is increased by non-deductible expenses which primarily arise as a result of depreciation on capital expenditure from continued investment in our attractions.
These factors are offset by the Groups internal financing arrangements, which have been put in place to support development and ongoing funding needs in overseas territories, and the impact of the package of measures enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act USA tax reform in the USA on 22 December 2017.
The Groups ETR has fallen from 23.8% to 22.9%.
This is driven by the USA tax reform.
The net 7 million 2.4% reduction in current year ETR comprises: i the effect of changes in tax rates 25 million as deferred tax liabilities have been revalued due to the federal tax rate reducing from 35% to 21% effective 1 January 2018: offset by ii an increase in unrecognised temporary differences 9 million resulting from new restrictions on interest deductibility: and iii other tax charges and deductions 9 million originating from revisions to the USA taxation of foreign investments.
Significant factors impacting on the Groups future ETR include the USA tax reform, the ability to continue current financing arrangements and changes to local or international tax laws.
With regard to the latter, the European Commissions preliminary findings relating to the UKs Controlled Foreign Company rules are further detailed in note 5.4.
Otherwise, the Groups future ETR will primarily be affected by the geographic mix of profits.

The remaining losses and other timing differences do not expire under current tax legislation.
The nature and location of the tax losses carried forward are such that there is currently no expectation that the losses will be utilised.
2.5 EARNINGS PER SHARE Accounting policy Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations: 2017 2016 m m Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 209 211 2017 2016 Basic weighted average number of shares 1,018,610,976 1,014,358,232 Dilutive potential ordinary shares 2,083,168 3,785,770 Diluted weighted average number of shares 1,020,694,144 1,018,144,002 Share incentive plans see note 4.6 are treated as dilutive to earnings per share when, at the reporting date, the awards are both in the money and would be issuable had the performance period ended at that date.
In 2017 and 2016, the PSP has a marginal dilutive effect as the performance measures have been partially achieved.
The DBP, CSOP and AESP are marginally dilutive as certain option tranches are in the money, after accounting for the value of services rendered in addition to the option price.

Where components of an item of PPE have different useful lives, they are accounted for separately.
The initial cost of PPE includes all costs incurred in bringing the asset into use and includes external costs for the acquisition, construction and commissioning of the asset, internal project costs primarily staff expenses and capitalised borrowing costs.
Assets acquired through business combinations At the time of a business combination PPE is separately recognised and valued.
Given the specialised nature of the PPE acquired, fair values are calculated on a depreciated replacement cost basis.
The key estimates are the replacement cost, where industry specific indices are used to restate original historic cost: and depreciation, where the total and remaining economic useful lives are considered, together with the residual value of each asset.
The total estimated lives applied are consistent with those set out below.
Residual values are based on industry specific indices.
New sites Capital expenditure on new attractions includes all the costs of bringing the items of PPE within that attraction into use ready for the opening of the attraction.
Pre-opening costs are only capitalised to the extent they are required to bring PPE into its working condition.
Other pre-opening costs are expensed as incurred.
On inception of a lease for a new site, where required, the estimated cost of decommissioning any additions is included within PPE and depreciated over the lease term.
A corresponding provision is set up as disclosed in note 3.5.
Existing sites Subsequent expenditure on items of PPE in our existing estate can be broadly split into two categories: Capital expenditure which adds new items of PPE to an attraction or which extends the operational life of, or enhances existing items of, PPE is accounted for as an addition to PPE.
Examples of such expenditure include new rides or displays and enhancements to rides or displays, which increase the appeal of our attractions to visitors.
Expenditure which is incurred to maintain the items of PPE in a safe and usable state and to maintain the useful life of items of PPE is charged to the income statement as incurred.
Examples of such expenditure include regular servicing and maintenance of buildings, rides and displays and ongoing repairs to items of PPE.
Depreciation Land is not depreciated.
Assets under construction are not depreciated until they come into use, when they are transferred to buildings or plant and equipment as appropriate.
Depreciation is then charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of PPE.
Asset lives for plant and equipment vary depending on the nature of the asset, from short life assets such as IT assets, up to long term infrastructure assets.
No residual values are typically considered.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Asset class Depreciation policy Freehold long leasehold buildings 50 years Leasehold buildings 2050 years dependent on life of lease Plant and equipment 530 years MERLIN ENTERTAINMENTS PLC 111 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Property, plant and equipment Land and Plant and Under buildings equipment construction Total m m m m Cost Balance at 27 December 2015 977 1,058 100 2,135 Acquisition of remaining share of joint venture 1 1 Additions owned assets 13 55 205 273 Movements in asset retirement provisions 5 1 6 Disposals 5 8 13 Transfers 39 86 125 Effect of movements in foreign exchange 157 116 10 283 Balance at 31 December 2016 1,186 1,309 190 2,685 Additions owned assets 10 41 278 329 Additions leased assets 98 13 111 Movements in asset retirement provisions note 3.5 2 1 3 Disposals 2 7 9 Transfers 70 188 258 Effect of movements in foreign exchange 29 23 5 57 Balance at 30 December 2017 1,335 1,522 205 3,062 Depreciation Balance at 27 December 2015 210 430 640 Depreciation for the year owned assets 38 87 125 Depreciation for the year leased assets 1 3 4 Disposals 3 7 10 Effect of movements in foreign exchange 35 50 85 Balance at 31 December 2016 281 563 844 Depreciation for year owned assets 36 105 141 Depreciation for year leased assets 4 4 8 Disposals 1 7 8 Effect of movements in foreign exchange 9 6 15 Balance at 30 December 2017 311 659 970 Carrying amounts At 27 December 2015 767 628 100 1,495 At 31 December 2016 905 746 190 1,841 At 30 December 2017 1,024 863 205 2,092 112 MERLIN ENTERTAINMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS SECTION 3 OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CONTINUED 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016 3.1 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CONTINUED Depreciation is calculated in line with the policy stated previously.
During the year the Group reviews useful economic lives and tests PPE for impairment in accordance with the Groups accounting policy, as referred to in note 3.3.
As a result no material adjustments were made in either 2016 or 2017.
The Group leases buildings and plant and equipment under finance lease agreements secured on those assets.
Additions of leased assets in the period of 111 million are in respect of the LEGOLAND Japan finance lease entered into on the opening of the park in April 2017 note 4.4.
At 30 December 2017 the net carrying amount of leased buildings was 103 million 2016: 16 million and the net carrying amount of leased plant and equipment was 38 million 2016: 29 million.
Further details in respect of leases and lease obligations are provided in note 4.4.
Capital commitments At the year end the Group had a number of outstanding capital commitments in respect of capital expenditure at its existing attractions, including accommodation, and for Midway attractions that are under construction.
These are expected to be settled within two financial years of the reporting date.
These amount to 104 million 2016: 82 million for which no provision has been made.
At year end foreign exchange rates, the Group is expecting to invest a further 39 million 2016: 62 million in the LEGOLAND Japan Resort in relation to the hotel and SEA LIFE Centre due to open in 2018.

3.2 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Accounting policies Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired less any contingent liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
In respect of joint ventures, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the joint venture.
Where they arise on acquisition, brands have been valued based on discounted future cash flows using the relief from royalty method, including amounts into perpetuity.
Currently all such brands held are assessed as having indefinite useful economic lives.
This assessment is based upon the strong historical performance of the brands over a number of economic cycles, the ability to roll out our brands, and the Directors intentions regarding the future use of brands.
The Directors feel this is a suitable policy for a brands business which invests in and maintains the brands, and foresee no technological developments or competitor actions which would put a finite life on the brands.
The brands are tested annually for impairment.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Other intangible assets comprise software licences, sponsorship rights and other contract based intangible assets.
They are amortised on a straight-line basis from the date they are available for use.
They are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The estimated useful lives of other intangible assets are as follows: Asset class Estimated useful life Licences Life of licence up to 15 years Other intangible assets Relevant contractual period up to 30 years MERLIN ENTERTAINMENTS PLC 113 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Goodwill and intangible assets Intangible assets Goodwill Brands Other Total m m m m Cost Balance at 27 December 2015 906 182 28 1,116 Additions 1 1 Effect of movements in foreign exchange 87 14 4 105 Balance at 31 December 2016 993 196 33 1,222 Additions 3 3 Effect of movements in foreign exchange 1 2 1 Balance at 30 December 2017 992 198 36 1,226 Amortisation Balance at 27 December 2015 169 12 12 193 Amortisation for the year 2 2 Effects of movements in foreign exchange 8 1 1 10 Balance at 31 December 2016 177 13 15 205 Amortisation for the year 2 2 Effect of movements in foreign exchange 1 1 Balance at 30 December 2017 178 13 17 208 Carrying amounts At 27 December 2015 737 170 16 923 At 31 December 2016 816 183 18 1,017 At 30 December 2017 814 185 19 1,018 Intangible assets are tested for impairment in accordance with the Groups accounting policy, as referred to in note 3.3.

Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Groups operating segments which represent the lowest level at which it is monitored and tested for impairment.
It is denominated in the relevant local currencies and therefore the carrying value is subject to movements in foreign exchange rates.

The London Eye, Gardaland Resort, Alton Towers Resort, THORPE PARK and Heide Park brands all arise from those specific visitor attractions.
3.3 IMPAIRMENT TESTING Accounting policies The carrying amounts of the Groups goodwill, intangible assets and PPE are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists or if the asset has an indefinite life, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The process of impairment testing is to estimate the recoverable amount of the assets concerned, and recognise an impairment loss whenever the carrying amount of those assets exceeds the recoverable amount.
The level at which the assets concerned are reviewed varies as follows: Asset Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed at an Operating Group level, being the relevant grouping of cash-generating units CGUs at which the benefit of such goodwill arises.
A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates largely independent cash inflows, being the Groups individual attractions.
Brands Brands are reviewed at an individual CGU level.
PPE PPE is reviewed at an individual CGU level, being the Groups individual attractions.
For assets that are in continuing use but do not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the assets belong.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill, and then to reduce the carrying amount of other intangible assets and other assets on a pro rata basis.
MERLIN ENTERTAINMENTS PLC 115 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Calculation of recoverable amount In accordance with accounting standards, the recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
To assess value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
The Group uses a multiple of EBITDA to estimate fair value which is based on the Groups average market capitalisation as a multiple of the Groups underlying EBITDA.
Where recoverable amount was based upon value in use, testing was performed by reference to the forward looking consolidated guidance communicated externally in October 2017, as well as subsequent scenario planning.
This guidance was based on the Groups internally approved five year business plan, being the current year and four future years, adjusted to reflect the potential for a continuation in the near term of the unforeseeable and uncontrollable events experienced in 2017, such as global terrorism continuing to impact our largest locations and extreme weather during peak trading periods.
Whilst it is possible that similar events may occur in the future, these events are such that their nature, timing and extent cannot be precisely forecast, nor can management reliably estimate which site or Operating Group they may affect.
In preparing the impairment calculations for the Resort Theme Parks Operating Group RTP, where headroom is most limited, management have therefore reviewed the growth expectations for each of the parks, forming their best estimate based on a balanced assessment of what risks might crystallise for each site in the short to medium term: key to this was the pace of recovery of RTP in the UK, the potential for disruptive terrorist activities and historical weather patterns in Southern Europe.
Reference was also made to current trading information, such as sales of annual passes and pre-booked accommodation.
On the basis of these forecasts no impairment has been indicated.
Common assumptions have been adopted for the purpose of testing goodwill across the business and for testing brand values where their risk profilesare similar.
The key assumptions and estimates used when calculating the net present value of future cash flows from the Groups businesses areas follows: Estimate Future cash flows Assumed to be equivalent to the operating cash flows of the businesses less the cash flows in respect of capital expenditure.
The Group uses EBITDA less an allocation of central costs, in line with other recharges which occur in the business, as a proxy for the operating cash flows of its attractions as they are not significantly impacted by movements in working capital.
Growth in EBITDA EBITDA is forecast by an analysis of both projected revenues and costs.
Visitor numbers and revenue projections are based on market analysis, including the total available market, historic trends, competition and site development activity, both in terms of capital expenditure on rides and attractions as well as marketing activity.
Operating costs projections are based on historical data, adjusted for variations in visitor numbers and planned expansion of site activities as well as general market conditions.
Timing and quantum of future capital and Projections are based on the attractions long term development plans, taking into account the capital investment necessary to maintain maintenance expenditure and sustain the performance of the attractions assets.
Long term growth rate A growth rate of 2.5% 2016: 2.5% was determined based on managements long term expectations, taking account of historical averages and future expected trends in both market development and market share growth.
Discount rates to reflect the risks involved Based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital of a market participant within the main geographical regions where the Group operates, these are drawn from market data and businesses in similar sectors, and adjusted for asset specific risks.
The key assumptions of the market participant include the ratio of debt to equity financing, risk free rates and the medium term risks associated with equity investments.
Net present values are calculated using pre-tax discount rates derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost ofcapital.
Pre-tax discount rates Post-tax discount rates 2017 2016 2017 2016 Midway Attractions 9.8% 10.5% 7.8% 8.1% LEGOLAND Parks 10.2% 10.8% 7.6% 7.7% Resort Theme Parks 10.2% 11.0% 8.3% 8.7% 116 MERLIN ENTERTAINMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS SECTION 3 OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CONTINUED 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016 3.3 IMPAIRMENT TESTING CONTINUED Sensitivity analysis Impairment reviews are often sensitive to changes in key assumptions.
Sensitivity analysis has therefore been performed on the calculated recoverable amounts considering incremental changes in the key assumptions.
When reviewing the outputs of the impairment testing and performing sensitivity analysis, particular focus is given to material amounts where headroom is more limited.
As in prior years, this solely relates to goodwill attributed to the Resort Theme Parks Operating Group RTP where the headroom is 32 million 2016: 26 million.
The Midway Attractions and LEGOLAND Parks Operating Groups, as well as individual brands, show considerable headroom and are not sensitive to even significant changes in any of the key assumptions.
In undertaking sensitivity analysis for RTP, consideration has been given to movements in forecast EBITDA, increases in discount rates and reductions in long term growth rates.
At the year end the Directors consider that the forecasts used reflect the current best estimate of future trading in RTP.
It is noted, however, that the calculations are inherently sensitive to the pace of the recovery at Alton Towers, weather patterns and the wider economic trading environment.
While in the short term a slower recovery would be highly unlikely to affect valuations by a substantial amount, longer term shortfalls that affect the outlook for the fourth year of the plan which drives the terminal value would have a more significant impact.
If EBITDA for RTP as a whole was forecast to be 3% 2016: 3% lower than currently anticipated for 2022 2016: that anticipated for 2021, headroom would be absorbed in full.
Furthermore, the Directors considered a scenario with the continued manifestation of the risks described in the October 2017 strategic update, being headwinds from global terrorism, extreme weather and a slower pace of recovery at Alton Towers.
Managements view is that were the negative impacts suffered in 2017 to continue, aligned with its core discipline around prudent capital allocation and consistent with other attractions in the estate with a slower rate of growth, capital investment would be further tempered to reflect the reduction in incremental returns which could be generated.
In this scenario the headroom would be reduced from 32 million to 11 million.
While it is not impossible for either shortfall to occur, the Directors do not consider it to be probable based on the strength of the product development, diversity across the businesses in RTP and our proven track record in scaling our cost base and capital plan to respond to changing demand.
Discount rates have been derived from market data.
As these rates are intended to be long term in nature, they are expected to be reasonably stable in the short term, however market discount rates could increase in the future.
If the discount rate used across RTP had been higher by a factor of 3% to 10.5% 2016: 3% to 11.3%, headroom would have been absorbed in full.
The Directors have formed their best estimate of the discount rate and do not consider that such a move in the rate is appropriate, but it is not impossible that a different view of discount rates could be required in the future.
The long term growth rate, which is applied to the cash flows of the final year in the business plan, was determined based on managements long term expectations, taking account of historical averages and future expected trends in both market development and market share growth.
The Directors do not consider it probable that this rate will prove to be inappropriate in the future, but note that if circumstances caused the rate to lower to 2.1% 2016: 2.1%, headroom would be absorbed in full.
3.4 WORKING CAPITAL Accounting policies Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is measured using the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their present location and condition.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any amounts considered by management to be uncollectible.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Other receivables are stated at their amortised cost less impairment losses.

They are measured at the Directors best estimates, after taking account of information available and different possible outcomes.

3 As disclosed in notes 4.2 and 4.4 a substantial proportion of the Groups borrowings are denominated in Euros, US Dollars and Japanese Yen.
4.2 INTEREST-BEARING LOANS AND BORROWINGS Accounting policy Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less attributable fees.
These fees are then amortised through the income statement on an effective interest rate basis over the expected life of the loan or over the contractual term where there is no clear indication that ashorter life is appropriate.
If the Groups estimate of the expected life based on repayment subsequently changes, the resulting adjustment to the effective interest rate calculation is recognised as a gain or loss on re-measurement and presented separately in the income statement, in accordance with IAS 39.

The proceeds were partly used to repay 50 million 43 million of the floating rate term debt due to mature in March 2020.
The Groups facilities at the year end are: Bank facilities comprising 250 million and $540 million floating rate term debt to mature in March 2020.
The relevant floating interest rates are LIBOR and the USD benchmark rate, which were 0.51% 2016: 0.37% and 1.61% 2016: 0.99% respectively at 30 December 2017.
The margin on the bank facilities is dependent on the Groups adjusted leverage ratio and at 30 December 2017 was 2.0% 2016: 2.0%.
A 300 million multi-currency revolving credit facility of which nil had been drawn down at 30 December 2017 2016: nil.
The margin on this facility is also dependent on the Groups adjusted leverage ratio and at 30 December 2017 was at a margin of 1.75% 2016: 1.75% over the same floating interest rates when drawn.
700 million 2016: 500 million notes with a coupon rate of 2.75% to mature in March 2022.
The Group has estimated that a refinancing of the bank facilities and multi-currency revolving credit facility is likely within the next 18 months, which is earlier than that previously assumed for accounting purposes.
As a result the Group has accelerated the amortisation of financing costs in respect of these facilities and the resulting adjustment has been recognised as a loss on re-measurement and presented in the income statement as a charge of 4 million see note 2.3.
The fees related to the fixed rate notes are being amortised to the maturity of the notes as the notes are currently expected to be held to their full term.
The borrowings including the revolving credit facility and the 700 million notes are unsecured but guaranteed by the Company and certain of itssubsidiaries.
The Group is required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants in the bank facilities, including a requirement to maintain certain ratios of EBITDA to both net finance costs and net debt.
It is also required to comply with certain non-financial covenants in the 700 million notes.
Allcovenant requirements were satisfied throughout the year.
4.3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group would not have sufficient funds to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups Treasury Department produces short term and long term cash forecasts to identify liquidity requirements and headroom, which are reviewed by the Groups Chief Financial Officer.
Surplus cash is actively managed across Group bank accounts to cover local shortfalls or invested in bank deposits or other short term liquid investments such as money market funds.
In some countries bank cash pooling arrangements are in place to optimise the use of cash.
As at the reporting date the Group had 309 million of cash and cash equivalents 2016: 215 million and a 300 million revolving credit facility, of which nil was drawn down 2016: 300 million of which nil drawn down, in order to meet its obligations and commitments that will fall due.

The Group has a policy of actively managing its interest rate risk exposure using a combination of fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps.
At 30 December 2017 the Group had 700 million of fixed rate debt 2016: 500 million.
Taken together with the floating rate bank facilities and interest rate swaps the accounting for which is set out below, in aggregate 79% 2016: 74% of the year end interest-bearing loans and borrowings is at a fixed rate for a weighted average period of 3.4 years 2016: 4.2 years.
Interest rate swaps are recognised at fair value which is determined by reference to market rates.
The fair value is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to exit the swap, taking into account current interest rates, credit risks and bid ask spreads.
Following initial recognition, changes in fair value are recognised immediately in profit or loss, except where the Group adopts hedge accounting.
When hedge accounting, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items.
It makes an assessment, at inception and on an ongoing basis, as to whether the hedging instruments are expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the respective hedged items during the life of the hedge.
Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity.
Any ineffective portion of changes in fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Cumulative gains and losses remain in equity until either the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, or until the hedged transaction occurs, at which point they will be reclassified to profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit and loss from that date.
At 30 December 2017 the Group had 40 million of fair value interest rates swaps with a value of less than 1 million: a 100 basis points fall or rise in the Euro interest rate with a similar duration as the swap would lead to a change in value of 1 million.
All interest rate swaps held by the Group are hedge accounted.
Sensitivity analysis Based on the net debt position as at 30 December 2017, taking into account interest rate swaps, each 100 basis points fall or rise in market interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in net interest paid of less than 1 million 20 1 6: 1 million.
This has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the Groups variable rate cash, borrowings and derivatives.
Foreign currency risk As the Group operates internationally the performance of the business is sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups potential currency exposures comprise transaction and translation exposures.
The Group ensures that its net exposure to foreign currency balances is kept to a minimal level by using foreign currency swaps to exchange balances back into Sterling or by buying and selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary.
The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is the present value of future cash flows and is determined by reference to market rates.
At 30 December 2017 the fair value of foreign currency swap assets was 2 million 2016: 3 million and of foreign currency swap liabilities was 1 million 2016: 2 million.

Any significant crossborder trading exposures would be hedged by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Translation exposures The Groups results, as presented in Sterling, are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate movements.
The Group does not hedge this translation exposure to its earnings but, where material, may carry out net asset hedging by borrowing in the same currencies as the currencies of its operating units or by using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Groups debt excluding finance leases is therefore denominated in Euros, US Dollars and Sterling and at 30 December 2017 consisted of 700 million, $540 million and 250 million and there are forward foreign exchange contracts in place in respect of JPY 12,128 million.
Gains or losses arise on the retranslation of the net assets of foreign operations at different reporting dates and are recognised within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
They will predominantly relate to the retranslation of opening net assets at closing foreign exchange rates, together with the retranslation of retained foreign profits for the year that have been accounted for in the consolidated income statement at average rates at closing rates.
Exchange rates for major currencies are set out below.
Gains or losses also arise on the retranslation of foreign currency denominated borrowings designated as effective net investment hedges of overseas net assets.
These are offset in equity by corresponding gains or losses arising on the retranslation of the related hedged foreign currency net assets.
The Group also treats specific intercompany loan balances, which are not intended to be repaid in the foreseeable future, as part of its net investment.
In the event of a foreign entity being sold or a hedging item being extinguished, such exchange differences would be recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.

A 10% strengthening of all currencies against Sterling would reduce the fair value of foreign exchange contracts and result in a charge to the income statement of 6 million 2016: 5 million.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Credit risk is limited to the carrying value of the Groups monetary assets.
The Group has limited credit risk with its customers, the vast majority of whom pay in advance or at the time of their visit.
There are credit policies in place with regard to its trade receivables with credit evaluations performed on customers requiring credit over a certain amount.
The Group manages credit exposures in connection with financing and treasury activities including exposures arising from bank deposits, cash held at banks and derivative transactions, by appraisal, formal approval and ongoing monitoring of the credit position of counterparties.
Counterparty exposures are measured against a formal transaction limit appropriate to that counterpartys credit position.
The Group robustly appraises investments before they are made to ensure the associated credit risk is acceptable.
Performance of investments are closely monitored, in some cases through Board participation, to ensure returns are in line with expectations and credit risk remains acceptable.
There were no overdue amounts in respect of investments and no impairments have been recorded 2016: nil.
The Group has no collateral in respect of itsinvestments.
Fair values Fair value hierarchy The Group analyses financial instruments in the following ways: Level 1: uses unadjusted quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2: uses inputs that are derived directly or indirectly from observable prices other than quoted prices.
Level 3: uses inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Fair value versus carrying amounts The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are presented in the table below, together with the carrying amounts shown in the statement of financial position.
Short term receivables, payables and cash and cash equivalents have been excluded from the following disclosures on the basis that their carrying amount is a reasonable approximation to fair value.

The fair values of the finance leases are determined by reference to similar lease agreements.
There is no difference between the carrying value and the fair value of investments that has been estimated by reference to discounted cash flows.
There have been no transfers between levels in 2017 or 2016.
124 MERLIN ENTERTAINMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS SECTION 4 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING CONTINUED 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016 4.4 LEASE OBLIGATIONS Accounting policies Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Where land and buildings are held under finance leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings.
Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received and predetermined non-contingent rent increases are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense over the lease term.
This therefore excludes the potential impact of future performance or rent increases based on inflationary indices.
Lease arrangements The Groups most significant lease arrangements relate to a sale and leaseback transaction undertaken during 2007, involving the PPE of certain attractions within the Midway Attractions and Resort Theme Parks Operating Groups.
The leases are accounted for as finance or operating leases depending on the specific circumstances of each lease and the nature of the attraction.
For certain of the sites an individual lease agreement is split for accounting purposes as a combination of finance and operating leases, reflecting the varied nature of assets at the attraction.
Each of these sale and leaseback agreements runs for a period of 35 years from inception and allows for annual rent increases based on the inflationary index in the United Kingdom and fixed increases in Continental Europe.
The Group has the option, but is not contractually required, to extend each of the lease agreements individually for two further terms of 35 years, subject to an adjustment to market rates at that time.
LEGOLAND Japan was opened during the year.
The park was developed under the Groups operated and leased model whereby the Groups local operating company leases the site and park infrastructure from a development partner.
The development partners are related parties, being KIRKBI Invest A S and LLJ Investco K. K, a subsidiary of KIRKBI A S: with KIRKBI A S being a shareholder of the Group and a related party note 5.3.
The lease is for a period of 50 years and is accounted for partly as a finance lease and partly as an operating lease depending on the nature of the underlying assets concerned.
Land and longer life assets, for example core elements of the parks infrastructure, are accounted for as operating leases.
Finance lease assets are those elements that will be substantially or entirely consumed over the lease term.
This accounting judgement is underpinned by a review of the cost of construction by asset type together with estimates of the lives of the assets concerned.
The liability when the finance lease was entered into on the opening of the park in April 2017 was 111 million.
The Group also enters into operating leases for sites within the Midway Attractions Operating Group and central areas.
These are typically of a duration between 10 and 60 years, with rent increases determined based on local market practice.
In addition to a fixed rental element, rents within the Midway Attractions Operating Group can also contain a performance related element, typically based on turnover at the site concerned.
Options to renew leases exist at these sites in line with local market practice in the territories concerned.
The key contractual terms in relation to each lease are considered when calculating the rental charge over the lease term.
The potential impact on rent charges of future performance or increases based on inflationary indices are each excluded from these calculations.
There are no significant operating restrictions placed on the Group as a result of its lease arrangements.
MERLIN ENTERTAINMENTS PLC 125 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Lease costs and commitments During 2017 106 million 2016: 96 million was recognised as an expense in the income statement in respect of operating leases.
Of this 18 million 2016: 13 million was contingent on performance.
The lease commitments in the following tables run to the end of the respective lease term and do not include possible lease renewals.
Where relevant, the lease commitments noted do not include the potential impact of future performance or rent increases based on inflationary indices.
Finance leases These tables provide information about the future minimum lease payments and contractual terms of the Groups finance lease liabilities, as follows: Present Present Future value of Future value of minimum minimum minimum minimum lease lease lease lease payments Interest payments payments Interest payments 2017 2017 2017 2016 2016 2016 m m m m m m Less than one year 10 9 1 7 7 Between one and five years 40 34 6 27 27 More than five years 385 201 184 258 170 88 435 244 191 292 204 88 Nominal Year of 2017 2016 Currency interest rate maturity m m Finance lease liabilities GBP 5.64% 2042 53 54 Finance lease liabilities EUR 9.11% 2042 36 34 Finance lease liabilities JPY 1.65% 2067 102 191 88 The nominal interest rate for finance leases in the table above represents the weighted average effective interest rate.
This is used because the table above aggregates finance leases with the same maturity date and currency.
Operating leases The minimum rentals payable as lessee under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2017 2016 m m Less than one year 88 83 Between one and five years 353 329 More than five years 1,456 1,325 1,897 1,737 The Group has also entered into a lease agreement as part of the development of LEGOLAND Korea.
Under the terms of the lease the Group would lease the site and park infrastructure from the development partner for a period of 50 years.
The lease would be accounted for as a finance or operating lease from the date the park starts operating, depending on the specific circumstances of the lease and the nature of the assets at the attraction.

The Groups objective when managing capital is to maintain a strong capital base so as to ensure investor and creditor confidence and to sustain future development of the business: to provide returns for shareholders: and to optimise the capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
There are no externally imposed capital requirements on the Group.
To enable the Group to meet its objective, the Directors monitor returns on capital through constant review of earnings generated from the Groups capital investment programme and through regular budgeting and planning processes, manage capital in a manner so as to ensure that sufficient funds for capital investment and working capital are available, and the requirements of the Groups debt covenants are met.
The Group does not routinely make additional issues of capital, other than for the purpose of raising finance to fund significant acquisitions or developments intended to increase the overall value of the Group.
Share plans have been created to allow employees of the Group to participate in the ownership of the Groups equity instruments, in order to ensure employees are focused on growing the value of the Group to achieve the aims of all the shareholders.
The Groups equity-settled share plans are settled either by the issue of shares by Merlin Entertainments plc or by the purchase of shares in the market.

The Company also received 8 million in relation to the exercise of options under the Company Share Option Plan CSOP and the All Employee Sharesave Plan AESP.
This was taken to the share premium account.
Ordinary shares The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at general meetings of the Company.
Each ordinary share in the capital of the Company ranks equally in all respects and no shareholder holds shares carrying special rights relating to the control of the Company.
The Company has entered into a Relationship Agreement with its major shareholder, KIRKBI, in connection with the exercise of its rights as a major shareholder in the Company and the right to appoint Directors to the Board.
The nominal value of shares in issue is shown in share capital, with any additional consideration for those shares shown in share premium.

4.6 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS Accounting policy The fair value of the share plans is recognised as an expense over the expected vesting period with a corresponding entry to retained earnings, net of deferred tax.
The fair value of the share plans is determined at the date of grant.
Non-market based vesting conditions i. e. earnings per share and return on capital employed targets are taken into account in estimating the number of awards likely to vest, which is reviewed at each accounting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued.
No adjustment is made after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or are not exercised.
The Group operates cash-settled versions of the employee incentive plans for employees in certain territories.
The issues and resulting charges of these plans are not material to the financial statements.
Equity-settled plans The Group operates four employee share incentive plans: the Performance Share Plan PSP, the Deferred Bonus Plan DBP, the Company Share Option Plan CSOP and the All Employee Sharesave Plan AESP as set out in the Directors Remuneration Report and the tables below.
A summary of the rules for the plans and the performance conditions attaching to the PSP are given in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The Black-Scholes model is used to value the AESP.
The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Companys shares.
The risk free rate is equal to the prevailing UK Gilts rate at grant date, which is commensurate with the expected term.
Expected forfeiture rates are based on recent experience of staff turnover levels.
Behavioural expectations have been taken into account in estimating the award life of the CSOP.
The charge is spread over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.

Minority equity investments are accounted for as available for sale financial assets at fair value.
As no observable market data is available for these minority equity holdings, fair value is determined by reference to discounted future cash flows, with movements recorded in other comprehensive income.
No fair value movements have been recorded and there is no material sensitivity to the assumptions used.
Previously, investments in loan notes were accounted for as financial assets at historic cost with interest accrued on an effective interest rate basis.
This calculation required estimation of the expected period over which the investment will be held together with the value of the investment at the end of that period.
Interest was recognised within finance income see note 2.3.
During 2017, these notes were modified such that they were derecognised and a minority equity investment recognised in their place.
Associates and joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control or significant influence, established by contractual agreement.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised income and expenses on an equity accounted basis, from the date that joint control or influence commences until the date that it ceases.

LEGOLAND Korea The Group has a minority equity investment in the consortium company developing LEGOLAND Korea.
Big Bus Tours Group Holdings Limited In 2016 the Group invested $44 million 32 million in Big Bus Tours Group Holdings Limited, the leading global owner-operator of Hop On Hop Off City Tours.
The investment was substantially all in the form of loan notes.
In calculating the effective interest rate for the loan notes, the Group considered its latest best estimate of future performance.
The transaction also provided Merlin with a minority equity investment valued at nil 2016: nil.
During 2017, the loan notes were modified, resulting in the financial asset held at historic cost being derecognised and a minority equity investment measured at fair value being recognised instead.
No gain or loss arose as a result.
This was due to changes made to the rights of the issuer of the loan notes that resulted in them having the characteristics of an equity instrument rather than of debt.
Investments in associates and joint ventures LEGOLAND Dubai Hotel On 14 February 2017 the Group invested 12 million in LL Dubai Hotel LLC, which is the company developing the hotel at LEGOLAND Dubai.
The Group holds a 40% equity interest.
Pirate Adventure Golf Limited On 12 September 2017 the Group acquired the remaining 50% of the Pirate Adventure Golf Limited joint venture 2016: carrying value of nil.
The consideration was 0.2 million, settled in cash, and the fair value of the net assets acquired was 0.2 million.
Pirate Adventure Golf was accounted for as a wholly controlled subsidiary from 12 September 2017.
Pirate Adventure Golf Limited is a UK entity that forms part of the Midway Attractions Operating Group.
MERLIN ENTERTAINMENTS PLC 131 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 5.2 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Accounting policies Defined contribution pension schemes In the case of defined contribution schemes, the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund on behalf of the employee and has no further obligations to them.
The risks and rewards associated with this type of scheme are assumed by the members rather than the employer.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit pension schemes A defined benefit scheme is a post-employment benefit scheme other than a defined contribution scheme.
The Groups net obligation is calculated for each scheme by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value and offset by the fair value of any scheme assets.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the period they occur directly in equity through other comprehensive income.
Defined contribution pension schemes The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes and the total expense relating to those schemes in the current year was 13 million 2016: 11 million.
Defined benefit pension schemes The principal scheme that the Group operates is a closed scheme for certain former UK employees of the Tussauds Group, which was acquired in 2007.
The scheme entitles retired employees to receive an annual payment based on a percentage of final salary for each year of service that the employee provided.
The pension schemes have not directly invested in any of the Groups own financial instruments or in properties or other assets used by the Group.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2015.
As a result, the Group agreed to pay annual deficit reduction contributions of 455,500, increasing at 3% per annum until 2021, together with an additional one-off payment of 2,260,000 which was paid in 2017.
The Group expects 1 million in ongoing contributions to be paid to its defined benefit schemes in 2018.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 30 December 2017 was 21 years 2016: 21 years.
The assets and liabilities of the schemes are: 2017 2016 m m Equities 25 22 Corporate bonds and cash 7 6 Property 5 4 Fair value of scheme assets 37 32 Present value of defined benefit obligations 43 43 Net pension liability 6 11 132 MERLIN ENTERTAINMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS SECTION 5 OTHER NOTES CONTINUED 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016 5.2 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS CONTINUED Movement in the net pension liability Present value Present value of defined of scheme benefit Net pension assets obligations liability m m m At 27 December 2015 28 33 5 Net interest 1 1 Contributions by employer 1 1 Benefits paid 1 1 Remeasurement gain loss 3 9 6 Effect of movement in foreign exchange 1 1 At 31 December 2016 32 43 11 Net interest 1 1 Contributions by employer 3 3 Benefits paid 1 1 Remeasurement gain 2 2 At 30 December 2017 37 43 6 The amount recognised in the income statement was nil 2016: nil.
The amount recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income was a profit of 2 million 2016: loss of 6 million.
In 2016 the loss primarily resulted from changes in actuarial estimates in respect of discount rates.
Actuarial assumptions Principal actuarial assumptions expressed as weighted averages at the year end were: 2017 2016 Discount rate 2.5% 2.7% Future salary increases 3.5% 3.7% Rate of price inflation 3.2% 3.4% Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on published statistics and mortality tables.
For the Tussauds Group scheme the actuarial table used is S2PxA.
The mortality assumption adopted predicts that a current 65 year old male would have a life expectancy to age 87 and a female would have a life expectancy to age 89.

The impact of a negative decision could result in a significant increase in the Groups future effective tax rate.
A final decision from the EC is expected in late 2018 but is subject to possible appeal.
5.5 NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS The following standards and interpretations, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB or the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, have been adopted by the Group with no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements: IAS 7 Statement of cash flows disclosure initiative.
IAS 12 Income taxes recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses.
EU endorsed IFRS and interpretations with effective dates after 31 December 2017 relevant to the Group will be implemented in the financial year when the standards become effective.
IFRS 9 IFRS 9 Financial instruments is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early adoption permitted.
The new standard sets out requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets and financial liabilities.
The Group has assessed the impact of the adoption of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and plans to apply the new requirements retrospectively, taking advantage of the exemption to not restate comparative information with respect to classification and measurement changes.
The Group does not anticipate any material changes to the statement of financial position as a result of its adoption of IFRS 9 and the expected impact on the Groups equity at the start of the 2018 financial year is not material.
The actual impact of adopting the standard at the start of the 2018 financial year may change until the Group presents its first financial statements including the impact of the new standard.
Further details of each aspect of the new standard have been provided below: Classification and measurement IFRS 9 contains a new classification and measurement approach for financial assets that reflects the business model in which assets are managed and their cash flow characteristics.
Under IFRS 9 the number of classification categories has reduced, resulting in all financial assets being measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss.
The Group does not believe that the new classification requirements will have a material impact on its accounting for trade and other receivables.
At 30 December 2017, the Group held equity investments classified as available-for-sale of 59 million.
The election available under IFRS 9 will be taken, allowing the minority equity investments to continue to be held at fair value with changes going through other comprehensive income FVOCI.
All fair value gains and losses will be reported through OCI, no impairment losses will be recognised in profit or loss and any gains or losses realised on disposal of these investments will no longer be reclassified to profit or loss.
IFRS 9 largely retains the existing requirements for classification of financial liabilities under IAS 39.
The Groups assessment did not identify any changes to classification and measurement of financial liabilities at the start of the 2018 financial year.
Impairment IFRS 9 replaces the incurred loss model in IAS 39 with a forward looking expected credit loss ECL model.
This will apply to all financial assets measured at amortised cost or FVOCI, except equity investments, and will be measured in respect of default events that will occur in 12 months from the reporting date or over the lifetime of the financial asset, depending on certain criteria.
A review of each category of financial assets has been performed to assess the level of credit risk and the appropriate ECL to use.
The Group has assessed that this only applies to its accounting for trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents, as detailed below: The Group has limited credit risk in respect of trade and other receivables with its customers as the majority pay in advance or at the time of their visit.
The estimated ECLs were calculated using both actual credit loss experience and forward looking projections and do not anticipate material changes to the impairment of trade and other receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents are held with banks and financial institutions.
The estimated ECLs were calculated based on the 12 month expected loss basis and reflect the short term nature of the exposures.
The Group considers that its cash and cash equivalents have a low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties.
Based on this, the Group has estimated that the ECL is not material for cash and cash equivalents.
At each reporting date the expected credit losses will be reviewed to reflect changes in credit risk and adjustments made accordingly.
MERLIN ENTERTAINMENTS PLC 135 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Hedging As allowed when initially applying IFRS 9, the Group has chosen to apply its hedge accounting policy under IFRS 9 rather than continuing to apply IAS 39.
The new standard introduces a more principles based approach with the intention of aligning the accounting for hedging instruments more closely with the Groups risk management strategies and to apply a more qualitative and forward looking approach to assessing hedge effectiveness.
IFRS 9 also introduces new requirements on rebalancing hedge relationships and prohibiting voluntary discontinuation of hedge accounting.
The Group anticipates that all existing hedge relationships that are currently designated as effective hedging relationships will continue to qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9 and are aligned to the Groups risk management strategy and objective.
IFRS 9 includes additional disclosure requirements, particularly around hedge accounting, credit risk and ECLs.
The Group will assess required changes in presentation in advance of the next reporting period end.
IFRS 15 IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The Group has assessed the estimated impact that the initial application of IFRS 15 will have on its consolidated financial statements.
The estimated impact of the adoption of this standard on the Groups equity as at the beginning of the 2018 financial year is based on assessments undertaken to date and is summarised below.
The actual impacts of adopting the standard at the beginning of the 2018 financial year may change because relevant accounting policies are subject to change until the Group presents its first financial statements that include the date of initial application.
IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised.
It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction contracts, IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes as well as SIC 31 Barter transactions involving advertising services.
Admission tickets, annual passes, accommodation and commercial offerings Revenue from admission tickets, accommodation and commercial offerings is recognised at the time of the visit.
For annual passes, revenue is recognised evenly over the validity period.
Under IFRS 15 the timing of revenue recognition by the Group is expected to be unchanged, with a nil estimated impact on retained earnings and non-controlling interest at the beginning of the 2018 financial year.
The majority of Merlins revenue comes directly from the visiting customer, either in advance or at the time of the visit, and simply represents the amounts received from the visiting customer excluding VAT and similar taxes.
This is unaffected by IFRS 15.
Trade partners Merlin engages with trade partners such as online travel agents, in selling admission tickets and accommodation to the end customer.
Under IFRS 15, the Group has reassessed these arrangements under the control model required by the new standard in contrast to the risk and reward model under IAS 18.
In some instances this leads to trade partners being considered agents for Merlin rather than customers themselves.
This is expected to result in an increase to the value of revenue with a corresponding change to cost of sales but no impact on EBITDA.
Commercial offerings in a small number of contracts, Merlin engages with third parties to assist in the operation of commercial offerings within theme park resorts and Midway attractions.
The Group currently determines who acts as the agent or principal on a case-by-case basis.
In some cases, this leads to a different determination of who acts as the agent or principal.
This is expected to result in a change to the value of revenue with a corresponding change to cost of sales but no impact on EBITDA.
The impact on the value of revenue in the Groups consolidated financial statements is expected to be low.
Sponsorship agreements and service contracts for attraction development Currently, the Group recognises revenue on sponsorship agreements and service contracts for attraction development over the period of the contract.
Transition The Group plans to adopt IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method, with the effect of initially applying this standard recognised on the date of initial application, being the first day of the 2018 financial year.
As a result, the Group will not apply the requirements of IFRS 15 to the comparative period.
136 MERLIN ENTERTAINMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS SECTION 5 OTHER NOTES CONTINUED 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016 5.5 NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS CONTINUED IFRS 16 IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees.
A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.
There are recognition exemptions for short term leases and leases of low value items.
The Group has completed an initial assessment of the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements and is in the process of refining this assessment.
The actual impact of applying IFRS 16 on the financial statements in the period of initial application will depend on the composition of the Groups lease portfolio at that date, any significant events or significant changes in circumstances that affect whether it is reasonably certain to exercise options and the extent to which the Group chooses to use recognition exemptions.
The Group has considered its entire lease portfolio and substantially it all relates to land, buildings and infrastructure assets.
As such, the most significant impact identified is that the Group will recognise new assets and liabilities for these leases.
As at 30 December 2017, the Groups future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases amounted to 1,897 million on an undiscounted basis see note 4.4.
The Groups future minimum lease payments under finance leases amounted to 435 million on an undiscounted basis.
In addition, the nature of expenses will now change as IFRS 16 replaces the straight-line operating lease expense with a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities.
The Groups rental expenses linked to turnover, which totalled 18 million during 2017, will continue to be recorded as a rent charge within operating expenses.
The effect of this will be an increase in reported EBITDA.
Due to the Groups most significant leases being in their earlier stages, the front loading impact of the finance costs will result in an initial reduction in reported earnings albeit this would be expected to even out over the lease term.
The Groups leverage threshold loan covenants described in note 4.2 are under frozen-GAAP and as such the adoption of IFRS 16 is not expected to impact the ability to comply with them.
Transition The Group plans to apply the practical expedient to grandfather the definition of a lease on transition.
This means that it will apply IFRS 16 to all contracts entered into before 30 December 2018 and identified as leases in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4, though the effect of this is not expected to be material.
The Group plans to apply IFRS 16 initially on 30 December 2018, for the 52 week period ending 28 December 2019, using the retrospective approach.
Therefore the cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 will be recognised, in line with IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors, by restating the 52 week period ending 29 December 2018 and making an opening equity adjustment as at 31 December 2017.
The Group is not required to make any adjustment for leases in which it is a lessor except where it is an intermediate lessor in a sub-lease.
Other standards The IASB has also issued the following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that will be effective for the Group as from 1 January 2018.
The Group does not expect any significant impact on its consolidated financial statements from these amendments.
IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over income tax treatments Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 20142016 Cycle: IFRS 1 and IAS 28 5.6 ULTIMATE PARENT COMPANY INFORMATION The largest group in which the results of the Company are consolidated is that headed by Merlin Entertainments plc, incorporated in the United Kingdom.
