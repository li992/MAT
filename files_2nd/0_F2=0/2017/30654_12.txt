Greencoat UK Wind PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2017 1. significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The consolidated annual financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS to the extent that they have been adopted by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies under IFRS.
The annual financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as modified for the measurement of certain financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
The principal accounting policies are set out below.
These consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates and are rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated.
Accounting for subsidiaries The Directors have concluded that the Group has all the elements of control as prescribed by IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements in relation to all its subsidiaries and that the Company continues to satisfy the criteria to be regarded as an investment entity as dened in IFRS 10, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
Subsidiaries are therefore measured at fair value through profit or loss, in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The financial support provided by the Company to its unconsolidated subsidiaries is disclosed in note 10.
Notwithstanding this, IFRS 10 requires subsidiaries that provide services that relate to the investment entitys investment activities to be consolidated.
Accordingly, the annual financial statements include the consolidated financial statements of Greencoat UK Wind PLC and Greencoat UK Wind Holdco Limited a 100 per cent.
In respect of these entities, intra-Group balances and any unrealised gains arising from intra-Group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the costs cannot be recovered.
The financial statements of subsidiaries that are included in the consolidated financial statements are included from the date that control commences until the dates that control ceases.
In the parent company financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IAS 39, as permitted by IAS 27.
Accounting for associates and joint ventures The Group has taken the exemption permitted by IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements for entities similar to investment entities and measures its investments in associates and joint ventures at fair value.
The Directors consider an associate to be an entity over which the Group has significant inuence, through an ownership of between 20 per cent.
The Groups associates and joint ventures are disclosed in note 10.
New and amended standards and interpretations not applied There were no new standards or interpretations effective for the first time for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 that had a significant effect on the Group or Companys financial statements.
Furthermore, none of the amendments to standards that are effective from that date had a significant effect on the financial statements.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, IFRS 9 Financial instruments was issued to replace IAS 39, but will not become effective until accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and has not been applied in these financial statements.
The Groups financial assets predominantly comprise equity investments held at fair value and the introduction of IFRS 9 is not expected to have a material impact on the reported results and financial position of the Group.
Also at the date of authorisation of these financial statements, IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers was issued but will not become effective until accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and IFRS 16 Leases was issued but will not become effective until accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
As the Groups investments are held at fair value through profit or loss and the revenue contracts and leases are held at SPV level, the introduction of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 is not expected to have a material impact on the reported results and financial position of the Group.
50 GREENCOAT U K W I N D Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2017 1. significant accounting policies continued New and amended standards and interpretations not applied continued Other accounting standards have been published and will be mandatory for the Companys accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 or later periods.
The impact of these standards is not expected to be material to the reported results and financial position of the Group.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
At 31 December 2017 and 2016 the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables, accrued expenses and short term borrowings reected in the financial statements are reasonable estimates of fair value in view of the nature of these instruments or the relatively short period of time between the original instruments and their expected realisation.
The fair value of advances and other balances with related parties which are shortterm or repayable on demand is equivalent to their carrying amount.
Financial assets The classication of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the purpose for which the financial asset was acquired and its characteristics.
All financial assets are initially recognised at fair value.
All purchases of financial assets are recorded at the date on which the Group became party to the contractual requirements of the financial asset.
The Groups and Companys financial assets comprise of only investments held at fair value through profit or loss and loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables These assets are non-derivative financial assets with xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They principally comprise cash and trade and other receivables and they are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provisions for impairment.
Transaction costs are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as incurred.
The Group and the Company assess whether there is any objective evidence that financial assets are impaired at the end of each reporting period.
If any such evidence exists, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Investments held at fair value through profit or loss Investments are designated upon initial recognition as held at fair value through profit or loss.
Gains or losses resulting from the movement in fair value are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income at each valuation point.
As shareholder loan investments form part of a managed portfolio of assets whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, loan investments are designated at fair value in line with equity investments.
The Companys loan and equity investments in Holdco are held at fair value through profit or loss.
Gains or losses resulting from the movement in fair value are recognised in the Companys Statement of Comprehensive Income at each valuation point.
Financial assets are recognised derecognised at the date of the purchase disposal.
Investments are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of consideration given.
Fair value is dened as the amount for which an asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable willing parties in an arms length transaction.
Fair value is calculated on an unlevered, discounted cash ow basis in accordance with IFRS 13 and IAS 39.
51 Greencoat UK Wind PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2017 1. significant accounting policies continued Financial assets continued Derecognition of financial assets A financial asset in whole or in part is derecognised either: when the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership: or when it has neither transferred or retained substantially all the risks and rewards and when it no longer has control over the assets or a portion of the asset: or when the contractual right to receive cash ow has expired.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classied according to the substance of the contractual agreements entered into.
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction costs incurred.
All financial liabilities are recorded on the date on which the Group becomes party to the contractual requirements of the financial liability.
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being fair value of the consideration received, less issue costs where applicable.
After initial recognition, all interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Loan balances as at the year end have not been discounted to reect amortised cost, as the amounts are not materially different from the outstanding balances.
The Groups other financial liabilities measured at amortised cost include trade and other payables and other short term monetary liabilities which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
A financial liability in whole or in part is derecognised when the Group has extinguished its contractual obligations, it expires or is cancelled.
Any gain or loss on derecognition is taken to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Embedded derivatives Embedded derivatives are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract, the terms of the embedded derivative would meet the denition of a stand-alone derivative if they were contained in a separate contract and the combined contract is not held for trading or designated at fair value.
Embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Embedded derivatives which are closely related to the host contract are not separated from the host instrument.
Finance expenses Borrowing costs are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period to which they relate on an accruals basis.
Share capital Financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity if the holder has only a residual interest in the assets of the Company after the deduction of all liabilities.
The Companys ordinary shares are classied as equity instruments.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in share premium as a deduction from proceeds.
Incremental costs include those incurred in connection with the placing and admission which include fees payable under a placing agreement, legal costs and any other applicable expenses.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, deposits held on call with banks and other short-term highly liquid deposits with original maturities of 3 months or less, that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignicant risk of changes in value.
52 GREENCOAT U K W I N D Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2017 1. significant accounting policies continued Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Dividends Dividends payable are recognised as distributions in the financial statements when the Companys obligation to make payment has been established.
Income recognition Dividend income and interest income on shareholder loan investments are recognised when the Groups entitlement to receive payment is established.
Other income is accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method.
Gains or losses resulting from the movement in fair value of the Groups and Companys investments held at fair value through profit and loss are recognised in the Consolidated or Company Statement of Comprehensive Income at each valuation point.
Expenses Expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Share issue expenses of the Company directly attributable to the issue and listing of shares are charged to the share premium account.
The Company issues shares to the Investment Manager in exchange for receiving investment management services.
The fair value of the investment management services received in exchange for shares is recognised as an expense at the time at which the investment management fees are earned, with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value of the investment management services is calculated by reference to the denition of investment management fees in the Investment Management Agreement.
Taxation Under the current system of taxation in the UK, the Group is liable to taxation on its operations in the UK.
Payment received or receivable from the Group or Group owned SPVs for losses surrendered are recognised in the financial statements and form part of the tax credit.
In some situations, it might not be appropriate to recognise the tax credit until the Groups and Group owned SPVs tax affairs have been nalised and the losses elections have been made.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the date of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit or the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments, except where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off tax assets against tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
53 Greencoat UK Wind PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2017 1. significant accounting policies continued Segmental reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identied as the Board of Directors, as a whole.
The key measure of performance used by the Board to assess the Groups performance and to allocate resources is the total return on the Groups net assets, as calculated under IFRS, and therefore no reconciliation is required between the measure of profit or loss used by the Board and that contained in the financial statements.
For management purposes, the Group is organised into one main operating segment, which invests in wind farm assets.
All of the Groups income is generated within the UK.
All of the Groups non-current assets are located in the UK.
Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the financial statements requires the application of estimates and assumptions which may affect the results reported in the financial statements.
Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgement and available information.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities are those used to determine the fair value of the investments as disclosed in note 9 to the financial statements.
As disclosed in note 1, the Directors have concluded that the Company meets the denition of an investment entity as dened in IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27.
This conclusion involved a degree of judgement and assessment as to whether the Company met the criteria outlined in the accounting standards.
The key assumptions that have a significant impact on the carrying value of investments that are valued by reference to the discounted value of future cash ows are the useful life of the assets, the discount factors, the level of wind resource, the rate of ination, the price at which the power and associated benets can be sold and the amount of electricity the assets are expected to produce.
Useful lives are based on the Investment Managers estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue which are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness.
The standard assumption used for the useful life of a wind farm is 25 years.
The actual useful life may be a shorter or longer period depending on the actual operating conditions experienced by the asset.
The discount factors are subjective and therefore it is feasible that a reasonable alternative assumption may be used resulting in a different value.
The discount factors applied to the cash ows are reviewed annually by the Investment Manager to ensure they are at the appropriate level.
The Investment Manager will take into consideration market transactions, where of similar nature, when considering changes to the discount factors used.
The revenues and expenditure of the investee companies are frequently partly or wholly subject to indexation and an assumption is made that ination will increase at a long term rate.
The price at which the output from the generating assets is sold is a factor of both wholesale electricity prices and the revenue received from the Government support regime.
Future power prices are estimated using external third party forecasts which take the form of specialist consultancy reports.
The future power price assumptions are reviewed as and when these forecasts are updated.
There is an inherent uncertainty in future wholesale electricity price projection.
Specically commissioned external reports are used to estimate the expected electrical output from the wind farm assets taking into account the expected average wind speed at each location and generation data from historical operation.
The actual electrical output may differ considerably from that estimated in such a report mainly due to the variability of actual wind to that modelled in any 1 period.
Assumptions around electrical output will be reviewed only if there is good reason to suggest there has been a material change in this expectation.

Investment management fees Under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, the Investment Manager is entitled to a combination of a Cash Fee and an Equity Element from the Company.
The Cash Fee is based upon the NAV as at the start of the quarter in question on the following basis: on that part of the then most recently announced NAV up to and including 500 million, an amount equal to 0.25 per cent.
of such part of the NAV: on that part of the then most recently announced NAV over 500 million and up to and including 1,000 million, an amount equal to 0.225 per cent.
of such part of the NAV: and on that part of the then most recently announced NAV over 1,000 million, an amount equal to 0.2 per cent.
The Equity Element is calculated quarterly in advance and has a value as set out below: on that part of the then most recently announced NAV up to and including 500 million, 0.05 per cent.
: and on that part of the then most recently announced NAV over 500 million up to and including 1,000 million, 0.025 per cent.
The ordinary shares issued to the Investment Manager under the equity element are subject to a 3 year lock up starting from the quarter in which they are due to be paid.

The level of fair value hierarchy within the financial assets or financial liabilities is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are classied in their entirety into only one of the following 3 levels: Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 inputs for assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The determination of what constitutes observable requires significant judgement by the Group.
The Group considers observable data to be market data that is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and veriable, not proprietary, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market.
The only financial instruments held at fair value are the instruments held by the Group in the SPVs, which are fair valued at each reporting date.
The Groups investments have been classied within level 3 as the investments are not traded and contain unobservable inputs.
The Companys investments are all considered to be level 3 assets.
As the fair value of the Companys equity and loan investments in Holdco is ultimately determined by the underlying fair values of the SPV investments, the Companys sensitivity analysis of reasonably possible alternative input assumptions is the same as for the Group.
58 GREENCOAT U K W I N D Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2017 9.
Investments at fair value through profit or loss continued Due to the nature of the investments, they are always expected to be classied as level 3.
There have been no transfers between levels during the year ended 31 December 2017.
Any transfers between the levels would be accounted for on the last day of each financial period.
The Investment Manager will carry out the asset valuations, which form part of the NAV calculation.
These asset valuations will be based on discounted cash ow methodology in line with IPEV Valuation Guidelines and adjusted where appropriate, given the special nature of wind farm investments.
The valuations are based on a detailed financial model produced by the Investment Manager which takes into account, inter alia, the following: due diligence findings where relevant: the terms of any material contracts including PPAs: asset performance: power price forecast from a leading market consultant: and the economic, taxation or regulatory environment.
The DCF valuation of the Groups investments represents the largest component of NAV and the key sensitivities are considered to be the discount rate used in the DCF valuation and long term assumptions in relation to energy yield, power prices and ination.
At the time of the 30 September 2017 NAV, the Group announced a reduction in the portfolio discount rate of 0.3 per cent.
the only such change since listing.
This reduction compares to a reduction in long term gilt yields over the same period of approximately 1 per cent..
The base case portfolio discount rate is now 7.7 per cent..
This is an unlevered discount rate.
The equivalent levered discount rate is approximately 10 per cent.. A variance of - 0.5 per cent.
is considered to be a reasonable range of alternative assumptions for discount rate.
Base case energy yield assumptions are P50 50 per cent.

probability of exceedance over a 10 year period and P10 10 per cent.
probability of exceedance over a 10 year period sensitivities reect the future variability of wind and the uncertainty associated with the long term data source being representative of the long term mean.
Given their basis on long term operating data, it is not anticipated that base case energy yield assumptions will be adjusted other than any wind energy true-ups with compensating purchase price adjustments.
Long term power price forecasts are provided by a leading market consultant, updated quarterly and may be adjusted by the Investment Manager where more conservative assumptions are considered appropriate.
Base case real power prices increase from approximately 45 MWh 2018 to approximately 55 MWh 2043.

Sensitivity analysis The fair value of the Groups investments is 1,405,724,491 2016: 894,790,604.
The analysis below is provided to illustrate the sensitivity of the fair value of investments to an individual input, while all other variables remain constant.
The Board considers these changes in inputs to be within reasonable expected ranges.
This is not intended to imply the likelihood of change or that possible changes in value would be restricted to this range.

The base case asset life assumption is 25 years.
An asset life sensitivity is not presented owing to the difficulty in quantifying various associated valuation drivers, including: ability to extend the lease term: ability to extend planning permission: commercial terms attaching to any lease extension: operating and maintenance costs associated with longer life: decommissioning costs: and scrap value.
Notwithstanding the difficulty in quantication, the Investment Manager considers asset life extension to be a significant potential upside to the Group.
Asset life is also highlighted as a principal risk and uncertainty in the Strategic Report.

In relation to non-current loans and borrowings, the Board is of the view that the current market interest rate is not signicantly different to the respective instruments contractual interest rates, therefore the fair value of the non-current loans and borrowings at the end of the reporting periods is not signicantly different from their carrying amounts.
On 18 August 2017, the Company renewed its revolving credit facility with RBS, RBC and Santander, with refreshed tenor and lower margin.
The facility was increased from 225,000,000 to 400,000,000, comprising: a tranche A facility of 300,000,000 with a margin of 1.75 per cent.
per annum and a final maturity date of 18 August 2020, which is the third anniversary of the facility agreement: and a tranche B facility of 100,000,000 with a margin of 1.50 per cent.
per annum and a final maturity date of 18 August 2018, which is the first anniversary of the revised facility agreement.
The Company repaid tranche B of the revolving credit facility on 31 October 2017 following the equity raise on 27 October 2017.
Tranche B is not available for redrawing.
The Company is obliged to pay a quarterly commitment fee of 0.65 per cent.
per annum on the undrawn commitment available under Tranche A of the revolving credit facility.
As at 31 December 2017, the balance of this facility was 165,000,000 2016: nil, accrued interest was 613,688 2016: nil and the outstanding commitment fee was 146,651 2016: 193,027.
The Company also has a term debt facility with CBA, together with associated interest rate swaps, which expires on 29 July 2022.
per annum and the swap xed rates are 1.94 per cent.
The swap is an embedded derivative closely related to the host contract.
Accordingly it has been treated as a single xed rate loan agreement which effectively sets interest payable at xed rates of 3.59 per cent.
As at 31 December 2017, the balance of this facility was 100,000,000 2016: 100,000,000 and accrued interest on the term debt facility and associated swap was 579,615 2016: 570,266.
All borrowing ranks pari passu and is secured by a debenture over the assets of the Company, including its shares in Holdco, and a oating charge over Holdcos bank accounts.

Contingencies At the time of acquisition, wind farms which had less than 12 months operational data may have had a wind energy true-up applied, whereby the purchase price for these wind farms may be adjusted so that it is based on a2 year operational record, once the operational data has become available.
On 17 May 2017, the Stroupster wind energy true-up was agreed and BayWa made a payment to the Group of 2,600,000 on 31 July 2017.
The Stroupster load factor has been reduced accordingly.
The following 2 wind energy true-ups remain outstanding and the maximum adjustment under each are as follows: Clyde Extension 4,747,094: and Corriegarth 9,069,293.
The Board and the Investment Manager are of the opinion that the estimate of the energy yield utilised at acquisition for the remaining assets is the most appropriate unbiased estimate of the yield following 2 years operational data.
Any variances of actual energy production from the date of acquisition to the date of signing this report are attributable to weather uctuations and other short term operational factors rather than more fundamental factors that might inuence the long term assessment.
Therefore it is not appropriate to recognise an asset or liability in respect of these acquisitions.

Financial risk management The Investment Manager and the Administrator report to the Board on a quarterly basis and provide information to the Board which allows it to monitor and manage financial risks relating to its operations.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups market risk is managed by the Investment Manager in accordance with the policies and procedures in place.
The Groups overall market positions are monitored on a quarterly basis by the Board.
Price risk Price risk is dened as the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument held by the Group will uctuate.
Investments are measured at fair value through profit or loss and are valued on an unlevered, discounted cash ow basis.
Therefore, the value of these investments will be amongst other risk factors a function of the discounted value of their expected cash ows and, as such, will vary with movements in interest rates and competition for such assets.
As disclosed in note 9, the discount factors are subjective and therefore it is feasible that a reasonable alternative assumption may be used resulting in a different valuation for these investments.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk on interest bearing financial assets is limited to interest earned on cash.
The Groups only other exposure to interest rate risk is due to oating interest rates required to service external borrowings through the revolving credit facility.
represents the Investment Managers assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates.
Should the LIBOR rate increase from 0.5 per cent.
the annual interest due on the facility would increase by 1,650,000 2016: nil.
The Investment Manager regularly monitors interest rates to ensure the Group has adequate provisions in place in the event of significant uctuations.

Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk continued The associated interest rate swaps on amounts drawn under the 7 year term debt facility with CBA effectively set interest payable at a xed rate for the full term of the loan, thereby mitigating the risks associated with the variability of cash ow arising from interest rate uctuations.
The Board considers that, as shareholder loan investments bear interest at a xed rate, they do not carry any interest rate risk.
The Groups interest and non-interest bearing assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2017 are summarised below: Interest bearing Non-interest Fixed rate Floating rate bearing Total Group 000 000 000 000 Assets Cash at bank 5,802 120 5,922 Other receivables note 11 1,409 1,409 Investments note 9 114,559 1,291,165 1,405,724 114,559 5,802 1,292,694 1,413,055 Liabilities Other payables note 12 4,088 4,088 Loans and borrowings note 13 100,000 165,000 265,000 100,000 165,000 4,088 269,088 The Groups interest and non-interest bearing assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2016 are summarised below: Interest bearing Non-interest Fixed rate Floating rate bearing Total Group 000 000 000 000 Assets Cash at bank 3,606 2,254 5,860 Other receivables note 11 3,759 3,759 Investments note 9 107,673 787,118 894,791 107,673 3,606 793,131 904,410 Liabilities Other payables note 12 4,351 4,351 Loans and borrowings note 13 100,000 100,000 100,000 4,351 104,351 67 Greencoat UK Wind PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2017 18.

Financial risk management continued Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of loss due to the failure of a borrower or counterparty to full its contractual obligations.
The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of other receivables, cash at bank and loan investments.
The Groups credit risk exposure is minimised by dealing with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and making loan investments which are equity in nature.
The Company has advanced loans to Holdco, however does not consider these loans a risk as they are intra-Group.
No balances are past due or impaired.
