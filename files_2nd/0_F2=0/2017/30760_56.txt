Deferred acquisition costs DAC on long-term business are generally recoverable in more than one year whereas such costs on general insurance and health business are generally recoverable within one year.
Of the above total, 1,521 million 2016: 1,262 million is expected to be recovered more than one year after the statement of financial position date.
For long-term business where amortisation of the DAC balance depends on projected profits, the amount expected to be recovered is estimated and actual experience will differ.
Surpluses in the staff pension schemes and 9 million 2016: 1 million of other assets are recoverable more than one year after the statement of financial position date.

Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2017 157 Strategic report Governance IFRS financial statements Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 28 Deferred acquisition costs, pension surpluses, other assets, prepayments and accrued income continued The balance of deferred acquisition costs for long-term business increased over 2017 mainly due to reductions in per policy costs on unitlinked pensions increasing the level of DAC that can be supported in UK Life business.
The balance of deferred acquisition costs for general insurance and health business increased over 2017 mainly due to increased new business sales.
Where amortisation of the DAC balance depends on projected profits, changes to economic conditions may lead to a movement in the DAC balance and a corresponding impact on profit.
It is estimated that the movement in the DAC balance would reduce profit by 38 million 2016: 19 million if market yields on fixed income investments were to increase by 1% and increase profit by 29 million 2016: reduce profit by 1 million if yields were to reduce by 1%.
At both 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 the DAC balance has been restricted by the value of projected future profits and hence is more sensitive to changes in the value of those projected profits.
Furthermore, the profile of this restriction across product lines has changed leading to a directional switch in the sensitivity year-on-year.
c Prepayments and accrued income Prepayments and accrued income of 2,876 million 2016: 2,996 million include assets classified as held for sale of 16 million 2016: 114 million and includes 7 million 2016: 8 million that is expected to be recovered more than one year after the statement of financial position date.
29 Assets held to cover linked liabilities Certain unit-linked products have been classified as investment contracts, while some are included within the definition of an insurance contract.
The assets backing these unit-linked liabilities are included within the relevant balances in the consolidated statement of financial position, while the liabilities are included within insurance and investment contract provisions.
This note analyses the carrying values of assets backing these liabilities.

Refer to note 26 a for further details of this adjustment and the financial statement impact arising.
The reinsurance assets balance in the table above includes 6,094 million 2016: 18,366 million of non-participating investment contracts, which are legally reinsurance but do not meet the definition of a reinsurance contract under IFRS.
These assets are financial instruments measured at fair value through profit and loss and are classified as Level 1 assets.
At 31 December 2017, the exposure on these reinsurance assets has reduced significantly as a result of action taken to restructure agreements with the Groups largest reinsurance counterparty, BlackRock Life Limited, and reduce counterparty risk.
As a consequence of this 14,353 million of funds previously reported with BlackRock Life Limited have been transferred to debt and equity securities.
