British Empire Trust plc 55 Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Investment Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
General information and accounting policies British Empire Trust plc is a company incorporated and registered in England and Wales.
The principal activity of the Company is that of an investment trust company within the meaning of Sections 1158 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 and its investment approach is detailed in the Strategic Report.
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, which comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The annual financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with the AIC SORP for the financial statements of investment trust companies and venture capital trusts, except to any extent where it is not consistent with the requirements of IFRS.
Basis of preparation The functional currency of the Company is Pounds Sterling because this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.
The financial statements are also presented in Pounds Sterling rounded to the nearest thousand, except where otherwise indicated.
Going concern The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and on the basis that approval as an investment trust company will continue to be met.
The Directors have made an assessment of the Companys ability to continue as a going concern and are satisfied that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future being a period of 12 months from the date these financial statements were approved.
Furthermore, the Directors are not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Companys ability to continue as a going concern, having taken into account the liquidity of the Companys investment portfolio and the Companys financial position in respect of its cash flows, debt and investment commitments of which there are none of significance.
Therefore, the financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
Segmental reporting The Directors are of the opinion that the Company is engaged in a single segment of business, being investment business.
The Company primarily invests in companies listed in the UK and other recognised international exchanges.
Accounting developments The accounting policies are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
The following accounting standards and their amendments were in issue at the period end but will not be in effect until after this financial year end.
The Directors are considering the impact of the standards upon the financial statements.
The impact of IFRS 9 in future periods will increase disclosure requirements and change the presentation of investments and the allocation of income.
This will require the consideration of future expected cash flows in holding financial assets.
There should be no material impact on the overall returns of the Company.
It is not envisaged that the other standards listed below will have a material effect on the financial statements.
International Financial Reporting Standards Effective date IFRS 7 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 Disclosures 1 January 2018 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts in the Balance Sheet, the Statement of Comprehensive Income and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future period if the revision affects both current and future periods.
There were no significant accounting estimates or significant judgements in the current period.
56 British Empire Trust plc Annual Report 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Investments The Companys business is investing financial assets with a view to capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with the documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
The investments held by the Company are designated at fair value through profit or loss.
All gains and losses are allocated to the capital return within the Statement of Comprehensive Income as Gains or losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Also included within this heading are transaction costs in relation to the purchase or sale of investments.
When a purchase or sale is made under a contract, the terms of which require delivery within the timeframe of the relevant market, the investments concerned are recognised or derecognised on the trade date.
All investments are designated upon initial recognition as held at fair value through profit or loss, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which is either the bid price or closing price for Stock Exchange Electronic Trading Service quotes and crosses SETSqx.
The Company derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the assets carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been accumulated is recognised in profit or loss.
Fair values for unquoted investments, or for investments for which the market is inactive, are established by using various valuation techniques in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital the IPEV guidelines.
These may include recent arms length market transactions, the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and reference to similar quoted companies.
Where there is a valuation technique commonly used by market participants to price the instrument and that technique has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions, that technique is utilised.
Where no reliable fair value can be estimated for such instruments, they are carried at cost, subject to any provision for impairment.
These are constantly monitored for value and impairment.
The values and impairment, if any, are approved by the Board.
All investments for which a fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy levels in note 14.
A transfer between levels may result from the date of an event or a change in circumstances.
Foreign currency Transactions denominated in currencies other than Pounds Sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Items which are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing on the Balance Sheet date.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rate subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the capital reserve or the revenue account depending on whether the gain or loss is capital or revenue in nature.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments and money market funds, that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts when applicable.
Other receivables and payables Trade receivables, trade payables and short-term borrowings are measured at amortised cost and balances revalued for exchange rate movements.
Income Dividends receivable on quoted equity shares are taken to revenue on an ex-dividend basis.
Dividends receivable on equity shares where no ex-dividend date is quoted are brought into account when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Fixed returns on non-equity shares are recognised on a time-apportioned basis.
Dividends from overseas companies are shown gross of any withholding taxes which are disclosed separately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Special dividends are taken to the revenue or capital account depending on their nature.
In deciding whether a dividend should be regarded as a capital or revenue receipt, the Board reviews all relevant information as to the reasons for the sources of the dividend on a case-by-case basis.
When the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend forgone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the cash dividend is recognised in the capital column.
All other income is accounted on a time-apportioned accruals basis and is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Expenses and finance costs All expenses are accounted on an accruals basis.
On the basis of the Boards expected long-term split of total returns in the form of capital and revenue returns of 70% and 30% respectively, the Company charges 70% of its management fee and finance costs to capital.
British Empire Trust plc 57 Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Investment Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Expenses incurred directly in relation to arranging debt finance are amortised over the term of the finance.
Expenses incurred in buybacks of shares to be held in treasury are charged to the capital reserve through the Statement of Changes in Equity.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the net revenue for the year and takes into account taxation deferred or accelerated because of temporary differences between the treatment of certain items for accounting and taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of timing differences can be deducted.
In line with recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate the tax relief on expenses charged to capital is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by expenses charged through the revenue account, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital account.
Dividends payable to shareholders Dividends to shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are paid or approved in general meetings and are taken to the Statement of Changes in Equity.
Dividends declared and approved by the Company after the Balance Sheet date have not been recognised as a liability of the Company at the Balance Sheet date.
Non-current liabilities: Debenture and Loan Notes The non-current liabilities are valued at amortised cost.
Costs in relation to arranging the debt finance have been capitalised and are amortised over the term of the finance.
Hence, amortised cost is the par value less the amortised costs of issue.
The Euro Loan Note is shown at amortised cost with the exchange difference on the principal amounts to be repaid reflected.
Any gain or loss arising from changes in the exchange rate between Euro and Sterling is included in the capital reserves and shown in the capital column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Further details of the non-current liabilities are set out in notes 11 and 14.
Capital redemption reserve The capital redemption reserve represents non-distributable reserves that arise from the purchase and cancellation of shares.
Share premium The share premium account represents the accumulated premium paid for shares issued in previous periods above their nominal value less issue expenses.
This is a reserve forming part of the non-distributable reserves.
The following items are taken to this reserve: costs associated with the issue of equity: and premium on the issue of shares.
Capital reserve The following are taken to the capital reserve through the capital column in the Statement of Comprehensive Income: Capital reserve other: gains and losses on the disposal of investments: amortisation of issue expenses: costs of share buybacks: exchange differences of a capital nature: and expenses, together with the related taxation effect, allocated to this reserve in accordance with the above policies.
Capital reserve investment holding gains: increase and decrease in the valuation of investments held at the year end.
The capital reserve is not distributable.
Merger reserve The merger reserve represents the share premium on shares issued on the acquisition of Selective Assets Trust plc on 13 October 1995 and is not distributable.
Revenue reserves The revenue reserve represents the surplus of accumulated profits and is distributable by the way of dividends.

60 British Empire Trust plc Annual Report 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The tax assessed for the year differs from the standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom of 19%.
The differences are explained below: Year ended 30 September 2017 Year ended 30 September 2016 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Profit before taxation 12,912 129,096 142,008 16,839 183,912 200,751 Theoretical average tax at UK corporation tax rate of 19.5% 2016: 20% 2,518 25,174 27,692 3,368 36,782 40,150 Effects of the non-taxable items: UK franked investment income 57 57 535 535 Tax-exempt overseas investment income 3,353 3,353 3,252 3,252 Exchange gains losses on revenue items 27 27 93 93 Losses gains on investments, exchange gains on capital items and movement on fair value of derivative financial instruments 26,476 26,476 37,871 37,871 Excess management expenses carried forward 865 1,302 2,167 505 1,089 1,594 Overseas tax not recoverable 849 849 1,068 1,579 511 Overseas tax recovered previously expensed 540 540 2,987 2,987 Overseas tax expensed as double tax relief 11 11 Accrued income taxable on receipt 7 7 Tax credit recovery for the year 309 309 1,908 1,579 3,487 Tax rate 20% to 31 March 2017 and 19% from 1 April 2017.
At 30 September 2017, the Company had unrelieved management expenses of 59,611,000 30 September 2016: 48,565,000 that are available to offset future taxable revenue.
A deferred tax asset of 10,134,000 has not been recognised because the Company is not expected to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods in excess of the available deductible expenses and accordingly, the Company is unlikely to be able to reduce future tax liabilities through the use of existing surplus losses.
Deferred tax is not provided on capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments because the Company meets and intends to continue for the foreseeable future to meet the conditions for approval as an investment trust company.

Financial instruments and capital disclosures Investment objective and policy The investment objective of the Company is to achieve capital growth through a focused portfolio of investments, particularly in companies whose share prices stand at a discount to estimated underlying net asset value.
The Companys investment objective and policy are detailed on page 38.
The Companys financial instruments comprise equity and fixed-interest investments, cash balances, receivables, payables and borrowings.
The Company makes use of borrowings to achieve improved performance in rising markets.
The risk of borrowings may be reduced by raising the level of cash balances or fixed-interest investments held.
Risks The risks identified arising from the financial instruments are market risk which comprises market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and credit and counterparty risk.
The Company may also enter into derivative transactions to manage risk.
The Board and Investment Manager consider and review the risks inherent in managing the Companys assets which are detailed below.
Market risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss which the Company might suffer through holding market positions by way of price movements, interest rate movements and exchange rate movements.
The Investment Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and these risks are monitored by the Investment Manager on a regular basis and the Board at quarterly meetings with the Investment Manager.
Market price risk Market price risk i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from currency risk or interest rate risk may affect the value of investments.
The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse price movements through detailed and continuing analysis with the objective of maximising overall returns to shareholders.
If the fair value of the Companys investments at the year end increased or decreased by 10%, then it would have had an impact on the Companys capital return and equity of 95,051,000 2016: 88,637,000.
Foreign currency The value of the Companys assets and the total return earned by the Companys shareholders can be significantly affected by foreign exchange rate movements as most of the Companys assets are denominated in currencies other than Pounds Sterling, the currency in which the Companys financial statements are prepared.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to Pounds Sterling upon receipt.
A 5% rise or decline of Sterling against foreign currency denominated i. e. non Pounds Sterling assets and liabilities held at the year end would have increased decreased the net asset value by 39,898,000 2016: 36,813,000.

The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions.
The Company, generally, does not hold significant cash balances, with short-term borrowings being used when required.
The Debenture Stock and Loan Notes issued by the Company pay a fixed-rate of interest and are carried in the Companys Balance Sheet at amortised cost rather than at fair value.
Hence, movements in interest rates will not affect net asset values, as reported under the Companys accounting policies, but may have an impact on the Companys share price and discount premium.
The fair value of the debt and its effect on the Companys assets is set out below.
The exposure at 30 September of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to floating interest rates.
At At 30 September 30 September 2017 2016 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and cash equivalents 25,496 13,799 If the above level of cash was maintained for a year, a 1% increase in interest rates would increase the revenue return and net assets by 255,000 2016: 138,000.
Management proactively manages cash balances.
If there was a fall by 1% in interest rates, it would potentially impact the Company by turning positive interest to negative interest.
The total effect would be a cost increase revenue reduction of 255,000.
The fair value of the Companys Debenture Stock and Loan Notes at the year end was 80,126,000 2016: 81,642,000.
A 1% increase in the applicable interest rates would be expected to increase the fair values of the Debenture Stock and Loan Notes by approximately 8.4m 2016: 9.0m, all other factors being equal.
A 1% decrease would decrease the fair values by approximately 9.8m, all other factors being equal.
This will impact the market value of the fixed-interest debt.

British Empire Trust plc 69 Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Investment Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Valuation of financial instruments The Company measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant assets as follows: Level 1 valued using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs for the asset or liability other than quoted prices included within Level 1.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data for the asset or liability.
The tables below set out fair value measurements of financial instruments as at the year end, by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised.

This was transferred to Level 3 at market value and realised during the year, as set out in the table below.
The valuation of Level 2 financial assets is determined using the average of independent broker traded prices available in the market.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies note on page 56.

The other financial assets and financial liabilities 8 of the Company are carried in the Balance Sheet at an approximation to their fair value.
The fair value is the amount at which the asset could be sold or the liability transferred in an orderly transaction between market participants, at the measurement date, other than a forced or liquidation sale.

As there is no publicly available price for the Companys Loan Notes, their fair market value has been derived by calculating the relative premium or discount of the loan versus the publicly available market price of the reference market instrument and exchange rates.
As this price is derived by model, using observable inputs, it would be categorised as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy.
The financial liabilities in the table below are shown at fair value, being the amount at which the liability may be transferred in an orderly transaction between market participants.
The costs of early redemption of the Debenture Stock and Loan Notes are set out on page 50.
The Debenture Stock is valued by reference to the price prevailing on an active market, so is determined as Level 1.
The market values of the Loan Notes are determined by the calculation above using observable inputs, and they are considered as Level 2.

The Board, with the assistance of the Investment Manager, regularly monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
