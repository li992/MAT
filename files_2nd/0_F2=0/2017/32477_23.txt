52 National Grid Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 17 Notes to the consolidated financial statements - analysis of items in the primary statements 1.
Segmental analysis This note sets out the financial performance for the year split into the different parts of the business operating segments.
We monitor and manage the performance of these operating segments on a day-to-day basis.
We work with our regulators to obtain robust regulatory agreements that balance the risks we face with the opportunity to deliver reasonable returns for our investors.
Our regulated businesses earn revenue for the transmission and distribution discontinued services they have provided during the year.
In any one year, the revenue recognised may differ from the revenue allowed under our regulatory agreements and any such timing differences are adjusted against future prices.
Revenue primarily represents the sales value derived from the transmission and distribution discontinued of gas and the provision of gas metering services during the year including an assessment of the value of services provided, but not invoiced, at the year end.
It excludes value added tax and intra-group sales.
The sales value for the transmission and distribution discontinued of gas is largely determined from the amount of system capacity sold for the year, and the amount of gas transported for the year, evaluated at contractual prices on a monthly basis.
The sales value for the provision of gas metering services is largely derived from monthly charges for the provision of individual meters under contractual arrangements.
Where revenue for the year exceeds the maximum amount permitted by regulatory agreement, and adjustments will be made to future prices to reflect this overrecovery, a liability for the over-recovery is not recognised as such an adjustment to future prices relates to the provision of future services.
Similarly, an asset is not recognised where a regulatory agreement permits adjustments to be made to future prices in respect of an under-recovery.
Revenue includes income arising from the sale of properties as a result of property management activities, from the sale of emission allowances and from the recovery of pension deficit from other gas transporters under regulatory arrangement.
We present revenue and the results of the business analysed by operating segment, based on the information the Board of Directors uses internally for the purposes of evaluating the performance of operating segments and determining resource allocation between operating segments.
The Board is National Grid Gas plc's chief operating decision-making body as dened by IFRS 8 'Operating Segments' and assesses the performance of operations principally on the basis of operating profit before exceptional items and remeasurements see note 3.
There has been no change to the way in which our businesses have reported internally during the year.
However, for the purpose of this note, the reporting structure for the year ended 31 March 2017 has been updated to show the Gas Distribution segment as a discontinued operation together with the results of Xoserve Limited.
The following table describes the main activities for each operating segment: Gas Transmission - The gas transmission network in Great Britain and liquefied natural gas LNG storage activities Gas Distribution discontinued - Four of the eight regional networks of Great Britain's gas distribution system The reporting structure including comparatives for the year ended 31 March 2016 has been updated to show the previously reported Gas Distribution segment within discontinued operations.
Other activities relate to the gas metering business which provides regulated gas metering activities in the UK, together with corporate activities.
Xoserve Limited discontinued provides transportation transaction services on behalf of all the major gas network transportation companies.
The results for the year ending 31 March including comparatives have been included in 'discontinued operations'.
Sales between businesses are priced having regard to the regulatory and legal requirements that the businesses are subject to, which include requirements to avoid cross-subsidies.

These fees have been subject to approval by the Audit Committee of National Grid plc.
Exceptional items and remeasurements To monitor our financial performance, we use a profit measure that excludes certain income and expenses.
We call that measure business performance or 'adjusted profit'.
We exclude items from business performance because we believe these items are individually important to understanding our financial performance.
If included, these items could distort understanding of our performance for the year and the comparability between periods.
This note analyses these items, which are included in our results for the year but are excluded from business performance.
Our financial performance is analysed into two components: business performance, which excludes exceptional items and remeasurements: and exceptional items and remeasurements.
Business performance is used by management to monitor financial performance as it is considered that it improves the comparability of our reported financial performance from year to year.
Business performance subtotals are presented on the face of the income statement or in the notes to the financial statements.
Management utilises an exceptional items framework that has been discussed and approved by the National Grid Gas plc Audit Committee.
This follows a three-step process which considers the nature of the event, the financial materiality involved and any particular facts and circumstances.
In considering the nature of the event, management focuses on whether the event is within the Groups control and how frequently such an event typically occurs.
In determining the facts and circumstances management considers factors such as ensuring consistent treatment between favourable and unfavourable transactions, precedent for similar items, number of periods over which costs will be spread or gains earned and the commercial context for the particular transaction.
Items of income or expense that are considered by management for designation as exceptional items include such items as significant restructurings, write-downs or impairments of non-current assets, significant changes in environmental or decommissioning provisions, integration of acquired businesses, gains or losses on disposals of businesses or investments and debt redemption costs as a consequence of transactions such as significant disposals or issues of equity.
Remeasurements comprise gains or losses recorded in the income statement arising from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments to the extent that hedge accounting is not achieved or is not effective.
These fair values increase or decrease because of changes in financial indices and prices over which we have no control.

Further detail of operating exceptional items specific to 2017 During October 2016, following the sale of the Gas Distribution business, the company sold 78 surplus land sites to a number of fellow National Grid Group undertakings, recognising a gain on disposal of 109 million.
A legal agreement was entered into with these National Grid Group companies to demolish the nonoperational gas holders on these sites, creating a constructive obligation for the Company.
As a result a provision of 107 million has been recognised at 31 March 2017.
With effect from 1 January 2017, sectionalisation of the National Grid UK Pension Scheme was carried out, resulting in separation of the scheme into three sections, each of which are legally and actuarially separate.
Section B is included within National Grid Gas plc and the associated costs of 89m have been recognised as exceptional in 2017, see note 19 for further details.
Pension deficit charges arise from the recovery plan contributions to the National Grid UK Pension Scheme for certain employees in other activities which were incurred prior to sectionalisation of the scheme, see note 19.
Remeasurements Net losses on derivative financial instruments comprise gains and losses arising on derivative financial instruments reported in the income statement.
These exclude gains and losses for which hedge accounting has been effective, which have been recognised directly in other comprehensive income or which are offset by adjustments to the carrying value of debt.
Items included within tax The Finance No.
2 Bill 2015 resulted in a reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% for the year beginning 1 April 2017, with a further reduction from 19% to 18% for the year beginning 1 April 2020.
A further reduction to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020 was enacted in the Finance Act 2016.
Deferred taxes at the reporting date have been measured using these enacted tax rates and reflected in these financial statements, resulting in a deferred tax credit.
This credit is presented as exceptional, reflecting its nature.

Finance income and costs This note details the interest income generated by our financial assets and the interest expense incurred on financial liabilities.
In reporting business performance, we adjust net financing costs to exclude any net gains or losses on derivative financial instruments included in remeasurements.

2 Interest on funding attributable to assets in the course of construction was capitalised during the year at a rate of 3.4% 2016:3.2%.
Capitalised interest qualifies for a current year tax deduction with tax relief claimed of 1m 2016: 1m.
3 Includes a net foreign exchange loss on financing activities of 196m 2016: 77m.
These amounts are offset by foreign exchange gains and losses on derivative financial instruments measured at fair value.
4 Includes a net loss on instruments designated as fair value hedges of 11m 2016: 22m offset by a net gain of 32m 2016: 2m arising from the fair value adjustments to the carrying value of debt.

Taxation This note gives further details of the tax charge and tax liabilities, including current and deferred tax.
The current tax charge is the tax payable on this years taxable profits.
Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment to provide for tax that is expected to arise in the future due to differences in accounting and tax bases.
The tax charge for the period is recognised in the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity, according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amounts expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amounts are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
The calculation of the Groups total tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement, and management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is provided for using the balance sheet liability method and is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised on all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
However, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction other than a business combination that affects neither the accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company and its subsidiaries intend to settle their current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Factors that may affect future tax charges The Finance Act 2016 which was enacted on 15 September 2016 reduced the main rate of UK corporation tax to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.
Deferred tax balances have been calculated at this rate.
Whilst the UK remains part of the EU, the evolution of the application of EU tax competition regulations continues to create uncertainty over tax legislation and at this stage it is not possible to quantify any potential impact on the financial statements.
As the Group's presence is in the UK, we do not envisage a significant impact on the Group following the UK Government's decision to invoke Article 50 to leave the EU.

Dividends Dividends represents the return of profits to shareholders.
Dividends are paid as an amount per ordinary share held.
We retain part of the profits generated in the year to meet future growth plans and meet our gearing target, and pay out the remainder in accordance with our dividend policy.
Interim dividends are recognised when they become payable to the Companys shareholders.
Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by shareholders.
The following table shows the dividends paid to equity shareholders: 2017 2016 pence pence per ordinary 2017 per ordinary 2016 share m share m Ordinary dividends Interim dividend paid in the year 205.38 8,100 15.72 620 National Grid Gas paid two dividends during the year, Interim dividend A of 5,917m and interim dividend B of 2,183m together, the interim dividends.
The interim dividends were made to ensure partial distribution of the proceeds from the Gas Distribution business.
Discontinued Operations Cash flows and operations that relate to a major component of the business or geographical region that has been sold or is classified as held for sale are shown separately from continuing operations.
Finance income or costs are included in discontinued operations only in respect of financial assets or liabilities classified as held for sale or derecognised on sale.
Disposal of Gas Distribution National Grid plc made an announcement, as part of the interim results release in November 2015, that it was commencing a process for the potential sale of a majority stake in the Gas Distribution business comprising four of the eight regional networks of Great Britains gas distribution system.
As part of the preparation for the external sale, National Grid Gas plc approved the sale of the trade and assets of the Gas Distribution business to a separate statutory entity, National Grid Gas Distribution Limited.
This sale was approved by the Board on 30 September 2016 and took place on 1 October 2016.
This entity was sold to a National Grid Group company and National Grid Gas plc had and has no direct or indirect ownership of National Grid Gas Distribution Limited.
On 1 October 2016, the Company transferred a majority of its 56.57% shareholding in Xoserve Limited to National Grid Gas Distribution Limited, resulting in the Company retaining a minority interest of 11%.
Accordingly, the results of the Gas Distribution business and Xoserve Limited are both presented as a discontinued operations.
The segmental analysis in note 2 has also been re-presented to show these both as discontinued operations.
The presentation of the 2017 income statement is required to be split between continuing and discontinued operations and to re-present results for previous periods in a comparable manner.
Revenues, operating expenses and operating profits: Discontinued results are closely aligned to the previously disclosed Gas Distribution segment, with the results of Xoserve Limited re-allocated from within Other activities.
"Interest costs: Since Gas Distribution was not independently financed prior to its sale it is necessary to allocate the National Grid Gas Groups ""Group"" overall financing cost between continuing and discontinued operations."
In doing so, the Group has presented the results of the continuing business on a basis consistent with how it expects to finance the Group in future periods, to aid comparability in future periods.
Interest costs associated with debt and derivatives which remain in the Group as at 1 October 2016 have been attributed to the continuing group in full.
Interest cost relating to instruments bought back in the period since the disposal process started, debt novated across, and debt and derivatives issued by Gas Distribution as part of the financing exercise have been included within discontinued operations.
The interest costs in the comparative periods for discontinued operations only includes interest that relates to the debt bought back in 2017 and the debt novated into Gas Distribution in 2017.
Tax: Tax follows the amount of revenues, operating costs and interest allocated to discontinued operations.

Intangible assets Intangible assets relate to software, which is written down amortised over the period we expect to receive a benefit from the asset.
Identifiable intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Intangible assets are tested for impairment only if there is some indication that the carrying value of the assets may have been impaired.
Impairments of assets are calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the recoverable amount, if lower.
Where such an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which that asset belongs is estimated.
Impairments are recognised in the income statement and are disclosed separately.
Any assets which suffered impairment in a previous period are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Internally generated intangible assets, such as software, are recognised only if: an asset is created that can be identified: it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and that the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recorded as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Intangible assets under development are not amortised.
Other non-current intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives.
The amortisation period for software is up to eight years.

Property, plant and equipment This note shows the physical assets controlled by us.
The cost of these assets primarily represents the amount initially paid for them.
A depreciation expense is charged to the income statement to reflect annual wear and tear and the reduced value of the asset over time.
Depreciation is calculated by estimating the number of years we expect the asset to be used useful economic life and charging the cost of the asset to the income statement equally over this period.
We operate a gas transmission business and therefore have a significant physical asset base.
We continue to invest in our network to maintain reliability, create new customer connections and ensure our networks are flexible and resilient.
Our business plan envisages these additional investments will be funded through a mixture of cash generated from operations and the issue of new debt.
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
Cost includes the purchase price of the asset, any payroll and finance costs incurred which are directly attributable to the construction of property, plant and equipment, as well as the cost of any associated asset retirement obligations.
Property, plant and equipment includes assets in which the Companys interest comprises legally protected statutory or contractual rights of use.
Additions represent the purchase or construction of new assets, including capital expenditure for safety and environmental assets, and extensions to, enhancements to, or replacement of existing assets.
All contributions received prior to 1 July 2009 towards the cost of property, plant and equipment and contributions received post 1 July 2009 towards the altering, diverting or relocating a tangible fixed asset are included in trade and other payables as deferred income and credited on a straight-line basis to the income statement over the estimated useful economic lives of the assets to which they relate.
Contributions received post 1 July 2009 towards the cost of tangible fixed assets from customers for connections to the gas transmission and distribution networks are initially recognised as deferred income and credited to revenue once the connection has been completed.
Contributions received post 1 July 2009 towards the provision of ongoing access to a supply of services are recognised initially as deferred income and revenue is subsequently recognised over the period in which the service is provided.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land or assets in the course of construction.
Other items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated, on a straightline basis, at rates estimated to write off their book values over their estimated useful economic lives.
In assessing estimated useful economic lives, consideration is given to any contractual arrangements and operational requirements relating to particular assets.
The assessment of estimated useful economic lives and residual values of assets are performed annually.
Unless otherwise determined by operational requirements, the depreciation periods for the principal categories of property, plant and equipment are, in general, as shown in the table below: Depreciation periods Years Freehold and leasehold buildings up to 50 Plant and Machinery - mains, services and regulating equipment 30 to 100 - meters and metering equipment 10 to 16 Motor vehicles and office equipment up to 7 Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within operating profit in the income statement.
Items within property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment if there is some indication that the carrying value of the assets may have been impaired.
Impairments are recognised in the income statement and material impairments may be disclosed separately.

Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from the price of an underlying item such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, equity or other indices.
In accordance with the National Grid Board approved policies, derivatives are transacted to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rate and foreign exchange rate on borrowings and other contractual cash flows.
Specifically, we use derivatives to manage these risks from our financing portfolio to optimise the overall cost of accessing the debt capital markets.
These derivatives are analysed below.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured at fair value at each reporting date.
Changes in fair values are recorded in the period they arise, in either the income statement or other comprehensive income depending on the applicable accounting standards.
Where the fair value of a derivative is positive it is carried as a derivative asset, and where negative as a derivative liability.
We calculate fair value of the financial derivatives by discounting all future cash ows using the market yield curve at the reporting date.
The market yield curve for each currency is obtained from external sources for interest and foreign exchange rates.
In the absence of sufficient market data, fair values would be based on the quoted market price of similar derivatives.
Analysis of these derivatives and the various methods used to calculate their respective fair values is detailed below and in note 25.
For each class of derivative instrument type the fair value amounts are as follows: 2017 2016 Asset Liabilities Total Asset Liabilities Total m m m m m m Interest rate swaps 363 151 212 595 346 249 Cross-currency interest rate swaps 486 7 479 482 13 469 Foreign exchange forward contracts 8 4 4 2 1 1 Inflation linked swaps 7 257 250 1 206 205 Total 864 419 445 1,080 566 514 The maturity profile of derivative financial instruments is as follows: 2017 2016 Assets Liabilities Total Assets Liabilities Total m m m m m m In one year or less 51 185 134 66 39 27 Current 51 185 134 66 39 27 In 1 - 2 years 69 52 17 21 11 10 In 2 - 3 years 76 30 46 43 63 20 In 3 - 4 years - - - 80 63 17 In 4 - 5 years 412 7 405 - - - More than 5 years 256 145 111 870 390 480 Non-current 813 234 579 1,014 527 487 864 419 445 1,080 566 514 1 For each class of derivative the notional contract amounts are as follows: 2017 2016 m m Interest rate swaps 3,173 4,378 Cross-currency interest rate swaps 728 913 Foreign exchange forward contracts 56 46 Inflation linked swaps 784 762 4,741 6,099 1 The notional contract amounts of derivatives indicate the gross nominal value of transactions outstanding at the balance sheet date.

Derivative financial instruments continued Where possible, derivatives held as hedging instruments are formally designated as hedges as defined in IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement' Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they are fair value hedges, cash ow hedges or net investment hedges.
Our use of derivatives may entail a derivative transaction qualifying for one or more hedge type designations under IAS 39.
Hedge accounting allows derivatives to be designated as a hedge of another non-derivative financial instrument, to mitigate the impact of potential volatility in the income statement of changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments.
To qualify for hedge accounting, documentation is prepared specifying the hedging strategy, the component transactions and methodology used for effectiveness measurement.
National Grid Gas uses two hedge accounting methods, which are described as follows: Fair value hedges Fair value hedges principally consist of interest rate and cross-currency swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of xed-rate, long-term financial instruments due to movements in market interest rates.
For qualifying fair value hedges, all changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the item in relation to the risk being hedged are offset in the income statement to the extent the fair value hedge is effective.
Adjustments made to the carrying amount of the hedged item for fair value hedges will be amortised over the remaining life, in line with the hedged item.
2017 2016 m m Cross-currency interest rate interest rate swaps 537 494 Cash ow hedges Exposure arises from the variability in future interest and currency cash ows on assets and liabilities which bear interest at variable rates or are in a foreign currency.
Interest rate and cross-currency swaps are maintained, and designated as cash ow hedges, where they qualify, to manage this exposure.
Fair value changes on designated cash ow hedges are initially recognised directly in the cash ow hedge reserve, as gains or losses recognised in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts are transferred from equity and recognised in the income statement as the income or expense is recognised on the hedged item.
Forward foreign currency contracts are used to hedge anticipated and committed future currency cash ows.
Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting they are designated as cash ow hedges.
On recognition of the underlying transaction in the financial statements, the associated hedge gains and losses, deferred in equity, are transferred and included with the recognition of the underlying transaction.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Where a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability results from a forecasted transaction or rm commitment being hedged, the amounts deferred in equity are included in the initial measurement of that non-monetary asset or liability.
2017 2016 m m Cross-currency interest rate interest rate swaps 72 162 Foreign exchange forward contracts 4 1 Inflation linked swaps - 85 Cash flow hedges 76 78 Derivatives not in a formal hedge relationship Our policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes.
However, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39 some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in remeasurements within the income statement.
2017 2016 m m Cross-currency interest rate interest rate swaps 83 62 Inflation linked swaps 251 120 Derivatives not in a formal hedge relationship 168 58 Discontinuation of hedge accounting Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gains or losses relating to cash flow hedges recognised in equity are initially retained in equity and subsequently recognised in the income statement in the same periods in which the previously hedged item affects profit or loss, unless the hedged item is no longer expected to occur and then the amounts would be recognised immediately.
For fair value hedges, the cumulative adjustment recorded to the carrying value of the hedged item at the date hedge accounting is discontinued is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest method.
Embedded Derivatives No adjustment is made with respect to derivative clauses embedded in financial instruments or other contracts that are defined as closely related to those instruments or contracts.
Consequently these embedded derivatives are not accounted for separately from the debt instrument.
Where there are embedded derivatives in host contracts not closely related, the embedded derivative is separately accounted for as a derivative financial instrument.

Inventories and current intangible assets Inventories represent assets that we intend to use in order to generate revenue in future periods, either by using it to fulfil a service to a customer or to maintain our network consumables.
Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value.
Where applicable, cost comprises direct materials and direct labour costs as well as those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Emission allowances, principally relating to the emissions of carbon dioxide in the UK, are recorded as intangible assets within current assets and are initially recorded at cost and subsequently at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Where emission allowances are granted by relevant authorities, cost is deemed to be equal to the fair value at the date of allocation.
Receipts of such grants are treated as deferred income, which is recognised in the income statement as the related charges for emissions are recognised or on impairment of the related intangible asset.
A provision is recorded in respect of the obligation to deliver emission allowances and emission charges are recognised in the income statement in the period in which emissions are made.
2017 2016 m m Raw materials and consumables 18 24 Current intangible assets - emission allowances 2 2 20 26 There is a provision for obsolescence of 5m against inventories as at 31 March 2017 2016: 5m.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are amounts which are due from our customers for services we have provided.
Other receivables also include prepayments made by us, for example, property lease rentals paid in advance.
Trade, loan and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less any appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
A provision is established for irrecoverable amounts when there is objective evidence that amounts due under the original payment terms will not be collected.
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and generally have a 30 to 90 day term.
Due to their short maturities, the fair value of trade and other receivables approximates their book value.

Financial and other investments Financial and other investments include two main categories.
Assets classified as available-for-sale typically represent investments in short-term money funds and quoted investments in equities or bonds of other companies.
The second category is loans and receivables which includes bank deposits with a maturity of greater than three months, and cash balances that cannot be readily used in operations, principally collateral pledged for certain borrowings.
Financial assets, liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into, and recognised on trade date.
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classied in any other categories.
Available-for-sale financial investments are recognised at fair value plus directly related incremental transaction costs, and are subsequently carried at fair value in the statement of financial position.
Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale investments are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, until the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired.
At this time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period.
Investment income is recognised using the effective interest method and taken through interest income in the income statement.
Loans receivable and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest income, together with gains and losses when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, are recognised in the income statement.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the fair values of financial assets measured at fair value that are quoted in active markets are based on bid prices.
When independent prices are not available, fair values are determined by using valuation techniques that are consistent with techniques commonly used by the relevant market.
The techniques use observable market data.

2 Comprises collateral placed with counterparties with whom we have entered into a credit support annex to the ISDA Master Agreement.
Available-for-sale investments are recorded at fair value.
Due to their short maturities the carrying value of loans and receivables approximates their fair value.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the financial investments.
For further information on our credit risk, refer to note 25 a.
None of the financial investments are past due or impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash balances, together with short-term investments with an original maturity of less than three months that are readily convertible to cash.
Net cash and cash equivalents reected in the cash ow statement are net of bank overdrafts, which are reported in borrowings.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts approximate their fair values.
Cash at bank earns interest at oating rates based on daily bank deposit rates.
Short-term deposits are made for periods varying between one day and three months, depending on the immediate cash requirements, and earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates.
Net cash and cash equivalents held in currencies other than sterling have been converted into sterling at year-end exchange rates.

Borrowings We borrow money primarily in the form of bonds, borrowings from fellow subsidiaries and bank loans.
These are for a fixed term and may have fixed or floating interest rates or are linked to the retail price index RPI.
As indicated in note 11, we use derivatives to manage risks associated with interest rates and foreign exchange.
Our price controls require us to fund our networks with a certain ratio of debt to equity and, as a result, we have issued a significant amount of debt.
As we continue to invest in our networks, the value of debt is expected to increase over time.
To maintain a strong balance sheet and to allow us to access capital markets at commercially acceptable interest rates, we balance the amount of debt we issue with the value of our assets, and take account of certain other metrics used by credit ratings agencies.
Borrowings, which include interest-bearing and inflation linked debt and overdrafts are recorded at their initial fair value which normally reflects the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs less any repayments.
Subsequently these are stated at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
Any difference between the proceeds after direct issue costs and the redemption value is recognised over the term of the borrowing in the income statement using the effective interest method.

Pensions and other post-employment benefit obligations We have employees who are members of the National Grid UK Pension Scheme Section B which is a defined benefit scheme closed to new entrants.
Membership of the National Grid YouPlan YouPlan defined contribution trust is offered to all new employees.
YouPlan was launched in 2013 and under the rules of the plan, National Grid double matches contributions to YouPlan up to a maximum of 6% of employee salary.
YouPlan is the qualifying scheme used for automatic enrolment and new hires are enroled into YouPlan.
The fair value of defined benefit scheme assets and present value of defined benefit obligations are updated annually in accordance with IAS 19 revised.
During the year ended 31 March 2017, in order for the Gas Distribution business to be sold externally, the National Grid UK Pension Scheme was split into three sections.
This has resulted in a change in National Grid Gas from recognising a pension charge for the year and recognising the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme to recognising a net pension asset on the statement of financial position and accounting as a defined benefit scheme.
Below we provide a more detailed analysis of the amounts recorded in the primary financial statements.
For the defined contribution plan, the Group pays contributions into a separate fund on behalf of the employee and has no further obligations to employees.
The risks associated with this type of plan are assumed by the member.
For the dened benefit retirement scheme, members receive benefits on retirement, the value of which is dependent on factors such as salary and length of pensionable service.
The Group underwrites both financial and demographic risks associated with this type of scheme.
The cost of providing benets in a defined benefit scheme is determined using the projected unit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each reporting date by a qualified actuary.
This valuation method is an accrued benefits valuation method that makes allowance for projected earnings.
The Groups obligation in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is calculated separately by projecting the estimated amount of future benefit payments that employees have earned for their pensionable service in the current and prior periods.
These future benefit payments are discounted to determine the present value of the liabilities and the fair value of plan assets and any unrecognised past service cost is then deducted.
The discount rate used is the yield at the valuation date on high-quality corporate bonds.
The Group takes advice from an independent actuary relating to the appropriateness of any key assumptions applied which include life expectancy of members, expected salary and pension increases, and inflation.
It should be noted that comparatively small changes in the assumptions used may have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the income statement and the statement of other comprehensive income and the net liability recognised in the statement of financial position.
Remeasurements of net retirement obligations are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of other comprehensive income.
Risks The defined benefit pension obligations are exposed to the primary risks outlined below.
Liabilities are calculated using discount rates set with reference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds prevailing in the US and UK debt markets and will fluctuate as yields change.
Scheme funds are invested in a variety of asset classes, principally: equities, government securities, corporate bonds and property.
Consequently, actual returns will differ from the underlying discount rate adopted and therefore have an impact on the net balance sheet liability.
Changes in inflation will affect both current and future pension payments and are partially mitigated through investment in inflation matching assets and hedging instruments.
Longevity is also a key driver of liabilities and changes in expected mortality will have a direct impact on liabilities.
The liabilities are, in aggregate, relatively mature which serves to mitigate this risk to some extent.
The scheme's investment strategy seeks to balance the level of investment return sought with the aim of reducing volatility and risk.
In undertaking this approach reference is made both to the maturity of the liabilities and the funding level.
A number of further strategies are employed to manage underlying risks, including liability matching asset strategies, diversification of asset portfolios, interest rate hedging and active management of foreign exchange exposure.
National Grid UK Pension Scheme The last full actuarial valuation for the National Grid UK Pension Scheme NGUKPS was carried out at 30 September 2015.
Based on long-term financial assumptions, the contribution rate agreed to meet future benefit accrual was 36% of pensionable earnings currently 31% by employers and 5% by employees.
In addition, payments are made to the scheme to cover administration costs and the Pension Protection Fund levy.
With effect from 1 January 2017, sectionalisation of the National Grid UK Pension Scheme was carried out as part of the disposal of Gas Distribution.
The National Grid UK Pension Scheme was split into three sections, each of which are legally and actuarially separate.
Section B is supported by NGG and Section A is supported by other companies within the National Grid Group.
Section C is supported by Cadent.
The figures shown within these financial statements cover Section B.
The first actuarial valuation for Section B will be carried out at 31 March 2017.
The fair value of plan assets as at 31 March 2017 was 5,851m and fair value of plan liabilities as at 31 March 2017 was 5,806m.
National Grid Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 17 73 19.
Pensions and post-employment benefit obligations continued Section B of the National Grid UK Pension Scheme National Grid Gas and the Trustees have agreed a schedule of contributions, under which payments of 30m plus an adjustment for RPI will be made in 2017 18 and will thereafter rise in line with RPI.
National Grid Gas has established a security arrangement with a charge in favour of the Trustees.
This amount may change over time or following changes to National Grid plcs credit rating.
At 31 March 2017 the value of this was required to be 192m.
This was provided via 200m in letters of credit.
The assets held as security will be paid to Section B in the event that National Grid Gas plc NGG is subject to an insolvency event, if NGG is given notice of less than 12 months that Ofgem intends to revoke its licence under the Gas Act 1986, if NGG fails to make the required contributions in relation to Section B, if NGGs credit rating by two out of three specified agencies falls below certain agreed levels for a period of 40 days, or if NGG grants any charges over its assets other than where agreed with the Trustees.
The assets held as security will be released back to National Grid Gas if the scheme moves into surplus.
In addition, NGG will make a payment of 65m increased in line with RPI into Section B if NGGs credit rating by two out of three specified agencies falls below certain agreed levels for a period of 40 days.
The scheme ceased to allow new hires to join from 1 April 2002.
A DC section of the scheme was offered for employees joining after this date, which has since been replaced by The National Grid YouPlan YouPlan.
Actuarial information When deciding on these assumptions we take independent actuarial advice.
Comparatively small changes in the assumptions applied may have a significant effect on the overall deficit or surplus of a defined benefit scheme.
The National Grid UK Pension Scheme is funded with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The arrangements are managed by a trustee company with a board consisting of company and member appointed directors.
The directors are required to manage the arrangements in accordance with local regulations and the arrangements' governing documents, acting on behalf of its beneficiaries.
The arrangements are subject to independent actuarial funding valuations at least every three years and following consultation and agreement with National Grid, the qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers' contribution, which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the scheme's assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable.
The results of 2015 actuarial variation for the NG UKPS are shown below: 1 30 September 2015 Latest full actuarial valuation Actuary Willis Towers Watson Market value of scheme assets at latest valuation 16,551m Actuarial value of benefits due to members 18,176m Market value as percentage of benefits 91% Funding deficit 1,625m Funding deficit net of tax 1,349m 1.
Note the NG UKPS valuation as 30 September 2015 occurred prior to sectionalisation and so the figures above represent the entire scheme including what are now Section A and Section C. All subsequent tables relate to Section B unless stated.

Target asset allocations National Grid UK Section B Pension Schemes investment strategy is formulated specifically in order to manage risk, through investment in diversified asset classes, including the use of liability matching assets and where appropriate through the employment of interest rate and inflation hedging instruments.
The target asset allocation of the scheme as at 31 March 2017 is as follows: % Equities 18 Other 82 Total 100 Actuarial assumptions The following financial assumptions have been applied in assessing defined benefit liabilities.
2017 % i Discount rate 2.4 2 Rate of increase in salaries 3.5 3 Rate of increase in RPI 3.2 1 The discount rate for pension liabilities has been determined by reference to appropriate yields on high quality corporate bonds prevailing in the UK debt market at the reporting date.
2 A promotional scale has also been used where appropriate.
The assumption stated is that relating to service prior to 1 April 2014.
The assumption for the rate of increase in salaries for service after this date is 2.2%.
3 This is the key assumption that determines assumed increases in pensions in payment and deferment.
The assumptions were 3.2% for increases in pensions in payment and 3.2% for increases in pensions in deferment.
There is no material difference between the actuarial assumptions as at 1 January 2017 and 31 March 2017.

Provisions We make provisions when an obligation exists, resulting from a past event and it is probable that cash will be paid to settle it, but the amount of cash required can only be estimated.
The main estimates relate to environmental remediation and decommissioning costs for various sites we own or have owned, other provisions, and lease contracts we have entered into that are now loss making.
We are committed to the protection and enhancement of the environment.
However, we have acquired, owned and operated a number of assets which have, during the course of their operations, created an environmental impact.
Therefore we have a provision that reflects the expected cost to remediate these sites.
Current operations will seldom result in new sites with significant expected costs being added to the provision.
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the reporting date, as a result of a past event, where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated and where the outflow of economic benefit is probable.
Provision is made for decommissioning and environmental costs, based on future estimated expenditures, discounted to present values.
An initial estimate of decommissioning and environmental costs attributable to property, plant and equipment is recorded as part of the original cost of the related property, plant and equipment.
Changes in the provision arising from revised estimates or discount rates or changes in the expected timing of expenditures that relate to property, plant and equipment are recorded as adjustments to their carrying value and depreciated prospectively over their remaining estimated useful economic lives: otherwise such changes are recognised in the income statement.
The unwinding of the discount is included within the income statement as a nancing charge.

During October 2016, following the sale of the Gas Distribution business, the company sold 78 surplus land sites to a number of fellow National Grid Group undertakings, recognising a gain on disposal of 109 million.
A legal agreement was entered into with these National Grid Gas Group companies to demolish the non-operational gas holders on these sites, creating a constructive obligation for the Company.
Environmental provision The environmental provision represents the estimated restoration and remediation costs relating to old gas manufacturing sites owned by the Company discounted using a real rate of 1.0%.
Cash flows are expected to be incurred between 2017 and 2076.
A number of uncertainties affect the calculation of the provision including the impact of regulation, the accuracy of the site surveys, unexpected contaminants, transportation costs, the impact of alternative technologies and changes in the discount rate.
The provision incorporates our best estimate of the financial effect of these uncertainties, but future material changes in any of the assumptions could materially impact the calculation of the provision.
The undiscounted amount of the provision at 31 March 2017 was 27m 2016:87m, being the undiscounted best estimate of the liability having regard to these uncertainties.
Restructuring provision The restructuring provision principally relates to business reorganisation costs in the UK and is expected to be incurred until 2019.
Other provisions Other provisions at 31 March 2017 include 134m 2016: nil in respect of business set up costs and business restructuring costs.
We expect the majority of this provision to be utilised within one year.

Share capital Ordinary share capital represents the total number of shares issued.
Share capital is accounted for as an equity instrument.
An equity instrument is any contract that includes a residual interest in the consolidated assets of the Company after deducting all its liabilities and is recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs, with an amount equal to the nominal amount of the shares issued included in the share capital account and the balance recorded in the share premium account.

Commitments and contingencies Commitments are those amounts that we are contractually required to pay in the future as long as the other party meets their obligations.
These commitments primarily relate to operating lease rentals and energy purchase agreements which, in many cases, extend over a long period of time.
We also disclose any guarantees that companies have given, where we pledge assets against current obligations which will remain for a specific period.

Financial risk management Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks including currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, capital risk and liquidity risk.
Our risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential volatility of financial performance from these risks.
We use financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, to manage risks of this type.
This note describes our approach to managing risk, including an analysis of assets and liabilities by currency type and an analysis of interest rate category for our net debt.
We are required by accounting standards to also include a number of specific disclosures, such as a maturity analysis of contractual undiscounted cash flows and have included these requirements below.
Risk management related to nancing activities is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Finance Committee of the National Grid plc Board.
The objective of the treasury department is to manage funding and liquidity requirements, including managing associated financial risks, to within acceptable boundaries.
The Finance Committee provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specic areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
We have exposure to the following risks, which are described in more detail below: credit risk: liquidity risk: interest rate risk: currency risk: and capital risk.
a Credit risk We are exposed to the risk of loss resulting from counterparties default on their commitments including failure to pay or make a delivery on a contract.
This risk is inherent in our commercial business activities.
We are exposed to credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
Treasury credit risk Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from the use of derivative instruments.
Our limits are managed by the central treasury department of National Grid.
As at 31 March 2016 and 2017, we had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
In accordance with our treasury policies, counterparty credit exposure utilisations are monitored daily against the counterparty credit limits.
Counterparty credit ratings and market conditions are reviewed continually with limits being revised and utilisation adjusted, if appropriate.
Management does not expect any significant losses from non performance by these counterparties.
Customer credit risk Our principal commercial exposure is governed by the credit rules within the Uniform Network Code.
These set out the level of credit relative to the regulatory asset value RAV for each credit rating.
Our credit policies and practices are designed to limit credit exposure by collecting security deposits prior to providing utility services, or after utility service has commenced if certain applicable regulatory requirements are met.
Collection activities are managed on a daily basis.
Sales to retail customers are usually settled in cash, cheques, electronic bank payments or by using major credit cards.
The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored and collateral is collected against these accounts when necessary.
Management does not expect any significant losses of receivables that have not been provided for as shown in note 13.
National Grid Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 17 81 25.
Financial risk management continued a Credit risk continued Offsetting financial assets and liabilities The following tables set out financial assets and liabilities which are subject to offset and to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements.
The tables show the amounts which are offset and reported net in the statement of financial position.
Amounts which cannot be offset under IFRS, but which could be settled net under terms of master netting agreements if certain conditions arise, and with collateral received or pledged, are shown to present National Grid Gas's net exposure.
Financial assets and liabilities on different transactions are only reported net if the transactions are with the same counterparty, a legal right of offset exists and the cash flows are intended to be settled on a net basis.
Amounts which do not meet the criteria for offsetting on the statement of financial position but could be settled net in certain circumstances principally relate to derivative transactions under ISDA International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements where each party has the option to settle amounts on a net basis in the event of default of the other party.
National Grid Gas has similar arrangements in relation to bank account balances and bank overdrafts: and trade payables and trade receivables which are subject to general terms and conditions.
However, these balances are immaterial.

Financial risk management continued b Liquidity risk We determine our liquidity requirements by the use of both short-term and long-term cash flow forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 24 month period and maintain adequate liquidity for a continuous 12 month period.
We believe our contractual obligations, including those shown in commitments and contingencies in note 23 can be met from existing cash and investments, operating cash ows and internal or external nancing that we reasonably expect to be able to secure in the future, together with the use of committed facilities if required.
Our debt agreements and banking facilities contain covenants, including those relating to the periodic and timely provision of financial information by the issuing entity, and financial covenants such as maintaining current rating levels.
Failure to comply with these covenants, or to obtain waivers of these requirements, could in some cases trigger a right, at the lenders discretion, to require repayment of some of our debt, and may restrict our ability to draw upon our facilities to access the capital markets.

Floating rate interest is estimated using a forward interest rate curve as at 31 March.
Payments are included on the basis of the earliest date on which the Company can be required to settle.
National Grid Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 17 83 25.
Financial risk management continued c Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from our long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose us to cash flow interest rate risk, partially offset by cash held at variable rates.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose us to fair value interest rate risk.
Our interest rate risk management policy is to seek to minimise total financing costs being interest costs and changes in the market value of debt subject to constraints.
We do this by using fixed and floating rate debt and derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps, swaptions and forward rate agreements.
We hold some borrowings on issue that are ination linked.
We believe that these provide a partial economic offset to the ination risk associated with our UK ination linked revenues.
The table in note 16 borrowings sets out the carrying amount, by contractual maturity, of borrowings that are exposed to interest rate risk before taking into account interest rate swaps.
During 2017 and 2016, net debt was managed using derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk as follows: 2017 Fixed Floating 1 Other rate rate RPI Total m m m m m Financial investments - 1,835 - 21 1,856 Borrowings 1,891 535 3,060 - 5,486 Pre-derivative position 1,891 1,300 3,060 21 3,630 Derivative effect 1,549 1,117 13 - 445 Net debt 342 183 3,047 21 3,185 2016 Cash and cash equivalents - - - - - Financial investments - 116 - 21 137 Borrowings 3,018 2,030 4,055 - 9,103 Pre-derivative position 3,018 1,914 4,055 21 8,966 Derivative effect 1,836 1,374 52 - 514 Net debt 1,182 3,288 4,003 21 8,452 1 Represents financial instruments which are not directly affected by interest rate risk, including investments in equity or other non-interest bearing instruments.
d Currency risk We are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from non-sterling future commercial transactions and non-sterling recognised assets and liabilities.
Our policy for managing foreign exchange risk is to hedge contractually committed foreign currency cash flows over a prescribed minimum size.
Where foreign currency cash forecasts are less certain, our policy is to hedge a proportion of the cash flows based on the probability of those cash flows occurring.
Instruments used to manage foreign exchange transaction risk include foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange swaps.
During 2017 and 2016, derivative financial instruments were used to manage foreign currency risk as follows: 2017 Sterling Euro Dollar Other Total m m m m m Financial investments 1,856 - - - 1,856 Borrowings 4,015 226 906 339 5,486 Pre-derivative position 2,159 226 906 339 3,630 Derivative effect 995 190 912 338 445 Net debt position 3,154 36 6 1 3,185 2016 Financial investments 137 - - - 137 Borrowings 7,498 210 1,041 354 9,103 Pre-derivative position 7,361 210 1,041 354 8,966 Derivative effect 1,075 177 1,059 353 514 Net debt position 8,436 33 18 1 8,452 There was no significant currency exposure on other financial instruments, including trade receivables and payables, and other receivables and payables.

Financial risk management continued e Capital risk management The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity, as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity, and net debt note 21.
Our objectives when managing capital are: to safeguard our ability to continue as a going concern, to remain within regulatory constraints of our regulated operating company and to maintain an efficient mix of debt and equity funding thus achieving an optimal capital structure and cost of capital.
We regularly review and manage the capital structure as appropriate in order to achieve these objectives.
Maintaining appropriate credit ratings for our regulated company is an important aspect of our capital risk management strategy and balance sheet efficiency.
We monitor our balance sheet efficiency by regulatory asset value RAV gearing calculated as net debt expressed as a percentage of RAV, which indicates the level of debt employed to fund our regulated business.
It is compared with the level of RAV gearing indicated by Ofgem as being appropriate for our business, at around 62.5 - 65%.
The RAV gearing ratio at 31 March 2016 was 55%.
f Fair value analysis The financial instruments included on the statement of financial position are measured at fair value.
These fair values can be categorised into hierarchy levels that are representative of the inputs used in measuring the fair value.
The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market.
In the event that the market for a financial instrument is not active, a valuation technique is used.
2017 2016 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m m m m m Assets Available-for-sale investments 1,632 - - 1,632 - - - - Derivative financial instruments - 864 - 864 - 1,080 - 1,080 1,632 864 - 2,496 - 1,080 - 1,080 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments - 206 213 419 - 493 73 566 Total 1,632 658 213 2,077 - 587 73 514 Level 1: Financial instruments with quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 2: Financial instruments with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are based directly or indirectly on observable market data.
Level 3: Financial instruments valued using valuation techniques where one or more significant inputs are based on unobservable market data.
Our level 3 derivative financial instruments include currency swaps where the currency forward curve is illiquid and inflation linked swaps where the ination curve is illiquid.
In valuing these instruments a third-party valuation is obtained to support each reported fair value.
The changes in value of our level 3 derivative financial instruments are as follows: 2017 2016 m m At 1 April 73 68 1 Net losses for the year 11 5 2 Reclassification into level 3 129 - At 31 March 213 73 1 Loss of 11m 2016: 5m loss is attributable to derivative financial instruments held at the end of the reporting period and have been recognised in finance costs in the income statement.
2 Sterling RPI swaps reclassified from level 2 into level 3.
The impacts on a post-tax basis of reasonably possible changes in significant level 3 assumptions are as follows: 2017 2016 Income Income Statement Statement m m 1 20 basis points change in LPI market curve 35 31 1 - 20 basis points change in LPI market curve 33 30 1 A reasonably possible change in assumption of other level 3 derivative financial instruments is unlikely to result in a material change in fair values.
The impacts disclosed above were considered on a contract by contract basis with the most significant unobservable inputs identified.

Sensitivities on areas of estimation and uncertainty In order to give a clearer picture of the impact on our results or financial position of potential changes in significant estimates and assumptions, the following sensitivities are presented.
These sensitivities are hypothetical, as they are based on assumptions and conditions prevailing at the year end, and should be used with caution.
The effects provided are not necessarily indicative of the actual effects that would be experienced because our actual exposures are constantly changing.
The sensitivities in the table below show the potential impact in the income statement and consequential impact on net assets for a range of different variables each of which have been considered in isolation i. e. with all other variables remaining constant.
There are a number of these sensitivities which are mutually exclusive and therefore if one were to happen, another would not, meaning a total showing how sensitive our results are to these external factors is not meaningful.
We are further required to show additional sensitivity analysis for changes in interest and exchange rates and these are shown separately in the subsequent table due to the additional assumptions that are made in order to produce meaningful sensitivity disclosures.
The sensitivities included in the table below all have an equal and opposite effect if the sensitivity increases or decreases by the same amount unless otherwise stated.
For example a 10% increase in unbilled revenue at 31 March 2017 would result in an increase in the income statement of 15 million and a 10% decrease in unbilled revenue would have the equal but opposite effect.

3 A change in the discount rate is likely to occur as a result of changes in bond yields and as such would be expected to be offset to a significant degree by a change in the value of the bond assets held by the scheme.
4 The projected impact resulting from a change in RPI reflects the underlying effect on pensions in payment, pensions in deferment and resultant increases in salary assumptions.
5 This change has been applied to both the pre 1 April 2015 and post 1 April 2015 rate of increase in salary assumption.

Further details on sensitivities are provided in note 25 f. Financial instruments assumptions Our financial instruments are sensitive to changes in market variables, being UK interest rates and the UK RPI.
The changes in market variables impacts the valuation of our borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The analysis illustrates the sensitivity of our financial instruments to the changes in market variables.
The following main assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis for continuing operations: the amount of net debt, the ratio of xed to oating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 March 2017 and 2016 respectively: the statement of financial position sensitivity to interest rates relates only to derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale investments, as debt and other deposits are carried at amortised cost and so their carrying value does not change as interest rates move: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net oating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments: and changes in the carrying value of derivatives from movements in interest rates of designated cash ow hedges are assumed to be recorded fully within equity.
