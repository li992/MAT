Fair values The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine the fair value.
Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2017 000 000 000 000 Assets Available for sale securities: equity securities 2,565 2,565 money market funds 10,000 10,000 2,565 10,000 12,565 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2016 000 000 000 000 Assets Available for sale securities: equity securities 1,864 1,864 money market funds 10,000 10,000 1,864 10,000 11,864 The company recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
There have been no transfers between levels during the year 2016: none.
Details of the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values of the financial assets in the above table, along with how reasonably possible changes to the assumptions affect these fair values, are provided in note 31 to the consolidated financial statements.
The fair values of the companys financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values, with the exception of equity investments in subsidiaries, which are carried at historical cost note 43. rathbones.
