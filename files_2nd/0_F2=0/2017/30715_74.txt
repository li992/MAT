The Groups foreign exchange contracts are for periods of 12 months or less.
At 31 December 2017, the Group held outstanding foreign exchange contracts with a net asset fair value of 15 million 62 million asset less 47 million liability.
At 31 December 2016, the fair value was 34 million net asset 133 million asset less 99 million liability.
The overall decrease in the net asset fair value has been due to the weakening of Sterling against the Euro in 2017 and the strengthening of Sterling against the US Dollar which has impacted on the portion of the hedging portfolio that is not in a designated accounting hedge.
Fair value movements are taken to the income statement in the period to offset the exchange gains and losses on the related underlying balances.
Fair value hedges At 31 December 2017, the Group had no designated fair value hedges.
Net investment hedges During the year, certain foreign exchange contracts were designated as net investment hedges in respect of the foreign currency translation risk arising on consolidation of the Groups net investment in its European Euro foreign operations as shown in the table above.
The carrying value of bonds on page 216 includes 4,315 million 2016 3,189 million that are designated as hedging instruments in net investment hedges.
Cash flow hedges During 2017, the Group entered into forward foreign exchange contracts which have been designated as cash flow hedges.
These are hedging the foreign exchange exposure arising on Euro denominated coupon payments relating to notes issued under the Groups European Medium Term Note programme and a number of highly probable forecast transactions denominated in US Dollars.
In addition, the Group carries a balance in reserves that arose from pre-hedging fluctuations in long-term interest rates when pricing bonds issued in prior years.
The balance is reclassified to finance costs over the life of these bonds.

The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects managements view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period.
Foreign exchange sensitivity The Group operates internationally and is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk in relation to Sterling against movements in US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen.
Foreign exchange risk arises from the translation of financial assets and liabilities which are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.
Based on the Groups net financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December, a weakening and strengthening of Sterling against these currencies, with all other variables held constant, is illustrated in the tables below.
The tables exclude financial instruments that expose the Group to foreign exchange risk where this risk is fully hedged with another financial instrument.

The majority of debt is issued at fixed interest rates and changes in the floating rates of interest do not significantly affect the Groups net interest charge, although the majority of cash and liquid investments earn floating rates of interest.
The table below hypothetically shows the Groups sensitivity to changes in interest rates in relation to Sterling, US Dollar and Euro floating rate financial assets and liabilities.
If the interest rates applicable to floating rate financial assets and liabilities were to have increased by 1% 100 basis points, and assuming other variables had remained constant, it is estimated that the Groups finance income for 2017 would have increased by approximately 5 million 2016 3 million increase.
A 1% 100 basis points movement in interest rates is not deemed to have a material effect on equity.

Financial instruments and related disclosures continued h Contractual cash flows for non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative instruments The following tables provides an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash flows including interest payable for the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis.
The Group did not use interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk.
For the purpose of this table, debt is defined as all classes of borrowings except for obligations under finance leases.
Interest is calculated based on debt held at 31 December without taking account of future issuance.
Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date.
Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at 31 December.
Contractual cash flows in respect of operating lease vacant space provisions are excluded from the table below as they are included in the Commitments under non-cancellable operating leases table in Note 41, Commitments.

This option relates to the ability of Novartis to put its shares in the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture to GSK at certain points commencing on 2 March 2018 with payment likely to be due several months after exercise.
See Note 27 Trade and other payables for further information on the Consumer Healthcare put option.
Anticipated contractual cash flows for the repayment of debt and debt interest have decreased by 2.6 billion over the year due to a reduction in the issuance of commercial paper and favourable exchange rate movements on US Dollar denominated debt.
The table below provides an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash flows for the Groups derivative instruments excluding embedded derivatives and equity options, which are not material, using undiscounted cash flows.
The gross cash flows of foreign exchange contracts are presented for the purpose of this table although, in practice, the Group uses standard settlement arrangements to reduce its liquidity requirements on these instruments.
The amounts receivable and payable in less than one year have decreased compared with 31 December 2016 as a result of reduced hedging of the US commercial paper programme.
