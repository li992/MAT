ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 METRO BANK PLC NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies This section sets out the Groups our or we accounting policies which relate to the financial statements as a whole.
Where an accounting policy relates specifically to a note then the related accounting policy is set out within that note.
All policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless stated otherwise.
1.1 General information Metro Bank the Company together with its subsidiaries the Group provides retail and corporate banking services in the UK and is a public limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 Registration number 6419578.
The address of our registered office is One Southampton Row, London WC1B 5HA.
1.2 Basis of preparation Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU, the IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as our Directors are satisfied that the Group and the Company have the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future.
In publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, we have taken advantage of the exemption in section 408 3 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present an individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these financial statements.
1.3 Cash flow statement Cash and cash equivalents comprise balances with less than three months maturity from the date of acquisition, including cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and balances held with the Bank of England.
The consolidated cash flow statement shows the changes in cash and cash equivalents arising during the year from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.
The cash flows from operating activities are determined by using the indirect method.
Net income is therefore adjusted by noncash items, such as measurement gains or losses, changes in provisions, impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as well as changes from receivables and liabilities.
In addition, all income and expenses from cash transactions that are attributable to investing or financing activities are eliminated.
Interest received or paid is classified as operating cash flows.
The cash flows from investing and financing activities are determined by using the direct method.
1.4 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures At the year end the following standards were in issue but not yet effective and have not been adopted early in these financial statements: a IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Full details can be found in note 30. b IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 Leases provides guidance on the classification, recognition and measurement of leases to help provide useful information to the users of financial statements.
IFRS 16 provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities for all applicable leases, with operating leases being brought onto the face of the balance sheet.
IFRS 16 will have a material impact on the amounts recognised in our financial statements.
We are currently assessing the impact of IFRS 16, and it is not practicable to quantify the effect at the date of the publication of these financial statements.
Details of our current lease commitments can be found in note 20. c IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers From 1 January 2018, we adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
We applied the modified retrospective method with the cumulative effect of any adjustments being made directly within retained earnings.
The majority of our revenue is net interest income which is accounted for under IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018.
Accordingly, the majority of our revenues were not affected.
Management has performed an assessment of the non-interest income revenue streams which are within the scope of the new standard.
The impact of adopting the standard is immaterial.
1.5 Segmental reporting IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports and components of the Group which are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker to allocate resources to segments and to assess their performance.
For this purpose, the Chief Operating Decision Maker of the Group is our Board of Directors.
94 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 METRO BANK PLC 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued The Board considers the results of the Group as a whole when assessing the performance of the Group and allocating resources.
Accordingly, the Group has a single operating segment.
We lend solely within the UK and, as such, no geographical analysis is required.
We are not reliant on any single customer.
1.6 Foreign currency translation a Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements are measured using pounds Sterling, the currency of the UK, which is the primary economic environment in which we operate the functional currency.
The financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling, which is our presentation currency.
b Transactions and balances Transactions in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of thetransaction.
Monetary items denominated in a foreign currency are translated using the closing rate as at the reporting date.
Non-monetary items measured at historical cost denominated in a foreign currency are translated with the exchange rate as at the date of initial recognition: non-monetary items in a foreign currency that are measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
Foreign currency differences arising on translation are recognised in other income.
Gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions offered to customers are also recognised in other income.
1.7 Critical accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best assessment of the outcome, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
Management believes that the underlying assumptions are appropriate and that the financial statements therefore present the financial position and results fairly.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed below.
a Impairment losses on loans and advances Individual impairment losses on secured loans and advances are calculated based on an individual valuation of the underlying asset and other expected cash flows.
Collective impairment losses on loans and advances are calculated using a statistical model.
The key assumptions used in the model are the probability of default: the probability of this default resulting in possession and or write-off: and the subsequent loss incurred.
The probability of default and the probability of this default resulting in possession and or write-off are determined based on historic default data observed by the bank.
This approach is industry standard.
The subsequent loss incurred on default is determined using the following inputs: the loan balance, the value of collateral held against a loan and any adjustment required to reflect costs of recovery, or disposal of the collateral.
The key estimate which materially impacts impairment provisions required is considered to be the value of collateral: For mortgage loan receivables, to the extent that: the level of house prices differs by - 10%, for example a property value of 100,000 is increased to 110,000 or decreased to 90,000, the impairment allowance would be an estimated 1.2 million lower or 1.8 million higher respectively.
For commercial loan receivables, to the extent that: the value of collateral differs by - 10%, for example the value of a commercial property on which a loan is secured of 100,000 is increased to 110,000 or decreased to 90,000, the impairment allowance would be an estimated 0.1 million lower or 0.2 million higher respectively.
These key assumptions are monitored quarterly to ensure the impairment allowance is reflective of the current portfolio.
The accuracy of the impairment calculation would therefore be affected by unanticipated changes to the economic situation and assumptions which differ from actual outcomes.
95 Financial statements Governance Strategic report ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 METRO BANK PLC NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued b Effective interest rate IAS 39 requires interest earned from loans and advances to customers to be measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Management must therefore use judgement to estimate the expected life of each instrument and the expected cash flows relating to it.
The accuracy of the effective interest rate may therefore be affected by unexpected market movements, resulting in altered customer behaviour and incorrect assumptions: If the estimated life of retail and commercial mortgages were increased or decreased by 10%, the value of such loans on the balance sheet would be increased or decreased by 0.5 million.
If the estimated life of corporate term loans were increased or reduced by 10%, the value of such assets on the balance sheet would be increased or decreased by 0.7 million.
c Deferred tax The largest element of the deferred tax asset represents the future tax impact of carried-forward tax losses which will reduce the payment of future tax.
This element of the deferred tax asset requires management judgement in assessing its recognition and measurement.
At 31 December 2017, we recognised a deferred tax asset net of 53.7 million 2016: 56.3 million in respect of tax losses carried forward and taxable temporary timing differences.
The decrease reflects in main the use of taxable losses against taxable profits earned during the year.
Accounting standards permit the recognition of a deferred tax asset to the extent that it is probable, more likely than not, that future taxable profits will be available to utilise the tax losses carried forward.
This assessment of future taxable profits has been performed over managements current planning horizon and involves estimation uncertainty, principally relating to projections of future taxable income based on business plans, and how the timing of that income affects the rate the deferred tax asset is valued at.
These income projections include assumptions about our future strategy and our ability to deliver expected performance against projections for new stores, deposit and loan growth, loan to deposit ratio, interest margins and operating costs.
Our Directors are satisfied based on our progress since launch, the detailed projections which include stress-tested scenarios, and the reliability of forecasts used, that sufficient taxable profits will be available to utilise the tax losses carried forward in full, and that the measurement of the deferred tax asset is reasonable.
Net interest income Accounting We recognise interest income and expense for all interest-bearing financial instruments within interest income and interest expense in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
policy The effective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
When calculating the effective interest rate we estimate cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument for example, prepayment options but do not consider future credit losses.
The calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.
Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an impairment loss, interest income is recognised using the original effective interest rate on the net balance.

Fee and commission income Accounting Fee and commission income is earned from a wide range of services we provide to our FANS and customers.
Weaccount for fees and commissions as follows: policy Product and service Nature, timing and satisfaction of performance obligations and payment terms Service charges and We levy a range of standard charges and fees for accountant maintenance or specific account other fee income services.
Where the fee is earned upon the execution of a significant act, for example CHAPs payment charges, these are recognised as revenue when the act is completed for the customer.
Where the income is earned from the provision of services, for example an account maintenance fee, this is recognised as revenue when the service is delivered.
Safe deposit box Revenue is recognised over the period the customer has access to the box from the date income possession is taken.
Safe deposit box fees are billed on either a monthly or annual basis with astandard set price payable dependent on the size of box.
ATM and Where we earn fees from our ATMs or from interchange this is recognised at the point the interchange fees service is delivered.
As disclosed in note 1.5, we provide services solely within the UK and therefore revenues are not presented on a geographic basis.
Revenue is grouped solely by contract-type as we believe this best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

People costs Accounting We operate a defined contribution pension scheme for our colleagues.
Contributions to colleagues individual personal pension plans are made on a contractual basis, with no further payment obligations once the contributions policy have been paid.
These contributions are recognised as an expense when they fall due.

The awards are accounted for under the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
Under this standard, the expense is recognised from the date when there was a shared understanding between parties of the terms of the award to be granted.
This was considered to be in March 2016.
20% of the award vested in March 2016 with a further 16% vesting on 30 April 2017.
The remaining 64% will vest annually on 30 April, 16% each year.
The total expense to be recognised in respect of the Listing Share Awards, equal to the fair value of the awards, is 6.5 million.
This is equal to the market value of shares at the grant date.
An expense of 1.4 million was recognised in 2017 2016: 3.3 million.
This expense is included in the income statement within Listing Share Awards.

Taxation Accounting Current income tax policy Our current income tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years.
It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Where we have tax losses that can be relieved only by carry-forward against taxable profits of future periods, a deductible temporary difference arises.
Those losses carried forward are set off against deferred tax liabilities carried in the balance sheet.
Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the date of the balance sheet and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
The principal differences arise from trading losses, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and relief on research and development expenditure.
We recognise a deferred tax asset to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used and deferred tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised or the deferred tax liability settled.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and where the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle on a net basis.
Income tax expense credit The components of income tax expense credit for the year are: 2017 2016 000 000 Current tax: Current income tax 958 177 Adjustment in respect of prior years 38 Total current tax expense 920 177 Deferred tax: Origination and reversal of temporary differences 5,210 584 Effect of changes in tax rates 2,974 280 Adjustment in respect of prior years 1,218 926 Total deferred tax expense credit 6,966 622 Total tax expense credit 7,886 445 99 Financial statements Governance Strategic report ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 METRO BANK PLC NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 8.
Taxation continued Reconciliation of the total tax expense credit The tax expense credit shown in the income statement differs from the tax expense credit that would apply if all accounting profits had been taxed at the UK corporation tax rate.
A reconciliation between the tax expense credit and the accounting profit loss multiplied by the UK corporation tax rate for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016 is as follows: 2017 Effective tax rate 2016 Effective tax rate Group 000 % 000 % Accounting profit loss before tax 18,675 17,198 Tax expense at statutory income tax rate of 19.25% 2016: 20% 3,595 19.25% 3,440 20% Tax effects of: Non-deductible expenses listing fees 0% 368 2.1% Non-deductible expenses depreciation on non-qualifying fixedassets 2,628 14.1% 2,261 13.1% Non-deductible expenses other 537 2.9% 863 5.0% Share based payments 630 3.4% 271 1.5% Adjustment in respect of prior years 1,218 6.5% 54 0.3% Effect of changes in tax rates 2,974 15.9% 280 1.6% Income tax expense credit reported in the consolidated income statement 7,886 42.2% 445 2.6% Adjustment in respect of prior years During the years to 31 December 2017 and 2016 we submitted an amendment to prior year corporate tax returns years ended 2016 and 2015 that resulted in an increase in prior period losses.
The amendments in 2017 related mainly to the reclassification of some store costs from non-qualifying to qualifying expenditure.
The amendments in 2016 related mainly to prior year accounting adjustments to reflect actual VAT recovery following the Banks agreement of a partial exemption special method PESM with HMRC.
In addition, 2017 and 2016 include prior year adjustments to share based payments where the current and deferred tax treatment has been subsequently revised.
Effect of changes in tax rates Legislation restricting the amount of profit that may be offset by brought forward losses to 50% was substantively enacted on 31 October 2017 and was effective from 1 April 2017.
As a result, the relevant deferred tax balances have been remeasured using the effective tax rate that will apply.
The impact of the change in tax rate has been recognised in tax expense.
Banks are also subject to a lower threshold of 25% of profits that can be utilised against losses accrued by 1 April 2015.
However, this loss restriction relief does not apply to the first five years of banking activity so this particular restriction will not impact us.
Effective tax rate The effective tax rate for the year is 42.2% 2016: 2.6% due to the impact of the loss restriction relief on the net deferred tax asset.
The effective tax rate on profits, excluding the impact of the loss restriction relief, is 26.3%.
100 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 METRO BANK PLC 8.
Taxation continued Deferred tax A deferred tax asset must be regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not there will be suitable tax profits from which the future of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Further information on the details of the judgements taken around deferred tax are discussed in note 1.
Loans and advances to customers and banks Accounting Loans and advances made to our customers and banks are initially recognised at fair value which is the cash policy consideration to originate the loan including any transaction costs and measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which is detailed further in note 2.
Interest on loans is included in the income statement and is reported as Interest income.
Credit impairment losses are reported as a deduction from the carrying value of the loan and recognised in the income statement as Credit impairment charges.

For the purposes of the disclosures in the loan asset credit quality section below: A loan is considered past due when the borrower has failed to make a payment when due under the terms of the loan contract.
The impairment allowance includes allowances against financial assets that have been individually impaired and those subject to collective impairment.
Loans neither past due nor impaired and loans that are past due but not impaired consist predominantly of corporate and retail loans that are performing and whilst not individually impaired, may be subject to a collective impairment allowance.
Impaired loans that are individually assessed consist predominantly of corporate loans that are past due and for which an individual allowance has been raised.
Portfolio impaired loans, which are not included in the categories above, are a subset of collectively impaired loans and consist predominantly of retail loans that are 90 days or more past due.

Investment securities Accounting Settlement date accounting is used when recording financial asset transactions where a trade is settled through the policy regular settlement cycle for that particular investment.
Financial assets that are transferred to a third party but do not qualify for derecognition are presented in the balance sheet as Assets pledged as collateral, if the transferee has the right to sell or repledge them.
Held to maturity investment securities Held to maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
A sale or reclassification of more than an insignificant amount of held to maturity investments would result in the reclassification of all held to maturity investments as available-for-sale and would prevent us from classifying investment securities as held to maturity for the current and the two following financial years.
Available-for-sale investment securities Available-for-sale investment securities are initially recognised at fair value, which is the cash consideration including any transaction costs, and measured subsequently at fair value with gains and losses being recognised in other comprehensive income, except for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses, until the investment security is derecognised.
If an available-for-sale investment security is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the statement of comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement.
Interest is calculated using the effective interest method, and foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets classified as available-for-sale are recognised in the income statement.
Reclassification of investment securities We may choose to reclassify investment securities that are classified in the available-for-sale category to the held to maturity category if we have the intention and ability to hold these financial assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity at the date of reclassification.
Reclassifications are made at fair value as of the reclassification date.
This fair value becomes the new cost or amortised cost as applicable.
Effective interest rates for financial assets reclassified to loans and receivables and held to maturity categories are determined at the reclassification date.

The two levels of the fair value hierarchy relevant to the Group and Company are defined below.
Quoted market prices Level 1 Investment securities are classified as Level 1 if their value is observable in an active market.
Such instruments are valued by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Valuation technique using observable inputs Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either directly as prices or indirectly derived from prices.
Reclassifications between categories On 17 February 2017 33.2 million, 18 April 2017 60.4 million, 21 November 2017 95.0 million, 19 December 2017 87.8 million and on 22 December 2017 46.1 million of financial assets classified as available-for-sale were reclassified as held to maturity.

policy We depreciated property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis to its residual value using the following useful economic lives: Leasehold improvements Lower of the remaining life of the lease or the useful life of the asset Freehold land Not depreciated Buildings Up to 50 years Fixtures and fittings and equipment 5 years IT hardware 3 to 5 years We keep depreciation rates, methods and the residual values underlying the calculation of depreciation of items of property, plant and equipment under review to take account of any change in circumstances.
Investment property consists of shops and offices which are located within the same buildings as some of our stores, where we have acquired the freehold interest.
Investment property is held to earn rental income and for capital appreciation.
Investment property is also stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment.
Depreciation is calculated on a consistent basis with that applied to land and buildings as disclosed in the table above.
All items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually for impairment.
All investment property has been recognised within the last 12 months and, as such, there is not deemed to be a material difference between the carrying value of 10.8 million shown above and its fair value.
Relevant disclosures for the Company have not been included, as these are not materially different to the Group disclosure above.
Intangible assets Accounting Goodwill policy Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over our interest in net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash-generating units CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Goodwill is not amortised, however it is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell, and the present value of its expected future cash flows.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is charged to the income statement.
Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
Other intangible assets Software includes both purchased items and internally developed systems, which consists principally of identifiable and directly associated internal staff and other costs.
Purchased intangible assets and costs directly associated with the development of systems are capitalised as intangible assets where there is an identifiable asset which we control and which will generate future economic benefits in accordance with IAS 38.
Costs to establish feasibility or to maintain existing performance are recognised as an expense.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis in profit or loss using the following useful economic lives: Core banking software used for recording banking transactions 20 years Other banking software 3 to 10 years Software licences Licence period Customer contracts 10 years All intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment.

For the purposes of impairment testing the goodwill is allocated to the appropriate CGU: of the total balance of 4.1 million 2016: 4.1 million, 100% has been allocated to SME Invoice Finance Limited.
The recoverable amount of SME Invoice Finance Limited has been based on a value-in-use calculation using pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management covering a seven-year period and a discount rate of 10.7%.
The long-term growth rate is consistent with external sources of information reviewed by management.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of SME Invoice Finance Limited to fall below the balance sheet carrying value.
Seven years was used as the basis for discounted cash flow calculation to align with the 2017-2023 plan, prepared by management and approved by the Board, and used in decision-making.
The plan is reviewed and updated annually.

Called-up share capital Accounting When we issue new shares, incremental directly attributable costs are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
policy We only have a single class of shares.
As at 31 December 2017 we had 88.5 million ordinary shares of 0.0001p 31 December 2016: 80.3 million authorised and in issue.
In July 2017, we issued 8.02 million ordinary shares of 0.0001p each, for consideration of 278 million.
Related transaction costs of 2.9 million have been deducted from equity during the year.
Additionally, during the year we issued 0.2 million ordinary shares which relate to the exercise of previously awarded share options.
These options contributed 892,000 to share premium.

Share options Accounting The grant date fair value of options awarded to colleagues is recognised as an expense over the period in which the policy colleagues become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The expense representing the value of the services received by us is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options granted on the date of the grant.
The cost of the colleague services received in respect of the share options granted is recognised in the consolidated income statement over the period that the services are received, which is the vesting period.
Graded vesting is applied where relevant.
The fair value of colleague share option plans is calculated at the grant date using a Black-Scholes model.
The resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting period.
The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting.
We offer options to Directors and colleagues.
The exercise price of the granted options is equal to the estimated market price determined at the date of the grant.
Options generally vest in equal tranches over five years and have a contractual option term of ten years, with the only vesting condition being the continuing service of the colleague.
Options acquired via exchange of some or all of the cash element of a colleagues variable reward vest immediately.
All our options are equity settled and we have no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase the shares or settle the options in cash.

Financial commitments At 31 December 2017, we had irrevocable undrawn loan facilities granted to retail and commercial customers of 687.5 million 2016: 382.2 million.
In addition, as part of our retail and commercial operations, we had commitments of 138.3 million 2016: 156.2 million in respect of credit card and overdraft facilities.
These commitments represent agreements to lend in the future, subject to certain conditions.
Such commitments are cancellable, subject to notice requirements, and given their nature are not expected to be drawn down to the full level of exposure.
Leases All of our leases are operating leases.
The total payments made under our operating leases are charged to other Accounting policy operating expenses in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
When an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment we are required to make to the lessor by way of penalty is recognised as an expense in the period in which termination takes place.
Commitments under leases We lease various offices and stores under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements.
The total operating lease expenditure recognised in the statement of comprehensive income during the year was 19.6 million 2016: 17.1 million.
The leases have various terms, escalation, renewal and rights.
At the balance sheet date, future minimum payments under operating leases relating to land and buildings were as follows: 31 December 31 December 2017 2016 Group 000 000 Due Within one year 20,060 17,534 Due in one to five years 80,636 71,954 Due in more than five years 318,582 290,574 Total 419,278 380,062 Future income due under non-cancellable operating leases We lease out surplus space in some of our properties.

Financial instruments Accounting Sale and repurchase agreements policy Securities sold subject to repurchase agreements repos are reclassified in the financial statements as pledged assets when the transferee has the right, by contract or custom, to sell or repledge the collateral: the counterparty liability is included in deposits from banks.
The difference between sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and accrued over the life of the agreements using the effective interest method.
Securities lent to counterparties are also retained in the financial statements.
Financial liabilities Our holdings in financial liabilities are held at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are deposits from banks or customers and repurchase agreements.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when extinguished.
Derecognition Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from these assets have ceased to exist or the assets have been transferred and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets are also transferred.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when they have been redeemed or otherwise extinguished.
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised and the sum of: i the consideration received including any new assets obtained less any new liability assumed : and ii any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income, is recognised in profit or loss.
Any interest in transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained is recognised as a separate asset or liability.
Collateral furnished under standard repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions is not derecognised because we retain substantively all the risks and rewards on the basis of the predetermined repurchase price, and the criteria for derecognition are therefore not met.
Our financial instruments primarily comprise customer deposits, loans to customers, cash held at banks and investment securities.
All of these arise as a result of our normal operations.
We do not enter into transactions for speculative purposes and there are no instruments held for trading.
From time to time, we may use interest rate derivatives such as swaps to manage part of our interest rate risk.
The main financial risks arising from the our financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and market risks price and interest raterisk.
114 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 METRO BANK PLC 22. Credit risk Accounting Assets carried at amortised cost policy We assess at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired.
The impairment relating to loans and advances is calculated and assigned in accordance with the accounting standards for individual and collective impairment: Impairment of individual loans is designed to recognise specific risks identified following the occurrence of a loss event: for example, a commercial customer whose business has gone into administration.
If loans are considered to be at risk, an individual assessment will be performed.
For loans that are not considered to be individually impaired whether individually significant or not, a collective impairment assessment is performed.
Collective provisions are intended to reflect the estimated amount of losses incurred on a collective basis, but which have yet to be individually identified.
The lending exposure subject to collective impairment is assessed for each group of loans with similar credit risk characteristics.
Collective impairment models are based on analysis of historical arrears data and estimated loss rates, in order to derive the expected loss net of the recoverable value.
For the purposes of a collective evaluation of impairment, financial assets are grouped on the basis of the product risk profile: residential mortgage lending, commercial lending and consumer lending.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
When a loan is uncollectable, it is written off against the related allowance for loan impairment.
Such loans are written off after all the necessary procedures have been completed and the amount of the loss has been determined.
The maximum time a loan can remain in past due without being written off is 24 months.
Impairment charges relating to loans and advances to banks and customers are classified in credit impairment charges while impairment charges relating to investment securities held to maturity are classified in Net gains losses on investment securities.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance account.
The amount of the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Assets classified as available-for-sale We assess at each date of the balance sheet whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
Impairment losses on available-for-sale assets are recognised by reclassifying the losses accumulated in the fair value reserve in equity to profit or loss.
The cumulative loss that is reclassified from equity to profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost, net of any principal repayment and amortisation, and the current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in profit or loss.
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to us if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from our loans and advances to customers and other banks, and investment debt securities.
The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for managing our credit risks through the following: Defining the enterprise risk management structure and quantifying our risk appetite.
Formulating credit policies covering collateral requirements, credit assessment, risk grading and reporting, documentary and legal procedures and compliance with regulatory and statutory requirements.
Establishing the authorisation structure for the approval and renewal of credit facilities.
Limiting concentrations of exposure to counterparties and industries for loans and advances and similar exposures and by issuer, credit rating bands and market liquidity for investment securities.

Residential mortgage lending The table below stratifies credit exposures from mortgage loans and advances to customers by ranges of debt-to-value DTV ratio.
The increase in concentration for the DTV ratio 80% is due to both the launch of our 90% loan-to-value mortgage product within the year and the acquisition of a portfolio of UK mortgages on 2 June 2017.
The portfolio was originated over 10 years ago, has been stressed at significantly higher rates and has a good payment performance.
However, collateral provides additional security and we generally request that corporate borrowers provide it.
We usually take collateral in the form of a first charge over real estate retail and commercial, floating charges over all corporate assets and other liens and guarantees.

Our Board of Directors set our risk appetite and policy for managing liquidity risk and delegates responsibility for oversight of the implementation of this policy to the Asset and Liability Management Committee ALCO.
Our Treasury function manages the liquidity position on a day-to-day basis under the oversight of the CFO, CRO and ALCO.
Our approach is to ensure that we can meet payments as they fall due both in normal conditions and in the event of a severe liquidity stress, and that we can survive a severe liquidity stress event and continue as a going concern.
The key elements of our liquidity strategy are as follows: building a franchise that has a stable deposit funding base, free of short-term unsecured wholesale funding: maintaining, at all times, a stock of liquid assets that are of sufficient quality and quantity so as to be able to withstand liquidity stress scenarios: monitoring liquidity risk exposures on an ongoing basis under a variety of market-wide and idiosyncratic liquidity stress scenarios: and maintaining a diversified funding base.
Expected maturity dates of our financial instruments do not differ significantly from the contract dates except for retail deposits.
These are repayable on demand or at short notice on a contractual basis.
In practice, however, these instruments provide long-term stable funding for our operations and liquidity needs because of the stable deposit nature of our business model.
While we have drawn down 3,321 million of borrowings from the Bank of Englands Term Funding Scheme TFS, our business model is primarily that of a deposit-led bank with more deposits than loans.
Given our deposit-led business model, we do not consider that the closure of the TFS drawdown window in 2018 will adversely affect us from the perspective of obtaining funding in the near term, nor refinancing TFS drawings in the long term.
We fund our lending growth and plan to refinance our TFS drawings through deposit growth.
The tables below set out the maturity structure of our financial instruments, which categorises liabilities by their earliest possible contractual maturity date: this differs from the behavioural maturity characteristics of the deposit base in both normal and stressed conditions, as the behavioural maturity is much longer than the contractual maturity.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates will affect our income or the value of our holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of our market risk management strategy is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters to ensure solvency while optimising the return on risk.
Interest rate risk We manage this risk within a risk appetite framework that is set and approved by the Board.
Limits are set for the economic value of equity EVE and net interest income NII.
EVE shall not drop more than 20 million based on the worse of a 200bp or -200bp instantaneous symmetrical parallel shock to interest rates, and one-year NII shall not drop more than 15 million based on the same shock.
The EVE limits are monitored daily by risk, whilst NII limits are monitored weekly.
Performance against limits are reported monthly to the ALCO with exceptions communicated by email and more regularly to senior management, as well as being noted by the Risk Oversight Committee and the Board.
Furthermore, a 15 million limit is set for a set of asymmetrical movements between LIBOR and the Bank of England Base Rate.
Our Treasury Risk function runs a series of other interest rate risk simulations on a monthly basis to ensure that the ALCO is kept apprised of any other risks not captured by the policy measures.
While we occasionally enter into hedging arrangements the impact of these arrangements is immaterial.
The tables below set out the interest rate risk repricing gaps of our balance sheet in the specified time buckets, indicating how much of each type of asset and liability reprices in the indicated periods.
Market risk continued A positive interest rate sensitivity gap exists when more assets than liabilities reprice during a given period.
A positive gap position tends to benefit net interest income in an environment where interest rates are rising: however, the actual effect will depend on a number of factors including actual repayment dates and interest rate sensitivities within the banding periods.
The converse is true for a negative interest rate sensitivity gap.
The below shows the sensitivity of projected net interest income to a 2.00% and -2.00% parallel interest rate shock for a one-year forecasting period.

Fair value of financial instruments Accounting Amortised cost measurement and determination of fair value policy The amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition, minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between the initial amount recognised and the maturity amount, minus any reduction for impairment.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which we have access at that date.
The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.
For financial instruments traded in active markets, we determine the fair value based on quoted market prices or dealer price quotations.
This includes quoted debt instruments on major exchanges and broker quotes.
A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker or pricing service and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
If the above criteria are not met, the market is regarded as being inactive.
Indications that a market is inactive are when there is a wide bid-offer spread or significant increase in the bid-offer spread or there are few recent transactions.
The fair values of financial instruments are based on market prices where available, or are estimated using other valuation techniques.
Where they are short term in nature or re-price frequently, fair value approximates to carrying value.
Apart from investment securities all other assets and liabilities are deemed to have a fair value hierarchy of level 3.
Level 3 is defined as: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
This level includes equity investments and debt instruments with significant unobservable components.

Information on how fair values are calculated for the financial assets and liabilities noted above are explained below: a Cash and balances with the Bank of England loans and advances to banks Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date.
Fair values approximate carrying amounts as their balances are generally short-dated.
b Loans and advances to customers Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date, adjusted for future credit losses and prepayments, if considered material.
c Investment securities The fair value of investment securities is based on either observed market prices for those securities that have an active trading market fair value Level 1 assets, or using observable inputs in the case of fair value Level 2 assets.
d Deposits from customers Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flows, applying current rates offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
The fair value of a deposit repayable on demand is approximated by its carrying value.
e Deposits from central banks repurchase agreements Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flows, applying current rates.

InterArch, a firm which is owned by Shirley Hill, the wife of Vernon W. Hill, II, the Non-Executive Chairman.
In order to ensure that the terms of the InterArch arrangements are consistent with those that could be obtained from an independent third party, and in accordance with the Articles, the contractual arrangements with InterArch are subject to periodic review by our Audit Committee using benchmarking reviews conducted by independent third parties.
The Audit Committee has concluded that contracts for services with InterArch are at arms length and are at least as beneficial as those which could be obtained in the market from an alternative supplier.
Architectural design services InterArch provide various architectural design services, including pre-design, architectural design, interior design, facilities coordination, construction management, landscape architectural, signage, security design and layout and procurement services.
The fee structure for each project is based on a fixed percentage of projected hard costs.
Certain additional services are provided on an hourly basis.
The contract for architectural design services has recently been renegotiated and the Audit Committee has taken steps to ensure that it continues to be at arms length as part of the renegotiation process.
Branding, marketing and advertising InterArch also provide branding, marketing and advertising services.
The agreement terminated on 31 December 2017 and a new agreement was signed in January 2018 covering the period up to 31 December 2018.
Capital management Capital is held to protect our depositors, cover our inherent risks, provide a cushion for stress events and to support our business strategy.
In assessing the adequacy of our capital resources, we consider our risk appetite, the material risks to which we are exposed and the appropriate strategies required to manage those risks.
We prepare an annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process document that sets out how we identify and manage the keyrisks to which we are exposed and details our capital requirements, capital resources and capital adequacy over the planningperiod.
We produce regular reports on the current and forecasted level of capital, as well as the results of stress scenarios, to the Board and the Executive Leadership Team chaired by the Chief Executive Officer.
The key assumptions and risk drivers used to create the stress tests are regularly monitored and reported.
We manage capital in accordance with prudential rules issued by the PRA and FCA, in line with the EU Capital Requirements Directive.
In June 2013 the European Parliament approved new capital reforms referred to as CRD IV, which implements Basel III in Europe.
CRD IV legislation has been effective from 1 January 2014.
We are committed to maintaining a strong capital base under both existing and future regulatory requirements.
During the year we complied with all externally imposed capital requirements to which we are subject.

Earnings per share Basic earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing the earnings loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of Metro Bank by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.

Potential ordinary shares are treated as dilutive when their conversion to ordinary shares results in a reduction in earnings per share.
As Metro Bank had a loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of Metro Bank in 2016, for this year the share options would be anti-dilutive as they would reduce the loss per share.
Therefore, they are disregarded in the calculation of dilutive earnings per share.
At 31 December 2017 all outstanding share options were considered dilutive.
Further details of our share options can be found in note 17.

IFRS 9 transitional disclosures Adoption of IFRS 9 In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9, Financial Instruments.
IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
It replaces IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
We have adopted IFRS 9 with a date of transition of 1 January 2018.
This resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts previously recognised in the financial statements.
In accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 9, comparative figures have not been restated.
IFRS 9 sets out new accounting requirements in respect of: classification and measurement of financial instruments, credit impairment and hedge accounting.
Based on assessments undertaken to date, the total estimated adjustment net of tax of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the opening balance of the Groups equity at 1 January 2018 is c. 12.1 million, representing: A decrease of c. 22.7 million relating to impairment requirements An increase of c. 6.8 million relating to classification and measurement requirements An increase of c. 3.8 million relating to deferred tax impacts.
The above assessment is preliminary and our transition work will be finalised during 2018.
The actual impact of adopting IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018 may change as we refine and finalise our expected credit loss ECL and related deferred tax calculations.
Classification and measurement of financial instruments Financial assets IFRS 9 defines three new measurement categories: Measured at amortised cost Measured at fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI Measured at fair value through profit or loss FVPL IFRS 9 applies one classification approach for all types of financial assets, including customer lending and treasury assets.
Two criteria are used to determine how financial assets should be classified and measured: a Business model: how an entity manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows by collecting contractual cash flows, selling financial assets or both.
Factors considered in determining the business model for a group of assets include, for example, past experience on how the cash flows for these assets were collected, how their performance is assessed and how their managers have compensated: and b SPPI test: whether contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement: that is whether cash flows solely comprise payments of principal and interest SPPI.
If assets pass the SPPI test, and are within a business model that holds to collect contractual cash flows, they are measured at amortised cost.
If assets pass the SPPI test, and are within a business model that holds to collect contractual cash flows and for sale, they are measured at FVOCI.
If an asset does not meet the criteria for amortised cost of FVOCI, it is measured at FVPL.
Under IFRS 9, assets will only move between categories if there is a significant change to the business model within which they are held: this is expected to be infrequent.
Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are classified and subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for those designated at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished, i. e. when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Impairment Under IFRS 9, we assess on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ECL associated with the assets carried at amortised cost and FVOCI and recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date.
Impairment provisions are driven by changes in credit risk of loans and securities, with a provision for lifetime expected credit losses recognised where the risk of default of an instrument has increased significantly.
Risk of default and expected credit losses must incorporate forward looking and macroeconomic information.
Loans and advances Sophisticated impairment models have been developed for our retail and commercial loan portfolios, with three core models: revolving products: fixed term loans: and mortgages.
Expected credit losses must be calculated for drawn loans, and for committed lending.

IFRS 9 transitional disclosures continued In general terms, the ECL for a loan is calculated using the following formula: ECL Probability of default x Loss given default x Exposure at default Key model inputs and judgements include: Consideration of when a significant increase in credit risk occurs Probability of default, loss given default, and exposure at default Macro economic scenarios to be applied IFRS 9 requires a higher level of expected credit loss to be recognised for underperforming loans.
This is considered based on a staging approach: Stage Description ECL recognised Stage 1 performing loans Financial instruments that have had no 12-month expected credit losses significant increase in credit risk since Losses expected on defaults which may initial recognition or that have low credit occur within the next 12 months.

For example: a newly originated loan on which repayments are being received and there are no other indicators of a significant increase in credit risk.
Stage 2 underperforming loans Financial instruments that have had a Lifetime expected credit losses significant increase in credit risk since Losses expected on defaults which may initial recognition but that do not have occur at any point in a loans lifetime.
Losses are adjusted for probabilityFor example: a loan on which payment weighted macro-economic scenarios.

For example: a loan on which payment Losses are adjusted for probabilityweighted macro-economic scenarios.

carrying amount of the loan net of credit allowance.
A significant increase in credit risk may be identified in a number of ways: Qualitative criteria for example, the borrower is included on the early warning list, or there are clear signs that the customer is unwilling to pay.
Quantitative criteria for example, where payments are at least 30 days overdue, or the numerically calculated probability of default on a loan has increased significantly since initial recognition, for example due to a movement in the customers credit score.
This is assessed using detailed models.
A loan will be considered to be non-performing when it meets the Groups definition of default e. g. the loan is 90 days past due, or the borrower is considered unlikely to pay.
Probability of default The probability of default represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation either over the next 12 months for Stage 1 accounts, or over the remaining lifetime of the loan for Stage 2 and 3 accounts.
A probability of default is calculated for all loans based on historic data and incorporates, but is not limited to: Credit quality scores Lifecycle trends depending on a loans vintage Factors indicating the quality of the vintage Characteristics of the current and future economic environment The probability of default is adjusted for the weighted average outcome of three macro-economic scenarios: baseline, upside anddownside.

IFRS 9 transitional disclosures continued Loss given default The loss given default LGD represents our expectation of the extent of a loss on a defaulted exposure, and is expressed as a percentage considering expected recoveries on defaulted accounts.
We apply two LGD rates one for unsecured lending and one for secured lending.
LGD rates have been modelled considering a range of inputs, including: value of collateral on secured portfolios a key driver of the expected recovery in the event of default Expected haircut applied to the collateral value to reflect a forced sale discount Expected exposure on a loan at the point of default models consider a number of factors including the pay down rates on loans Price index forecasts applied to project collateral values into the future Stress factors based on macro-economic scenarios Exposure at default This is the amount the we expect to be owed at the point of default.
This is subject to judgement since a balance will not necessarily remain static between the balance sheet date and the point of expected default.
For example: Interest should be accrued Repayments may be received on mortgages For a revolving product, further drawings may be taken between the current point in time and the point of default Investment securities and other financial assets Impairment provisions have been calculated based on our best estimate of expected credit losses on other assets classified and measured at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income.
These include investment securities, cash held at banks and other financial assets.
Impairment provisions are not material.
Hedge accounting The new requirements under IFRS 9 align hedge accounting more closely with risk management.
The revised standard also establishes a more principles-based approach to hedge accounting.
IFRS 9 includes an accounting policy choice to remain with IAS 39 hedge accounting.
Hedge accounting is not currently material for us and we have elected to continue applying the requirements of IAS 39.
IFRS 9 governance Responsibility for initial approval of all impairment models has been assigned to a Model Governance Committee.
The Credit Risk, Policy and Appetite Committee is responsible for review of credit impairment models, including model design and outcomes.
The Audit Committee is responsible for review and approval of accounting policy.
Impact on adoption The measurement category and the carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2017 in accordance with IAS 39 and IFRS 9 are compared as follows.

IFRS 9 transitional disclosures continued We have applied the classification requirements in IFRS 9 after performing a detailed analysis of its business models for managing financial assets.
The Group has considered whether financial assets are held for the collection of principal and interest payments, or whether cash flows are expected to be collected from their sale, as well as how the performance of such financial assets is assessed.
The application of the new classification requirements of IFRS 9 led to changes in the classification of certain investment securities held by the Bank.
332 million fixed rate securities classified as held to maturity under IAS 39 have been classified as FVOCI under IFRS 9.
Going forward, this pool of assets will be held to collect cash flows and to sell if required in order to effectively manage our interest rate risk, therefore it has been classified as FVOCI.
Had IAS 39 remained in force, we would have maintained our intention and ability to hold these assets to maturity, and we would have sought other methods to manage our interest rate risk.
Reconciliation of balance sheet balances from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 The following table reconciles the carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities, from their previous measurement category in accordance with IAS 39 to their new measurement categories upon transition to IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018.

IFRS 9 transitional disclosures continued Reconciliation of impairment allowance balance from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 The following table reconciles the previous impairment allowance measured in accordance with the IAS 39 incurred loss model and the new impairment allowance measured in accordance with the IFRS 9 expected loss model at 1 January 2018: Loan loss allowance under Loan loss IAS 39 Provision allowance under Measurement category IAS 39 IFRS 9 under IAS 37 Reclassification Remeasurement IFRS 9 Loans and receivables Financial assets at amortised cost 14,361 22,399 36,760 Available-for-sale financial instruments Financial assets at FVOCI 257 257 Total 14,361 22,656 37,017 The increase in loss allowance estimated under IFRS 9 when compared to that measured under IAS 39 is primarily due to earlier recognition of credit losses under the new expected loss model.
The most significant impact has been observed in relation to our unsecured lending portfolios, a number of which are no longer being originated.
We continue to refine, monitor and validate certain elements of the impairment models underpinning the estimates provided above.
We expect some additional volatility in impairment charges under IFRS 9 when compared to the current IAS 39 impairment model due to the forward looking nature of expected credit losses.
The European Banking Authority has amended the Capital Requirements Regulation to establish IFRS 9 related transitional arrangements.
On adoption of IFRS 9, movements in the opening impairment provision will be posted as an adjustment to reserves, and therefore to capital.
The transitional arrangement enables firms to add back a portion of this capital adjustment in early years, thereby reducing the initial impact on capital.
Add-back adjustments are also allowable for movements in provisions in subsequent years.
Metro Bank has elected to adopt the transitional arrangements.
Post balance sheet events On 23 February 2018, we announced the intention to purchase a portfolio of residential mortgages for 523 million.
The purchase is expected to complete in March 2018.
