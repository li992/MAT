Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Accounting policies ZPG Plc is a company domiciled and incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The address of the registered office is The Cooperage, 5 Copper Row, London SE1 2LH.
1.1 Basis of preparation The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are set out below for the years ended 30 September 2017 and 30 September 2016.
The policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
The consolidated statement of cash flows has been represented in the prior year to move transaction costs on acquisitions of 1.3 million to operating cash flows.
The impact was to reduce net cash flows from operating activities by 1.3 million to 60.9 million and to reduce the net cash flows used in investing activities to 93.8 million.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards and IFRIC Interpretations collectively IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the European Union adopted IFRS.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in compliance with adopted IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires Management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
Note 1.20 and 1.21 give further details relating to the Groups critical accounting estimates and judgements.
The presentational currency of the financial statements is Pound Sterling.
Amounts included in the consolidated financial statements are shown in round thousands unless otherwise indicated.
At the date of approval, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these consolidated financial statements were in issue but are only effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2017: Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative effective 1 January 2017 Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses effective 1 January 2017 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective 1 January 2018 Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payments effective 1 January 2018 IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advanced Consideration effective 1 January 2018 Amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance contracts effective 1 January 2018 Amendments to IAS 40 Investment Properties effective 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases effective 1 January 2019 IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts effective 1 January 2021 Not yet endorsed for use in the EU.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is effective for the first time for the financial year commencing 1 October 2018.
The implementation of IFRS 9 will require the reclassification of the Groups Available for sale financial assets.
From 1 October 2018 these assets will be measured as Fair value through other comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 9.
As this treatment mirrors the Groups current policy, there is not expected to be any material impact on the Groups reported results: however, Management notes that any gain or loss arising on the sale of these assets may no longer be able to be recognised in the Consolidated income statement but will remain within Other Comprehensive Income.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers is effective for the first time for the financial year commencing 1 October 2018.
An initial impact assessment was performed during 2017 by Management to identify potential implications for the business on its existing contracts and the recognition of revenue.
Management has identified a number of contract types which could result in a change in the profile of revenue recognition as currently drafted, including but not limited to: contracts for the provision of desktop software and contracts for advertising services.
Management also notes that the current recognition of sales commission across the Group will also change and will lead to these costs being spread over the expected life of the contract.
As the Group is still in the process of assessing the full impact of IFRS 15 it is not currently practicable to quantify the impact of this standard and therefore the standard could have a material impact on the future results of the Group, in particular revenue, adminstrative expenses and accrued and deferred revenue.
Management intend to provide an indication of the expected impact of IFRS 15 in the interim announcement for the period to 31 March 2018.
The impact of IFRS 16 Leases will require the Group to record its current property leases and fleet of motor vehicles on the statement of financial position.
The leases impacted are currently treated as operating expenses.
The change in recognition is expected to increase future depreciation charges and lead to a reduction in operating expenses.
Future commitments under current operating leases are outlined in Note 27 which gives some indication of the impact on the Group going forward, however, as IFRS 16 is effective for the first time for the financial year commencing 1 October 2019 a full assessment of the standard has not yet been made and therefore the standard could have a material impact on the future results of the Group.
All other standards identified above are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Accounting policies continued 1.2 Adoption of new and revised standards These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the policies set out in the Groups Annual Report for the year ended 30 September 2016.
No new or revised accounting standards were adopted in the period.
1.3 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of ZPG Plc the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries together the Group.
Control exists when the Group has existing rights to give it the ability to direct the relevant activities of an entity and has the ability to affect the returns the Group will receive as a result of its involvement with the entity.
The results of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date control commences until the date when control ceases.
Throughout the year the Group acquired a number of entities and their subsidiaries.
The results of each acquisition have been consolidated from the date of acquisition as set out in Note 13.
The consolidated results for 2017 are therefore not a like for like comparison for 2016.
Full details of the acquisitions are set out in Note 13.
Full details of acquisitions made in 2016 are set out in the Groups Annual Report 2016 and are summarised in Note 13.
The Company has one trading subsidiary that uses a functional currency which is different to the presentational currency of the Group.
Hometrack Australia Limiteds functional currency is the Australian Dollar as it is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Assets and liabilities for Hometrack Australia are translated into Pound Sterling using the exchange rate at the statement of financial position date and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income translated using the average exchange rate for the year.
Exchange differences on translation into the presentational currency are recognised within other comprehensive income.
The principal exchange rates for the Australian Dollar against Pound Sterling used in these consolidated financial statements are: average: 1.66, closing: 1.71.
1.4 Going concern The consolidated financial position shows a positive net asset position and the Group continues to generate net cash flows from operating activities and maintain its current dividend policy.
The Group also has access to a 325 million debt facility of which 269 million was drawn down at 30 September 2017.
The facility includes required covenant ratios of Net Debt: EBITDA and interest cover.
The Group are comfortably within these limits.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business and financial risks successfully.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the historical financial information.
1.5 Revenue Revenue represents amounts due for services provided during the period, net of value added tax.
The Group recognises revenue under two categories Property and Comparison.
Revenue from Property derives principally from subscription to the Groups property websites and from the provision of property software to UK domestic, overseas and commercial estate agents UK Agency revenue, home developers New Homes revenue and overseas and commercial estate agents along with the provision of property data to financial and other institutions Other property revenue.
Subscription revenue, including fees for listing on the Groups property websites or the ongoing provision of property data, is recognised over the period of the subscription.
Software revenue includes subscription to Software as a Service SaaS, desktop software licensing, support and installation fees.
Installation fees are recorded at fair value when the installation is complete.
Ongoing SaaS revenue, support and licensing fees are recognised over the service period.
Revenue from other property services is recognised in the month in which the service is provided.
The main sources of Comparison revenue are fees received for the comparison of gas and electricity services Energy revenue and mobile, broadband, pay TV and home phone services Communications revenue.
Revenue is recognised at the point at which a lead is generated to an energy or communications provider, based on the historical conversion of such leads into completed switches.
Revenue from other comparison services Other Comparison revenue is recognised in the month in which the service is provided.
1.6 Leases During 2016 the Group entered into a new 15 year lease agreement for its head office at The Cooperage, London.
During 2017 the Groups previous offices were sublet to a third party.
All of the Groups current lease and sub-lease arrangements are recognised as operating leases as the material risks and rewards incidental to ownership remain with the lessor.
Operating lease expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Rent-free periods, lease arrangement fees and other direct costs are amortised through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the term of the lease.
Operating lease income is recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease and is classified as other income.
Any rent-free or reduced rent periods are amortised through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the term of the lease.
110 ZPG Plc Annual Report 2017 Financial statements 1.
Accounting policies continued 1.7 Finance income and costs Finance income represents interest receivable on cash and deposit balances and gains recognised on foreign currency transactions.
Interest receivable is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest method.
Finance costs represent interest charges and certain fees charged on the Groups revolving credit facility as well as losses recognised on foreign currency transactions.
Finance costs are recognised as they accrue using the effective interest method.
Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised monthly based on the translation of assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies to Pound Sterling and realised gains and losses on transactions recorded in the period.
The Groups principal exposure is to the Australian dollar, through its Australian subsidiary, and the US Dollar, through agreements with of a number of suppliers based in the United States.
The Directors are comfortable that any sensitivity to fluctuations in exchange rates would not have a material impact on the results of the Group.
1.8 Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost.
This cost includes the purchase price, directly attributable costs and the estimated present value of any future unavoidable costs of dismantling and removing items.
The corresponding liability is recognised within provisions.
Items of property, plant and equipment are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and are not revalued.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful economic lives, using the straight-line method, as follows: Fixtures and fittings over 2 to 5 years Computer equipment over 2 to 5 years Leasehold improvements over the lease term Freehold property over 50 years The Directors review the residual values and useful economic lives of assets on an annual basis.
1.9 Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses is accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, net of cash acquired.
Acquisition related costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value with the exception of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes.
Identifiable net assets include the recognition of any separately identifiable intangible assets.
Further detail of the identifiable assets and liabilities recognised during the year on acquisitions are provided in Note 13.
Deferred and contingent consideration are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Where the amounts payable are classified as a financial liability any subsequent change in the fair value is charged credited to the Groups consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Amounts classified as equity are not subsequently remeasured.
Where consideration to Management shareholders is contingent on their continued employment the amount is recognised as a remuneration expense in the statement of comprehensive income over the deferral period when it coincides with the period of continued employment.
1.10 Goodwill Goodwill arising on a business combination represents the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and is recorded as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is not subsequently subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually and whenever the Directors have an indication that it may be impaired.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combination.
Any impairment in carrying value is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
1.11 Intangible assets Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are initially recorded at cost.
Intangibles arising on acquisition are recorded at fair value.
All intangibles are subsequently stated at initial value less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets as follows: Brand 510 years Domain names 5 years Database 310 years Customer relationships 510 years Website development and computer software 38 years www.
co. uk 111 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued 1.12 Impairment of tangible and intangible assets If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs is estimated.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount to the extent that this increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
1.13 Research and development The Group incurs expenditure on research and development in order to develop new products and enhance the existing websites.
Research expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs are expensed when incurred unless they meet certain criteria for capitalisation.
Development costs whereby research findings are applied to creating a substantially enhanced website or new product are only capitalised once the technical feasibility and the commercial viability of the project has been demonstrated and they can be reliably measured.
Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic life.
Once the new website enhancement or product is available for use, subsequent expenditure to maintain the website or product, or on small enhancements to the website or product, is recognised as an expense when it is incurred.
Research and Development tax credit claims made in the UK are recognised as a credit to administrative expenses in the financial year relevant to the claim.
Research and Development tax credits in Australia are recognised as a deduction to the tax expense.
1.14 Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Full details of financial instruments are included in Note 26.
Investments in unlisted securities not meeting the definition of associates, joint ventures or subsidiaries are classified as available for sale financial assets and are initially recorded at fair value plus transaction costs.
The investments are then remeasured at each subsequent reporting date to fair value.
Changes in the fair value of the unlisted securities are recognised in other comprehensive income, with the exception of impairment losses.
On disposal of the asset any gains and losses recorded within other comprehensive income are realised and are reclassified to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Trade and other receivables are designated as loans and receivables.
They are recognised at amortised cost, which is net of any allowance for impairment in relation to irrecoverable amounts.
This is deemed to be a reasonable approximation of their fair value.
The provision is reviewed regularly in conjunction with a detailed analysis of historical payment profiles and past default experience.
When a trade receivable is deemed uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account.
The Group receives interest income on certain amounts held in escrow.
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are designated as other financial liabilities.
They are recognised at their carrying amount, which is deemed to be a reasonable approximation of their fair value.
Loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost, net of direct costs.
Direct costs are released through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income under the effective interest method, along with interest charged, over the life of the instrument.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.
The Companys Ordinary Shares are classified as equity instruments and are recognised at the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs.
Repurchase of the Companys own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Companys own equity instruments.
Financial instruments are not used for speculative purposes.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents represent amounts held in the Groups current accounts and overnight deposits that are immediately available.
The information set out below provides information about how the Group determines fair values of various financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Details of the type of fair value input used is included within the relevant note.
112 ZPG Plc Annual Report 2017 Financial statements 1.
Accounting policies continued 1.15 Net Debt The Group defines Net Debt as loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, both as per the statement of financial position.
The Group does not currently hold any financial derivatives, have any leases recorded as finance leases or operate a defined benefit pension plan and therefore these costs are not currently considered.
These, and any other financing costs, will be considered as they become applicable to the results of the Group.
The calculation of net debt is presented in Note 21.
1.16 Current tax Current income tax comprises UK income tax and is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
Current tax is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it is required to be recognised directly in equity.
1.17 Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated statement of financial position differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit: and investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it is required to be recognised directly in equity.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax assets are recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle balances on a net basis.
1.18 Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, legal or constructive, as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are measured at Managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the statement of financial position date and are discounted to present value where the impact is material.
The unwinding of any discount is recognised in finance costs.
Dilapidation provisions are recognised based on Managements best estimate of costs to make good the Groups leasehold properties at the end of the lease term.
Onerous lease provisions relate to contracts whereby the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
Restructuring provisions are recognised when a full restructuring plan has been developed and communicated.
The restructuring provisions represent expected costs incurred of completing the restructure including redundancy costs.
1.19 Employee benefits: defined contribution benefit scheme The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme which is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a fund.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Contributions payable to the fund are charged to the statement of comprehensive income in the period to which they relate.
co. uk 113 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued 1.20 Share-based payments The Group provides equity-settled share-based incentive plans whereby ZPG Plc grants shares or nil-cost options over its shares to employees of its subsidiaries for their employment services.
The Group also issues warrants over shares in ZPG Plc to a number of the Groups estate agent partners, allowing them to acquire shares in exchange for making their property listings available for inclusion on the Groups property websites.
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and partners are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.
The fair value is measured using a suitable valuation model, including the Black-Scholes and Monte-Carlo valuation models where appropriate, and is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each statement of financial position date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest.
Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted.
The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to meet a market vesting condition.
Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-based payment transactions are set out in Note 24.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in fair value of the options, measured immediately before and after the modification, is charged to the income statement over the remaining vesting period.
Within the company accounts of ZPG Plc equity-settled share options granted directly to employees or estate agent partners of a subsidiary are treated as a capital contribution to the subsidiary.
The capital contribution is measured by reference to the fair value of the share-based payments charge for the period and is recognised as an increase in the cost of investment with a corresponding credit to equity.
A number of shares are held in trust in order to settle future exercises of the Groups share incentive schemes.
Details of the trusts are included in Note 24.
Shares held in trust are treated as a deduction from equity.
Employers National Insurance Contributions are accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8%.
The amount accrued is based on the market value of the shares at 30 September 2017 after deducting the exercise price of the share option.
1.21 Sources of estimation uncertainty Comparison revenue and accrued income Revenue generated by the Comparison division is recognised at the point at which a transaction or interaction on the Groups website is completed and a lead is generated.
A Management estimate is required in calculating a revenue accrual to estimate the number of successful switches based upon leads provided for each partner in the period between the last date of billing and the latest partner data being made available.
The accrued income is estimated by considering the volume of leads that have passed from the Groups website to the partner, the historical conversion of such leads into completed switches and contracted revenue per switch.
Recognition of acquired intangibles on acquisition During the period the Group completed its acquisition of Hometrack, ExpertAgent, TechnicWeb and Ravensworth.
The process of determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in each acquisition requires an estimation of future cash flows arising from acquired intangibles and there is a risk that inaccurate estimation could lead to the valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill being misstated.
The details of assets and liabilities recognised upon acquisition is set out in note 13.
The Group engaged third party valuation experts for Hometrack and ExpertAgent to mitigate the risk associated with the valuation of assets and liabilities upon acquisition: however, estimation uncertainty still exists in the preparation of forecasts that underpin the valuation models.
Intangibles recognised are subsequently amortised over their useful economic lives: as such, no future revaluation of the assets recognised will be made except for the purposes of impairment reviews.
Recognition of earn-out agreements In consideration for the acquisition of Hometrack an earn-out agreement was entered which is contingent upon the future performance of a ten-year licence agreement also entered into at the point of acquisition.
The earn-out is measured at fair value at the point of acquisition using discounted future cashflows under a range of weighted scenarios requiring an estimation of the future performance of the currently nascent licence agreement.
Deferred and contingent consideration on the acquisition of Hometrack was recognised at 13 million.
At each reporting period the earn-out will be measured at fair value with any revaluation being recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
The initial fair value recognised upon acquisition was assessed to represent fair value as at 30 September 2017.
Impairment of goodwill and intangibles The Group holds goodwill and intangibles on the statement of financial position in respect of business acquisitions made.
Acquired intangibles include acquired goodwill, brands, customer relationships, databases, websites and software of which 491.0 million has been recognised as at 30 September 2017 2016: 322.6 million.
The Group is required to review these assets annually for impairment.
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable value of the relevant cash-generating unit, which represents the higher of fair value and value in use.
The value in use calculation requires an estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit, discounted using a suitable discount rate to determine if any impairment has occurred.
The impairment review has concluded that the carrying value of the Groups intangible assets is supported by the value in use of the respective cash-generating units.
Details of the impairment analysis are included in Note 14.

Accounting policies continued 1.22 Key accounting judgements PropertyFinder Group barter transaction PropertyFinder Group is a Dubai-based business with leading property portals across the Middle East and North Africa.
During the period the propertyfinder.
com domain name was transferred in exchange for 1% of the issued share capital of PropertyFinder International Limited, the PropertyFinder Group parent entity.
A key accounting judgement was made in recognising the fair value of the acquired asset as required by IAS 38.
Property Finder International Limited is a private company registered in the British Virgin Islands and as such is required to make only limited public financial disclosure.
Determining the fair value of the investment is therefore subject to inherent uncertainty.
Management used various sources of publicly available information, including the audited value of an investment in PropertyFinder Group disclosed by a listed investment company to determine the fair value at acquisition.
The investment in PropertyFinder is held as an available for sale financial asset and therefore is subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting date.
As at 30 September 2017 the asset is valued at 1.7 million on the statement of financial position.
1.23 Alternative performance measures In the analysis of the Groups financial performance certain information disclosed in the consolidated financial statements may be prepared on a non-GAAP basis or has been derived from amounts calculated in accordance with IFRS but is not itself an expressly permitted GAAP measure.
These measures are reported in line with how financial information is analysed by Management.
When reviewing performance, the Directors use a combination of both statutory and adjusted performance measures.
The adjusted performance measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted basic EPS, provide additional information to help assess the underlying performance of the business as they strip out deal related costs and give a closer approximation to ZPGs cash flows.
The non-GAAP measures are designed to increase comparability of the Groups financial performance year on year.
However, these measures may not be comparable with non-GAAP measures adopted by other companies.
The key non-GAAP measures presented by the Group are: Adjusted EBITDA which is defined as operating profit after adding back depreciation and amortisation, share-based payments and exceptional items Note 3 : and Adjusted basic EPS which is defined as profit for the year, excluding exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions, adjusted for tax adjusted profit for the year and divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue for the year Note 11.
Both of these measures are used in determining the remuneration of the Executive Directors and Management and are used by the Companys external debt providers to assess performance against covenants and determine the interest charge.
2. Business segments The Board of Directors has been identified as the Groups chief operating decision maker.
The monthly reporting pack provided to the Board to enable assessment of the performance of the business has been used as the basis for determining the Groups operating segments.
Whilst the chief operating decision maker monitors the performance of the business at a revenue and Adjusted EBITDA level, depreciation and amortisation, share-based payments, exceptional items, finance income and costs and income tax are all monitored on a consolidated basis.
Assets and liabilities are also managed on a centralised basis and are not reported to the chief operating decision maker in a disaggregated format.
The chief operating decision maker monitors six individual revenue streams as set out below.
The six revenue streams are grouped under two headings: Property and Comparison.
Adjusted EBITDA is monitored on an aggregated basis under these two headings.
Revenue and costs shown under the Agency heading include trading for 10 months of TechnicWeb, seven months of ExpertAgent and one month of Ravensworth, being the results of each entity from the date of acquisition.
Other property revenue includes eight months trading of Hometrack.
The consolidated results for 2017 are therefore not a like for like comparative for 2016.
Property Agency revenue, which represents property advertising services and the provision of property software, websites and other marketing materials to estate agents and lettings agents: New Homes revenue, which represents property advertising services provided to new home developers: and Other property revenue, which predominantly represents the provision of property data to large financial institutions and other third parties as well as display advertising and other data services.
Comparison Energy revenue, which represents gas and electricity switching services: Communications revenue, which represents mobile, broadband, pay TV and home phone switching services: and Other Comparison revenue, which predominantly represents financial services switching, boiler cover, business energy and data insight services.
All material revenues in 2017 are generated in the UK and Australia UK: 240.1 million, Australia: 4.4 million.
In 2016 all material revenues were generated in the UK.

Adjusted EBITDA The performance measure Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information to help assess the underlying performance of the business as it strips out deal related costs and gives a closer approximation to ZPGs cash flows.
Adjusted EBITDA is used by Management to run the business, in determining the remuneration of the Executive Directors and Management and is used by the Companys external debt provider to assess performance against covenants and to determine the interest charge.
The Group defines Adjusted EBITDA as operating profit after adding back depreciation and amortisation, share-based payments and exceptional items.
Exceptional items include costs and income which Management believes to be exceptional in nature by virtue of their size or incidence.

They reflect Managements expectations of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash flows, based on past experience and future expectations of business performance.
Cash flows for ExpertAgent and Hometrack after the three year period are based on forecasts used for the recent fair value exercise at acquisition, tending down towards the perpetuity growth rate.
Cash flows for other CGUs, beyond the three year period have been extrapolated using a perpetuity growth rate.
A growth rate of 2% has been applied to extrapolate the cash flows into perpetuity.
Growth has been capped at 2% across all CGUs so as not to exceed the long-term expected growth rate of the industry and country the Group operates in, in accordance with IAS 36.
The pre-tax discount rate used for each CGU was in the range of 13.2% to 15.5%.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of each CGUs assets exceeds their carrying value, as such no impairment was identified.
Amending the analysis such that a growth rate into perpetuity of negative 1%, or a reasonable increase in discount rate, is applied across all CGUs whilst holding all other variables constant would not give rise to an impairment.
The Directors note that the three year forecast for the Property Software Group CGU includes revenue and margin growth resulting from new and recently launched products.
Failure to achieve the forecasted cash flows could indicate an impairment.
Headroom currently stands at 20.0 million for this CGU.
2020 cash flows would need to fall by 26% from current forecasts to eliminate this headroom.
Indicators of impairment for all CGUs, including Property Software Group, will continue to be assessed throughout the 2018 financial year.

Deferred and contingent consideration The Group recognised a total of 29.4 million in respect of deferred payments due on acquisitions made in the period, as set out below and detailed in Note 13.
A further 11.3 million was recognised through the income statement in relation to payments to continuing Management shareholders.
2.8 million was recognised in respect of uSwitch, 5.3 million of Hometrack, 3.0 million for Property Software Group and 0.2 million for TechnicWeb.
During the year the Group also settled 33.0 million due in respect of uSwitch, Property Software Group and Hometrack.

Of the 32.7 million recorded on the statement of cash flows, 9.7 million of deferred and contingent consideration settled during the year was conditional on the continued employment of Management 2016: 2.9 million.
There have been no changes to the expected outcome of ongoing contingent consideration requirements made during the period outside of the finalisation of the acquisition accounting for entities acquired in the year as set out in Note 13.
The fair value of deferred and contingent consideration is therefore considered equal to its carrying value.

The utilisation and release of onerous lease provisions in the period relates to the successful sub-lease of the Companys previous head office as mentioned above, which had previously been provided for.
The onerous lease provision recognised during the year and held at 30 September 2017 relates to Managements best estimate of the fair value of future lease payments falling due prior to the expiry of a legacy lease agreement on computer servers relating to one to the Groups acquired entities.
This onerous lease provision will be fully utilised in the 2018 financial year.
Restructuring provisions are recognised in respect of redundancy and other costs in relation to internal restructuring.

Financial instruments Carrying amount and fair value of financial assets and liabilities The Group has shareholdings and commercial arrangements with a number of other entities.
Where these holdings do not give the Group significant influence over the entity the holdings are classified as Available for sale financial assets.
Details for available for sale financial assets are included in Note 16.
The valuation of all available for sale financial assets are based on level 2 inputs.
The Group uses publicly available financial information to determine the fair value of its shareholding and any warrants held.
The fair value of these assets is equal to their carrying value.
All other financial assets, including cash and cash equivalents, are designated as Loans and receivables and are held at amortised cost.
All financial liabilities are classified as Other liabilities and are measured at amortised cost.
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the consolidated financial statements are approximate to their fair values.
Financial risk management The Group is exposed to the following risks from financial instruments: credit risk: market risk: and liquidity risk.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or bank counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of each period was equal to the carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the consolidated financial statements.
The exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual characteristics of each counterparty.
The potential for customer default varies between the Groups two divisions.
The customer base of the Property division is large, so there is no significant concentration of credit risk.
The Comparison division operates in a market with a small number of customers, which creates a concentration of debtor balances, and from time to time the amounts due from one or a number of suppliers may be material.
However, customers within this market are often large energy and telecommunications organisations with high credit ratings and access to significant funds.
The Groups largest customer contributed to 10% 2016: 18% of the Groups trade receivables balance.
The Group manages counterparty risk on its trade receivables through strict credit control quality measures and regular aged debt monitoring procedures.
The Group reserves the right to charge interest on overdue receivables, although it does not hold collateral over any trade receivable balances.
Overdue amounts are regularly reviewed and impairment provisions are created where necessary.
This provision is reviewed regularly in conjunction with a detailed analysis of ageing profile, historical payment profiles and past default experience.
The Group has long-standing relationships with its key customers and extremely low historical levels of customer credit defaults.

Financial instruments continued Credit risk continued The ageing of trade receivables at the Period end is as follows: 2017 2016 Gross Provision Gross Provision 000 000 000 000 030 days 12,926 4,634 3160 days 1,760 37 3,154 104 6190 days 805 519 721 151 91 days 419 354 767 125 Total 15,910 910 9,276 380 In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was granted up to the period end date.
Receivables written off during the year to 30 September 2017 was 415,000 2016: 470,000.
As at 30 September 2017 receivables of 1,447,000 were past due but not impaired 2016: 1,386,000.
The credit risk associated with bank and deposit balances is mitigated by the use of banks with good credit ratings.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange and interest rates will affect the income and financial management of the Group.
The Group is not exposed to any significant currency risk and there is a minimal interest rate risk on cash and bank balances.
However, the Group has borrowings subject to an interest rate calculated with reference to Libor.
Changes in interest rates therefore impact the financial results of the Group.
The Directors actively monitor interest rate risk and note that interest rates remain at a historical low.
The Directors believe that any reasonable increase in the Libor rate would not significantly impact the Group.
Therefore, the Group does not hedge its interest rate risk at this time.
At 30 September 2017 borrowings of 269 million were subject to floating interest rates 2016: 151.5 million.
At 30 September 2017 if Libor were to have increased by 1% throughout the year with all other variables held constant profit before tax would decrease by 2.0 million 2016: 1.2 million as a result of additional interest incurred.
Therefore, the Directors are comfortable that any sensitivity to fluctuations in interest or exchange rates would not have a material impact on the results of the Group.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk refers to the ability of the Group to meet the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled in cash as they fall due.
Management regularly reviews performance against budgets and forecasts to ensure sufficient cash funds are available to meet its contractual obligations.
The Groups activities are highly cash generative allowing it to effectively service working capital requirements.
At 30 September 2017 the Group held total cash and cash equivalents of 75.4 million 2016: 3.4 million and net debt of 191.5 million 2016: 146.3 million.
The Group has access to a 200.0 million revolving credit facility RCF, of which 144 million was drawn down at 30 September 2017.
The remaining 56 million undrawn facility allows the Group to secure additional external financing should it be required.
The total facility requires the Group to meet certain covenants based on the Groups interest cover and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio.
Exceeding the covenants would result in the Group being in breach of the facility, which may lead to the facility being withdrawn.
Management regularly monitors and models covenant compliance and prepares detailed forecasts to ensure that sufficient headroom is available.
The Directors are satisfied that there is reasonable headroom on each of the Groups debt covenant ratios.
In addition to the 200 million RCF the Company increased its total facility in the period by 125 million with the draw down of two term loans of 75 million and 50 million to fund the acquisitions of Hometrack and Money respectively.
The 75 million is subject to two bullet payments of 10 million in March 2018 and March 2019 with the remaining balance falling due on April 2020 at the end of the term facility.

Treasury and capital risk management The Groups policy is to actively manage its cash and capital structure to ensure that it complies with its current debt covenant ratios, maintains its current dividend policy and minimises the Groups interest payments by paying down its debt where possible.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Management will consider the use of excess cash, including the payment of special dividends to shareholders and M&A activity, based on the risks and opportunities of the Group at that time.
The Directors can manage the Groups capital structure through the issue or redemption of either debt or equity instruments and by adjustment of the Groups dividend paid to equity holders.
The Directors believe that the current debt to equity ratio remains appropriate but continue to monitor the efficiency of the capital structure on an ongoing basis.
