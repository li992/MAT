Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 20.
Retirement benefit plans continued In the highly unlikely event that the group were to become insolvent there are additional protections of BTPS members benefits: Feature Detail Crown The Crown Guarantee was granted by the Government when the group was privatised in 1984 and would only come into Guarantee effect upon the insolvency of BT.
The Trustee brought court proceedings to clarify the scope and extent of the Crown Guarantee.
The Court of Appeal judgment on 16 July 2014 established that: the Crown Guarantee covers BTs funding obligation in relation to the benefits of members of the BTPS who joined post-privatisation as well as those who joined pre-privatisation subject to certain exceptions : the funding obligation to which the Crown Guarantee relates is measured with reference to BTs obligation to pay deficit contributions under the rules of the BTPS.
The Crown Guarantee is not taken into account for the purposes of the actuarial valuation of the BTPS and is an entirely separate matter, only being relevant in the highly unlikely event that BT became insolvent.
Pension The Pension Protection Fund PPF may take over the BTPS and pay benefits not covered by the Crown Guarantee to Protection Fund members.
PPF There are limits on the amounts paid by the PPF and the PPF would not provide exactly the same benefits as those provided under the BTPS Rules.
Other benefit plans In addition to the BTPS, the group maintains benefit plans around the world with a focus on these being appropriate for the local market and culture.
