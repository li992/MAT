Financial statements Notes to the parent company financial statements 1.
Company accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The application of FRS 101 has enabled the Company to take advantage of certain disclosure exemptions that would have been required had the Company adopted International Financial Reporting Standards in full.
The exemptions that have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements are as follows: A cash flow statement and related notes have not been presented.
Disclosures in respect of new standards and interpretations that have been issued but which are not yet effective have not been provided.
Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries have not been made.
Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures have not been made.
The Company has taken the exemption allowed under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
These financial statements present information about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about its Group.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements.
b Investments Investments in subsidiaries are carried at historical cost less provision for impairment based upon an assessment of the net recoverable amount of each investment.
To the extent that the assessment of the recoverable amount improves due to changes in economic conditions, impairment provisions are reversed, with all provision movements recognised in profit and loss.
c Tax Corporation tax is provided on taxable profits or losses at the current rate.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the end of the reporting period, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at that date.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
d Own shares including treasury shares Transactions of The Grainger Employee Benefit Trusts are included in the Companys financial statements.
The purchase of shares in the Company by each trust and any treasury shares bought back by the Company are debited direct to equity.
e Share-based payments Under the share-based compensation arrangements set out in Note 31 to the Group financial statements, employees of Grainger Employees Limited have been awarded options and conditional shares in the Company.
These share-based arrangements have been treated as equity-settled in the consolidated financial statements.
In the Companys financial statements, the share-based payment charge has been added to the cost of investment in subsidiaries with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
f Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of consideration received, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the statement of financial position date.
