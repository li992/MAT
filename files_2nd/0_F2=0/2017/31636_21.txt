Strategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements | Additional Information Notes For the 52 weeks ended 30 September 2017 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Company information Marstons PLC is a public company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales and domiciled in the UK.
The registered offce is Marstons House, Brewery Road, Wolverhampton, WV1 4JT.
Basis of preparation These fnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland FRS 102 and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The fnancial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company.
Monetary amounts in these fnancial statements are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million.
The fnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modifed to include the revaluation of freehold and leasehold properties and the holding of certain fnancial instruments at fair value.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The Company is a qualifying entity for the purposes of FRS 102, as it prepares publicly available consolidated fnancial statements, which are intended to give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, fnancial position and proft or loss of the Group.
The Company has therefore taken advantage of the exemptions from the following disclosure requirements in FRS 102: Section 4 Statement of Financial Position Reconciliation of the opening and closing number of shares: Section 7 Statement of Cash Flows Presentation of a statement of cash fows and related notes and disclosures: Section 11 Basic Financial Instruments Carrying amounts, interest income expense and net gains losses for each category of fnancial instrument not measured at fair value through proft or loss, and information that enables users to evaluate the signifcance of fnancial instruments: Section 33 Related Party Disclosures Compensation for key management personnel.
These fnancial statements present information about the Company as an individual entity and not about its group.
As permitted by section 408 3 of the Companies Act 2006, no proft and loss account has been presented for the Company.
At the time of approving the fnancial statements, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the fnancial statements.
Turnover Turnover represents rent receivable which is recognised in the period to which it relates.
Current and deferred tax The tax currently payable is based on taxable proft for the period.
Taxable proft differs from net proft as reported in the accounts because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Companys liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profts.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax proft nor the accounting proft.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that suffcient taxable profts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to proft or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Company has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.
Fixed assets Freehold and leasehold properties are stated at valuation or at cost.
Fixtures, fttings, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is charged to the proft and loss account on a straight-line basis to provide for the cost of the assets less their residual values over their useful lives.
Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to their residual values over 50 years.
Short leasehold properties are depreciated over the life of the lease.
Fixtures, fttings, plant and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from 3 to 15 years.
Interest costs directly attributable to capital projects are capitalised.
Properties are revalued by qualifed valuers at least once in each rolling three year period, on an open market value basis.
Substantially all of the Companys properties have been externally valued in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Red Book.
These valuations are performed directly by reference to observable prices in an active market or recent market transactions on arms length terms.
Internal valuations are performed on the same basis.
Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 111 Notes continued For the 52 weeks ended 30 September 2017 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED When a valuation is below current carrying value, the asset concerned is reviewed for impairment.
Impairment losses are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that a previous gain has been recorded, and thereafter to the proft and loss account.
Surpluses on revaluation are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except to the extent they reverse previously charged impairment losses, in which case the reversal is recorded in the proft and loss account.
Disposals of fxed assets Proft loss on disposal of fxed assets represents net sale proceeds less carrying value of the assets.
Any element of the revaluation reserve relating to the fxed assets disposed of is transferred to proft and loss reserves at the date of sale.
Financial instruments The Company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 Basic Financial Instruments and Section 12 Other Financial Instruments Issues of FRS 102 to all of its fnancial instruments.
Financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet when the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the fnancial statements, when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Basic fnancial assets Basic fnancial assets, which comprise amounts owed by Group undertakings, other debtors and cash and cash equivalents, are initially measured at the transaction price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Other fnancial assets Derivatives, including interest rate swaps, are not basic fnancial assets and are accounted for as set out below.
Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through proft and loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting end date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the fnancial asset, the estimated future cash fows have been affected.
If an asset is impaired, the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash fows discounted at the assets original effective interest rate.
The impairment loss is recognised in proft or loss.
If there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the impairment is reversed.
The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not exceed what the carrying amount would have been, had the impairment not previously been recognised.
The impairment reversal is recognised in proft or loss.
Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash fows from the asset expire or are settled, or when the Company transfers the fnancial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classifed according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Basic fnancial liabilities Basic fnancial liabilities, comprising amounts owed to Group undertakings, other creditors and borrowings, are initially recognised at the transaction price and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Other fnancial liabilities Derivatives, including interest rate swaps, are not basic fnancial liabilities and are accounted for as set out below.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the Companys contractual obligations expire or are discharged or cancelled.
Derivatives The Company uses derivative fnancial instruments to hedge the Groups exposure to fuctuations in interest rates.
Derivative fnancial instruments are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The Company has not designated any derivative fnancial instruments as hedging instruments and as such any gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in the proft and loss account immediately.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a fnancial asset, whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a fnancial liability.
Leases Leases are classifed as fnance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classifed as operating leases.
Assets held under fnance leases are recognised as assets at the lower of the assets fair value at the date of inception of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The related liability is included in the balance sheet as a fnance lease obligation.
Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements.
The interest is charged to the proft and loss account so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to the proft and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefts from the leased asset are consumed.
112 | Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements | Additional Information 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Lease premiums received are recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Obligations arising from sale and leaseback arrangements with repurchase options that do not fall within the scope of Section 20 Leases of FRS 102 are classifed as other lease related borrowings and accounted for as secured loans on an amortised cost basis.
Investments in subsidiaries Interests in subsidiaries are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
The investments are assessed for impairment at each reporting date and any impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses are recognised immediately in proft or loss.
Provisions Provisions are recognised in the balance sheet when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outfow of economic benefts will be required to settle the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount expected to be required to settle the obligation is recognised at present value, using a pre-tax rate that refects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifc to the obligation.
When a provision is measured at present value the unwinding of the discount is recognised as a fnance cost in proft or loss in the period it arises.
When valuations of leasehold properties based on future estimated income streams give rise to a defcit as a result of onerous lease conditions they are recognised as provisions.
Other contractual property costs are also recorded as provisions as appropriate.
Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board but unpaid at the period end are recognised in the fnancial statements when they have been approved by the shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Preference shares Preference shares are treated as borrowings, and dividends payable on those preference shares are charged as interest in the proft and loss account.
Group undertakings There is an intra group funding agreement in place between the Company and certain other members of the Group.
This agreement stipulates that all balances outstanding on any intercompany loan account between these companies which exceed 1 are interest bearing at a prescribed rate.
There is a 12.5% subordinated loan owed to the Company by Marstons Pubs Limited and a deep discount bond owed by the Company to Bankss Brewery Insurance Limited.
No interest is payable on any other amounts owed by to Group companies who are not party to the intra group funding agreement.
All amounts owed by to Group undertakings are unsecured and, with the exception of the subordinated loan and deep discount bond, repayable on demand.
2 JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY In the application of the Companys accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements The following judgements apart from those involving estimates have had the most signifcant effect on amounts recognised in the fnancial statements.
Lease classifcation In determining whether a lease is classifed as an operating lease or fnance lease, judgements are required in respect of whether the lease has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset to the lessee, in particular whether the present value of the minimum lease payments amounts to at least substantially all of the fair value of the asset and whether the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The following estimates and assumptions have a signifcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
Tangible fxed assets The Company carries its freehold and leasehold properties at fair value.
These properties are valued by external or internal valuers on an open market value basis, primarily using earnings multiples derived from prices in observed transactions involving comparable businesses.
The estimation of the fair values requires a combination of assumptions, including future earnings and appropriate multiples.
Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 113 Notes continued For the 52 weeks ended 30 September 2017 2 JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY CONTINUED The useful lives and residual values of the Companys tangible fxed assets are estimated based on current property market trends, technological advancement, physical condition of the assets and expected future investment.
These are reviewed annually and amended when necessary to refect current estimates.
The annual depreciation charge is sensitive to changes in both the useful lives and residual values of the assets.
The carrying amount of tangible fxed assets is shown in note 5 and the useful lives are shown in note 1.
Property lease provisions The amount provided in respect of onerous property leases is dependent on a number of assumptions including market rents, vacant periods, future trading income, infation rates and discount rates.
The assumptions made refect historical experience and current trends and rates.
The amount provided for onerous property leases is shown in note 9.
Valuation of interest rate swaps The Companys interest rate swaps are held at fair value.
The Company utilises valuations from counterparties who use a variety of assumptions based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The fair values are highly sensitive to the inputs to the valuations, such as discount rates and yield curves.
The carrying amount of the interest rate swaps is shown in note 10.
3 AUDITORS REMUNERATION Fees payable to the Companys Auditors for the audit of the Companys annual accounts are disclosed in note 3 to the Group fnancial statements.
Fees paid to the Companys Auditors for non-audit services to the Company itself are not required to be disclosed as the Group fnancial statements disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.
