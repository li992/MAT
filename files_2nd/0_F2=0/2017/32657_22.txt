Accounting policies General information A. G. BARR p. l. c. the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group manufacture, distribute and sell soft drinks.
The Group has manufacturing sites in the UK and sells mainly to customers in the UK with some international sales.
The Company is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and domiciled in Scotland.
The address of its registered office is Westfield House, 4 Mollins Road, Cumbernauld, G68 9HD.
The financial year represents the 52 weeks ended 28 January 2017 prior financial year 53 weeks ended 30 January 2016.
Summary of significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation The consolidated and parent Company financial statements of A. G. BARR p. l. c. have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
They have been prepared under the historical cost accounting rules except for the derivative financial instruments and the assets of the Group pension scheme which are stated at fair value and the liabilities of the Group pension scheme which are valued using the projected unit credit method.
The directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these accounts for the reasons set out in note 31.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed on page 94.
The directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under s408 of the Companies Act 2006 and have not presented an income statement for the Company.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures a New and amended standards adopted by the Group The following revised IFRSs have been adopted in this consolidated financial information.
The application of these revised IFRSs has not had any material impact on the amounts reported for the current and prior periods.
Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 1 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 20122014 Cycle IFRS 5, IFRS 7, IAS 19 and IAS 34 b New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 31 January 2016 and not adopted early A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for future year ends, and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements.
These standards and amendments are listed in the table below.
Note this list is limited to those standards which are expected to impact the Group.
Financial year beginning which standard becomes International Accounting Standards and Interpretations effective Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows 29 January 2017 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses Amendments to IAS 12 29 January 2017 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions Amendments to IFRS 2 28 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 28 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases 27 January 2019 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 28 January 2018 Standards not yet endorsed by the EU.
Management have considered the potential impact of the implementation of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16.
It is expected that neither IFRS 9 nor IFRS 15 will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Accounts 88 Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Changes in accounting policy and disclosures continued b New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 31 January 2016 and not adopted early continued It is expected that IFRS 16 will materially affect the consolidated financial statements.
As at the reporting date, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of 9.8m refer to note 25, the vast majority of which relate to production equipment held at the Milton Keynes facility.
Management have performed an analysis of these leases to assess the expected impact of IFRS 16.
If IFRS 16 was implemented in the year to 28 January 2017, its effect would be to increase the net book value of property, plant and equipment by 9.6m, with a corresponding finance lease liability of 11.2m.
The net impact on the income statement for the year ended 28 January 2017 would be immaterial.
To date, 6.6m of operating lease rentals have been recognised in respect of the assessed leases.
Under IFRS 16, 5.8m of depreciation would have been charged, plus a further 1.7m of interest charges.
Consolidation subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
The Company controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date over which control commences until the date on which control ceases.
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group and for acquisitions prior to 1 July 2009 costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Currently, there are no non-controlling interests in any of the entities within the Group.
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair value of non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed.
If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised as a credit in profit or loss.
Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Profits and losses resulting from intercompany transactions that are recognised in net assets are also eliminated.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries are consistent with those adopted by the Group.
Revenue recognition Revenue is the net invoiced sales value, after deducting promotional sales related discounts invoiced by customers, including brand support costs, and exclusive of value added tax of goods and services supplied to external customers during the year.
Brand support costs are investments in customer promotional activities.
Sales are recorded based on the price specified in the sales invoices, net of any agreed discounts and rebates.
Revenue is recognised when the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount can be measured reliably.
Sales related discounts and rebates are calculated based on the expected amounts necessary to meet the claims of the Groups customers in respect of these discounts and rebates.
Brand support accruals are included in the statement of financial position in respect ofthese.
Segment reporting An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Groups other components and for which discrete financial information is available.
Segment results that are reported to the management committee as chief operating decision maker include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those which can be allocated on a consistent basis.
Foreign currency translation a Functional and presentation currency Functional and presentation currency items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling which is the Companys functional and the Groups presentationcurrency.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Accounts 89 b Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement in the same line in which the transaction is recorded.
Exceptional items As permitted by IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements, an item is treated as exceptional if it is considered unusual by its nature and scale and is of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the financial statements to be properlyunderstood.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment charges.
Impairment charges on goodwill are not reversed.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside of goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Brands Separately acquired brands are recognised at cost at the date of purchase.
Brands acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Brands acquired separately or through a business combination are assessed at the date of acquisition as to whether they have an indefinite life.
The assessment includes whether the brand name will continue to trade, and the expected lifetime of the brand.
All brands acquired to date have been assessed as having an indefinite life as they are expected to continue to contribute to the long term future of the Group.
The brands are reviewed annually for impairment, being carried at cost less accumulated impairment charges.
The fair value of a brand at the date of acquisition is based on the Relief from Royalties method, which is a valuation model based on discounted cash flows.
Customer relationships Customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
The customer relationships have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over the expected life of the customer relationship.
The closing balance in the current year represents the carrying value of the customer relationships acquired during the acquisitions of Groupe Rubicon Limited and Funkin Limited.
The fair value of the customer relationships at the acquisition date was based on the Multiple Excess Earnings Method MEEM which is a valuation model based on discounted cash flows.
The useful lives of customer relationships are based on the churn rate of the acquired portfolio and are up to 10 years corresponding to a yearly amortisation of between 10% and 33%.
The useful lives of all intangible assets are reviewed annually and amended, as required, on a prospective basis.
Internally generated software development costs Internally generated software development costs comprise of internal and third party consultancy costs incurred in relation to the Business Process Redesign project.
Amortisation is charged from the date the software is available for use.
This is calculated using the straight-line method over the expected useful life of the software, which is 10 years.
Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings comprise mainly factories, distribution sites and offices.
All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets.
The purchase price of an asset will include the fair value of the consideration paid to acquire the asset.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to acquisition, construction and or production of assets that take a substantial time to complete are capitalised.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Accounts 90 Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment continued Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of any replaced part is derecognised.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation is charged from the date that assets, other than land, are available for use.
It is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost to the residual values of the related assets using the following rates: Buildings 1% Leasehold buildings Term of lease Plant, equipment and vehicles 10% to 33% Computer hardware 20% The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each year end date.
The carrying value of the property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount may be less than the carrying value.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or where no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the net proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within administration costs in the income statement.
Leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
The Group has two heritable properties held under operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the leases commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges.
The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other long term payables.
The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Impairment of non-financial assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment charge is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that is based on current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Accounts 91 A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised although any reversal cannot result in a carrying amount that would exceed the carrying amount that would have been recognised, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade payables.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the estimated cash flows.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of a bad debt provision account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within administration costs.
When a trade receivable becomes uncollectable it is written off against the bad debt provision.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment in the parent Company accounts.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the cash flow statement.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 16.
Movements on the hedging reserve in shareholders equity are shown in the statement of changes in equity.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as non-current when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months from the statement of financial position date and as current when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months from the statement of financial position date.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Accounts 92 Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within administration costs.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled through the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of forward foreign currency contracts hedging overseas purchases is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement within administration costs.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised within the income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completing production and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their primary distribution location and condition.
This includes direct labour costs and an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating activity.
Company shares held by employee benefit trusts Company shares are purchased on behalf of employee benefit trusts to satisfy the liability of various employee share schemes.
The amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a charge in equity.
Purchased shares are classified as Company shares held by employee benefit trusts, and presented as a deduction from retained earnings.
Current and deferred income tax Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is charged in the income statement except where it relates to tax on items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is charged to equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the year end date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the liability method, providing for temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts, in the consolidated financial statements.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Where the carrying value of an asset is to be recovered through both use and subsequent disposal, a single tax base is attributed to that asset resulting in a single temporary difference being recognised.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Employee benefits Retirement benefit plans The Group operates two pension schemes as detailed in note 27.
The schemes are generally funded through payments to trustee-administered funds.
The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
Defined contribution pension plans A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.
Obligations for contributions are recognised as an expense in the income statement as they fall due.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Accounts 93 Defined benefit pension plans A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan.
Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of plan assets less the fair value of the defined benefit obligation.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.
The gain or loss on a settlement is the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation being settled as determined on the date of settlement and the settlement price, including any plan assets transferred and any payments made directly by the Group in connection with the settlement.
The Groups defined benefit plan was closed to future accrual on 1 May 2016.
Share-based compensation The Group grants equity settled share-based payments to certain employees.
These are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions at the grant date.
The fair value of the equity settled share-based payment determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The Group also provides employees with the ability to purchase the Companys ordinary shares at a discount to the current market value through payroll.
The Group records as an expense the fair value of the discount on the shares purchased by the employee as a charge to the income statement and a credit to the share options reserve.
At each year end date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non market vesting conditions.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to the share options reserve.
Profit-sharing and bonus plans The Group recognises a liability and an expense for various bonuses based on formulae that take into consideration the profit attributable to the Companys shareholders after certain adjustments.
The Group recognises a provision where there is a contractual obligation or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
Provisions A provision is recognised if, as the result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan which has been either announced or has commenced.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
Dividend distributions Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Accounts 94 Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Key judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the statement of financial position date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year.
Due to the nature of estimation, the actual outcomes may well differ from these estimates.
The principal estimates and judgements that have a significant effect on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are discussed below: Valuation of inventory judgement Inventory is a significant balance in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The Group purchases commodities for use in the manufacture of soft drinks and these purchases are subject to price volatility.
As the Group uses standard costing to value its inventory, management review price variances arising from the purchases of commodities to ensure that the closing inventory correctly reflects the costs incurred in bringing the inventory to its current state and location.
Carrying value of brand support accruals judgement and estimation uncertainty The Group incurs significant costs in the support and development of the Groups brands.
Judgement is required in determining the level of closing accrual required at a year end for promotions and brand support campaigns that either span two financial years or where the costs have not been fully settled by the year end date.
This includes sales related discounts which are included within revenue as disclosed in the revenue recognition policy above.
At 28 January 2017 the closing brand support accrual was 14.7m 30 January 2016: 13.0m.
In addition the following area of judgement had an effect on the carrying value of assets and liabilities: Retirement benefit obligations estimation uncertainty The determination of any defined benefit pension scheme surplus obligation is based on assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice.
The assumptions used include discount rate, inflation, pension increases, salary increases, the expected return on scheme assets and mortality assumptions.
Segment reporting The Groups management committee has been identified as the chief operating decision maker.
The management committee reviews the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
The management committee has determined the operating segments based on these reports.
The management committee considers the business from a product perspective.
This has led to the operating segments identified in the table below: there has been no change to the segments during the year after aggregation.
The performance of the operating segments is assessed by reference to their gross profit before exceptional items.
The operating segments disclosed have been aggregated by the nature of the products and the production processes that they share in addition to similar long-term average gross margins for the operating segments.

A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Accounts 95 Other segments represent income from the sale of Funkin cocktail solutions, the sale of ice cream and other soft drink relateditems.
The gross profit from the segment reporting is stated before exceptional costs.
There are no exceptional costs included within gross profit for either year presented.
The gross profit from the segment reporting is reconciled to the total profit before income tax, as shown in the consolidated income statement.
All of the assets and liabilities of the Group are managed by the management committee on a central basis rather than at a segment level.
As a result no reconciliation of segment assets and liabilities to the statement of financial position has been disclosed for either of the periods presented.
All of the segments included within Carbonates and Still drinks and water meet the aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8 Operating Segments.

These costs included advisory and legal fees.
0.5m of advisory costs have been incurred as part of a strategic review of the market threats posed by new and emerging digital trading models.
0.6m of redundancy costs have been incurred, arising from a reorganisation of direct sales routes that was completed in the six months ended 30 July 2016.
A further 2.7m of redundancy costs were incurred in the six months ended 28 January 2017, following the announcement of a Company restructuring in September 2016.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Accounts 98 Notes to the Accounts continued 7.
Exceptional items continued Following the announcement of the business restructuring and reorganisation, a further 0.6m of costs were incurred, being mainly recruitment costs, accrual for unpaid holiday entitlement, business development consultancy fees, legal fees and termination costs for employee vehicles and mobile phone contracts.
The Groups defined benefit pension scheme closed to future accrual in May 2016.
This resulted in a 7.0m curtailment gain.
Offsetting the curtailment gain is a further 1.5m of costs incurred in relation to the closure of the defined benefit pension scheme.
This includes the cost of 1.3m past service cost for one years additional service negotiated with the active members of the scheme and 0.2m of further costs relating to the closure of the scheme to future accrual.

A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Accounts 99 The tax on the Groups profit before tax differs from the amount that would arise using the tax rate applicable to the consolidated profits of the Group as follows: 2017 2017 2016 2016 m % m % Profit before tax 43.1 41.3 Tax at 20.0% 2016: 20.2% 8.6 20.0 8.3 20.2 Tax effects of: Items that are not deductible in determining taxable profit 0.3 0.7 1.0 2.4 Current tax adjustment in respect of prior years 0.4 0.9 0.7 1.7 Deferred tax adjustment in respect of prior years 0.1 0.2 Deferred tax adjustment in respect of change of deferred tax rate 0.9 2.1 1.6 3.9 Total tax expense 7.5 17.4 7.0 17.1 The weighted average tax rate was 17.4% 2016: 17.1%.
The Chancellor announced in his Autumn Budget on 23 November 2016 that the main rate of corporation tax will be reduced to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 2020 and the future charges will reduce accordingly.
2 Bill 2016 became substantively enacted on 23 November 2016.
The deferred tax liability at 28 January 2017 has therefore been calculated having regard to the rate of 17% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding shares held by the employee share scheme trusts.

These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

Acquisition of subsidiary On 2 February 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Funkin Limited Funkin, a company which offers a broad range of premium cocktail solutions including fruit pures, cocktail mixers and syrups.
Consideration transferred The following table summarises the acquisition-date fair value of each major class of consideration transferred: m Cash paid in the year ended 30 January 2016 17.5 Contingent consideration payable in the year ending 27 January 2018 4.5 Total consideration 22.0 Contingent consideration The Group has agreed to pay the former owners of Funkin a contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain financial targets by Funkin in the two years ending 28 January 2017.
The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement of 4.5m was estimated by assessing the expected growth of Funkin over the two years trading post acquisition.
No discount rate has been applied to the fair value estimate of the contingent consideration due to the short time period the effect of discounting has a negligible effect on the fair value.
Management believe that Funkin has achieved the financial targets and that the contingent consideration of 4.5m will be paid to the former owners before 29 July 2017.
This will be subject to the audit of the Funkin statutory accounts for the year ended 31 January 2017, and completion of the necessary legal documentation relating to the acquisition.

This project introduced a more effective, modern and robust Enterprise Resource Planning software.
This project was completed during the year to 30 January 2016.
The opening customer relationships balance represents intangible assets recognised on the acquisition of the Strathmore Water business and Groupe Rubicon Limited.
The amortisation charge represents the spreading of the cost over the assets expected useful lives: the Strathmore customer relationships are fully amortised.
The Rubicon asset has two years remaining and the Funkin asset has eight years remaining.
These periods have been reviewed at the statement of financial position date and remain appropriate.
The amortisation costs for the year ended 28 January 2017 have been included in the income statement as administration costs.

Impairment tests for goodwill and brands For impairment testing, goodwill and brands are allocated to the cash-generating unit CGU representing the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.

These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management which cover a three year period.
Cash flows beyond the three years are extrapolated using the growth rates and other key assumptions as stated below: Key assumptions 2017 2016 Gross margin Growth rate Discount rate Gross margin Growth rate Discount rate % % % % % % Rubicon operating unit 30.2 2.25 10.25 38.5 2.25 11.00 Funkin operating unit 48.5 2.25 10.25 52.4 2.25 11.00 Strathmore operating unit 37.3 2.25 10.25 30.2 2.25 11.00 The budgeted gross margin is based on past performance and management's expectation of market development.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The discount rates used are pre-tax.
The discount rate reflects management's estimate of pre-tax cost of capital adjusted for the specific risks impacting on each operating unit.
The estimated pre-tax cost of capital is a benchmark for the Group provided by an independent third party.
Advertising and promotional costs are included in the analysis, using latest annual budgets for the year to 27 January 2018 and projected costs thereafter.
Sensitivity analysis was carried out on the above calculations to review possible levels of impairment after adjusting discount rates.
At a pre-tax rate of 15%, none of the CGUs were impaired.
Whilst cash flow projections used within the impairment reviews are subject to inherent uncertainty, changes within reason to the key assumptions applied in assessing the value in use calculation would not result in a change in the impairment conclusions reached.

Pension prepayment The Company established the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2008 Scottish Limited Partnership the Partnership in the year to 26 January 2014 and through the Partnership has entered into a long term pension funding arrangement with the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2008 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.

The Partnership is controlled by A. G. BARR p. l. c. and its results are consolidated by the Group.
A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate only to administrative tasks and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
As outlined in note 27, during a prior year, certain freehold properties were transferred to a limited partnership a structured entity established by the Group the main purpose of which is to lease these properties to a Group company and, as a result, to provide the Groups pension scheme with a distribution of the profits of the Partnership.
The distribution is subject to discretion exercisable by the Group in certain circumstances however, given that the Group has the ability to control the limited Partnership by making an additional contribution into the scheme, it is the view of the directors that the Group controls the limited Partnership and therefore it is treated as a consolidated entity.
The carrying value of the properties sold to the Partnership and leased back to the Company remain included on the Groups and Companys balance sheet and continued to be depreciated in line with the Groups and Companys accounting policies with the Group and Company retaining full operational control over these properties.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption conferred by Regulation 7 of the Partnerships Accounts Regulations 2008 and has, therefore, not appended the accounts of this qualifying partnership to these financial statements.
Separate accounts for the Partnership are not required to be, and have not been, filed at UK Companies House.
As part of the funding arrangement the Company made a one off payment to the Pension Scheme of 20.4m to allow it to invest in the Partnership and this is treated as a prepayment of pension contributions.
Further information on the asset backed funding arrangement is included within note 27.
As the Partnership results are consolidated within the Group results no prepayment is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.

Derivative financial instruments Group and Company Fair value hierarchy IFRS 7 requires all financial instruments carried at fair value to be analysed under the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: i nputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
The fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the date of the statement of financial position, with the resulting value discounted accordingly as relevant.
The following tables show the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy.
It does not include fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
The fair value of the current trade and other receivables and the current trade and other payables approximates to their book value as none of the balances are interest bearing.
For the current borrowings, the impact of discounting is not significant as the borrowings will be paid within 12 months of the year end date.
The carrying amount approximates their fair value.
The fair value of the non-current borrowings is based on cash flows discounted using the current variable interest rate charged on the borrowings of 1.5%, a discount rate of 1.5% and are within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Contingent consideration The Group has agreed to pay the former owners of Funkin a contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain financial targets by Funkin in the two years from the date of its acquisition by the Group.
The potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that the Group could make under the acquisition agreement is between nil and 4.5m.
No discount rate has been applied to the fair value estimate of the contingent consideration as due to the short time period the effect of discounting has a negligible effect on the fair value.
The Group expects to make a payment of 4.5m within 6 months of the year ended 28 January 2017 note 12.

Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign exchange risk, cash flow and fair value interest rate risk and price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors.
Management identifies, evaluates and manages financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups business units.
The Board provides guidance on overall market risk management including use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
In addition, treasury matters are dealt with by the Treasury Committee.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Accounts 119 Market risk Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally.
The Group primarily buys and sells in Sterling but does make purchases and sales denominated in USDollars and Euros.
Due to the hedging arrangements that have been in place for the year ended 28 January 2017, if Sterling had weakened strengthened by 10% against the US Dollar or Euro, with all other variables held constant, there would have been an immaterial effect on post-tax profit year ended 30 January 2016: immaterial impact on post-taxprofit.
The Group periodically enters into forward option contracts to purchase foreign currencies for known purchases where the value and volume of trading purchases is known.
The Treasury Committee assesses whether hedge accounting should be applied for each forward option contract.
Price risk The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk because no such investments are held by the Group other than within Pension Scheme assets.
The Group purchases a wide range of commodities in the ordinary course of business.
Exposure to changes in the market price of certain of these commodities, including sugar, plastic, aluminium and mango, is managed through the use of forward physical supply contracts, primarily to convert floating or indexed prices to fixed prices.
The use of such contracts to hedge commodity exposures is governed by the Groups risk management policies and is continually monitored by the Treasury Committee.
Commodity derivatives also provide a way to meet customers pricing requirements whilst achieving a price structure consistent with the Groups overall pricing strategy.
All of the Groups commodity derivatives are treated as own use contracts, which are outside the scope of IAS 39, since they are both entered into, and continue to be held, for the purposes of the Groups ordinary operations, and are not net settled the Group takes physical delivery of the commodity concerned.
Own use contracts do not require accounting entries until the commodity purchase actually crystallises.
The majority of the Groups forward physical contracts and commodity derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.
As all of the commodity contracts qualify for the own use treatment, no sensitivity analysis has been carried out.
Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, the Groups income and operating cash inflows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings.
Borrowings obtained at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, which is partially offset by cash held at variable rates.
For the year ended 28 January 2017, if interest rates on Sterling-denominated borrowings at that date had been 0.5% higher lower with all other variables held constant, there would have been an immaterial change in the post-tax profit for the year year ended 30 January 2016: immaterial impact.
Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to major and direct to store customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of A are accepted.
If major customers are independently rated, these ratings are used.
Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, risk control processes assess the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual risk limits are set by the management committee based on internal or external ratings.
The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored.
Sales to direct to store customers are largely settled in cash in order to manage credit risk from smaller, independent stores.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Accounts 120 Notes to the Accounts continued 26.
Financial risk management continued Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, the Group maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining sufficient cash reserves and the availability of borrowing facilities.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve which comprises undrawn borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows.
This is carried out at a Group level and involves projecting forward cash flows and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet excesses of expenditure relative to income.
Capital risk management The Group defines capital as being net cash debt plus equity.
The Groups objective when managing capital is to maintain an appropriate capital structure to balance the needs of the Group, whilst operating within its bank covenants.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group has a number of options available to it including modifying dividend payments to shareholders, returning capital to shareholders or issuing new shares.
In this way, the Group balances returns to shareholders between long term growth and current returns whilst maintaining capital discipline in relation to investing activities and taking any necessary action on costs to respond to the currentenvironment.
The Group monitors existing equity in issuance on the basis of the net cash debt EBITDA ratio.
Net cash debt is calculated as being the net of cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
The net debt position is discussed in the Financial Review on pages 26 to 30.
The net cash debt EBITDA ratio enables the Group to plan its capital requirements in the medium term.
The Group uses this measure to provide useful information to financial institutions and investors.
The Group believes that the current net cash debt EBITDA ratio together with existing shares in issuance provides an efficient capital structure and an acceptable level of financial flexibility.
For the year ended 28 January 2017, there was a net cash surplus of 9.7m year ended 30 January 2016: net debt of 11.3m.
The Group monitors capital efficiency on the basis of the return on capital employed ratio ROCE.
In the financial year ended 28 January 2017, ROCE increased to 20.2% from 18.8%.
Retirement benefit obligations During the year the Company operated two pension schemes, the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2005 Defined Contribution Scheme and the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2008 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
The latter is a funded defined benefit scheme based on final salary which also includes a defined contribution section for the pension provision of new executive entrants.
Under the defined benefit scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on final pensionable pay.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
Defined benefit scheme: actuarial valuation The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Company and are invested in managed funds.
A full valuation of the defined benefit scheme was conducted as at 5 April 2014 using the attained age method.
A surplus of 12.2m was determined at the valuation date.
The defined benefit scheme exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
Responsibility for governance of the plans, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies jointly with the Company and the board of trustees.
The board of trustees is composed of representatives from the Company scheme members as set out in the plans rules.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Accounts 121 Defined benefit scheme: IAS 19 information The full actuarial valuation carried out at 5 April 2014 was updated to 28 January 2017 by a qualified independent actuary.

A curtailment gain of 7.0m arose on the closure to future accrual.
A past service cost of 1.3m has also been recognised as active members were awarded one years further service as part of the negotiated closure.
Following the closure the Company incurred a further 0.2m of costs in relation to the closure of the Scheme to future accrual.
These three items have been treated as exceptional items in the year to 28 January 2017 note 7.
The Company made a 1.0m contribution to the scheme in May 2016 and will make a further 1.0m contribution to the scheme in May 2017.

Under this arrangement certain property assets were transferred into the Partnership and are being leased back to A. G. BARR p. l. c under a 21 year lease agreement, generating an income stream of 1.1m per annum for the pension scheme, increasing annually in line with inflation.
The value of the properties transferred into the Partnership remains included on the Groups and Companys balance sheet at carrying values at the date of transfer with the Group and Company retaining full operational control over these properties.
At the end of the term of the relevant lease, or earlier if the Scheme becomes fully funded to the extent that the members benefits can be secured with an insurance company, the Company has the option to repurchase the properties in the Partnership for an agreed fixed price.

The fair value of scheme assets at the year end dates is analysed as follows: 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 m m m m m Equities 46.4 41.6 46.8 49.5 56.8 Bonds 28.2 60.7 59.9 43.1 25.9 Property 0.5 0.4 0.3 Cash 5.2 4.6 5.7 4.6 4.2 Buy-in policy 31.5 Total market value of scheme assets 111.8 107.3 112.7 97.2 86.9 Sensitivity review The sensitivity of the overall pension liability to changes in the weighted principle assumptions is: Impact on overall liabilities Change in assumption Year to 28 January 2017 Year to 30 January 2016 Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decreases increases liabilities by 2.3m Decreases increases liabilities by 2.2m Rate of inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% Increases decreases liabilities by 2.0m Increases decreases liabilities by 1.5m Life expectancy Increase decrease by 1 year Increases decreases liabilities by 5.6m Increases decreases liabilities by 4.3m Methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses The sensitivities disclosed were calculated using approximate methods taking into account the duration of the Schemes liabilities.
They have been calculated consistently with last periods disclosures, however these change over time with financial conditions and assumptions.
Risks to which the Scheme exposes the Company The nature of the Scheme exposes the Company to the risk of paying unanticipated additional contributions to the Scheme in times of adverse experience.
The most financially significant risks are likely to be: Asset volatility The Schemes liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields in line with the requirements of IAS 19R.
If the Scheme assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The plan holds investments in a portfolio of equity and bonds which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term but provide volatility and risk in the short term.
The Trustees have made a number of steps to control the level of investment risk within the Scheme over the last 12 months.
The Trustee and the Company agreed in April 2016 to purchase an annuity policy with Canada Life to cover all future pension payments to certain members of the Scheme.
This policy was purchased at a cost of 34.7m and secures the total amount of future pension payments for 100 of the Schemes pensioner members.
The Trustees will continue to review the risk exposures in light of the longer term objectives of the Scheme.

Retirement benefit obligations continued Risks to which the Scheme exposes the Company continued Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities.
In the event of a reduction in the corporate bond yields there will be an increase in the value of the Schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk The Group pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of the Schemes assets are either unaffected by inflation fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated with inflation equities, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The Schemes obligation is to provide benefits for the life of the members.
An increase in life expectancy will result in an increase in the Schemes liabilities.
Policy for recognising gains and losses The Company recognises actuarial gains and losses immediately, through the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability.
Asset-liability matching strategies used by the Scheme or the Company The Trustees current investment strategy, having consulted with the Company, is to invest circa 40% of the Schemes assets in a mix of equities and diversifying return seeking assets, with the balance in an annuity policy, long dated gilts and corporate bonds, in order to strike a balance between: maximising the returns on the Schemes assets: and minimising the risks associated with the lower than expected returns on the Schemes assets.
Description of funding arrangements and funding policy that affect future contributions The Schedule of Contributions dated 9 January 2015 sets out the current contributions payable by the Company to the Scheme.
This was revised based on the actuarial valuation performed as at 5 April 2014 to allow for the rental income stream from the asset backed funding arrangement effectively being a commitment which will offset the requirement for future deficitcontributions.
Expected contributions over the next accounting period A. G. BARR p. l. c. expects to contribute approximately 1.0m to the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2008 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme in the period ending 28 January 2017, and the Scheme expects to receive further contributions of approximately 1.2m from the asset backed funding arrangement in which the Scheme holds an interest.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 20 years.
The expected maturity analysis of the undiscounted defined benefit pension benefit, estimated on the Schemes funding is as follows: Less than One to Two to Greater than one year two years five years five years Proportion of total pension benefits to be paid as at 5 April 2016 1% 1% 3% 95% Proportion of total pension benefits to be paid as at 5 April 2015 1% 1% 3% 95% Defined contribution scheme The pension costs for the defined contribution schemes are as follows: 2017 2016 m m Defined contribution costs 3.1 2.8 A.

Share-based payments continued LTIP During the year, an award of shares was made to the executive directors as disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The weighted average fair value of the share awards made during the period was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
The significant inputs to the model were as follows: Date of grant 7 April 2016 Number of share awards granted 272,785 Share price at date of grant 527p Contractual life in years 3 Dividend yield 2.19% Expected outcome of meeting performance criteria at grant date 50% Fair value determined at grant date 493p AESOP As described in the Directors Remuneration Report, there are two elements to the AESOP.
The partnership share element provides that for every three shares that a participant purchases in A. G. BARR p. l. c. up to a maximum contribution of 150 per month, the Company will purchase one matching share.
The matching shares purchased are held in trust in the name of the individual.
There are various rules as to the period of time that the shares must be held in trust but after five years, the shares can be released tax free to the participant.
The second element of free shares allows participants to receive shares to the value of a common percentage of their earnings, related to the performance of the Group.
The maximum value of the annual award is 3,600 and the shares awarded are held in trust for five years.
Under the terms of the AESOP rules, any award of free shares to employees is made by the Trustee of the AESOP subject to the Companys consent.
