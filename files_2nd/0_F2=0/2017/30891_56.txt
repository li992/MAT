Earnings per share Cents per share Per ordinary share 2017 2016 2015 Basic earnings per share 17.20 0.61 35.39 Diluted earnings per share 17.10 0.60 35.39 Dollarspershare Per American Depositary Share ADS 2017 2016 2015 Basic earnings per share 1.03 0.04 2.12 Diluted earnings per share 1.03 0.04 2.12 Basic earnings per ordinary share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit loss for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
The average number of shares outstanding includes certain shares that will be issuable in the future under employee share-based payment plans and excludes treasury shares, which includes shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan trusts ESOPs.
For the diluted earnings per share calculation, the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for the average number of shares that are potentially issuable in connection with employee share-based payment plans.
If the inclusion of potentially issuable shares would decrease loss per share, the potentially issuable shares are excluded from the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share.
A dilutive effect relating to potentially issuable shares has not been included, therefore, in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for 2015.
