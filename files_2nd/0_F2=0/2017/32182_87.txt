The Directors consider the carrying amount of trade and other payables and accruals and deferred income approximates fair value.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Groups debt facilities require 45% of total drawn debt to be fixed.
The Group has complied with this during the year.
With the exception of derivative instruments which are classified as a financial liability at fair value through the profit and loss FVTPL, financial liabilities are categorised under amortised cost.
All financial assets are categorised as loans and receivables.
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements.
Balance sheet management The Groups Board reviews the capital structure on an ongoing basis.
As part of this review, the Board considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
The Group seeks to have a conservative gearing ratio the proportion of net debt to equity.
The Board considers at each review the appropriateness of the current ratio in light of the above.
The Board is currently satisfied with the Groups gearing ratio.
The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 Debt 304,955 312,198 Cash and cash equivalents 6,906 17,207 Net debt 298,049 294,991 Balance sheet equity 890,350 829,387 Net debt to equity ratio 33.5% 35.6% Debt is defined as long-term and short-term borrowings, as detailed in note 19, excluding finance leases and debt issue costs.
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to equity holders of the Company.
Net debt is defined as gross bank borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Debt management The Group currently borrows through a senior term loan, secured on 25 self storage assets and sites, a 15 year loan with Aviva Commercial Finance Limited secured on a portfolio of 15 self storage assets, and a 70 million seven year loan from M&G Investments Limited secured on a portfolio of 15 self storage assets.
Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short term liquidity.
Funding is arranged through banks and financial institutions with whom the Group has a strong working relationship.
C. Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, and by the use of interest rate swap contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite: ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
At 31 March 2017 the Group had two interest rate derivatives in place: 30 million fixed at 0.4% excluding the margin on the underlying debt instrument until October 2021, and 35 million fixed at 2.635% excluding the margin on the underlying debt instrument until June 2022.
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The 30 million interest rate swap settles on a monthly basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swap is one month LIBOR.
The Group settles the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
The 35 million interest rate swap settles on a three-monthly basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swap is three month LIBOR.
The Group does not hedge account for its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value, with changes in fair value included in the statement of comprehensive income.
The gain in the statement of comprehensive income for the year on the fair value of interest rate derivatives was 719,000 2016: loss of 4,000.
The fair value of the above derivatives at 31 March 2017 was a liability of 2,964,000 2016: liability of 3,683,000.
D. Interest rate sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings, without jeopardising its flexibility.
Over the longer term, permanent changes in interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31 March 2017, it is estimated that an increase of 0.25 percentage points in interest rates would have reduced the Groups adjusted profit before tax and net equity by 375,000 2016: reduced adjusted profit before tax by 388,000 and a decrease of 0.25 percentage points in interest rates would have increased the Groups adjusted profit before tax and net equity by 375,000 2016: increased adjusted profit before tax by 388,000.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest rate swaps, at the year end.
The Groups sensitivity to interest rates has decreased during the year, with a slight reduction in the amount of floating rate debt.
The Board monitors closely the exposure to the floating rate element of our debt.
E. Cash management and liquidity Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Included in note 19 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
Short term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk.
F. Foreign currency management The Group does not have any foreign currency exposure.
G. Credit risk The credit risk management policies of the Group with respect to trade receivables are discussed in note 16.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over 52,500 customers in our stores.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

Fair values of financial instruments The fair values of the Groups cash and short term deposits and those of other financial assets equate to their book values.
Details of the Groups receivables at amortised cost are set out in note 16.
The amounts are presented net of provisions for doubtful receivables, and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate.
Trade and other payables, including bank borrowings, are carried at amortised cost.
Finance lease liabilities are included at the fair value of their minimum lease payments.
Derivatives are carried at fair value.
For those financial instruments held at valuation, the Group has categorised them into a three level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique in accordance with IFRS 7.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3.
If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the category level is based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument in its entirety.
The fair value of the Groups outstanding interest rate derivative, as detailed in note 18C, has been estimated by calculating the present value of future cash flows, using appropriate market discount rates, representing Level 2 fair value measurements as defined by IFRS 7.
There are no financial instruments which have been categorised as Level 1 or Level 3.
Maturity analysis of financial liabilities The contractual maturities based on market conditions and expected yield curves prevailing at the year end date are as follows: Trade and other Interest rate Borrowings Finance payables swaps and interest leases Total 2017 000 000 000 000 000 From five to twenty years 127 166,652 25,556 192,335 From two to five years 1,493 180,928 6,116 188,537 From one to two years 692 11,930 2,039 14,661 Due after more than one year 2,312 359,510 33,711 395,533 Due within one year 21,631 816 11,930 2,039 36,416 Total 21,631 3,128 371,440 35,750 431,949 Trade and other Interest rate Borrowings Finance payables swaps and interest leases Total 2016 000 000 000 000 000 From five to twenty years 506 176,296 22,894 199,696 From two to five years 1,684 188,517 5,255 195,456 From one to two years 675 12,982 1,752 15,409 Due after more than one year 2,865 377,795 29,901 410,561 Due within one year 21,045 1,055 12,982 1,752 36,834 Total 21,045 3,920 390,777 31,653 447,395 K.
