110 RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Basis of Preparation and Significant Accounting Policies RSA Insurance Group plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The Company through its subsidiaries and associates together the Group or RSA provides personal and commercial insurance products to its global customer base, principally in the UK, Ireland, Middle East together UK & International, Scandinavia and Canada.
1 Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the Companies Act 2006 where applicable.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on an historical cost basis.
Where other bases are applied, these are identified in the relevant accounting policy.
In line with industry practice, the Groups statement of financial position is not presented using current and non-current classifications, but broadly in increasing order of liquidity.
The assets and liabilities considered as non-current include: investments in associates, deferred tax assets, property and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, deferred tax liabilities, outstanding debt including loan capital and elements of financial investments, insurance contract liabilities and reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities.
The assets and liabilities considered as current include cash and cash equivalents, and insurance and reinsurance debtors.
The remaining balances are of a mixed nature.
The current and non-current portions of such balances are in the notes on pages 111 to 178 or in the Risk and Capital Management note note 5.
Except where otherwise stated, all figures included in the consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of pounds sterling m. Accounting policies that are significant to understanding the performance, financial position and cash flows of the Group are set out in note 4 with other policies presented in Appendix A.
The notes are grouped together by their nature.
Estimation techniques and assumptions are presented in the relevant note in order to provide context to the figures presented.
The most significant estimates and judgements are those used in determining insurance contract liabilities note 37, deferred tax note 29 and defined benefit pension scheme liabilities note 38.
2 Adoption of new and revised standards There are a small number of narrow scope amendments arising from annual improvements to standards that are applicable to the Group for the first time in 2017, none of which have had a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
3 New accounting standards, interpretations and amendments IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts The International Accounting Standards Board IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts in May 2017, which it is expected will replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts at the latest for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021.
A Transitional Resource Group has been set up by the IASB to support implementation of the new standard.
The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group EFRAG have been requested by the European Commission to provide their advice by the end of 2018 which should lead to endorsement some time in 2019.
There is currently no certainty of what the endorsement process will be if this has not happened by the time the UK leaves the EU, and RSA continue to monitor this.
The Group has completed its initial impact assessment and is using these results to inform a detailed planning phase which is underway.
During this phase decisions will be made on appropriate policies to adopt and the required change to finance systems and processes.
The Group intends to start implementation activities in 2018 and intends to parallel run systems and reporting during 2020 to assure reporting compliance by 1 January 2021.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments has been issued to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and primarily changes the classification and measurement of financial assets, depending on the business model under which they are held, as well as hedge accounting requirements and recognising expected credit losses.
The Group, in line with peers, will take advantage of the exemption available to entities whose activities are predominantly insurance related to defer applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which would otherwise be applicable for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 until 1 January 2021 which will coincide with the expected implementation of IFRS 17.
This will enable accounting policy choices to consider the interrelationships of IFRS 17 and 9 particularly with regards to asset and liability management.
Assessment and implementation of IFRS 9 will therefore run alongside IFRS 17 activity.
IFRS 15 Revenue Recognition IFRS 15 Revenue Recognition is effective from 1 January 2018 and does not apply to insurance and financial instrument income.
The impact of IFRS 15 on the recognition of relevant revenue has been evaluated during the year with no significant changes identified.
RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 111 Basis of Preparation and Significant Accounting Policies continued IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 Leases replaces the existing standard IAS 17 Leases and standardises lessee treatment of leases and becomes effective at the latest for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The standard requires a lessee to recognise a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing the corresponding obligation to make lease payments.
In addition, the nature of expenses related to those leases will now change: IFRS 16 replaces the straight line operating lease expense with a depreciation charge for the right-of-use assets and interest expense on the lease liabilities, The Group has completed an initial assessment of the potential impact of adopting the standard but has still to complete its detailed assessment or to incorporate into its financial reporting systems and processes, which will take place during 2018.
The actual impact of implementing IFRS 16 on the Groups financial statements will depend on future economic conditions, including the Groups borrowing rate at 1 January 2019, the composition of the Groups lease portfolio at that date, the Groups latest assessment of whether it will exercise any lease renewal options and the extent to which the group chooses to use practical expedients and recognition exemptions.
Other standards The following amended standards and interpretations are not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements: Annual improvement to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle Amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 28: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions Amendments to IFRS 2 : Transfers of Investment Property Amendments to IAS 40 : Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 : IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration: IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments.
4 Significant accounting policies The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, as set out below, have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise stated.
The Group has not made any significant changes to its accounting policies during 2017.
Premium income Premium written is recognised in the period in which the Group is legally bound through a contract to provide insurance cover.
It represents the full amount of premiums receivable under the contract, including estimates where the amounts are not known at the date they are written.
These are deferred as a provision for unearned premiums until recognised as revenue principally computed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis.
Net premiums earned are stated net of amounts passed ceded to reinsurers.
Premiums are shown before deduction of commission and exclude any sales based taxes or duties.
Gross claims incurred and insurance contract liabilities Gross claims incurred represent the cost of agreeing and settling insurance claims on insurance contracts underwritten by the Group.
Provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses are recognised at the estimated ultimate cost, net of expected salvage and subrogation recoveries when a claim is incurred.
The provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses, and related reinsurance recoveries, are discounted where there is a long period from incident to claims settlement or when nominal interest rates are high and where there exists a suitable claims payment pattern from which to calculate the discount.
In defining those claims with a long period from incident to claims settlement, an average period of settlement of six years or more has been used as a guide.
The discount rate used is based upon an investment return expected to be earned by financial assets which are appropriate in value and duration to match the provisions for insurance contract liabilities being discounted during the period expected before the final settlement of such claims.
Differences between the estimated cost and subsequent settlement of claims or re-estimated costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the year in which they are settled or in which the insurance contract liabilities are re-estimated.
Acquisition costs comprise the direct and indirect costs of obtaining and processing new insurance business.
Levies payable are treated as costs of underwriting business.
These costs are recognised as deferred acquisition costs DAC and are deducted from the provision for unearned premium.
DAC is amortised on the same basis as the related unearned premiums are earned.
At the end of each reporting period tests are performed to ensure the adequacy of the Groups insurance contract liabilities by considering the cash flows associated with the provision for unearned premium net of related DAC.
In performing these tests, best estimates of future contractual cash flows, including loss adjustment and administrative expenses as well as investment income on financial assets backing such liabilities are used.
Any deficiency is charged to the consolidated income statement immediately by establishing a provision for liability adequacy known as the unexpired risk provision.
The unexpired risk provision is assessed in aggregate for business classes which are managed together and where there are no restraints on the ability to use assets held in relation to such business to meet any of the associated liabilities.
Further information on net claims can be found in note 10, and insurance contract liabilities in note 37.
112 RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Reinsurance Written premiums ceded to a reinsurer are recognised in the period in which the reinsurance contract is entered into and include estimates where the amounts are not finalised at the end of the reporting period.
The ceded written premiums are recognised in the consolidated income statement over the period of the reinsurance contract, based on the expected earning pattern in relation to the underlying insurance contract s. Reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities within the consolidated statement of financial position includes the reinsurers share of provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses and unearned premiums.
The Group reports third party reinsurance balances on the consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis to present the exposure to credit risk related to third party reinsurance.
The amount recoverable is reduced when there is an event arising after the initial recognition that provides objective evidence that the Group may not receive all amounts due under the reinsurance contract.
Annuities purchased by the Group to provide for payments under structured settlement arrangements are accounted for as reinsurance ceded and a corresponding reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities in cases where the Group remains liable for the settlement in the event of default by the annuity provider.
Any gain or loss arising on the purchase of an annuity is recognised in the consolidated income statement at the date of purchase.
Further information can be found in note 28.
Financial Instruments Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities The Group initially recognises financial instruments at their fair value on the date at which they are purchased.
At initial measurement, the Group classifies its financial assets and financial liabilities in one of the following categories: Designated at fair value through profit and loss FVTPL : Held for trading: Available for sale AFS : Cash and cash equivalents: Loans and receivables: Financial liabilities: or Derivatives designated as hedging instruments.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and financial liabilities that are not FVTPL are added to their fair value in their initial measurement.
Further information can be found in notes 25, 26 and 27.
The table below summarises the classification and treatment of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities.
Recognition of Category Financial instrument Description Subsequent measurement change in fair value Designated fair value Debt securities, Where the investment Fair value using prices at Income statement net through profit & loss equity securities return is managed on the the end of the period investment gains losses FVTPL on initial basis of the total return recognition on investment including unrealised investment gains Held for trading Derivative assets Acquired or incurred Carried at fair value Income statement net liabilities not designated principally for the investment gains losses Derivatives are carried as as hedging instruments purpose of selling or assets when fair value is repurchasing in the near positive and as liabilities term when fair value is negative Available for sale AFS Debt securities, Where the investment Fair value using prices at Other comprehensive equity securities return on equity or debt the end of the period income unrealised securities is managed on gains losses the basis of the periodic Income statement cash flows arising from net investment gains the investment losses when realised or impaired RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 113 Basis of Preparation and Significant Accounting Policies continued Recognition of Category Financial instrument Description Subsequent Measurement change in fair value Cash and cash Cash and cash Consist of cash and Carrying amounts at equivalents equivalents highly liquid investments amortised cost that are readily convertible into a known amount of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have a maturity date of 90 days or less from the date of acquisition Loans and receivables Loans, reinsurance Financial assets with Amortised cost using the Income statement net deposits, other deposits fixed or determinable effective interest investment gains losses and financial assets payments not quoted in method when realised or arising from nonan active market impaired investment activities, and loans made for investment purposes Financial liabilities Other borrowings Financial liabilities with Amortised cost using the Income statement fixed or determinable effective interest net investment gains payments method losses when settled Loan capital Financial liabilities with Amortised cost using the Income statement fixed or determinable effective interest net investment gains payments and maturity method losses when settled date Derivatives designated Derivative assets Hedge of a net Carried at fair value Hedge of future cash as hedging instruments liabilities designated as investment in a foreign flows effective portion Derivatives are carried as hedging instruments operation or hedge of is initially recognised in assets when fair value is future cash flows or OCI: subsequently positive and as liabilities hedge of fair value of recognised in the income when fair value is fixed interest securities statement when the negative hedged cash flows affect profit or loss Hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation effective portion is recognised in other comprehensive income, ineffective portion is immediately recognised in the income statement Hedge of fair value recognised in the income statement.
The change in fair value of the hedged investments attributable to the hedged risk is transferred from the revaluation reserve to the income statement 114 RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Investment income Dividends on equity investments are recognised as investment income in the consolidated income statement on the date at which the investment is priced ex dividend.
Interest income is recognised in the consolidated income statement using the effective interest rate method.
Unrealised gains and losses on AFS investments are recognised in other comprehensive income, except for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary items which are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
On derecognition of an investment classified as AFS, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Further information can be found in note 9.
Impairment of financial instruments The Group determines, at each reporting date, whether there is evidence that the value of a financial asset or a group of financial assets, other than those measured as FVTPL are impaired.
A financial asset is impaired if there is objective evidence that indicates that an event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset that may have resulted in a loss of value as a result of having a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows generated by that asset which can be estimated reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of debt instruments is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument.
Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised using the effective interest rate method.
For equity securities whose fair values are readily determined and where there is objective evidence that such an asset is impaired by a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below cost, the net loss previously charged to other comprehensive income is reclassified to the consolidated income statement.
If the fair value of a previously impaired debt security increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, the impairment loss is reversed and the reversal recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Impairment losses on equity investments are not reversed.
Current and deferred tax Current and deferred tax are recognised in the consolidated income statement, except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Any exceptions permitted under IAS12 are disclosed in the notes.
Current taxation is based on profits and income for the year as determined in accordance with the relevant tax legislation, together with adjustments for prior years.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting, nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the related deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax in respect of the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and principal associated undertakings is recognised as an expense in the year in which the profits arise, except where the remittance of earnings can be controlled and it is probable that remittance will not take place in the foreseeable future, in which case the tax charge is recognised on the dividends received.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which unused tax losses and temporary differences can be utilised.
RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 115 Basis of Preparation and Significant Accounting Policies continued Post-retirement benefits and obligations The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.
A defined contribution scheme is a pension scheme under which the Group pays fixed contributions and has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged in the consolidated income statement in the period in which the underlying employment services are provided to the Group.
A defined benefit scheme refers to any other pension scheme: specifically, the Groups defined benefit schemes define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and salary.
The value of the net defined benefit liability asset recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position for each individual post-retirement scheme is calculated as the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligations of the scheme and the fair value of the scheme assets out of which the obligations are to be settled.
For those schemes in a net liability deficit position, the net liability is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position in provisions.
For those schemes in a net asset surplus position, the asset is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position in other debtors and other assets only to the extent that the Group can realise an economic benefit, in the form of a refund or a reduction in future contributions, at some point during the life of the scheme or when the scheme liabilities are settled.
The amounts charged or credited where relevant in the consolidated income statement relating to post-retirement defined benefit schemes are as follows: The current service cost: this is the present value of additional benefits payable for employees services provided during the reporting period: The past service costs and gains or losses on settlement: these are changes to the obligations already established for past service costs that have arisen from an amendment to the terms of the scheme or a curtailment of the benefits payable by the scheme.
These are recognised at the earlier of when the terms of the scheme are amended or the curtailment occurs or, where applicable, when the Group recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits: Net interest on the net defined benefit liability asset: this is determined by applying the discount rate applied to the defined benefit obligation for the period to the net defined benefit liability asset, and results in a net interest expense income: The administration costs of operating the pension schemes.
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability asset recognised in other comprehensive income comprises actuarial gains and losses as a result of changes in assumptions and experience adjustments in the calculation of the defined benefit obligation, and return on scheme assets excluding interest.
The most significant of these is the selection of the discount rate used to calculate the defined benefit obligation, details of which are set out in note 38.
Goodwill Goodwill is the difference between the cost of a business acquisition and the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is initially capitalised in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost and is subsequently recognised at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
The cost of the acquisition is the amount of cash paid and the fair value of other purchase consideration.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are valued at cost less accumulated amortisation, and less any accumulated impairment losses.
Other intangible assets comprise renewal rights, customer lists, brands, computer software and other acquired identifiable nonmonetary assets without physical form.
The useful economic lives are generally between one and five years and are estimated considering relevant metrics such as customer retention rates, contract length, and forecast period to technological obsolescence.
The asset is amortised on a straight-line basis across this period.
Internally developed computer software The Group capitalises internal and external computer software development costs where the software is separately identifiable: the Group has control over the software: and where it can be demonstrated that they provide future economic benefits for the Group through facilitating revenue or improved processes.
The costs capitalised includes administrative and other general overhead expenditure when they can be directly attributed to the software development and preparing it for use.
The useful economic life of externally acquired and internally generated software is normally estimated to be between three and seven years.
Further information on goodwill and other intangibles can be found in note 22.
116 RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets and internally developed computer software Goodwill and intangible assets not yet available to use are subject to an impairment test on an annual basis.
Other intangible assets, which includes internally generated software, are reviewed for indications of impairment on an annual basis and are subject to an impairment test only if there is an indication of impairment.
Goodwill, other intangible assets and internally developed computer software are allocated to cash generating units CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
When testing for impairment, the recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
Further information on how the value in use is calculated can be found in note 22.
Where the carrying amount is more than the recoverable amount, impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Impairment losses previously recognised on other intangible assets may be reversed in subsequent periods provided that the revised carrying amount does not exceed the value that would have been determined net of amortisation had no impairment loss been recognised.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Assets and liabilities held for sale Assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale if it is considered highly probable that the carrying amount of the assets and directly associated liabilities will be recovered principally through a sale, rather than through continuing operations.
This includes the expectation that the sale will be completed within 12 months of the classification date as held for sale, subject to extension in certain circumstances, including where disposals have been committed to subject to regulatory and legal approval.
Assets and liabilities held for sale are each presented as a single line in the statement of financial position, at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Where the asset or liability comprises a separate business operation e. g. a subsidiary, an associate or a branch, the assets including any goodwill allocated to the business and the directly associated liabilities of the business are considered together as one disposal group.
In the period when assets are recognised as held for sale on the face of the consolidated statement of financial position for the first time, the comparative prior period is not re-presented.
Further information can be found in note 6 ii.
Discontinued operations and business disposal A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has either been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operation.
The profit from discontinued operations is shown separately on the face of the income statement as a single amount.
It comprises the profit or loss after tax from discontinued operations together with the gain or loss after tax recognised on completed sales or the gain or loss after tax on the discontinued operations arising from revaluing the carrying value of a held for sale operation to its fair value less costs to sell.
Further information can be found in note 6 i.
In the period in which an operation is first classified as discontinued, the consolidated income statement, statement of other comprehensive income, statement of cash flows, earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for the comparative prior period is re-presented to present those operations as discontinued.
In circumstances where the Group is entering into an arrangement to make a legal transfer of a significant book of business, which includes an interim economic transfer of risk to the intended acquirer prior to obtaining court approval for the transfer, the accounting gain or loss arising from the reinsurance is considered as being incremental to the disposal and is consequently presented as a gain or loss arising from the disposal of the business.
Reorganisation costs Reorganisation costs represent external and clearly identifiable internal costs that are necessarily incurred and directly attributable to the Groups restructuring programme.
The aim of the restructuring programme is to both reduce operating costs and improve profitability.
Employee termination costs are only recognised when they are part of a restructuring programme that has been communicated to those affected or when a detailed plan of redundancies is announced.
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognised when action is taken by the Group as part of a restructuring programme that reduces any remaining benefit expected under a contract to below its remaining unavoidable costs.
