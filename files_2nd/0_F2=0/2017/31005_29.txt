Group financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 31 December 2017 1 General information Synthomer plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The address of the registered office is given on the inside back cover.
The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in pounds sterling functional currency of the parent company.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
New and amended standards adopted by the Group No new standards have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2017.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2017 reporting period and have not been early adopted by the Group.
The Groups assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and fide-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets.
This standard is mandatory for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2018.
The Group has reviewed its financial assets and liabilities and expects there to be no material impact arising from the adoption of the new standard on 1 January 2018.
As disclosed in note 23, the Groups only financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables, which will continue to be held at amortised cost.
There will be no impact on the Groups accounting for financial liabilities, as the new requirements only affect the accounting for financial liabilities that are designated as fair value through profit or loss, and the Group does not have any such liabilities.
The Group has confirmed that its current hedging relationships will continue to qualify as hedges upon the adoption of IFRS 9.
The new impairment model requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected credit losses, rather than only incurred credit losses as is the case under IAS 39.
The Group does not expect any material movement in the loss allowance for trade receivables on the adoption of IFRS 9.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The IASB has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue.
This will replace IAS 18 which covers contracts for goods and services and IAS 11 which covers construction contracts.
The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of agood or service transfers to a customer.
The standard also requires entities to apportion revenue earned from contracts to individual performance obligations, based on a five-step model.
The Group has performed a detailed assessment at all major sites, and as a result has concluded that no material impact is expected ontheaccounting of revenue in the Group.
No material separate performance obligations are expected, and no material adjustment is anticipated to the pattern of revenue recognition.
Further work is being done to identify any potential increased disclosure requirements.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016.
For lessees, it will result in almost all leases being recognised on the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed.
Under the new standard, an asset the right-to-use the leased item and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised.
The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases.
This standard is mandatory for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2019.
At this stage, the Group does not intend to adopt the standard before its effective date.
The standard will primarily affect the accounting for the Groups operating leases, and the Group has undertaken a review to identify all leases in each entity.
As at the reporting date, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of 34.7m see note 33.
However, the Group has not yet assessed what other adjustments are required, for example because of the change in definition of lease term, and the treatment of extension and termination options.
Moreover, the standard offers various transitional arrangements which may have an impact on the adjustments required.
As the various options are still being considered to establish which is right for the Group, an estimate has not yet been made for the amount of right-to-use assets and lease liabilities that will have to be recognised on adoption of the new standard, and how this may affect the Groups income statement and classification of cash flows going forward.
There are no other standards that are not yet effective and that would be expected to have a material impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 99 Group financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 December 2017 2 Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU, IFRS Interpretations Committee and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments at fair value through the Income Statement.
As discussed in the Report of the Directors on page 87, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below and have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company itssubsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returnsfromits involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
The results of joint ventures are accounted for using equity accounting.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination see below and the non-controlling interests share of changes in equity since the date of combination.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed forimpairment at least annually at the cash generating unit level.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Should the fair value of the identifiable assets exceed the cost of acquisition, a Bargain purchase, the excess is credited to the income statement immediately on acquisition.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
100 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Group financial statements Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of completion of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 2008 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes: liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits: and assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that standard.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during themeasurement period see below, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirers previously held investment is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date: any gains or losses from such re-measurement are recognised in the income statement.
Acquired intangible assets Intangible assets acquired through acquisition are measured at their fair value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, on the following bases: Customer relationships between 5 and 14 years Technology 10 years Where necessary the fair value at acquisition and estimated useful lives for these intangible assets are based on independent valuationreports.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are not acquired through a business combination are initially measured at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of between 3 and 5 years.
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Groups product development is recognised only if all of the following conditions inIAS 38 are met: an asset is created that can be separately identified such as software and new processes : it is technically feasible to complete the asset: management intends to complete the development: there is an ability to use or sell the asset once development has been completed: it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development are available: and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
No research or development costs met the criteria required for capitalisation under IAS 38 during the year.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 101 Group financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 December 2017 2 Significant accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Cost comprises original purchase price and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use, including, where appropriate, capitalised finance costs.
Except for freehold land, which is not depreciated, the cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold land and buildings the lesser of 50 years and the period of the lease Plant and equipment between 3 and 10 years Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until the assets are ready for their intended use.
Joint ventures Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Groups share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its plant, property and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of theasset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that areindependent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of theasset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Operating leases Operating lease payments are expensed on a straight-line basis to the income statement over the term of the relevant lease.
Any benefits received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the weighted average method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Loans and receivables Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
All trade receivables that are factored by third parties are done so on a non-recourse basis.
At the point of factoring, the Group forfeits the right to future cash flows from these receivables and those amounts are derecognised.
The cost of factoring receivables is recognised as afinance cost in the period in which the receivable is factored.
102 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Group financial statements Amortised costs Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Impairment of financial assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its financial assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Finance costs Finance costs of debt are recognised in the income statement over the term of such instruments at an effective interest rate on the carrying amount.
Finance costs that are directly attributable to the construction of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets in accordance with IAS 23.
Foreign currencies In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts see below for details of the Groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the relevant average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs as sterling-denominated assets and liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of directors, which provide written principles onthe use of financial derivatives, as set out in note 23.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and foreign currency options.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fairvalue at each balance sheet date.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency risk of firm commitments cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Hedge accounting The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, embedded derivatives and non-derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, as either cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 103 Group financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 December 2017 2 Significant accounting policies continued Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and isrecognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity in the foreign currency translation reserve.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement, and is included in the other gains and losses line.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks which become fully liquid within three months or less and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities inthefinancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using thebalance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred taxassetsare recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differencescan be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
104 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Group financial statements Retirement benefit costs Current and past service costs in respect of the Group's defined benefit pension schemes are charged to the consolidated income statement.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
Actuarial gains on the defined benefit schemes are recognised in full in each period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside of the consolidated income statement and are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
The UK defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the Group, in separate trusteeadministered funds.
For the German schemes, the assets are included within the assets of the respective companies, as permitted under local laws.
The assets of the other overseas schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Provisions Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.
Revenue Recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Sales are recognised when products are delivered to the customer and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customers acceptance of the products.
Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped to the specified location, the risks of obsolescence andloss have been transferred to the customer, and either the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the group has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair valueat the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on astraight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Group will on occasion, at its own discretion, settle the share-based payments in cash rather than equity.
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 105 Group financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 December 2017 2 Significant accounting policies continued Definitions Operating profit Operating profit represents profit from continuing activities before financing costs and taxation.
EBITDA EBITDA is calculated as operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and Special Items as defined below.
Special Items The following are disclosed separately as Special Items in order to provide a clearer indication of the Groups underlying performance: Amortisation of acquired intangible assets: Impairment of non-current assets: Acquisition costs: Re-structuring and site closure costs: Fair value adjustment mark to market adjustments in respect of cross currency and interest rate derivatives used for hedging purposes where IAS 39 hedge accounting is not applied: Items of income and expense that are considered material, either by their size and or nature: and Tax impact of above items.
These Special Items are either irregular and therefore including them in the assessment of a segments performance would lead to a distortion of trends orare technical adjustments which ensure the Groups financial statements are in compliance with IFRS but do not reflect the operating performance of the segment in the year.
Underlying performance Underlying performance represents the statutory performance of the Group under IFRS, excluding Special Items.
Net cash borrowings Net cash borrowings represents cash and cash equivalents less short and long term borrowings, as adjusted for the effect of related derivative instruments, irrespective of whether they qualify for hedge accounting, non-recourse factoring arrangements and the inclusion offinancial assets.
Critical judgements in applying accounting policies The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations see below, that the Group has made in the process ofapplying the accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Recognition of deferred tax assets The Group activities give rise to significant potential deferred tax assets, particularly in respect of the UK pension liability, tax losses and accelerated capital allowances.
Determination of whether these assets should be recognised requires a high degree of management judgement and is dependent on managements ability to project future earnings from activities that may apply loss positions carried forward against future income taxes.
Valuation of goodwill and intangibles on acquisition Acquired intangibles IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations requires that goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised andincluded in intangible assets.
IFRS 3 revised also requires the identification of other intangible assets at acquisition.
The assumptions involved in valuing these intangible assets require the use of estimates and judgements, that may differ from the actual outcome.
These estimates and judgements cover future growth rates, expected inflation rates and the discount rate used.
Changing the assumptions selectedby management could significantly affect the allocation of the purchase price paid between goodwill and other acquired intangibles.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience andvarious other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis taking the current and expected future market conditions into consideration.
Post retirement benefit obligations Included in the actuaries calculation of the post retirement benefit obligations are a number of assumptions.
Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying value of the obligations.
These are shown in detail in note 26.
106 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Group financial statements Current tax liability and deferred tax The Group annually incurs significant amounts of income taxes payable to various jurisdictions around the world, and it also recognises significant changes in deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, all of which are based on managements interpretations of applicable laws, regulations and relevant court decisions.
The quality of these estimates is highly dependent upon managements ability to properly apply what can be very complex sets of rules and to recognise changes in applicable rules.
3 Special Items The Special Items are made up as follows: 2017 2016 Note m m Continuing operations Restructuring and site closure 11.6 5.2 Profit on sale of business 4.7 Sale of land 24 1.3 33.2 Gain on foreign exchange contracts relating to acquisition 13.1 Acquisition costs 2.3 4.3 Amortisation of acquired intangibles 16 31.0 27.0 Operating loss profit 43.6 14.5 Loss profit before taxation from continuing operations 43.6 14.5 Taxation 10 13.1 9.1 Loss profit for the year from continuing operations 30.5 23.6 The restructuring and site closure costs included 9.0m in relation to the post-acquisition integration of the PAC Dispersions business, withthe majority being attributable to the rationalisation of the Ribcourt France site.
A further 1.6m comprised the cost of an onerous lease on a site closed during 2017, while 0.8m comprised costs for the post-acquisition integration of Speciality Additives.
The profit on sale of business relates to the disposal of our South African business in 2016.
The profit on sale of land in 2017 related to a disposal of land in Hapton, UK.
The profit on sale of land in 2016 related to the disposal of tranches of Malaysian land.
The gain of 13.1m in 2016 resulted from foreign exchange contracts taken out as a hedge against the US dollar purchase consideration of the PAC Dispersions acquisition.
Acquisition costs were incurred in relation to Speciality Additives 2016: PAC Dispersions and for other potential acquisitions which will not occur, or have not occurred before the balance sheet date.
The amortisation of intangibles increased during 2017 due to a full year of amortisation for the 2016 PAC Dispersions acquisition, the intangibles acquired with Speciality Additives and due to foreign currency exchange rate movements.
4 Segmental analysis The Groups Executive Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, examines the Groups performance and has identified two reportable segments of its business: Europe and North America ENA These markets are well developed and are typically growing in line with GDP.
Asia and Rest of the World ARW These markets are characterised by growing at rates generally above GDP coupled with an increased penetration of more sophisticated products into wider uses.
The Executive Committee primarily uses Underlying operating profit, being operating profit before Special Items, to assess the performance of the operating segments.

To provide additional clarity on the ongoing trading performance of the Groups businesses, the management uses Underlying performance as an alternative performance measure to plan for, control and assess the performance of the segments.
Underlying performance differs from the IFRS measures as it excludes Special Items.
The definition of Special Items is shown in note 2 and has been consistently applied.
Special Items are either irregular, and therefore including them in the assessment of a segment's performance would lead to a distortion of trends, orare technical adjustments which ensure the Group's financial statements are in compliance with IFRS but do not reflect the operating performance of the segment in the year, or both.
Anexample of the latter is the amortisation of acquired intangibles, which principally relates to acquired customer relationships.
TheGroupincurs costs, which are recognised as an expense in the income statement, in maintaining these customer relationships.
TheGroupconsiders that the exclusion of the amortisation charge on acquired intangibles from Underlying performance avoids the potential double counting of such costs and therefore excludes it as a Special Item from Underlying performance.

The key assumptions for those discounted cash flow calculations are the discount rate, profitability and growth rate.
The discount rate is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted, where appropriate, for the risk premium attributable to the particular CGUs activities and geography of operation.
Profitability and growth rates are based on past experience combined with managements expectations for future business performance, which is informed by a number of factors including economic growth, internal plans and competitor and customer activity.
116 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Group financial statements Pre-tax discount rates of 11% 2016: 11% and 12% 2016: 12% have been used in the above calculations for Europe & North America and Asia & Rest of the World respectively.
The profit used in the cash flows for the first five years is derived from management forecasts: for years six to ten a growth rate is applied.
Growth rates of 2% 2016: 2% and 2% 2016: 5% have been used for Europe & North America and Asia & Rest of the World respectively, representing managements best estimate of each CGUs circumstances, and these do not exceed the long term growth rates for the markets concerned.
The profit for year ten is then assumed to apply without further growth into perpetuity.
The directors consider that there is no reasonably possible change in key assumptions that would lead to an impairment.

Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flow at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
The carrying amount of short-term borrowings approximates to book value.
The fair value of the Groups financial instruments are measured using inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable, Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below, together with related disclosure required by IFRS.
Market risk The Groups main exposure to market risk is in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.
The policies adopted to address these risks are as follows: Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The Group monitors interest rate trends regularly, through discussion with its banks, and fixes interest rates when it is prudent to do so.
Foreign currency risk When it is efficient to do so, the Group uses currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge overseas net assets, which are predominantly denominated in Euro, US dollar and Malaysian Ringgit.
Profit translation exposures are not hedged.
The Group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Groups policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities.
Consequently, there are no material currency exposures to disclose 2016: none.

For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at thebalance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
The foreign currency sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation atthe period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans toforeign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the functional currency of the lender orborrower.
Liquidity risk The objective of the Group is to meet financial commitments as and when they fall due.
The Board closely monitors liquidity through monthly management accounts.

Malaysia The Group owns agricultural land in Malaysia, which is operated as a palm oil and natural rubber plantation.
The land is owned by Kind Action Sdn Bhd, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Revertex Malaysia Sdn Bhd, which has a 30% non-controlling interest.
The directors decided in 2013 to dispose of this land, excluding the 300 acres immediately surrounding the manufacturing facilities, on the open market.

Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 127 Group financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 December 2017 26 Post retirement benefit obligations Charge credit to income statement in respect of the Groups pension schemes: 2017 2016 UK Overseas Total UK Overseas Total m m m m m m Defined benefit 3.4 2.5 5.9 3.0 0.8 2.2 Defined contribution 1.7 4.7 6.4 1.6 7.7 9.3 5.1 7.2 12.3 4.6 6.9 11.5 The 2016 overseas column includes two offsetting one-off items.
Following a regulatory clarification by the authorities, employers in Germany are now required to provide for post retirement disability benefits in funded plans rather than in unfunded arrangements.
The Group has complied with this by transferring this liability from its unfunded defined benefit plan to a multi-employer funded plan in which it participates.
Thelatter, although a defined benefit arrangement, is accounted for on a defined contribution basis as discussed below.
Although this transfer has no financial impact on the Group, IAS 19 results in a different accounting treatment for the transfer in the two plans.
The transfer out of the unfunded plan is treated as a past service credit under defined benefit accounting and as such is included as areduction of 3.9m in the overseas defined benefit charge above.
The transfer in to the funded plan increases the liabilities of this scheme by the same amount.
As this scheme is accounted on a defined contribution basis, this additional liability would not be reflected until additional contributions were made.
However, an actuarial valuation ofthis scheme has been performed in the year, which concluded that additional contributions were required to address underfunding.
Asa result the overseas defined contribution amount above includes an additional charge of 3.6m.

All pension benefits since that time are provided by way ofadefined contribution scheme.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the companies concerned.
Defined benefit scheme The UK defined benefit scheme is administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Company.
The trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme.
Thetrustees of the pension are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 6 April 2015 and updated to 31 December 2017 by a qualified actuary.
The Group is committed to a funding deficit recovery plan entered into following the 2015 valuation.
This valuation indicated a shortfall, when measured against the schemes technical provisions of 118.7m.
This shortfall is expected to be eliminated in eight years following thevaluation date.
As a result the Group is committed to paying contributions for the period 6 April 2015 to 5 April 2023, increasing from 14.0m for the year commencing 6 April 2015 to 18.2m for the year commencing 6 April 2022.
128 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Group financial statements The scheme is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Asset return risk The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if plan assets underperform this yield, this will increase the deficit.
The scheme holds a significant proportion of equities which areexpected to outperform corporate bonds on the long term while providing volatility and risk in the short term.
Interest rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase inthe value of the plans bond holdings.
Longevity risk The majority of the plans obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependants of scheme members widow and orphan benefits is re-insured by an external insurance company.
The major assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows: 2017 2016 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.00% 2.10% Rate of increase in pensions in deferment 2.00% 2.20% Discount rate 2.50% 2.70% Inflation assumption 3.10% 3.20% Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics.
These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at 65 as follows: 2017 2016 years years Retiring today: Males 87.2 87.6 Females 89.1 90.2 Retiring in 20 years: Males 88.7 89.5 Females 90.6 92.1 Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate and mortality.
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period assuming that all other assumptions are held constant: Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 1% Decrease increase by 63m Rate of mortality Increase by 1 year Increase by 18m The above sensitivities are based on a change of assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may have some correlation.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet.

The weighted average duration of the benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period is 16.5 years 2016: 16.5 years.
Contributions from the sponsoring companies are expected to be 15.5 million in 2018.
Overseas pension schemes The Group operates a number of smaller overseas pension and post-retirement schemes.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group, with the exception of the unfunded German schemes net liability 72.1m, 2016: 69.6m where in line with common practice, the assets are held within the respective companies.
130 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Group financial statements Defined benefit schemes The aggregated pension disclosure below for the overseas defined benefit schemes has been compiled from a number of actuarial valuations at 31 December 2017.
The largest of these schemes accounts for 68.5m 2016: 66.2m of the deficit at 31 December 2016.
The major assumption used in the actuarial valuation of this scheme are: 2017 2016 Rate of increase in salaries 3.00% 3.00% Rate of increase in pensions 1.75% 1.75% Discount rate 1.90% 1.90% Mortality assumptions: Theassumed life expectations on retirement at age 65 are: 2017 2016 years years Retiring today: Males 84.3 84.1 Females 88.3 88.2 Retiring in 20 years: Males 86.9 86.8 Females 90.8 90.7 The major assumptions used in the valuation of the other overseas schemes do not differ significantly from the above.

Regular contributions are payable to the scheme by each participating employer for new benefits accruing.
The assets of all participating employers are pooled, and contributions are calculated based on aggregated demographic experience, therefore sufficient information is not available to identify the Groups share of the assets on a consistent and reliable basis and the Group accounts forthe scheme on a defined contribution basis.
The Group expects to make regular contributions of 2.3m tothe scheme in 2018.
To the extent that there is underfunding in the scheme, deficit contributions are payable.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 4.70 2016: 3.56.
The weighted average fair value of the options at the measurement date granted during the year was 2.97 2016: 1.84.
The valuation wasbased on the following inputs and assumptions: 2017 2016 Weighted average share price 5.03 3.67 Option price Value of optionality nil nil Vesting assumption 59% 50% Given the option price is nil, the only circumstance in which a vested option will not be exercised is if the current share price is nil.
There is some value associated with the timing of when the exercise would be made but this is considered to be minimal and therefore this has not been modelled.
The vesting assumption is the estimate at the measurement date of the percentage of the options that will ultimately vest and is based on managements assessment of the likelihood of achievement of the performance criteria.
