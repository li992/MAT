145376 STC Back PRINT CIO 145376 STC Back V13 06 07 2017 17:32 Page 103 Note 16 Subsidiary and related undertakings Asset purchase and non-controlling interests The UK Department for Transport awarded the Virgin Trains East Coast rail franchise to the Group during the year ended 30 April 2015.
In connection with that award, a subsidiary company, Inter City Railways Limited, purchased all of the equity in East Coast Main Line Company Limited, the train operating company that now operates inter-city train services in the UK under the Virgin Trains East Coast rail franchise.
East Coast Main Line Company Limited held certain assets and liabilities at the date of purchase.
However, it did not constitute a business and so the purchase was accounted for by the Group as an asset purchase rather than as a business combination.
The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Group based on their fair values.
The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net liabilities assumed was recognised as an intangible asset, being the cost of the right to operate the franchise.
Inter City Railways Limited is the one subsidiary in which a third party has a material non-controlling interest.
The Group holds 90% of the equity and voting rights in Inter City Railways Limited.
Both Inter City Railways Limited and East Coast Main Line Company Limited are incorporated in the UK.
The Virgin Group of companies holds the other 10% of the equity and voting rights of Inter City Railways Limited and may also receive a royalty fee from East Coast Main Line Company Limited that varies depending on the revenue and profit of that company.
The Group has contractual arrangements with the Virgin Group in respect of the business.
However, the Group may appoint a majority of the directors of Inter City Railways Limited and appoint the executive management of East Coast Main Line Company Limited.
Also, the Group is responsible for the day-to-day management of the business, the Managing Director of the business reports directly to the Managing Director of the Groups UKRail Division, and so the Group has the power to direct the activities of the entity.
The Group therefore accounts for Inter City Railways Limited and East Coast Main Line Company Limited as subsidiaries.
The loss for the year ended 29 April 2017 allocated to the non-controlling interest is shown on the consolidated income statement.
The accumulated non-controlling interest as at 29 April 2017 is shown on the consolidated balance sheet and the movement in that interest in the year including any dividends paid to non-controlling interests is shown in the consolidated statement of movements in equity.
At least 75% of the distributable profit of Inter City Railways Limited should be distributed to its shareholders within four months of each financial year-end subject to retaining sufficient cash to meet any obligations under rail franchise agreements.
Both shareholders in Inter City Railways Limited need to agree to any changes to or deviations from that dividend policy.
Under the terms of its rail franchise agreement, East Coast Main Line Company Limited may only pay dividends and or repay loans from other Group companies to the extent it remains compliant with certain financial ratios specified in the franchise agreement.
This could restrict it from making distributions or repaying loans that would be otherwise permitted by company law.
East Coast Main Line Company Limited is also prohibited from loaning money to other Group companies without the prior consent of the UK Department for Transport.
Such restrictions on dividends and loans generally apply to all entities operating train services under UK rail franchise agreements, including two of Stagecoach Groups other subsidiaries, Stagecoach South Western Trains Limited and East Midlands Trains Limited.
The Group may be required to loan further amounts to East Coast Main Line Company Limited pursuant to the committed loan facilities shown in note 30 iii.
