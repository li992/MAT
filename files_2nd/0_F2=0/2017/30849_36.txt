Additional Information: Glossary Glossary Alternative Performance Measures Throughout this report, the Group uses a number of Alternative Performance Measures APMs : measures that are not required or commonly reported under International Financial Reporting Standards, the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP under which the Group prepares its financial statements.
These APMs are used by the Group, alongside GAAP measures, for both internal performance analysis and to help shareholders and other users of the Annual Report and financial statements to better understand the Groups performance in the period in comparison to previous periods and the Groups competitors.
The table below defines and explains the primary APMs used in this report.
Financial APMs are usually derived from financial statement items and are calculated using consistent accounting policies to those applied in the financial statements, unless otherwise stated.
Non financial KPIs incorporate information that cannot be derived from the financial statements but provide further insight into the performance and financial position of the Group.
APMs may not necessarily be defined in a consistent manner to similar APMs used by the Groups competitors.
They should be considered as a supplement rather than a substitute for GAAP measures.
Turnover Turnover is defined as total premiums written as below and other revenue.
It is reconciled to financial statement line items in note 12a to the financial statements.
This measure has been presented by the Group in every Annual Report since it became a listed Group in 2004.
It reflects the size of the revenue generated by the Group and analysis of this measure over time provides a clear indication of the size and growth of the Group.
The measure was developed as a result of the Groups business model.
The core UK Car insurance business has historically shared a significant proportion of the risks with Munich Re, a third party insurance Group, through a co-insurance arrangement, with the arrangement subsequently being replicated in some of the Groups international insurance operations.
Premiums and claims accruing to the external co-insurer are not reflected in the Groups income statement and therefore presentation of this metric enables users of the Annual Report to see the scale of the Groups insurance operations in a way not possible from taking the income statement in isolation.
Total Premiums Total premiums written are the premiums written within the Group, including co-insurance.
It is reconciled to financial Written statement line items in note 12a to the financial statements.
It reflects the total premiums written by the Groups insurance intermediaries and analysis of this measure over time provides a clear indication of the growth in premiums, irrespective of how co-insurance agreements have changed over time.
The reasons for presenting this measure are consistent with that for the Turnover APM noted above.
Groups share of Groups share of profit before tax represents profit before tax, excluding the impact of Non-controlling Interests.
It is Profit before Tax reconciled to statutory profit before tax in note 12d to the financial statements.
This measure is useful in presenting the limit of the Groups exposure to the expenditure incurred in starting up new businesses and demonstrates the test-and-learn strategy employed by the Group to expansion into new territories.
In 2016, Groups share of Profit before Tax is presented on a Pre Ogden and a Post Ogden basis.
Pre Ogden represents the Groups share of estimated profit before tax before the impact of the reduction in the UK Ogden discount rate confirmed by the Lord Chancellor in February 2017.
Underwriting result For each insurance business an underwriting result is presented showing the segment result prior to the inclusion of profit or loss profit commission, other income contribution and instalment income.
It demonstrates the insurance result, i. e. premium revenue and investment income less claims incurred and insurance expenses.
152 Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Introduction Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Loss Ratio Reported loss ratios are expressed as a percentage of claims incurred divided by net earned premiums.
There are a number of instances within the Annual Report where adjustments are made to this calculation in order to more clearly present the underlying performance of the Group and operating segments within the Group.
The calculations of these are presented within note 12b to the accounts and explanation is as follows.
UK reported motor loss ratio: Within the UK insurance segment the Group separately presents motor ratios, i. e. excluding the underwriting of other products that supplement the car insurance policy.
The motor ratio is adjusted to i exclude the impact of reserve releases on commuted reinsurance contracts and ii exclude claims handling costs that are reported within claims costs in the income statement.
International insurance loss ratio: As for the UK motor loss ratio, the international insurance loss ratios presented exclude the underwriting of other products that supplement the car insurance policy.
The motor ratio is adjusted to exclude the claims element of the impact of reinsurer caps as inclusion of the impact of the capping of reinsurer claims costs would distort the underlying performance of the business.
Group loss ratios: Group loss ratios are reported on a consistent basis as the UK and international ratios noted above.
Adjustments are made to i exclude the impact of reserve releases on commuted reinsurance contracts, ii exclude claims handling costs that are reported within claims costs in the income statement and iii exclude the claims element of the impact of international reinsurer caps.
Expense Ratio Reported expense ratios are expressed as a percentage of net operating expenses divided by net earned premiums.
The calculations of these are presented within note 12c to the accounts and explanation is as follows.
UK reported motor expense ratio: Within the UK insurance segment the Group separately presents motor ratios, i. e. excluding the underwriting of other products that supplement the car insurance policy.
The motor ratio is adjusted to i include claims handling costs that are reported within claims costs in the income statement and ii include intra-group aggregator fees charged by the UK price comparison business to the UK insurance business.
International insurance expense ratio: As for the UK motor loss ratio, the international insurance expense ratios presented exclude the underwriting of other products that supplement the car insurance policy.
The motor ratio is adjusted to i exclude the expense element of the impact of reinsurer caps as inclusion of the impact of the capping of reinsurer expenses would distort the underlying performance of the business and ii include intra-group aggregator fees charged by the overseas price comparison businesses to the international insurance businesses.
Group expense ratios: Group expense ratios are reported on a consistent basis as the UK and international ratios noted above.
Adjustments are made to i include claims handling costs that are reported within claims costs in the income statement, ii include intra-group aggregator fees charged by the Groups price comparison businesses to the Groups insurance businesses and iii exclude the expense element of the impact of international reinsurer caps.
Combined Ratio Reported combined ratios are the sum of the loss and expense ratios as defined above.
Explanation of these figures is noted above and reconciliation of the calculations are provided in notes 12b and 12c.
Return on Equity Return on equity is calculated as profit after tax for the period attributable to equity holders of the Group divided by the average total equity attributable to equity holders of the Group in the year.
This average is determined by dividing the opening and closing positions for the year by two.
The relevant figures for this calculation can be found within the Consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Group Customers Group customer numbers are the total number of cars, households and vans on cover at the end of the year, across the Group.
It reflects the size of the Groups customer base and analysis of this measure over time provides a clear indication of the growth.
It is also a useful indicator of the growing significance to the Group of the different lines of business and geographic regions.
Effective Tax Rate Effective tax rate is defined as the approximate tax rate derived from dividing the Groups profit before tax by the tax charge going through the income statement.
It is a measure historically presented by the Group and enables users to see how the tax cost incurred by the Group compares over time and to current corporation tax rates.
