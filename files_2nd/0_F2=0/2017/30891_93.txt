Pensions The primary pension arrangement is a funded final salary pension plan in the UK under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity.
This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated directors, four company-nominated directors, an independent director, and an independent chairman nominated by the company.
The trustee board is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan.
The plan is closed to new joiners but remains open to ongoing accrual for current members.
New joiners are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.
The level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
During 2017 the aggregate level of contributions was $509 million 2016 $539 million.
The aggregate level of contributions in 2018 is expected to be approximately $483 million, and includes contributions we expect to be required to make by law or under contractual agreements, as well as an allowance for discretionary funding.
For the primary plan there is a funding agreement between the company and the trustee.
On an annual basis the latest funding position is reviewed and a schedule of contributions covering the next five years has been agreed.
The funding agreement can be terminated unilaterally by either party with two years notice.
Contractually committed funding therefore represents seven years of future contributions, which amounted to $2,623 million at 31December2017, of which $106 million relates to past service.
The surplus relating to the primary pension plan is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that the company is entitled to a refund of any remaining assets once all members have left the plan.
The obligation and cost of providing the pension benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method.
The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31December2017.
The principal plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years in the UK.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the primary pension plan was as at 31 December 2014, and a valuation as at 31 December 2017 is currently under way.
The material financial assumptions used to estimate the benefit obligations of the plans are set out below.
The assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year, and are used to evaluate accrued pension benefits at 31December and pension expense for the following year.

Pensions continued The discount rate assumption is based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and we use yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments.
The inflation rate assumption is based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest longterm government bonds.
The inflation assumption is used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions.
The assumption for the rate of increase in salaries is based on our inflation assumption plus an allowance for expected long-term real salary growth.
This includes an allowance for promotion-related salary growth of 0.7%.
In addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions.
The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the UK, and have been chosen with regard to applicable published tables adjusted to reflect the experience of the plans and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future.
For the primary pension plan the mortality assumptions are as follows: Mortality assumptions Years 2017 2016 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 60 27.4 28.0 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40 29.0 30.0 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60 28.8 29.5 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40 30.5 31.9 The assets of the primary plan are held in a trust, the primary objective of which is to accumulate assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the plan.
The assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.
A significant proportion of the assets are held in equities, owing to a higher expected level of return over the long term of such assets with an acceptable level of risk.
In order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios are highly diversified.
The trustees long-term investment objective for the primary UK plan as it matures is to invest in assets whose value changes in the same way as the plan liabilities, in order to reduce the level of funding risk.
To move towards this objective, the plan uses a liability driven investment LDI approach for part of the portfolio, investing in government bonds to achieve this matching effect for the most significant plan liability assumptions of interest rate and inflation rate.
This is partly funded by short-term sale and repurchase agreements, whereby the plan borrows money using existing bonds as security and which will be bought back at a specified price at an agreed future date.
The funds raised are used to invest in further bonds to increase the proportion of assets which match the plan liabilities.
The borrowings are shown separately in the analysis of pension plan assets in the table below.
The primary UK pension plan has an agreement with the trustee to increase the proportion of assets included in the LDI portfolio over time by reducing the proportion of plan assets held as equities and increasing the proportion held as bonds.
During 2017, the plan switched 15% of plan assets from equities to bonds.
The companys asset allocation policy for the primary plan is as follows: Asset category % Total equity including private equity 43 Bonds cash including LDI 50 Property real estate 7 The amounts invested under the LDI programme by the primary UK pension plan as at 31December2017 were $2,588 million 2016 $423 million of government-issued nominal bonds and $16,177 million 2016 $9,384 million of index-linked bonds.
In addition, the primary plan has entered into interest rate swaps in the year to offset the long-term fixed interest rate exposure for $1,333 million 2016 $4,450 million of the corporate bond portfolio.
At 31December2017 the fair value liability of these swaps was $49 million 2016 $144 million fair value liability and is included in other assets in the table below.
The primary plan does not invest directly in either securities or property real estate of the company or of any subsidiary.
The fair values of the various categories of assets held by the defined benefit plans at 31December are presented in the table below, including the effects of derivative financial instruments.
Movements in the fair value of plan assets during the year are shown in detail in the table on page 226.
