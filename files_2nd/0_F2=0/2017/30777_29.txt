Notes to the consolidated financial statements Year ended 31 December 2017 1.
Alternative performance measures APMs Bodycote uses various APMs, in addition to those reported under IFRS, as management believe these measures enable users of the financial statements to assess the underlying trading performance of the business.
The APMs used include headline operating profit, headline profit before taxation, EBITDA, headline EBITDA, headline earnings per share EPS, headline operating cash flow, free cash flow, net cash and return on capital employed ROCE.
These measures reflect the underlying performance of the business as they exclude the impact of amortisation of acquired intangible assets and exceptional items.
The Group also uses revenue growth percentages adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange movements, where appropriate, also to better represent the underlying performance of the business.
The measures described above are also used in the targeting process for executive and management annual bonuses headline operating profit, operating cash-flow and share schemes headline operating profit, headline operating cash flow, ROCE, headline EPS.
The constant exchange rate comparison uses the current year reported segmental information, stated in the relevant functional currency, and translates the results into its presentational currency using the prior years monthly exchange rates.
APMs are defined and reconciled to the IFRS statutory measure as follows: Headline operating profit 2017 2016 m m Statutory operating profit 119.4 94.5 Add back: Amortisation of acquired intangibles 4.5 4.5 Acquisition costs 0.6 Headline operating profit 123.9 99.6 Headline profit before taxation 2017 2016 m m Profit before taxation 117.0 91.9 Add back: Amortisation of acquired intangibles 4.5 4.5 Acquisition costs 0.6 Headline profit before taxation 121.5 97.0 EBITDA and Headline EBITDA Earnings Before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation, and Amortisation 2017 2016 m m Operating profit 119.4 94.5 Depreciation and amortisation 64.3 59.7 Impairment of fixed assets 0.4 5.1 Profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment 0.7 4.5 Profit on disposal of businesses 0.1 Share-based payments 7.8 0.5 EBITDA 191.2 155.2 Add back exceptional items: Acquisition costs 0.6 Headline EBITDA 191.2 155.8 Headline earnings per share A detailed reconciliation is provided in note 10.

Business and geographical segments The Group has 187 locations across the world serving a range of market sectors with various thermal processing services.
The range and type of services offered is common to all market sectors.
In accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the segmentation of Group activity reflects the way the Group is managed by the chief operating decision maker, being the Group Chief Executive, who on a monthly basis reviews the operating performance of six operating segments, split between the Aerospace, Defence & Energy ADE and Automotive & General Industrial AGI business areas, as follows: ADE Western Europe: ADE North America: ADE Emerging markets: AGI Western Europe: AGI North America: and AGI Emerging markets.
The split of operating segments by geography reflects the divisional reporting structure of the Group.
In accordance with the aggregation criteria of IFRS 8, the operating segments are aggregated into the Groups two key business areas, ADE and AGI, the split being driven by customer behaviour and requirements.
Customers in the ADE segment tend to operate and purchase more globally and have long supply chains, while customers in the AGI segment tend to purchase more locally and have shorter supply chains.
Bodycote plants do not exclusively supply services to customers of a given market sector.
Allocations of plants between ADE and AGI is therefore derived by reference to the preponderance of markets served.

Taxation 2017 2016 m m Current taxation charge for the year 28.1 24.9 Current taxation adjustments in respect of previous years 6.3 2.2 Deferred tax see note 19 2.1 2.2 19.7 24.9 The Group has chosen to use a weighted average country tax rate rather than the UK tax rate for the reconciliation of the charge for the year to the profit before taxation per the consolidated income statement.
The Group operates in several jurisdictions, many of which have a tax rate in excess of the UK tax rate.
As such, a weighted average country tax rate is believed to provide the most meaningful information to the users of the financial statements.
The appropriate tax rate for this comparison is 30.09% 2016: 32.36%.
As part of the calculation of the tax charge, the Group recognises a number of tax risk provisions in respect of ongoing tax inquiries and in recognition of the multinational tax environment that Bodycote operates in where the nature of the tax positions that are taken is often complex and subject to change.
The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit before taxation per the consolidated income statement as follows: 2017 2016 m m Profit before taxation 117.0 91.9 Tax at the weighted average country tax rate of 30.09% 2016: 32.36% 35.2 29.7 1 Tax effect of expenses not deductible in determining taxable profit 0.4 0.4 Impact of recognition or derecognition of deferred tax balances 1.4 2.1 2 Effect of long-term capital financing 0.7 1.0 Tax effect of other adjustments in respect of previous years: 3 Current tax 7.0 2.2 3 Deferred tax 4.3 0.6 2 Effect of financing activities between jurisdictions 9.2 7.2 Impact of trade and minimum corporate taxes 1.3 1.1 4 Impact of US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act treated as an exceptional item 6.4 Effect of changes in statutory tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities 0.1 1.2 Other tax risk provision movements 1.9 0.2 Tax expense for the year 19.7 24.9 Tax on items taken directly to equity is a credit of 0.5m 2016: 1.0m.
1 Those costs in various territories not deductible in calculating taxable profits.
2 The Group is externally financed by a mix of cash flows from operations, short-term borrowings, long-term loans and finance leases.
Internally, operating subsidiaries are predominantly financed via intercompany loans.
The charge includes provisions based on managements estimation of tax risk.
3 2017 prior year adjustments in current and deferred tax relate to changes in assumptions and outcomes in relation to overseas tax credits and other claims, whilst the 2016 adjustments mainly relate to changes in overseas pensions assumptions.
4 Net exceptional impact of the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the US in December 2017, made up of i 6.8m one-off tax gain resulting from a revaluation of the Groups US deferred tax liabilities, and ii 0.4m tax charge on accumulated overseas profits of US entities.

Goodwill 2017 2016 m m Cost At 1 January 222.5 200.6 Exchange differences 4.1 11.5 Recognised on acquisition of businesses 0.4 10.4 At 31 December 218.8 222.5 Accumulated impairment At 1 January 61.6 60.6 Exchange differences 0.4 1.0 At 31 December 61.2 61.6 Carrying amount 157.6 160.9 During the year a 0.4m hindsight adjustment was made to a 2016 acquisition.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the business units that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
After recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the Groups cash generating units, which are summarised in the following operating segments: 2017 2016 m m ADE: Western Europe 27.0 26.8 North America 47.5 49.0 AGI: Western Europe 24.1 23.1 North America 52.5 55.9 Emerging markets 6.5 6.1 157.6 160.9 The Group tests goodwill at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for those calculations are the discount rates and growth rates in respect of future cash flows.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash generating units.
This rate is risk adjusted, for specific countries, where the Group perceives a risk premium is appropriate.
The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows for cash generating units are between 11.7% 2016: 13.4% and 12.7% 2016: 14.4%.
The recoverable amount is the sum of the discounted cash flows as forecast for the coming five years, together with a further estimate of cash flows in perpetuity.
The forecast sales in the initial 5 years reflect managements expectation of how sales will develop at this point in the economic cycle.
This is based on the approved 2018 budget and a growth rate of up to 3% year on year.
The expected profit margin reflects managements experience of each cash generating units profitability at the forecast level of sales.
As outlined in the Business review, these forecasts take into account the current and expected economic environment both in respect of geography and market sectors.
Annual growth in cash flows after five years are in the range 2.4% to 5.4% depending on the geographical region of the cash generating unit and are based on historical weighted average growth in GDP in the respective geographies.

Goodwill continued If the goodwill allocated to a cash generating unit represents more than 15% of the Groups total goodwill carrying value, the cash generating unit is considered to be individually significant.
The Group considers the North America ADE Heat Treatment and North America AGI Heat Treatment cash generating units to be significant cash generating units.

An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the supply of services of 5.5m 2016: 7.2m.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

Other financial assets continued Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high creditratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Further disclosure of the Groups financial instrument risk management activities is set out in note 18.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 29.2m 2016: 21.9m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average credit terms offered to customers is 36 days, with a range from 14 days to 67 days.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a gross balance of 6.6m 2016: 10.2m.
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the expected proceeds.

The multi-currency drawings under this facility carry an interest rate of between 0.90% and 1.75% above LIBOR the applicable margin at 31 December 2017 was 0.90%.

The contracts are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
The unrecognised gains and losses were not significant in either 2017 or 2016.
In accordance with IFRS 7 Financial Instrument: Disclosures, the Groups financial instruments are considered to be classified as level 2 instruments.
Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liabilities, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.

Derivative financial instruments continued Fair value is determined using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
The Groups interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings fair value risk and floating rate borrowings cash flow risk.
From time to time the Group will use interest rate derivative contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements within Group policy.
However, at the balance sheet date, the Group had no interest rate derivative contracts.

Treasury activities have the objective of minimising risk and treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines reviewed and authorised by the Board.
The Group uses a number of derivative instruments that are transacted, for risk management purposes only, by specialist treasury personnel.
The use of financial instruments, including derivatives, is permitted when approved by the Board, where the effect is to minimise risk for the Group.
Speculative trading of derivatives or other financial instruments is not permitted.
There has been no significant change during the financial year, or since the end of the year, to the types or scope of financial risks faced by the Group.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group might not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
Liquidity risk arises as a result of mismatches between cash inflows and outflows from the business.
This risk is monitored on a centralised basis through regular cash flow forecasting, a three-year rolling strategic plan, an annual budget agreed by the Board each December and a quarterly re-forecast undertaken during the financial year.
To mitigate the risk, the resulting forecast net debt cash is measured against the liquidity headroom policy which, at the current net debt cash levels, requires committed facilities plus term loans in excess of one year to exceed net debt by 50% minimum facilities of 75m.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had a revolving credit committed borrowing facility of 230.0m 2016: 230.0m which, together with net cash of 39.6m 2016: 1.1m, resulted in available funds of 269.6m 2016: 231.1m.
The Group also uses uncommitted short-term bank facilities to manage short-term liquidity but these facilities are excluded from the liquidity headroom policy.
The Group manages longer-term liquidity through its committed bank facilities and will, if appropriate, raise funds on capital markets.
As at 31 December 2017 the Groups principal committed bank facility of 230.0m had a maturity date of 3 April 2022 4.3 years to maturity and had drawings of nil 2016: 5.0m.
Cash management pooling, netting and concentration techniques are used to minimise borrowings.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had gross cash of 41.0m 2016: 12.0m.
com 25695 19 March 2018 3:24 PM Proof 7 Additional information Financial statements Governance Strategic report Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2017 18.
Derivative financial instruments continued Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises on borrowings and cash balances and derivative liabilities and assets which are at floating interest rates.
Changes in interest rates could have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the Groups net profit.
Under the Groups interest rate management policy, the interest rates on each of the Groups major currency monetary assets and liabilities are managed to achieve the desired mix of fixed and variable rates for each major net currency exposure.
The major interest rate risk is to UK rates but exposures also exist to rates in the USA, Europe and Sweden.
Measurement of this interest rate risk and its potential volatility to the Groups reported financial performance is undertaken on a monthly basis and the Board uses this information to determine, from time to time, an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rates.
As at 31 December 2017, 0% of gross debt and 0% of gross cash were at fixed rates 2016: 0% of gross debt, 0% of gross cash.
Currency risk Bodycote has operations in 23 countries and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange translation risk when the profits and net assets of these entities are consolidated into the Group accounts.
92% of the Groups sales are in currencies other than sterling EUR 40%, USD 34% and SEK 6%.
Cumulatively over the year, sterling rates moved such that the sales for the year were 32.1m higher than if sales had been translated at the rates prevailing in 2016.
It is Group policy not to hedge exposure for the translation of reported profits.
The Groups balance sheet translation policy is not to actively hedge currency net assets.
However, where appropriate, the Group will still match centrally held currency borrowings to the net assets.
The Group principally borrows in sterling but also maintains debt in US Dollar, Euro and Swedish Krona, consistent with the location of the Groups assets.
The Group recognises foreign exchange movements in equity for the translation of net investment hedging instruments and balances.
Transaction foreign exchange exposures arise when entities within the Group enter into contracts to pay or receive funds in a currency different from the functional currency of the entity concerned.
It has been Group policy to hedge exposure to cash transactions in foreign currencies when a commitment arises, usually through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts.
Even though approximately 92% of the Groups sales are generated outside the UK, the nature of the business is such that cross border sales and purchases are limited and immaterial for the Group.
Market risk sensitivity analysis To represent managements best estimate of a reasonable range of potential outcomes, the Group has measured the estimated charge to the income statement and equity of either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1% 100 basis points in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies from the applicable rates as at 31 December 2017, for all financial instruments with all other variables remaining constant.
This analysis is for illustrative purposes only.
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations.
Interest rate sensitivity The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments: c hanges in mark et interest rates only af f ect the income st atement in relation to financial instr uments with fix ed interest if these are recognised at their fair value: and changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments.
Under these assumptions, a one percentage point fall or rise in market interest rates for all currencies in which the Group has variable net cash or net borrowings at 31 December 2017 would reduce or increase profit before tax by approximately 0.4m 2016: 0.1m decrease.
There is no significant impact on equity in the current or previous year.
Currency sensitivity Taking the 2017 sales by currency, a 10% weakening strengthening in the 2017 cumulative average rates for all currencies versus sterling would have given rise to a 70.9m -62.7m movement in sales respectively.
The impact on headline operating profit is affected by the mix of losses and profits in the various currencies.
However, taking the 2017 operating profit mix, a 10% weakening strengthening in 2017 cumulative average rates for all currencies would have given rise to a 14.0m -11.2m movement in headline operating profit.
Counterparty risk Counterparty risk encompasses settlement risk on derivative financial instruments and money market contracts and credit risk on cash, time deposits and money market funds.
The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings where applicable and through its policy, thereby limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure there is no significant concentration of credit risk.
Group policy is to enter into such transactions only with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of AA3 or better.
However, acquired businesses occasionally have dealings with banks with lower credit ratings.
Business with such banks is moved as soon as practicable.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 35.6m 2016: 46.3m available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 7.3m 2016: 14.0m of such losses, based on management forecasts of future taxable profits against which the assets can be recovered in the relevant jurisdictions.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 28.3m 2016: 32.3m of such losses where there remains uncertainty over the timing of utilisation relating to future profitability.
The majority of losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
A deferred tax liability of 0.5m 2016: nil relating to the temporary differences on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries has been recognised as the Group believes it is probable that these temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.

The Group provides for the costs of environmental remediation that have been identified, either as part of acquisition due diligence, or in other circumstances where remediation by the Group is required.
This provision is reviewed annually and is separated into restructuring environmental and environmental to identify separately environmental provisions relating to the restructuring programme from those arising in the ordinary course of business.
The majority of cash outflows in respect of these liabilities are expected to occur within five years.
Whilst the Groups use of chlorinated solvents and other hazardous chemicals continues to reduce, the Group remains exposed to contingent liabilities in respect of environmental remediation liabilities.
In particular, the Group could be subjected to regulatory or legislative requirements to remediate sites in the future.
However, it is not possible at this time to determine whether and to what extent any liabilities exist, other than for those recognised above.
Therefore no provision is recognised in relation to these items.

Acquisition of businesses On 20 December 2017, Bodycote acquired the thermal processing assets including hot isostatic pressing vessels and vacuum furnaces in Blaenavon, South Wales from Doncasters Group Limited for 8.7m.
As part of the acquisition, Bodycote entered into a long term agreement to provide Doncasters Group with their HIP and Heat Treatment requirements in the United Kingdom and the associated employees involved with the thermal processing assets have transferred to Bodycote.
Therefore, the transaction was treated as a business combination and with the consideration being assigned to the fair value of the thermal processing assets.
This is the only transaction during 2017.
In the prior year acquisitions were made to strengthen the Groups network and to enhance the process offering in Canada, USA and Germany.
The transactions have been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and are summarised below: 2017 m Fair value of net assets acquired: Property, plant and equipment 8.7 Total consideration 8.7 Satisfied by: Cash consideration 8.7 Net cash outflow arising on acquisition: Cash consideration 8.7 Prior year acquisitions had 6.5m of accrued consideration of which 5.5m has been paid in the current year.
The remaining is expected to be paid in the next 12 months.
During the year an adjustment was made to acquisitions completed in 2016.
The adjustments are outlined in the table below: 2017 m Fair value adjustment Property, plant and equipment 0.6 Trade and other receivables 0.4 Trade and other payables 0.1 Deferred tax liabilities 0.7 Goodwill 0.4 Acquisition-related costs reported in exceptional items in note 5 amounted to nil 2016: 0.6m.
The acquired businesses contributed nil revenue and nil operating profit for the period between the dates of acquisition and the balance sheet date due to the fact the acquisition was so close to year end.
If the acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenue would have been 693.5m and Group headline operating profit attributable to equity holders of the parent, stated prior to Group management charges, would have been 124.0m.

Share-based payments Bodycote Incentive Plan BIP The Company operates the BIP under which Executive Directors and senior executives received a conditional award of Bodycote shares up to a maximum of 175% of base salary.
Vesting of awards are based upon two performance measures, over a three year period.
Fifty per cent of the award is subject to a return on capital employed ROCE performance condition and 50% of the award is subject to an earnings per share EPS performance condition.
In the event that threshold performance for both EPS and ROCE is not achieved none of the conditional awards will vest.
The number of outstanding share awards is as follows: BIP BIP 2017 2016 At 1 January 2,060,570 2,003,996 Granted during the year 759,058 896,894 Exercised during the year 90,533 745,089 Expired during the year 522,808 95,231 At 31 December 2,206,287 2,060,570 Average fair value of share awards granted during the year at date of grant pence 757.6 543.3 Fair value of awards granted during the year 5,750,623 4,873,094 Exercise Price nil.

Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for employees in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Canada and the United States of America.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the schemes prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the contributions payable by the Group are reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.
The Groups employees in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Italy and the Netherlands are members of state-managed retirement benefit schemes operated by the governments of each country.
The relevant subsidiaries are required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit schemes to fund the benefits.
The only obligation of the Group with respect to these retirement benefit schemes is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income of 6.7m 2016: 6.2m represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
As at 31 December 2017 contributions of 0.2m 2016: 0.2m due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operated a number of pension schemes and provided leaving service benefits to certain employees during the year.
The defined benefit obligation less fair value of assets at the end of the year and total expense recognised in the income statement are summarised below as follows: 2017 2016 m m UK Scheme 2.4 3.6 Non-UK Schemes 17.6 17.9 15.2 21.5 Total expense recognised in income statement 2017 2016 m m UK Scheme 1.1 0.8 Non-UK Schemes 0.4 0.1 1.5 0.9 UK Scheme The Group sponsors the Bodycote UK Pension Scheme the Scheme which is a funded defined benefit arrangement for certain UK employees, and pays out pensions at retirement based on service, final pensionable pay and price inflation.
The Scheme is funded by the Group and current employee members.
The Scheme exposes the Company to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
The Scheme operates under UK trust law and the trust is a separate legal entity from the Group.
The Scheme is governed by a board of trustees, composed of two member representatives, two employer representatives and one independent trustee.
The trustees are required by law to act in the best interests of scheme members and are responsible for setting certain policies e. g. investment, funding together with the Group.
Funding of the Scheme is based on a separate actuarial valuation for funding purposes for which the assumptions may differ from the assumptions above.
Funding requirements are formally set out in the Statement of Funding Principles, Schedule of Contributions and Recovery Plan agreed between the Trustees and the Group.
The actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 6 April 2017 was completed by a qualified independent actuary and the results of this have been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2017.
The contributions made by the employer over the financial year have been 0.7m, comprising 0.3m in respect of benefit accrual and 0.4m in respect of deficit recovery and ongoing expenses.
It is the policy of the Group to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur outside of the profit and loss account and in Other Comprehensive Income.
As the Group does not have an unconditional right to a return of any surplus in the Scheme under the wording of the Scheme Rules, the additional reporting requirements of IFRIC14 apply.
As the Scheme is in surplus as at 31 December 2017 a restriction must be applied to the balance sheet.
The surplus recognised on the balance sheet has been restricted to 2.4m.
No further liabilities need to be recognised at 31 December 2017 as the Group is not committed to paying any further deficit reduction contributions under the current Schedule of Contributions.

The LDI portion of assets has been put in place to reduce interest rate and inflation risk.

This has been recognised as a settlement of the assets and liabilities in the Metallurgical scheme with an offsetting past service credit and cost in the non-Meterallurgical scheme.
Overall there is no net impact on the total expense recognised in the income statement in the year due to the merger of the US schemes.

Contingent liabilities The international tax environment has received increased attention and seen rapid change over recent years, both at a US and European level, and by international bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD.
Against this backdrop, Bodycote has been monitoring developments and continues to engage transparently with the tax authorities in the countries where we operate.
In October 2017, the European Commission opened a state aid investigation into the Group Financing Exemption in the UK controlled foreign company rules.
The Group Financing Exemption was introduced in legislation by the British government in 2013.
In common with other UK-based international companies whose arrangements are in line with current UK CFC legislation, Bodycote may be affected by the outcome of this investigation.
If the preliminary findings of the European Commissions investigation into the UK legislation are upheld, we calculate the maximum potential liability to be approximately 15m.
Based on a current assessment, Bodycote believes that no provision is required in respect of this matter.
