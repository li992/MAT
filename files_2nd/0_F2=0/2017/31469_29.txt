Exemptions In accordance with section 408 3 of the Companies Act 2006, the company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement.
The company has taken advantage of certain disclosure exemptions in FRS 101, in part because its financial statements are included in the publicly-available consolidated financial statements of G4S plc.
These disclosure exemptions relate to: the requirements of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: the statement of compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union: new IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective and which have not been applied by the company: comparative information for the movements from the beginning to the end of the year in respect of intangible assets and certain other additional comparative information: information on the assumptions used in the determination of fair value and recoverable amounts of cash-generating units containing goodwill and managements approach to determining these amounts: financial instruments disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: certain related-party disclosures on key management compensation and transactions entered into between two or more whollyowned members of a Group: and capital management disclosures.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provisions for impairment.
The accounting policy for impairments is disclosed in note 3 j to the consolidated financial statements.
Amounts owed by to Group undertakings Amounts owed by to Group undertakings are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Finance income and expense are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
Impairment of financial assets The company provides for impairments in financial assets when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that impact the estimated future cash flows of the financial assets.
204 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 179 Financial report Share-based payments The company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value of equity settled share-based payments is determined at the date of grant and is either expensed or capitalised as an investment in the relevant subsidiary, with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the companys estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
The amount expensed or capitalised is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, save for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions.
The company also issues cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees, which are recognised as a liability at fair value at the date of grant.
The value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the date on which the liability is settled.
The fair value of cash settled share-based payments is expensed in the income statement if it relates to employees of the company and capitalised as an investment in the relevant subsidiary if it relates to employees of a subsidiary company.
Financial guarantees The company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group.
The company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
The company therefore treats such contracts as a contingent liability unless and until such time as it becomes probable that the company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.

The source of the market prices is Bloomberg and in addition the third-party relationship counterparty banks.
The relevant currency yield curve is used to forecast the floating-rate cash flows anticipated under the instrument, which are discounted back to the reporting date.
This value is compared to the original transaction value, giving a fair-value of the instrument at the reporting date.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach and using inputs based on observable market data.
Judgment is used to determine the relevant inputs, currency yield curves and discount rates.
Although these judgments, estimates and associated assumptions are based on managements best knowledge of current events and circumstances, the actual results may differ.
Currency risk and cross-currency swaps The Group conducts business in many currencies.
The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in Sterling and as a consequence is subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The company, together with its subsidiary G4S International Finance plc, hedges a substantial portion of the Groups exposure to fluctuations in the translation into Sterling of the Groups overseas net assets by holding loans in foreign currencies and cross-currency swaps.
On consolidation, translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans and changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swaps meeting hedge accounting criteria are recognised in equity to match translation adjustments on foreign currency equity investments as they qualify as net-investment hedges.
However, in the companys own financial statements, translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in the income statement and are in part hedged by cross-currency swaps.
Cross-currency swaps with a nominal value of 25m are outstanding.
These swaps were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on US$50m of the second US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively fixing the Sterling value on this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.9750.
These swaps will mature in July 2018.
182 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 207 Notes to the parent company financial statements continued i Derivative financial instruments continued Interest-rate risk and interest-rate swaps Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the company to fair value interest-rate risk, which the company manages within policy limits approved by the directors.
When fixed floating interest-rate debt in the preferred mix is unavailable directly from investors, interest-rate swaps are utilised to create the desired blend in accordance with Treasury policy, with the proportion of fixed interest rate held reducing on a sliding scale over forward periods up to a maximum of five years.
The quantity of interest-rate swaps outstanding in the Company is expected to continue to decline as treasury activity is increasingly conducted by G4S International Finance plc.
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fixed-rate market, with investors preferring a fixed-rate return over the life of the loan notes.
At the time of the first issue in March 2007, the Group was comfortable with the proportion of floating-rate exposure not hedged by interest-rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of fixed-rate debt it arranged fixed-to-floating swaps, effectively converting the fixed coupon on the Private Placement to a floating rate.
Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement is LIBOR 60bps.
These swaps have been documented as fair-value hedges of the US Private Placement fixed-interest loan notes, with the movements in their fair value posted to profit and loss at the same time as the movement in the fair value of the hedged item.
The swaps with a nominal value of US$200m matured in 2017 with the remainder of US$145m maturing in 2019 and US$105m maturing in 2022.
The interest on the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, and on the 350m public notes issued in May 2009, was initially kept at fixed rate.
In April 2014, the interest rate on 44m of the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, and on all of the 350m public notes issued in May 2009, was swapped from fixed to floating for a period of three years using derivatives.
The 350m public notes have a coupon step-up of 1.25%, which is triggered should the credit rating of the company fall below investment grade.
j Retirement benefit obligations The company is the sponsoring company for the Groups UK defined benefit pension scheme, to which it provides a guarantee over all payments to be made to the scheme by the operating companies.

k Deferred tax assets The reconciliation of deferred tax assets is as follows: Retirement Other Intangible benefit Share-based temporary Total assets obligation payments Tax losses differences m m m m m m At 1 January 2017 1 57 2 58 118 Credit charge to the income statement 6 9 2 13 Credit to equity 8 1 7 Charge to equity change in tax rate 1 1 At 31 December 2017 1 44 2 49 3 99 At 1 January 2016 36 1 6 43 Credit charge to the income statement 1 1 58 6 54 Credit to equity 24 24 Charge to equity change in tax rate 3 3 At 31 December 2016 1 57 2 58 118 At 31 December 2017, the company had unutilised tax losses of approximately 271m 2016: 298m potentially available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset of 49m 2016: 58m has been recognised in respect of approximately 271m 2016: 298m of gross losses based on expected forecast profitability from approved budgets and business plans.
The recognition of deferred tax assets on tax losses is predicated on the projected generation of income in the company which should result in the utilisation of the available tax losses within a foreseeable period.
This income stream is driven by the current and future global results of the Group in line with business plans.
The timing of recognition of the tax losses as a deferred tax asset in 2017 was supported by the improved profit profile of the company, which itself is underpinned by the continuing progress of the Groups transformation strategy to generate future sustainable, profitable growth.
As at 31 December 2017, the company has capital losses available to carry forward of approximately 2.5bn 2016: 0.14bn.
These losses have no expiry date and have not been agreed with the relevant tax authorities.
No deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of these losses on the basis that the likelihood of their future utilisation is considered to be remote.
