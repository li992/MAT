Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Company Financial Statements 26.
Accounting Policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements.
Basis of Preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost accounting rules.
Information regarding the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position is set out in the Financial Review on pages 26 to 29 and the Risks and Uncertainties section on pages 18 to 22.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 26 to 29.
In addition, Note 21 to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: a Cash Flow Statement and related notes: comparative period reconciliations for share capital, tangible fixed assets and intangible assets: disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries: disclosures in respect of capital management: the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs: an additional Balance Sheet for the beginning of the earliest comparative period following the retrospective change in accounting policy: and disclosures in respect of the compensation of Key Management Personnel.
Investments In the Companys financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Impairment The Group evaluates its investments for financial impairment where events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.
When such evaluations indicate that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable value, an impairment in value is recorded.
Deferred Taxation Deferred tax is recognised using the Balance Sheet method, providing temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all temporary differences except as otherwise required by IAS 12.
Share-Based Payment Transactions The share options programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an addition to fixed asset investments with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using an evaluation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Share appreciation rights are also granted by the Company to employees.
The fair value of the amount payable to the employee is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities.
The fair value is initially measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.
The fair value of the share appreciation rights is measured based on an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
The liability is remeasured at each Balance Sheet date and at settlement date and any changes in fair value recognised in profit and loss spread equally over the vesting period.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its subsidiarys financial statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
Amounts recharged to or reimbursed bythe subsidiary are recognised as a reduction in the cost of investment in the subsidiary.
Own Shares Held by Employee Benefit Trust EBT Transactions of the Group sponsored EBT are included in the Group financial information.
In particular, the trusts purchase ofshares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
