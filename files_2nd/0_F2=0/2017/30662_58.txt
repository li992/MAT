Financial instruments Classi cation and measurement Accounting policy The Group classi es its financial assets into the following measurement categories: financial assets held at fair value through pro t or loss: loans and receivables: held-to-maturity: or available-for-sale.
Financial liabilities are classi ed as either held at fair value through pro t or loss or at amortised cost.
Management determines the classi cation of its financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition.
The following details the approach for the categories: a Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through pro t or loss: This category has two sub-categories: Financial assets and liabilities held for trading: A financial asset or liability is classi ed as held for trading if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term, or forms part of a portfolio of financial instruments which are managed together and for which there is evidence of short-term pro t-taking or is a derivative excluding qualifying hedging relationships Designated at fair value through pro t or loss: Financial assets and liabilities may be designated at fair value through pro t or loss when: The designation eliminates or signi cantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities on a different basis for example, the Group may designate certain xed rate loans and receivables that are managed with derivative interest rate swaps A group of financial assets and or liabilities is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis for example, the Group may designate issued debt to fund a portfolio of trading assets and liabilities that are all managed on a fair value basis The assets or liabilities include embedded derivatives and such derivatives are required to be recognised separately b Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and it is expected that apart from credit deterioration substantially all of the initial investment will be recovered.
