Investment property continued Investment properties are valued using a capitalisation methodology applying a yield to current and estimated rental income.
Yields and rental values are considered to be unobservable inputs and details of the ranges used in each region are as follows: Information about fair value measurements using unobservable inputs Level 3 Fair value at Rent per sq m Yield 31 December 2017 Min Max Min Max m % % Belgium 14.5 25.7 108.2 3.0 9.7 France 17.2 29.5 29.5 8.3 8.3 UK Industrial properties 760.0 10.8 178.0 2.5 15.6 UK Offices 16.4 23.1 625.7 3.0 17.6 Total 808.1 Fair value at Rent per sq m Yield 31 December 2016 Min Max Min Max m % % Belgium 17.0 27.2 90.5 6.5 9.4 France 17.7 28.6 31.7 8.6 12.7 Germany 761.7 15.2 109.4 1.3 17.5 Netherlands 264.7 11.6 79.0 3.7 22.0 UK Industrial properties 646.4 6.1 158.4 1.8 14.4 UK Offices 20.4 23.1 625.7 3.1 19.1 Total 1,727.9 Everything else being equal, there is a positive relationship between rental values and the property valuation, such that an increase in rental values will increase the valuation of a property and vice versa.
However, the relationship between capitalisation yields and the property valuation is negative: therefore an increase in capitalisation yields will reduce the valuation of a property and vice versa.
There are interrelationships between these inputs as they are determined by the market conditions, and the valuation movement in any one period depends on the balance between them.
If these inputs move in opposite directions i. e. rental values increase and yields decrease valuation movements can be amplified, whereas if they move in the same direction they may be offset, reducing the overall net valuation movement.
The valuation movement is materially sensitive to changes in yields and rental values however it is impractical to quantify these changes.
