Financial statements Financial statements of the group: Risk management and capital structure DIAGEO ANNUAL REPORT 2017 129 This section sets out the policies and procedures applied Risk to manage the groups capital structure and the financial management risks the group is exposed to.
Diageo considers the and capital following components of its balance sheet to be capital: borrowings and equity.
Diageo manages its capital structure structure to achieve capital efficiency, provide flexibility to invest through the economic cycle and give efficient Introduction access to debt markets at attractive cost levels.
Financial instruments and risk management Accounting policies Financial assets and liabilities are initially recorded at fair value including any directly attributable transaction costs.
For those financial assets that are not subsequently held at fair value, the group assesses whether there is evidence of impairment at each balance sheet date.
The group classifies its financial assets and liabilities into the following categories: loans and receivables, available-for-sale investments, financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss and other financial liabilities at amortised cost.
The accounting policies for available-for-sale investments and loans are described in note 12, for trade and other receivables in note 14 and for cash and cash equivalents in note 16.
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include derivative assets and liabilities.
Where financial assets or liabilities are eligible to be carried at either amortised cost or fair value the group does not apply the fair value option.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value using a discounted cash flow technique based on market data applied consistently for similar types of instruments.
Gains and losses on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are taken to the income statement as they arise.
Other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost unless they are part of a fair value hedge relationship.
The difference between the initial carrying amount of the financial liabilities and their redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the contractual terms using the effective interest rate method.
Hedge accounting The group designates and documents certain derivatives as hedging instruments against changes in fair value of recognised assets and liabilities fair value hedges, highly probable forecast transactions or the cash flow risk from a change in exchange or interest rates cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations net investment hedges.
The effectiveness of such hedges is assessed at inception and at least on a quarterly basis, using prospective and retrospective testing.
Methods used for testing effectiveness include dollar offset, critical terms, regression analysis and hypothetical derivative method.
Fair value hedges are used to manage the currency and or interest rate risks to which the fair value of certain assets and liabilities are exposed.
Changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognised in the income statement, along with any changes in the relevant fair value of the underlying hedged asset or liability.
If such a hedge relationship is fide-designated, fair value movements on the derivative continue to be taken to the income statement while any fair value adjustments made to the underlying hedged item to that date are amortised through the income statement over its remaining life using the effective interest rate method.
Cash flow hedges are used to hedge the foreign currency risk of highly probable future foreign currency cash flows, as well as the cash flow risk from changes in exchange or interest rates.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income, while any ineffective part is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are recycled to the income statement in the same period in which the underlying foreign currency or interest exposure affects the income statement.
Net investment hedges take the form of either foreign currency borrowings or derivatives.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation of net investments are recorded in other comprehensive income and included in the exchange reserve.
Liabilities used as hedging instruments are revalued at closing exchange rates and the resulting gains or losses are also recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that they are effective, with any ineffectiveness taken to the income statement.
Foreign exchange contracts hedging net investments are carried at fair value.
Effective fair value movements are recognised in other comprehensive income, with any ineffectiveness taken to the income statement.

The groups exposure to foreign Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of board approved policies and guidelines, which are recommended and currency risk arising on forecasted transactions is managed using monitored by the finance committee, chaired by the Chief Financial forward agreements.
The policies and guidelines include benchmark exposure b Interest rate risk and or hedge cover levels for key areas of treasury risk which are periodically reviewed by the Board following, for example, significant The group has an exposure to interest rate risk, arising principally business, strategic or accounting changes.
The framework provides on changes in US dollar, euro and sterling interest rates.
To manage for limited defined levels of flexibility in execution to allow for the interest rate risk, the group manages its proportion of fixed to floating rate borrowings within limits approved by the Board, optimal application of the Board approved strategies.
Transactions arising from the application of this flexibility are carried at fair value, primarily through issuing fixed and floating rate borrowings and gains or losses are taken to the income statement as they arise and commercial paper, and by utilising interest rate derivatives.
These are separately monitored on a daily basis using Value at Risk analysis.

To facilitate operational efficiency In the year ended 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2016 gains and losses on these transactions were not material.
The group does not use and effective hedge accounting, the groups policy is to maintain derivatives for speculative purposes.
All transactions in derivative fixed rate borrowings within a band of 40% to 60% of forecast net financial instruments are initially undertaken to manage the risks borrowings.
For these calculations, net borrowings exclude interest rate related fair value adjustments.

Financial statements Financial statements of the group: Risk management and capital structure DIAGEO ANNUAL REPORT 2017 131 d Market risk sensitivity analysis The group uses a sensitivity analysis that estimates the impacts on the consolidated income statement and other comprehensive income of either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 0.5% in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies, from the rates applicable at 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2016, for each class of financial instruments with all other variables remaining constant.
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market risks on the net post employment benefit liability and corporate tax payable.
This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice interest and foreign exchange rates rarely change in isolation.
The sensitivity analysis estimates the impact of changes in interest and foreign exchange rates.
All hedges are expected to be highly effective for this analysis and it considers the impact of all financial instruments including financial derivatives, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and other financial assets and liabilities.
The results of the sensitivity analysis should not be considered as projections of likely future events, gains or losses as actual results in the future may differ materially due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table below.

ii The impact on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income includes the impact on the income statement.
e Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the group.
Credit risk arises on cash balances including bank deposits and cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and credit exposures to customers, including outstanding loans, trade and other receivables, financial guarantees and committed transactions.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the groups exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date as disclosed in section i, excluding the impact of any collateral held or other credit enhancements.
Credit risk is managed separately for financial and business related credit exposures.
Financial credit risk Diageo aims to minimise its financial credit risk through the application of risk management policies approved and monitored by the Board.
Counterparties are predominantly limited to major banks and financial institutions, primarily with a long term credit rating within the A band or better, and the policy restricts the exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits taking into account the credit quality of the counterparty.
The groups policy is designed to ensure that individual counterparty limits are adhered to and that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Board also defines the types of financial instruments which may be transacted.
The credit risk arising through the use of financial instruments for currency and interest rate risk management is estimated with reference to the fair value of contracts with a positive value, rather than the notional amount of the instruments themselves.
When derivative transactions are undertaken with bank counterparties, the group may, where appropriate, enter into certain agreements with such bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral for the benefit of the other if the net valuations of the derivatives are above a predetermined threshold.
At 30 June 2017, the collateral held under these agreements amounted to $96 million 74 million and nil million nil million 2016 $104 million 78 million and 73 million 61 million.
Diageo annually reviews the credit limits applied and regularly monitors the counterparties credit quality reflecting market credit conditions.
Business related credit risk Loan, trade and other receivables exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer.
There is no significant concentration of credit risk with respect to loans, trade and other receivables as the group has a large number of customers which are internationally dispersed.
f Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that Diageo may encounter difficulties in meeting its obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or other financial assets.
The group uses short term commercial paper to finance its day-to-day operations.
The groups policy with regard to the expected maturity profile of borrowings is to limit the amount of such borrowings maturing within 12 months to 50% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits, and the level of commercial paper to 30% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits.
In addition, the groups policy is to maintain backstop facilities with relationship banks to support commercial paper obligations.
The following tables provide an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash flows including interest payable for the groups financial liabilities and derivative instruments on an undiscounted basis.
Where interest payments are on a floating rate basis, rates of each cash flow until maturity of the instruments are calculated based on the forward yield curve prevailing at 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2016.
The gross cash flows of cross currency swaps are presented for the purposes of this table.
All other derivative contracts are presented on a net basis.
Financial assets and liabilities are presented gross in the statement of financial position, although in practice, the group uses netting arrangements to reduce its liquidity requirements on these instruments.

j Capital management The groups management is committed to enhancing shareholder value in the long term, both by investing in the businesses and brands so as to deliver continued improvement in the return from those investments and by managing the capital structure.
Diageo manages its capital structure to achieve capital efficiency, provide flexibility to invest through the economic cycle and give efficient access to debt markets at attractive cost levels.
This is achieved by targeting a net borrowing to EBITDA leverage of 2.5 3.0 times, this range for Diageo being currently broadly consistent with an A band credit rating.
Diageo would consider operating outside of this range in order to effect strategic initiatives within its stated goals, which could have an impact on its rating.
If Diageos leverage was to be negatively impacted by the financing of an acquisition, it would seek over time to return to the range of 2.5 3.0 times.
The group regularly assesses its debt and equity capital levels against its stated policy for capital structure.
For this calculation net borrowings are adjusted by the pension deficit whilst EBITDA equals operating profit excluding exceptional operating items and depreciation, amortisation and impairment and includes share of after tax results of associates and joint ventures.
