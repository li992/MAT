Amendments to IFRS 1: First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards and IAS 28: Investments in associates and joint ventures.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated Financial Statements are set out below and in the Management has established and progressed separate projects Supplementary Information note S2.
Unless otherwise stated, these to oversee the implementation of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 and further policies have been consistently applied to the years presented.
IFRS 9 a Basis of preparation The Group will apply IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018.
The The consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in implementation of IFRS 9 has been split into three parts, accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS representing the areas of change from the new financial instrument adopted by the European Union EU and therefore comply with standard.

available-for-sale financial assets, financial instruments designated at Classification and measurement fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition, and the assets of IFRS 9 applies one classification approach for all types of financial the Groups defined benefit pension schemes that have been assets.
Two criteria are used to determine how financial assets measured at fair value: the liabilities of the Groups defined benefit should be classified and measured, namely, the entitys business pension schemes that have been measured using the projected unit model for the financial assets and the contractual cash flow credit valuation method: and the carrying values of recognised assets characteristics of the financial assets.
IFRS 9 identifies three and liabilities qualifying as hedged items in fair value hedges that categories of financial assets: amortised cost: fair value through have been adjusted from cost by the changes in the fair values other comprehensive income FVOCI and: fair value through profit attributable to the risks that are being hedged.
The Groups business units have reviewed their The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS, as financial instruments under the revised IFRS 9 classification and adopted by the EU, requires the use of certain critical accounting measurement rules.
The classification of debt financial instruments, estimates.
It requires management to exercise its judgement in the predominantly held by Treasury, that are currently classified as process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas available-for-sale and measured at FVOCI will be FVTPL under involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity and areas IFRS 9.
The value of these items can be seen in note S6 a.

The conclusion of these reviews is that the adoption of Management does not currently expect the future application of the IFRS 15, which is effective from 1 January 2018, will not have a Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle to have material impact on the recognition of revenue compared to current a material impact on the amounts reported and disclosed in the accounting standards.
This is for the following reasons: consolidated Financial Statements.
a significant amount of the Groups revenue is outside the scope Not endorsed by the EU of IFRS 15.
For example, a portion of our UK Home services The Group has not applied the following standards and revenue is from fixed fee service contracts, which are currently amendments in the consolidated Group Financial Statements within the scope of IFRS 4: Insurance contracts and the sale of as they are not yet effective and they have not been endorsed by much of the Groups asset production for example, the majority the EU: of our Exploration & Production gas production, Central Power Generation gas fired power station production and sales of IFRS 17: Insurance contracts, effective from 1 January 2021: power received from the Groups associate investment in IFRIC Interpretation 22: Foreign currency transactions and Nuclear is sold in the market via the Groups Energy Marketing advance consideration, effective from 1 January 2018: & Trading segment through contracts that are in the scope of IFRIC Interpretation 23: Uncertainty over income tax treatments, IFRS 9: effective from 1 January 2019: for the majority of energy supply contracts, because there are no Amendments to IFRS 2: Classification and measurement minimum quantities whereby the Group delivers the amount of of share-based payment transactions, effective from energy required by customers on demand, it has been 1 January 2018: concluded that there is only an enforceable right to bill for consumption once the customer consumes energy.

ii In the Exploration & Production segment, net impairments of assets have been booked relating to the net decreases in value of certain UK, Dutch and Norwegian gas and oil fields pre-tax impairments 494 million, post-tax 162 million: including a PRT credit of 207 million, predominantly due to a reduction in long-term price forecasts, reserves and changes to expected decommissioning costs following the conclusion of the triennial review.
Also included is the reduction of decommissioning provisions pre-tax 86 million, post-tax 51 million for assets previously impaired through exceptional items.
iii A pre-tax impairment of 270 million post-tax 224 million has been recorded in the current year in respect of the UK Rough gas storage asset, following the June 2017 announcement to apply for a production licence and permanently end Roughs status as a storage facility.
iv On 17 February 2017, the Group disposed of its joint venture investment in Lincs Wind Farm for net proceeds of 214 million, giving rise to a pre-tax gain on disposal of 64 million post-tax 58 million.
On 31 August 2017, the Group disposed of its Langage, South Humber Bank and Kings Lynn B power station assets for net proceeds of 314 million, giving a pre and post-tax loss of 7 million.
These power station assets were originally classified as held for sale as at 30 June 2017 and a net pre-tax write-back of 15 million post-tax 12 million was recognised.
v On 27 May 2017, the Group disposed of its remaining portfolio of gas assets in Trinidad and Tobago for consideration of US$35 million 26 million giving rise to a pre and post-tax loss on disposal of 9 million.

viii Included within net taxation is a 21 million credit associated with the leased Spalding CCGT power station, previously impaired through exceptional items.
b Certain re-measurements Certain re-measurements are the fair value movements on energy contracts entered into to meet the future needs of our customers or to sell the energy produced from our upstream assets.
These contracts are economically related to our upstream assets, capacity off-take contracts or downstream demand, which are typically not fair valued, and are therefore separately identified in the current period and reflected in business performance in future periods when the underlying transaction or asset impacts the Group Income Statement.

EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS AND CERTAIN RE-MEASUREMENTS c Impairment accounting policy, process and sensitivities The Group tests the carrying amounts of goodwill, PP&E and intangible assets with the exception of exploration assets see note S2 for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amounts may be lower than their carrying amounts.
Interests in joint ventures and associates and exploration assets are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment and tested for impairment where such an indicator arises.
Where an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use VIU and fair value less costs of disposal FVLCD.
At inception, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups CGUs or groups of CGUs that expect to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Any impairment is expensed immediately in the Group Income Statement.
Any CGU impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU.
The impairment tests for the Exploration & Production gas and oil assets and CGUs including goodwill, the Groups associate investment in Nuclear and the Storage PP&E asset, have used FVLCD to determine their recoverable amounts.
This methodology is deemed to be appropriate for these assets and CGUs as it is based on the post-tax cash flows arising from the underlying assets and is consistent with the approach taken by management to evaluate the economic value of the underlying assets.
VIU calculations have been used to determine recoverable amounts for all other CGUs that include goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
UK power generation assets have also been valued using the VIU impairment methodology.
Further details of the approach and assumptions used in the VIU calculations are provided in note S2.
FVLCD discount rate and cash flow assumptions The price assumptions used to determine recoverable amounts for FVLCD calculations are based on the liquid market prices for the three year period, 2018 to 2020.
The longer-term price assumptions thereafter are derived using valuation techniques based on available external data and with reference to market comparators.
The average price for the period 2018 to 2022 was 45p per therm for NBP Gas, US$65 per barrel for Brent and 43 per MWh for Baseload Power all in real terms thereafter nominal prices are broadly inflated.
The valuation of the Groups portfolio of assets is more sensitive to NBP Gas and Baseload Power prices than to Brent.
Exploration & Production assets A net impairment of 408 million 2016: write-back 79 million has been recorded within exceptional items for retained Exploration & Production assets net of 86 million of reductions to decommissioning provisions.
For those assets subject to the net impairment, the associated recoverable amounts net of decommissioning costs of 401 million are categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
FVLCD is determined by discounting the post-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the gas and oil production and development assets, net of associated selling costs, taking into account those assumptions that market participants would use in estimating fair value.
Post-tax cash flows are derived from projected production profiles of each field, taking into account forward prices for gas and liquids over the relevant period.
Where forward market prices are not available that is outside the active period for each commodity, prices are determined based on internal model inputs.
Note S6 provides additional detail on the active period of each of the commodity markets in which the Group operates.
The date of cessation of production depends on the interaction of a number of variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, production costs, the contractual duration of the licence area and the selling price of the gas and liquids produced.
As each field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the post-tax cash flows for each field are computed using individual economic models.
Post-tax cash flows used in the FVLCD calculation for the first five years are based on the Groups Board-approved business plans and, thereafter, are based on long-term production and cash flow forecasts, which management believes reflects the assumptions of a market participant.
The future post-tax cash flows are discounted using a post-tax nominal discount rate of 8.5% 2016: 9.0% to determine the FVLCD.
The discount rate and inflation rate used in the FVLCD calculation are determined in the same manner as the rates used in the VIU calculations described in note S2, with the exception of the adjustment required to determine an equivalent pre-tax discount rate.
The valuation of Exploration & Production assets and goodwill are particularly sensitive to the price assumptions made in the impairment calculations.
To illustrate this, the price assumptions for gas and oil have been varied by 10%.
Changes in price generate different production profiles and in some cases the date that an asset ceases production.
This has been considered in the sensitivity analysis.
Otherwise, all other operating costs, life of field capital expenditure and abandonment expenditure assumptions remain unchanged.
For Exploration & Production assets, an increase in gas and oil prices of 10% would potentially reverse 148 million 2016: 89 million of previous post-tax impairment charges of the underlying exploration and production assets.
A reduction of 10% would potentially give rise to further post-tax impairments of the underlying legacy exploration and production assets of 140 million 2016: 166 million but no post-tax impairment of goodwill 2016: nil due to adequate headroom.
Storage The recoverable amount of the Groups storage facility Rough is calculated on a FVLCD basis by discounting the post-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
In June 2017, the Group announced that the Rough facility could not be safely returned to injection and storage operations and it therefore intended to make all relevant applications to permanently end Roughs status as a storage facility.
The Group received production consent on 15 January 2018, effective from 17 January 2018, to produce gas from the reservoir.
Since the cash generating unit that comprises the UK gas storage assets will continue to operate, the Storage business does not qualify as a discontinued operation under IFRS 5: Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations.
The cash flow estimates in the recoverable amount calculation have been based on the revenue from extracting the cushion gas less any related capital, operating and decommissioning expenditure.
The key assumptions in these estimates are forward gas prices, the timing of government consent for production, the amount of gas available and the rate of extraction.
Where forward market gas prices are not available, prices are determined based on internal model inputs.
The future post-tax cash flows are discounted using a post-tax nominal discount rate of 7.5% 2016: 7.5% to determine FVLCD.

EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS AND CERTAIN RE-MEASUREMENTS A pre-tax impairment charge of 270 million post-tax 224 million has been recorded within exceptional items in the current period.
The valuation of the recoverable amount of the asset is categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The carrying amount after this impairment amounts to a net liability position of 88 million, including the decommissioning provision and deferred tax.
The impairment test is particularly sensitive to price assumptions made in the impairment calculation.
To illustrate this, the price assumptions for gas and liquids have been varied by 10%.
An increase of 10% would potentially reverse impairments of 76 million.
A decrease of 10% would potentially give rise to a further impairment of 20 million.
Central Power Generation Nuclear No impairment charge has been recorded 2016: nil for the Groups associate investment in Nuclear.
FVLCD is determined by discounting the post-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the investment, net of associated selling costs, taking into account those assumptions that market participants would use in estimating fair value.
Post-tax cash flows are derived from projected production profiles of the underlying nuclear power stations, planned and unplanned outage assumptions, operating cost assumptions and forward prices for power and forecast capacity market auction prices.
Note S6 provides additional detail of the active period of each of the commodity markets in which the Group operates.
Post-tax cash flows used in the FVLCD calculations for the first five years are based on the Groups Boardapproved business plans and thereafter are based on long-term production and cash flow forecasts.
The future post-tax cash flows are discounted using a post-tax nominal discount rate of 7% 2016: 8% to determine the FVLCD.
The valuation of the Groups investment in Nuclear, which is categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, is particularly sensitive to assumptions variations in the power price.
To illustrate this, sensitivities were performed at the year end to vary the power price assumptions in the Groups internal valuation model by 10% and separately to vary the discount rate by 1%.
An increase in power prices of 10%, assuming all other assumptions remain constant, would result in a reversal of previous impairments of 477 million 2016: 444 million.
A reduction of 10% would give rise to an impairment charge of 442 million 2016: 461 million.
An increase in the discount rate of 1%, assuming all other assumptions remain constant, would result in an impairment charge of 125 million 2016: 138 million.
A decrease in the discount rate of 1% would result in an impairment write-back of 187 million 2016: 145 million.
NET FINANCE COST Financing costs mainly comprise interest on bonds and bank debt, the results of hedging activities used to manage foreign exchange and interest rate movements on the Groups borrowings, and notional interest arising on discounting of decommissioning provisions and pensions.
An element of financing cost is capitalised on qualifying projects.
Investment income predominantly includes interest received on short-term investments in money market funds, bank deposits, and government bonds.

TAXATION The taxation note details the different tax charges and rates, including current and deferred tax arising in the Group.
The current tax charge is the tax payable on this years taxable profits together with amendments in respect of tax provisions made in earlier years.
This tax charge excludes share of taxation on the results of joint ventures and associates.
Deferred tax represents the tax on differences between the accounting carrying values of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
These differences are temporary and are expected to unwind in the future.

ii An increased deferred PRT asset has been recognised, reflecting a reduction in long-term price forecasts and changes to expected decommissioning costs.
iii During the year, the US tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21%.
This has resulted in a 3 million charge to be recognised within the year due to a change to the net deferred tax assets at the date the rate changed.
iv A comprehensive review as part of business transformation activities in North America during 2016 enabled certain deferred tax balances to be adjusted.
v Total taxation on profit loss excludes taxation on the Groups share of profits of joint ventures and associates.
UK tax rates The Group earns the majority of its profits in the UK.
Most activities in the UK are subject to the standard rate for UK corporation tax, which for 2017 was 19.25% 2016: 20%.
Upstream gas and oil production activities are taxed at a UK corporation tax rate of 30% 2016: 30% plus a supplementary charge of 10% 2016: 10% to give an overall rate of 40% 2016: 40%.
In addition, certain upstream assets in the UK attract petroleum revenue tax PRT at 0% 2016: 0%, giving an overall effective rate of 40% 2016: 40%.
On 6 September 2016, the UK Government substantively enacted Finance Act 2016 which included a reduction in the main UK corporation tax rate to 17% from 1 April 2020.
At 31 December 2017, the relevant UK deferred tax assets and liabilities included in these consolidated Group Financial Statements were based on the reduced rate having regard to their reversal profiles.
Non-UK tax rates Norwegian upstream profits are taxed at the standard rate of 24% 2016: 25% plus a special tax of 54% 2016: 53% resulting in an aggregate tax rate of 78% 2016: 78%.
Profits earned in the US prior to 22 December 2017 were taxed at a Federal rate of 35% together with state taxes at various rates dependent on the state.
On 22 December 2017, the US enacted a reduction in the Federal rate to 21% effective from 1 January 2018.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 December 2017 were based on the reduced rate.
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rate prevailing in those respective jurisdictions, with rates ranging from 12.5% in the Republic of Ireland to 50% in the Netherlands.
The tax charges were not material in such jurisdictions.
Prior year adjustments reflect changes made to estimates or to judgements when further information becomes available.
Movements in deferred tax liabilities and assets are disclosed in note 16.
Tax on items taken directly to equity is disclosed in note S4.

TAXATION b Factors affecting the tax charge The Group is expected to continue earning the majority of its profits in the UK and accordingly considers the standard UK rate to be the appropriate reference rate.
The differences between the total taxation shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax to the profit loss before taxation are as follows: 2017 2016 Exceptional items Exceptional items Business and certain Results for Business and certain Results for performance re-measurements the year performance re-measurements the year Year ended 31 December m m m m m m Profit loss before taxation 901 759 142 1,167 1,019 2,186 Less: share of profits in joint ventures and associates, net of interest and taxation 51 28 23 130 28 102 Group profit loss before taxation 850 731 119 1,037 1,047 2,084 Tax on profit at standard UK corporation tax rate of 19.25% 2016: 20% 164 141 23 207 209 416 Effects of: Depreciation impairment on non-qualifying assets including write-backs 51 3 54 49 12 37 Non-taxable disposals 7 3 10 4 12 8 Other non-allowable non-taxable items 2 2 5 8 13 Higher rates applicable to upstream profits losses 149 96 53 61 1 60 Upstream investment incentives 43 43 22 22 UK petroleum revenue tax 34 124 158 3 3 i Non-UK tax rates 35 14 49 60 107 167 Movement in uncertain tax provisions 34 34 4 4 Movement in unrecognised deferred tax assets 2 4 6 14 13 27 Differences in deferred tax reversal rates 7 5 2 ii Changes to tax rates 34 37 3 21 45 66 iii Adjustments in respect of prior years 53 49 102 54 1 53 Taxation on profits losses 191 352 161 282 242 524 Less: movement in deferred tax 188 398 210 31 445 476 Total current tax 3 46 49 251 203 48 i Excludes additional non-UK tax applicable to upstream profits, notably in Norway.
ii Changes to tax rates on exceptional items and certain re-measurements includes a petroleum revenue tax charge of nil 2016: 90 million.
iii Excludes amounts included in movement in uncertain tax provisions that relate to prior years of 49 million credit 2016: 9 million charge.
The Group is subject to taxation in a number of jurisdictions.
The complexity of applicable rules may result in legitimate differences of interpretation between the Group and taxing authorities or between different taxing authorities especially where an economic judgement or valuation is involved.
Resolution of these differences typically takes many years.
The uncertain tax provisions represent multiple layers of estimation for different time periods and different jurisdictions.
The principal element relates to transfer pricing challenges in jurisdictions outside the UK.
While the Group applies the arms length principle to all intra-group transactions, taking OECD guidance into account, taxing authorities may take different views.
The outcome of resolving any disputes is not predictable: the provisions represent managements assessment of the most likely outcome of each issue.
The assessment is reviewed and updated on a regular basis.
c Factors that may affect future tax charges The Groups effective tax rates are impacted by changes to the mix of activities and production across the territories in which it operates.
Effective tax rates may also fluctuate where profits and losses cannot be offset for tax purposes, such as in the UK where there is generally no offset between upstream gas and oil and downstream results.
Losses realised in one territory cannot be offset against profits in another.
The Groups UK profits earned away from gas and oil production will benefit from reduced rates of corporation tax in 2018 and beyond 19% for 2018 and 2019, and 17% from 1 April 2020.
Profits from gas and oil production in the UK continue to be taxed at rates above the UK statutory rate 40% versus 19%.
PRT is now set at 0% but may still give rise to historic refunds from the carry-back of excess reliefs for example, from decommissioning.
Income earned in territories outside the UK, particularly in Norway, is generally subject to higher effective rates of tax than the current UK statutory rate.
US tax reform has reduced its Federal rate to 21% which will benefit the Groups effective rate assuming US profits continue.
Globally, tax reform has significant potential to change tax charges, particularly in relation to the OECDs Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS project, which has widespread support.
Based on current proposals, the Group does not expect its tax position to be impacted materially.

TAXATION Local tax laws and rates are subject to change, which may have a significant impact on the Groups future tax charges.
In the medium term, the Groups effective tax rate is expected to remain above the UK statutory rate, reflecting a continued upward trend in profits earned outside the UK.
The mix of upstream downstream activities across regimes continues to be influential on the effective tax rate.

Payments are made on account and the final liability is settled as the tax return is filed.
Fluctuations in profits from year to year, one-off items and mark-to-market movements within the year may therefore give rise to divergence between the charge for the year and the taxes paid.
In certain jurisdictions advance tax payments are required based on estimated tax liabilities which can result in overpayments.
These are included as tax assets, to be refunded in a subsequent period 2017 saw net refunds in the UK : and PRT refunds were based on income realised in the preceding period, with subsequent adjustments to reflect actual profits.
Following the reduction in the PRT rate to 0% from 1 January 2016, PRT cash movements are expected to reflect refunds, but on a less predictable basis.
EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE Earnings per share EPS is the amount of profit or loss attributable to each share.
Basic EPS is the amount of profit or loss for the year divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted EPS includes the impact of outstanding share options.
Basic earnings per ordinary share has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company for the year of 333 million 2016: 1,672 million by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 5,537 million 2016: 5,318 million.
The number of shares excludes 53 million ordinary shares 2016: 61 million, being the weighted average number of the Companys own shares held in the employee share trust and treasury shares purchased by the Group as part of the share repurchase programme.
The Directors believe that the presentation of adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, being the basic earnings per ordinary share adjusted for certain re-measurements and exceptional items assists with understanding the underlying performance of the Group, as explained in note 2.
In addition to basic and adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, information is presented for diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per ordinary share.
Under this presentation the weighted average number of shares used as the denominator is adjusted for potentially dilutive ordinary shares.

The Directors propose a final dividend of 8.40 pence per ordinary share totalling 470 million for the year ended 31 December 2017.
The dividend will be submitted for formal approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 14 May 2018 and, subject to approval, will be paid on 28 June 2018 to those shareholders registered on 11 May 2018.
Since 2015, the Company has offered a scrip dividend alternative to its shareholders.
191 million of the 459 million prior year final dividend was in the form of ordinary shares to shareholders opting in to the scrip dividend alternative.
The market value per share at the date of payment was 1.93 per share resulting in the issue of 99 million new shares and 185 million of share premium.
Similarly, 7 million of the 202 million interim dividend was taken as a scrip dividend.
The market value per share at the date of payment was 1.74 resulting in the issue of 4 million new shares and 7 million of share premium.
The Group has sufficient distributable reserves to pay dividends to its ultimate shareholders.
Distributable reserves are calculated on an individual legal entity basis and the ultimate parent company, Centrica plc, currently has adequate levels of realised profits within its retained earnings to support dividend payments.
Refer to the Centrica plc Company Balance Sheet on page 191.
On an annual basis, the distributable reserve levels of the Groups subsidiary undertakings are reviewed and dividends paid up the ownership chain to replenish Centrica plcs reserve levels.

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS a 2017 business combinations This section details business combinations made by the Group.
During the year, the significant acquisitions were of Bayerngas Norge which was combined with the Groups Exploration & Production business in a newly formed business, Spirit Energy, in which the Group has a controlling stake of 69% and REstore, a Distributed Energy & Power demand response aggregator.
The fair values of acquired assets and liabilities are provisional unless otherwise stated.
The purchase price allocation exercise requires management to make subjective judgements at the time control passes to the Group.
Bayerngas Norge Spirit Energy Limited is the newly formed business combining the Groups existing Exploration & Production business with that of Bayerngas Norge AS.
This transaction was completed on 8 December 2017 with the Group owning 69% of Spirit Energy and Bayerngas Norges former shareholders owning 31%.
The formation of Spirit Energy creates a strong and sustainable Exploration & Production business across the UK, Norway, the Netherlands and Denmark.
It combines the Groups cash generative and relatively near-term production profile with Bayerngas Norges more recently on-stream producing assets and development profile.
The new business will invest in the range of 400-600 million per annum to deliver sustainable medium term production of 45-55 mmboe.
The consideration for the acquisition is the 31% share of the value of the combined Exploration & Production business of Spirit Energy attributable to the noncontrolling interest that is provided in return for the Bayerngas Norge assets.
This value includes cash, the value of indemnities provided by both parties and promises to pay further cash to fund net decommissioning liabilities of certain gas and oil fields.
102 million of goodwill was recognised on acquisition which predominately relates to goodwill in relation to the deferred tax liabilities recognised on acquisition.
None of the goodwill is tax deductible.
REstore On 3 November 2017, the Group acquired 100% of REstore NVs demand response business for cash consideration of 62 million.
REstore provides key capabilities in energy optimisation and provides over 850MW of flexible power capacity to grid operators.
This power is aggregated from a 2.2GW flexible portfolio of industrial and commercial customers across Belgium, the UK, France and Germany, and generates value for businesses through ancillary services including frequency response and capacity markets.
The companys software and international patents are currently used by over 150 of Europes largest energy users.
The business is a strong fit with the fide&P business model and provides immediate capability to the division in terms of energy insight, asset optimisation and energy solutions to large energy users.
For this acquisition, the majority of the value is recognised as goodwill, which is reflective of the enhanced synergies, geographical presence, the assembled workforce and new and distinct capability in demand side response and management of battery equipment using a world class technology platform.
In addition, the existing order book and future margins on renewed contracts are both captured in the customer intangible asset.
53 million of goodwill was recognised on acquisition, none of which is tax deductible.
REstore reported under Belgian GAAP.
Upon review of Belgian GAAP versus IFRS no material accounting policy alignments have been identified.

Other acquisitions in the year, including Rokitt Inc. were immaterial and resulted in no goodwill being recognised.
Acquisition-related costs have been charged to operating costs before exceptional items in the Group Income Statement for an aggregated amount of 16 million.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL The Group Balance Sheet contains significant intangible assets.
Goodwill, customer relationships and brands arise when we acquire a business.
Goodwill is attributable to enhanced geographical presence, cost savings, synergies, growth opportunities, the assembled workforce and also arises from items such as deferred tax.
Goodwill is not amortised but is assessed for recoverability each year.
The Group uses European Union Allowances EUAs and Renewable Obligation Certificates ROCs to satisfy its related obligations.
Upstream exploration and evaluation expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset until development of the asset commences, at which point it is transferred to PP&E or is deemed not commercially viable and is written down.
ii The remaining amortisation period of material application software assets, which had a carrying value of 206 million 2016: 223 million, is between six and eight years.
iii Included within disposals retirements and surrenders are 226 million 2016: 86 million of gross assets that have been retired and have a net book value of zero.
iv Transfers to disposal groups held for sale in 2017 are in respect of the Canadian exploration and production business and the Langage and Humber CCGT power stations.
See note 12 d. v Amortisation of 1 million 2016: 7 million has been recognised in cost of sales before exceptional items and certain re-measurements, and 261 million 2016: 261 million has been recognised in operating costs before exceptional items.

Sensitivities to these assumptions for goodwill allocated to the Exploration & Production CGU are provided in note 7 c. The impairment tests for the Connected Home and Distributed Energy & Power CGUs did not result in any impairment.
These tests are dependent on these currently loss-making businesses becoming profitable in the future.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment to provide for tax that is expected to arise in the future as a result of differences in the accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities.
The principal deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised by the Group relate to capital investments, decommissioning assets and provisions, tax losses, fair value movements on derivative financial instruments, PRT and pensions.

ii Net decommissioning includes deferred tax assets of 1,233 million 2016: 1,300 million in respect of decommissioning provisions.
iii The losses arise principally from accelerated allowances for upstream investment expenditure, for which equivalent deferred tax liabilities are included under accelerated tax depreciation.
iv The deferred PRT amounts include the effect of deferred corporation tax as PRT is chargeable to corporation tax.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
The following is an analysis of the gross deferred tax balances and associated offsetting balances for financial reporting purposes: 2017 2016 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities 31 December m m m m Gross deferred tax balances 2,231 1,836 1,725 1,614 Offsetting deferred tax balances 1,663 1,663 1,369 1,369 Net deferred tax balances after offsetting for financial reporting purposes 568 173 356 245 Deferred tax assets arise principally on decommissioning provisions, trading losses carried forward, retirement benefit obligations and marked to market positions.
Forecasts indicate that there will be suitable taxable profits to utilise those deferred tax assets not offset against deferred tax liabilities.
Specific legislative provisions applicable to gas and oil production provide assurance that deferred tax assets relating to decommissioning costs and certain trading losses will be utilised.
At the balance sheet date the Group had certain unrecognised deductible temporary differences of 1,538 million 2016: 1,276 million, of which 1,538 million 2016: 1,073 million are carried forward tax losses available for utilisation against future taxable profits.
Some 98 million 2016: 313 million of these losses will expire within one to five years.
All other temporary differences have no expiry date.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these temporary differences, due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
At the balance sheet date, no taxable temporary differences existed in respect of the Groups overseas investments 2016: nil.
The deferred tax liability arising on these temporary differences is estimated to be nil 2016: nil.

TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES The provision for credit losses is based on an incurred loss model and is determined by application of expected default and loss factors, informed by historical loss experience and current sampling to the various balances receivable from residential and business customers on a portfolio basis, in addition to provisions taken against individual accounts.
Balances are written off when recoverability is assessed as being remote.
The impairment charge in trade receivables is stated net of credits for the release of specific provisions made in previous years, which are no longer required.
These relate primarily to residential customers in the UK.

ii Provision has been made for the estimated net present cost of decommissioning gas production and storage facilities at the end of their useful lives.
The estimate has been based on 2P reserves, price levels and technology at the balance sheet date.
The timing of decommissioning payments is dependent on the lives of the facilities but is expected to occur by 2040. iii The sale purchase contract loss provision relates mainly to a number of European gas transportation contracts and Direct Energy wind farm power purchase agreements.
The majority of the provision is expected to be utilised by 2020. iv Other provisions have been made for dilapidations, insurance, legal and various other claims.
POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Group manages a number of final salary and career average defined benefit pension schemes.
It also has defined contribution schemes.
The majority of these schemes are in the UK.

The other schemes are individually, and in aggregate, immaterial.
Independent valuations The Registered Pension Schemes are subject to independent valuations at least every three years, on the basis of which the qualified actuary certifies the rate of employer contributions, which together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the schemes assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the schemes.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out at the following dates: the Registered Pension Schemes at 31 March 2015, the Bord Gis Energy Company Defined Benefit Pension Scheme at 1 January 2017 and the Direct Energy Marketing Limited Pension Plan at 1 August 2014.
These have been updated to 31 December 2017 for the purpose of meeting the requirements of IAS 19.
Investments held in all schemes have been valued for this purpose at market value.
Governance The Registered Pension Schemes are managed by trustee companies whose boards consist of both company-nominated and membernominated Directors.
Each scheme holds units in the Centrica Combined Common Investment Fund CCCIF, which holds the majority of the combined assets of the Registered Pension Schemes.
The board of the CCCIF is currently comprised of nine Directors: three independent Directors, three Directors appointed by Centrica plc including the Chairman and one Director appointed by each of the three Registered Pension Schemes.
Under the terms of the Pensions Act 2004, Centrica plc and each trustee board must agree the funding rate for its defined benefit pension scheme and a recovery plan to fund any deficit against the scheme-specific statutory funding objective.
This approach was first adopted for the triennial valuations completed at 31 March 2006, and has been reflected in subsequent valuations, including the 31 March 2015 valuations.

POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS b Risks The Registered Pension Schemes expose the Group to the following risks: Asset volatility The pension liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to AA corporate bond yields.
If the growth in plan assets is lower than this, this will create an actuarial loss within other equity.
The CCCIF is responsible for managing the assets of each scheme in line with the liability-related investment objectives which were updated in 2017 that have been set by the trustees of the schemes, and invests in a diversified portfolio of assets.
The schemes are relatively young in nature the schemes opened in 1997 on the formation of Centrica plc on demerger from BG plc formerly British Gas plc, and only took on liabilities in respect of active employees.
Therefore, the CCCIF holds a significant proportion of return-seeking assets: such assets are generally expected to provide a higher return than corporate bonds, but result in greater exposure to volatility and risk in the short term.
The investment objectives are to achieve a long-term target return of 4% per annum in nominal terms, subject to a maximum level of modelled downside risk exposure.
Interest rate A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the net present value of the pension liabilities.
The relative immaturity of the schemes means that the duration of the liabilities is longer than average for typical UK pension schemes, resulting in a relatively higher exposure to interest rate risk.
Inflation Pensions in deferment, pensions in payment and pensions accrued under the career average schemes increase in line with the Retail Prices Index RPI and the Consumer Prices Index CPI.
Therefore scheme liabilities will increase if inflation is higher than assumed, although in some cases caps are in place to limit the impact of significant movements in inflation.
Furthermore, a pension increase exchange PIE option implemented in 2015 is available to future retirees, which gives the choice to receive a higher initial pension in return for giving up certain future increases linked to RPI, again limiting the impact of significant movements in inflation.
Longevity The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of scheme members and their surviving spouses: therefore increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the pension liabilities.
The relative immaturity of the schemes means that there is comparatively little observable mortality data to assess the rates of mortality experienced by the schemes, and means that the schemes liabilities will be paid over a long period of time, making it particularly difficult to predict the life expectancy of the current membership.
Furthermore, pension payments are subject to inflationary increases, resulting in a higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.
Salary Pension liabilities are calculated by reference to the future salaries of active members, and hence salary rises in excess of assumed increases will increase scheme liabilities.
During 2011, changes were introduced to the final salary sections of CEPS and CPP such that annual increases in pensionable pay are capped to 2%, resulting in a reduction in salary risk.
During 2016, a salary cap on pensionable pay for the CPS career average and CPP schemes was implemented.
Both the 2011 and 2016 changes result in a reduction in salary risk.
Foreign exchange Certain assets held by the CCCIF are denominated in foreign currencies, and hence their values are subject to exchange rate risk.
The CCCIF has long-term hedging policies in place to manage interest rate, inflation and foreign exchange risks.
The table below analyses the total liabilities of the Registered Pension Schemes, calculated in accordance with accounting principles, by type of liability, as at 31 December 2017.

POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS c Accounting assumptions The accounting assumptions for the Registered Pension Schemes have been given below: Major assumptions used for the actuarial valuation 2017 2016 31 December % % Rate of increase in employee earnings: Subject to 2% cap 1.7 1.7 Other not subject to cap 2.3 3.2 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.1 3.2 Rate of increase in deferred pensions: In line with CPI capped at 2.5% 2.0 2.1 In line with RPI 3.1 3.2 Discount rate 2.6 2.7 The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the balance sheet date have been based on a combination of standard actuarial mortality tables, scheme experience and other relevant data, and include an allowance for future improvements in mortality.
The longevity assumptions for members in normal health are as follows: 2017 2016 Life expectancy at age 65 for a member Male Female Male Female 31 December Years Years Years Years Currently aged 65 23.0 24.6 23.2 24.9 Currently aged 45 24.5 26.1 25.0 26.8 The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuations of the pension schemes.
Marginal adjustments to the assumptions used to calculate the pension liability, or significant swings in bond yields or stock markets, can have a large impact in absolute terms on the net assets of the Group.
Reasonably possible changes as at 31 December to one of the actuarial assumptions would have affected the scheme liabilities as set out below: 2017 2016 Impact of changing material assumptions Indicative effect Indicative effect Increase on scheme Increase on scheme decrease in liabilities decrease in liabilities 31 December assumption % assumption % Rate of increase in employee earnings subject to 2% cap 0.25% 0 0.25% 1 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 0.25% 5 0.25% 5 Discount rate 0.25% 6 0.25% 6 Inflation assumption 0.25% 5 0.25% 5 Longevity assumption 1 year 3 1 year 3 The indicative effects on scheme liabilities have been calculated by changing each assumption in isolation and assessing the impact on the liabilities.
For the reasonably possible change in the inflation assumption, it has been assumed that a change to the inflation assumption would lead to corresponding changes in the assumed rates of increase in uncapped pensionable pay, pensions in payment and deferred pensions.
The remaining disclosures in this note cover all of the Groups defined benefit schemes.

POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS g Pension scheme contributions The Group estimates that it will pay 89 million of ordinary employer contributions during 2018, at an average rate of 23% of pensionable pay, together with 32 million of contributions paid via the salary sacrifice arrangement.
At 31 March 2015 the date of the latest full actuarial valuations the weighted average duration of the liabilities of the Registered Pension Schemes was 24 years.
During 2016, the Group finalised the outcome of the UK Registered Pension Schemes triennial review, based on the position as at 31 March 2015, with the Pension Trustees.
The Group committed to additional annual cash contributions of 76 million for 14 years to fund the pension deficit which, on a Technical Provisions basis, had increased from 331 million in 2012 to 1,203 million in 2015 primarily due to a lower discount rate used following falls in market yields.
The funding is provided through a new asset-backed contribution arrangement with the annual contributions commencing in 2017.
The existing asset-backed contribution arrangements, 55 million in 2017, 22 million per annum in 2018-2022 and 5 million per annum in 2023-2026 into the schemes, continue unchanged.
A 995 million security package over certain of the Groups assets, enforceable in the unlikely event the Group is unable to meet its obligations, was agreed in support of these arrangements.
Although the Group established a new funding arrangement during 2016 based on the position as at 31 March 2015, it should be noted that the market rates, from which the discount rate is derived, have continued to decline in the subsequent period.
The next UK Registered Pension Schemes triennial review will be based on the position as at 31 March 2018.
The Group continues to monitor its pension liabilities on an ongoing basis, including assessing various scenarios that may arise and their potential implications for the business.
Deficit payments are also being made in respect of the Direct Energy Marketing Limited Pension Plan in Canada.
2 million was paid in 2017 with further annual contributions of 1 million to be paid in 2018 and 2019.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES a Commitments Commitments are not held on the Groups Balance Sheet as these are executory arrangements, and relate to amounts that we are contractually required to pay in the future as long as the other party meets its contractual obligations.
The Group procures commodities through a mixture of production from gas fields, power stations, wind farms and procurement contracts.
Procurement contracts include short-term forward market purchases of gas and electricity at fixed and floating prices.
They also include gas and electricity contracts indexed to market prices and long-term gas contracts with non-gas indexation.
The commitments in relation to commodity purchase contracts disclosed below are stated net of amounts receivable under commodity sales contracts, where there is a right of offset with the counterparty.
The total volume of gas to be taken under certain long-term structured contracts depends on a number of factors, including the actual reserves of gas that are eventually determined to be extractable on an economic basis.
The commitments disclosed below are based on the minimum quantities of gas and other commodities that the Group is contracted to buy at estimated future prices.
The commitments in this note differ in scope and in basis from the maturity analysis of energy derivatives disclosed in note S3.
Whilst the commitments in relation to commodity purchase contracts include all purchase contracts, only certain procurement and sales contracts are within the scope of IAS 39 and included in note S3.
In addition, the volumes used in calculating the maturity analysis in note S3 are estimated using valuation techniques, rather than being based on minimum contractual quantities.
On 25 March 2013, the Group and Company announced that it had entered into a 20-year agreement with Cheniere to purchase 89bcf per annum of LNG volumes for export from the Sabine Pass liquefaction plant in the US, subject to a number of project milestones and regulatory approvals being achieved.
During 2015, Cheniere made a positive final investment decision on the fifth project at Sabine Pass following receipt of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval and a Non-Free Trade Agreement licence from the Department of Energy.
Under the terms of the agreement with Cheniere, the Group is committed to make capacity payments of 3.8 billion included in LNG capacity below between 2019 and 2039.
The Group may also make up to 8.0 billion of commodity purchases based on market gas prices and foreign exchange rates as at the balance sheet date.
The target date for first commercial delivery is estimated by the terminal operator as September 2019.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES b Guarantees and indemnities This section discloses any guarantees and indemnities that the Group has given, where we may have to provide security in the future against existing and future obligations that will remain for a specific period.
In connection with the Groups energy trading, transportation and upstream activities, certain Group companies have entered into contracts under which they may be required to prepay, provide credit support or provide other collateral in the event of a significant deterioration in creditworthiness.
The extent of credit support is contingent upon the balance owing to the third party at the point of deterioration.
The Group has provided a number of securities in respect of decommissioning liabilities associated with field developments owned, or partly owned by Spirit Energy and its subsidiaries.
These securities are provided to fellow partners and previous owners of these fields, who may be liable for Spirit Energys share of the decommissioning costs, in the event of default by the Group.
The most significant securities relate to the Morecambe and Statfjord fields.
As at 31 December 2017, 694 million of letters of credit and on demand payment bonds have been issued in respect of decommissioning obligations included in the Group Balance Sheet.
As additional assets are developed or acquired, additional securities may be provided.
c Contingent liabilities The Group has no material contingent liabilities.
SOURCES OF FINANCE a Capital structure The Group seeks to maintain an efficient capital structure with a balance of net debt and equity as shown in the table below: 2017 2016 31 December m m Net debt 2,596 3,473 Equity 2,699 2,666 Capital 5,295 6,139 Debt levels are restricted to limit the risk of financial distress and, in particular, to maintain a strong credit profile.
The Groups credit standing is important for several reasons: to maintain a low cost of debt, limit collateral requirements in energy trading, hedging and decommissioning security arrangements, and to ensure the Group is an attractive counterparty to energy producers and long-term customers.
The Group monitors its current and projected capital position on a regular basis, considering a medium-term view of three to five years, and different stress case scenarios, including the impact of changes in the Groups credit ratings and significant movements in commodity prices.
A number of financial ratios are monitored, including those used by the credit rating agencies.
The level of debt that can be raised by the Group is restricted by the Companys Articles of Association.
Borrowings is limited to the higher of 10 billion and a gearing ratio of three times adjusted capital and reserves.
The Group funds its long-term debt requirements through issuing bonds in the capital markets and taking bank debt.
Short-term debt requirements are met primarily through issuance of commercial paper.
The Group maintains substantial committed facilities and uses these to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including short-term business requirements and back-up for commercial paper.
British Gas Insurance Limited BGIL is required under PRA regulations to hold a minimum capital amount and has complied with this requirement in 2017 and 2016.
BGILs capital management policy and plan is subject to review and approval by BGILs board.
Reporting processes provide relevant and timely capital information to management and the board.
A medium-term capital management plan forms a part of BGILs planning and forecasting process, embedded into approved timelines, management reviews and board approvals.
In the period from 2015-2017, the Group has reduced its overall levels of net debt, in accordance with its strategic objectives and financial framework.
This has resulted in an increase in overall levels of cash held.
The Group regularly reviews its cash and gross debt positions and considers opportunities for early retirement of debt in order to maintain a more efficient balance sheet.
b Liquidity risk management and going concern The Group has a number of treasury and risk policies to monitor and manage liquidity risk.
Cash forecasts identifying the Groups liquidity requirements are produced regularly and are stress-tested for different scenarios, including, but not limited to, reasonably possible increases or decreases in commodity prices and the potential cash implications of a credit rating downgrade.
The Group seeks to ensure that sufficient financial headroom exists for at least a 12-month period to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
It is the Groups policy to maintain committed facilities and or available surplus cash resources of at least 1,200 million, raise at least 75% of its net debt excluding non-recourse debt in the long-term debt market and to maintain an average term to maturity in the recourse longterm debt portfolio greater than five years.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had undrawn committed credit facilities of 3,530 million 2016: 4,497 million and 2,664 million 2016: 1,881 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.
238% 2016: 186% of the Groups net debt has been raised in the longterm debt market and the average term to maturity of the long-term debt portfolio was 10.8 years 2016: 11.6 years.
The Groups liquidity is impacted by the cash posted or received under margin and collateral agreements.
The terms and conditions of these depend on the counterparty and the specific details of the transaction.
Cash is generally returned to the Group or by the Group within two days of trade settlement.
Refer to note 24 c for the movement in cash posted or received as collateral.

SOURCES OF FINANCE The relatively high level of undrawn committed bank facilities and available cash resources has enabled the Directors to conclude that the Group has sufficient headroom to continue as a going concern.
The statement of going concern is included in the Governance section Other Statutory Information, on page 100. c Net debt summary Net debt predominantly includes capital market borrowings offset by cash, cash posted or received as collateral, securities and certain hedging financial instruments used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange movements on borrowings.

GENERAL INFORMATION Centrica plc the Company is a public company limited by shares, domiciled and incorporated in the UK, and registered in England and Wales.
The address of the registered office is Millstream, Maidenhead Road, Windsor, Berkshire, SL4 5GD.
The Company, together with its subsidiaries comprise the Group.
The nature of the Groups operations and principal activities are set out in note 4 a and on pages 2 to 62.
The consolidated Financial Statements of Centrica plc are presented in pounds sterling.
Operations and transactions conducted in currencies other than pounds sterling are included in the consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the foreign currencies accounting policy set out in note S2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES This section sets out the Groups significant accounting policies in addition to the critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated Financial Statements.
These accounting policies have been consistently applied to the years presented.
Income Statement presentation The Group Income Statement and segmental note separately identify the effects of re-measurement of certain financial instruments and items that are exceptional, in order to provide readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the Groups underlying performance, as described in note 2.
Basis of consolidation The Group Financial Statements consolidate the Financial Statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company.
Subsidiaries are all entities including structured entities over which the Group has control.
Control is exercised over an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Transactions with non-controlling interests that relate to their ownership interests and do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition at which point the Group gains control over a business as defined by IFRS 3, and applies the acquisition method to account for the transaction as a business combination or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the Financial Statements of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to align the accounting policies with those used by the Group.
When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss.
This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as a joint venture, associate or financial asset.
Segmental reporting The Groups operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to and regularly reviewed by the Groups Executive Committee for the purposes of evaluating segment performance and allocating resources.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be measured reliably.
Revenue includes amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Energy supply: revenue is recognised on the basis of energy supplied during the year.
Revenue for energy supply activities includes an assessment of energy supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end known as unread revenue.
Unread gas and electricity is estimated using historical consumption patterns, taking into account the industry reconciliation process for total gas and total electricity usage by supplier, and is included in accrued energy income within trade and other receivables.
Proprietary energy trading: revenue comprises both realised settled and unrealised fair value changes net gains and losses from trading in physical and financial energy contracts.
Wholesale energy: revenue in the North America Business segment is presented on a gross basis, reflecting revenue arising from the retrading of energy in addition to physical supply.
Fixed-fee service and insurance contracts: revenue from these contracts is recognised in the Group Income Statement with regard to the incidence of risk over the life of the contract, reflecting the seasonal propensity of claims to be made under the contracts and the benefits receivable by the customer, which span the life of the contract as a result of emergency maintenance being available throughout the contract term.
Amounts paid in advance are treated as deferred income, with any amount in arrears recognised as accrued income.
For one-off services, such as installations, revenue is recognised at the date of service provision.
Storage services: storage capacity revenues are recognised evenly over the contract period, whilst commodity revenues for the injection and withdrawal of gas are recognised at the point of gas flowing into or out of the storage facilities.
Gas purchases and gas sales transactions entered into to optimise the performance of the gas storage facilities are presented net within cost of sales.
Cushion gas sales revenue is recognised when the gas is transferred to the customer account or sold to the market.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Upstream production: revenue associated with exploration and production sales of natural gas, crude oil and condensates is recognised when title passes to the customer.
Revenue from the production of natural gas, oil and condensates in which the Group has an interest with other producers is recognised based on the Groups working interest and the terms of the relevant production sharing arrangements the entitlement method.
Where differences arise between production sold and the Groups share of production, this is accounted for as an overlift or underlift see separate accounting policy.
Purchases and sales entered into to optimise the performance of production facilities are presented net within revenue.
Power generation: revenue is recognised on the basis of power supplied during the year.
Power purchases and sales entered into to optimise the performance of power generation facilities are presented net within revenue.
Cost of sales Energy supply includes the cost of gas and electricity produced and purchased during the year, taking into account the industry reconciliation process for total gas and total electricity usage by supplier and related transportation, distribution, royalty costs and boughtin materials and services.
Cost of sales relating to fixed-fee service and insurance contracts includes direct labour and related overheads on installation work, repairs and service contracts in the year.
Cost of sales relating to gas and oil production includes depreciation of assets used in production of gas and oil, royalty costs and direct labour costs.
Cost of sales within power generation businesses includes the depreciation of assets included in generating power, fuel purchase costs, direct labour costs and carbon emissions costs.
Financing costs Financing costs that arise in connection with the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised and subsequently amortised in line with the depreciation of the related asset.
Financing costs are capitalised from the time of acquisition or from the beginning of construction or production until the point at which the qualifying asset is ready for use.
Where a specific financing arrangement is in place, the specific borrowing rate for that arrangement is applied.
For non-specific financing arrangements, a Group financing rate representative of the weighted average borrowing rate of the Group is used 2017: 4.55%, 2016: 4.53%.
Financing costs not arising in connection with the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are expensed.
Investment income Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying value.
Foreign currencies The consolidated Financial Statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the Groups presentational currency.
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the Financial Statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are, on initial recognition, recorded in the functional currency of the entity at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All exchange movements are included in the Group Income Statement for the period.
In previous periods, the Group utilised net investment hedging and exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings and derivatives that provided a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity were taken directly to equity.
Upon the disposal or partial disposal of the net investment, any accumulated foreign exchange reserves related to the investment are recognised in the Group Income Statement.
The Group no longer uses net investment hedging but historic exchange differences remain in equity until the disposal of the specific investments.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity concerned are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the dates of the initial transaction.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups non-sterling functional currency subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates are translated into pounds sterling at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
The results of these generally foreign subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates are translated into pounds sterling at the average rates of exchange for the relevant period.
The relevant exchange rates are shown below: Closing rate at 31 December Average rate for the year ended 31 December Exchange rate per pound sterling 2017 2016 2017 2016 US dollars 1.35 1.23 1.30 1.35 Canadian dollars 1.70 1.66 1.69 1.79 Euro 1.13 1.17 1.15 1.23 Norwegian krone 11.09 10.66 10.71 11.37 i Danish krone 8.39 8.72 8.52 8.58 i In 2016, the average rate for the Danish krone is measured over the three month period ended 31 December, being the period of ownership of Neas Energy in that period.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Exchange adjustments arising from the retranslation of the opening net assets and results of non-sterling functional currency operations are transferred to the Groups foreign currency translation reserve, a separate component of equity, and are reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In the event of the disposal of a non-sterling functional currency subsidiary, the cumulative translation difference arising in the foreign currency translation reserve is charged or credited to the Group Income Statement on disposal.
Employee share schemes The Group operates a number of employee share schemes, detailed in the Remuneration Report on pages 78 to 89, under which it makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis together with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the number of awards that will vest, and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
The majority of the share-based payment charge arises from the following schemes.
More information is included in the Remuneration Report on pages 78 to 89.
Deferred Matching Share Scheme DMSS : Applicable employees: Senior Executive Group.
From 2015 this scheme was replaced by the Annual Incentive Plan AIP and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for Executive Directors and the On Track Incentive Plan OTIP for Senior Executives and senior management.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Sharesave: Applicable employees: All UK and Ireland employees.
Options granted with a fixed exercise price equal to 80% of the average market price of the shares for three days prior to invitation which is three to four weeks prior to the grant date.
Employees pay a monthly fixed amount into a savings account and may elect to save over three or five years.
At the end of the savings period, employees have six months to exercise their options or withdraw the saved funds.
For each of the schemes, the fair value is measured using the market value on the date of the grant.
Business combinations and goodwill The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method at the point the Group gains control over a business as defined by IFRS 3.
The cost of the acquisition is measured as the cash paid and the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of other assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement at the acquisition date.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3, are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5, which are recognised and measured at FVLCD.
The Group recognises any non-controlling interests in the acquiree on an  basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquirees identifiable net assets.
Goodwill arising on a business combination represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of the non-controlling interests and the acquisition date fair value of any previously held interest in the acquiree over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a stake in a joint venture or an associate represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
The goodwill arising on an investment in a joint venture or in an associate is not recognised separately, but is shown under Interests in joint ventures and associates in the Group Balance Sheet.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement.
Acquisitions of joint operations that meet the definition of a business as defined in IFRS 3 are accounted for as a business combination.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture entity, any amount of goodwill attributed to that entity is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
A similar accounting treatment is applied on disposal of assets that represent a business.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.
Intangible assets include contractual customer relationships, brands, application software, emissions trading schemes, renewable obligation certificates, and certain exploration and evaluation expenditures, the accounting policies for which are dealt with separately below.
For purchased application software, for example investments in customer relationship management and billing systems, cost includes contractors charges, materials, directly attributable labour and directly attributable overheads.
Capitalisation begins when expenditure for the asset is being incurred and activities necessary to prepare the asset for use are in progress.
Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for use are complete.
Amortisation commences at the point of commercial deployment.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful lives and are tested for impairment annually, otherwise they are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset could be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset are reviewed at each financial year end.
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for on a prospective basis by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Intangible assets are derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from their use.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset could be impaired, either individually or at the CGU level.
Such intangibles are not amortised.
The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life assessment continues to be supportable.
If not, the change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
The useful economic lives for the principal categories of intangible assets are as follows: Customer relationships and other contractual assets Up to 20 years Strategic identifiable acquired brands Indefinite Application software Up to 15 years Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 161 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 161 Centrica Financials Back-End.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES EU Emissions Trading Scheme and renewable obligation certificates Purchased carbon dioxide emissions allowances are recognised initially at cost purchase price within intangible assets.
The liability is measured at the cost of purchased allowances up to the level of purchased allowances held, and then at the market price of allowances ruling at the balance sheet date, with movements in the liability recognised in operating profit.
Forward contracts for the purchase or sale of carbon dioxide emissions allowances are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognised in the Group Income Statement.
The intangible asset is surrendered and the liability is extinguished at the end of the compliance period to reflect the consumption of economic benefits.
Purchased renewable obligation certificates are recognised initially at cost within intangible assets.
A liability for the renewables obligation is recognised based on the level of electricity supplied to customers, and is calculated in accordance with percentages set by the UK Government and the renewable obligation certificate buyout price for that period.
Any recycling benefit related to the submission of renewable obligation certificates is recognised in the Group Income Statement when received.
Exploration, evaluation, development and production assets The Group uses the successful efforts method of accounting for exploration and evaluation expenditure.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure associated with an exploration well, including acquisition costs related to exploration and evaluation activities are capitalised initially as intangible assets.
Certain expenditures such as geological and geophysical exploration costs are expensed.
If the prospects are subsequently determined to be successful on completion of evaluation, the relevant expenditure including licence acquisition costs is transferred to PP&E.
If the prospects are subsequently determined to be unsuccessful on completion of evaluation, the associated costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made.
All field development costs are capitalised as PP&E.
Such costs relate to the acquisition and installation of production facilities and include development drilling costs, project-related engineering and other technical services costs.
PP&E, including rights and concessions related to production activities, are depreciated from the commencement of production in the fields concerned, using the unit of production method, based on all of the 2P reserves of those fields.
Changes in these estimates are dealt with prospectively.
The net carrying value of fields in production and development is compared annually on a field-by-field basis with the likely discounted future net revenues to be derived from the remaining commercial reserves.
An impairment loss is recognised where it is considered that recorded amounts are unlikely to be fully recovered from the net present value of future net revenues.
Exploration assets are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment and production and development assets are tested annually for impairment.
Interests in joint arrangements and associates Under IFRS 11, joint arrangements are those that convey joint control, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor.
Associates are investments over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control, which are generally investments in which the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
The Groups joint ventures and associates as defined in note 6 are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method, investments are carried at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets, less any impairment in value in individual investments.
The Group Income Statement reflects the Groups share of the results of operations after tax and interest.
Adjustments are made to the results and net assets of the joint ventures and associates where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
Upon initial acquisition goodwill may arise and is recognised within Interests in joint ventures and associates in the Group Balance Sheet.
The Groups interests in joint operations gas and oil exploration and production licence arrangements are accounted for by recognising its assets including its share of assets held jointly, its liabilities including its share of liabilities incurred jointly, its revenue from the sale of its share of the output arising from the joint operation, its share of the revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation and its expenses including its share of any expenses incurred jointly.
Where the Group has an equity stake or a participating interest in operations governed by a joint arrangement for which it is acting as operator, an assessment is carried out to confirm whether the Group is acting as agent or principal.
As the terms and conditions negotiated between business partners usually provide joint control to the parties over the relevant activities of the gas and oil fields that are governed by joint arrangements, the Group is usually deemed to be an agent when it is appointed as operator and not as principal as the contracts entered into do not convey control to the parties.
Accordingly, the Group recognises its interests in these arrangements as outlined above except that it presents gross liabilities and gross receivables of joint operations including amounts due to or from nonoperating partners in the Group Balance Sheet in accordance with the netting rules of IAS 32.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Property, plant and equipment PP&E is included in the Group Balance Sheet at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation.
The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
Subsequent expenditure in respect of items of PP&E, such as the replacement of major parts, major inspections or overhauls, are capitalised as part of the cost of the related asset where it is probable that future economic benefits will arise as a result of the expenditure and the cost can be reliably measured.
All other subsequent expenditure, including the costs of day-to-day servicing, repairs and maintenance, is expensed as incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other PP&E, with the exception of upstream production assets see above, are depreciated on a straight-line basis at rates sufficient to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of individual assets over their estimated useful lives.
The depreciation periods for the principal categories of assets are as follows: Freehold and leasehold buildings Up to 50 years Plant Five to 20 years Equipment and vehicles Three to 10 years Power generation assets Up to 30 years i Gas storage assets Up to 40 years i The depreciation policy for the Groups UK Storage assets has remained unchanged during 2017.
However, following the granting of consent from the Oil and Gas Authority confirming transition from a storage operation into one of production on 17 January 2018, this policy will change to be consistent with the unit of production method used by production assets in 2018.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as for owned assets or, where shorter, the lease term.
The carrying values of PP&E are tested annually for impairment and are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Residual values and useful lives are reassessed annually and, if necessary, changes are accounted for prospectively.
Impairment assumptions Details of the approach taken to impairment are included in note 7 c. The following provides further information on the assumptions used in the VIU calculations: VIU Key assumptions used The VIU calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on the Groups Board-approved business plans for five years except for Central Power Generation CCGTs.
The Groups business plans are based on past experience and adjusted to reflect market trends, economic conditions, key risks, the implementation of strategic objectives and changes in commodity prices, as appropriate.
Commodity prices used in the planning process are based in part on observable market data and in part on internal estimates.
The extent to which the commodity prices used in the business plans are based on observable market data is determined by the extent to which the market for the underlying commodity is judged to be active.
a VIU Growth rates and discount rates Cash flows beyond the planned period have been extrapolated using long-term growth rates in the market where the CGU operates.
Long-term growth rates are determined using a blend of publicly available historical data and long-term growth rate forecasts published by external analysts.
Cash flows are discounted using a discount rate specific to each CGU.
Discount rates reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and are based on the estimated cost of capital of each CGU.
Additionally, risks specific to the cash flows of the CGUs are reflected within cash flow forecasts.
Each CGUs weighted average cost of capital is then adjusted to reflect the impact of tax in order to calculate an equivalent pre-tax discount rate.
Long-term growth rates and pre-tax discount rates used in the VIU calculations for each of the Groups CGUs are provided in the table below: North America North America Connected Distributed Energy Home Business Home Energy & Power Marketing & UK Home UK Business Ireland i ii i ii ii iii ii iii Trading 2017 % % % % % % % % Growth rate to perpetuity 2.6 2.6 1.3 2.1 2.0 2.1 2.0 2.1 2.6 2.1 2.6 2.6 Pre-tax discount rate 7.3 7.3 7.2 7.9 7.5 7.9 7.5 10.4 9.5 10.4 9.5 9.0 North America North America Connected Distributed Home Business Home Energy & Power Energy Marketing UK Home UK Business Ireland i i iii iii & Trading 2016 % % % % % % % % Growth rate to perpetuity 1.9 1.9 1.5 2.2 2.1 2.2 2.1 2.2 1.9 2.2 1.9 1.9 Pre-tax discount rate 7.4 7.4 7.2 7.9 7.5 7.9 7.5 10.5 9.6 10.5 9.6 9.6 i US Canada respectively.
ii The US discount rates used for impairment testing purposes were calculated prior to the reduction in US federal tax rates.
The reduction in tax rates would not have changed the impairment conclusions.

Overlift and underlift Off-take arrangements for gas and oil produced from joint operations are often such that it is not practical for each participant to receive or sell its precise share of the overall production during the period.
This results in short-term imbalances between cumulative production entitlement and cumulative sales, referred to as overlift and underlift.
An overlift payable, or underlift receivable, is recognised at the balance sheet date within trade and other payables or trade and other receivables respectively, and is measured at market value, with movements in the period recognised within cost of sales.
Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets.
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in PP&E at their fair value, or if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included within bank loans and other borrowings, with the amount payable within 12 months included in bank overdrafts, loans and other borrowings within current liabilities.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and the reduction of the finance lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Payments under operating leases are charged to the Group Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Inventories Inventories of finished goods are valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realisable value after allowance for redundant and slowmoving items.
The cost of inventories includes the purchase price plus costs of conversion incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Inventory of gas in storage is valued either on a weighted average cost basis or at fair value less any costs to sell depending on the business model for holding the inventory.
Changes in fair value less costs to sell are recognised in the Group Income Statement.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Decommissioning costs Provision is made for the net present value of the estimated cost of decommissioning gas and oil production facilities at the end of the producing lives of fields, and storage facilities and power stations at the end of their useful lives, based on price levels and technology at the balance sheet date.
When this provision relates to an asset with sufficient future economic benefits, a decommissioning asset is recognised and included as part of the associated PP&E and depreciated accordingly.
If there is an indication that the new carrying amount of the asset is not fully recoverable, the asset is tested for impairment and an impairment loss is recognised where necessary.
Changes in these estimates and changes to the discount rates are dealt with prospectively and reflected as an adjustment to the provision and corresponding decommissioning asset included within PP&E.
The unwinding of the discount on the provision is included in the Group Income Statement within financing costs.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal.
No depreciation is charged in respect of non-current assets classified as held for sale.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable, the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the Directors are committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
The profits or losses and cash flows that relate to a major component of the Group that has been sold or is classified as held for sale are presented separately from continuing operations as discontinued operations within the Group Income Statement and Group Cash Flow Statement.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit schemes is determined separately for each scheme using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the period in which they occur in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The cost of providing retirement pensions and other benefits is charged to the Group Income Statement over the periods benefiting from employees service.
Past service cost is recognised immediately.
Costs of administering the schemes are charged to the Group Income Statement.
Net interest, being the change in the net defined benefit liability or asset due to the passage of time, is recognised in the Group Income Statement within net finance cost.
The net defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the Group Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation of the schemes and the fair value of the schemes assets.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits are paid, and that have terms of maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are recognised in the Group Income Statement as they fall due.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, that can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised in the Group Income Statement within interest expense.
Onerous contract provisions are recognised where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
Contracts to purchase or sell energy are reviewed on a portfolio basis given the fungible nature of energy, whereby it is assumed that the highest priced purchase contract supplies the highest priced sales contract and the lowest priced sales contract is supplied by the lowest priced purchase contract.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax, UK petroleum revenue tax and foreign tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
From time to time, the Group may have open tax issues with a number of revenue authorities.
Where an outflow of funds is believed to be probable and a reliable estimate of the dispute can be made, management provides for its best estimate of the liability.
These estimates take into account the specific circumstances of each dispute and relevant external advice.
Each item is considered separately and on a basis that provides the better prediction of the outcome.
See note 9 for further detail on uncertain tax provisions.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences identified at the balance sheet date, except to the extent that the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill if impairment of goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit and loss.
Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of the Groups assets and liabilities and their tax base.
Deferred tax liabilities may be offset against deferred tax assets within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group.
Any remaining deferred tax asset is recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that there will be suitable taxable profits, within the same jurisdiction, in the foreseeable future, against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or liability settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences expected from the manner in which the asset or liability is recovered or settled.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the Group no longer has the rights to cash flows, the risks and rewards of ownership or control of the asset.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
a Trade receivables Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value, which is usually the original invoice amount, and are subsequently held at amortised cost using the effective interest method less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group may not be able to collect the trade receivable.
If collection is due in one year or less, receivables are classified as current assets.
If not they are presented as non-current assets.
b Trade payables Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value, which is usually the original invoice amount and are subsequently held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
If payment is due within one year or less, payables are classified as current liabilities.
If not they are presented as non-current liabilities.
c Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds received.
Own equity instruments that are reacquired treasury or own shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the Group Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
d Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity of three months or less.
Cash and cash equivalents are presented net of outstanding bank overdrafts where there is a legal right of set off and, for the Groups cash pooling arrangements, to the extent the Group expects to settle its subsidiaries year-end account balances on a net basis.
For the purpose of the Group Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
e Interest-bearing loans and other borrowings All interest-bearing loans and other borrowings with banks and similar institutions are initially recognised at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and other borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, except when they are hedged items in an effective fair value hedge relationship where the carrying value is also adjusted to reflect the fair value movements associated with the hedged risks.
Such fair value movements are recognised in the Group Income Statement.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, discount or premium.
f Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale.
They are recognised initially at fair value in the Group Balance Sheet.
Available-for-sale financial assets are re-measured subsequently at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognised directly in equity and presented in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, until the asset is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the Group Income Statement for the year.
Accrued interest or dividends arising on available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in the Group Income Statement.
At each balance sheet date the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that available-for-sale financial assets are impaired.
If any such evidence exists, cumulative losses recognised in equity are removed from equity and recognised in the Group Income Statement.
The cumulative loss removed from equity represents the difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the Group Income Statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the Group Income Statement for equity investments classified as available-for-sale are not subsequently reversed through the Group Income Statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the Group Income Statement for debt instruments classified as available-for-sale are subsequently reversed if an increase in the fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the recognition of the impairment loss.
g Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss The Group holds investments in gilts which it designates at fair value through profit or loss.
Investments are measured at fair value on initial recognition and are re-measured to fair value in each subsequent reporting period.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the Group Income Statement within investment income or financing costs.
h Derivative financial instruments The Group routinely enters into sale and purchase transactions for physical delivery of gas, power and oil.
A portion of these transactions take the form of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of receipt or delivery of the physical commodity in accordance with the Groups expected sale, purchase or usage requirements own use, and are not within the scope of IAS 39.
The assessment of whether a contract is deemed to be own use is conducted on a Group basis without reference to underlying book structures, business units or legal entities.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Certain purchase and sales contracts for the physical delivery of gas, power and oil are within the scope of IAS 39 due to the fact that they net settle or contain written options.
Such contracts are accounted for as derivatives under IAS 39 and are recognised in the Group Balance Sheet at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the Group Income Statement for the year.
The Group uses a range of derivatives for both trading and to hedge exposures to financial risks, such as interest rates, foreign exchange and energy price risks, arising in the normal course of business.
The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Groups policies which are approved by the Board of Directors.
Further detail on the Groups risk management policies is included within the Strategic Report Principal Risks and Uncertainties on pages 52 to 62 and in note S3.
The accounting treatment of derivatives is dependent on whether they are entered into for trading or hedging purposes.
A derivative instrument is considered to be used for hedging purposes when it alters the risk profile of an underlying exposure of the Group in line with the Groups risk management policies and is in accordance with established guidelines.
Certain derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are designated in hedge accounting relationships as described by IAS 39.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the effectiveness of the hedge must be reliably measurable and documentation describing the formal hedging relationship must be prepared at the point of designation.
The hedge must be highly effective in achieving its objective.
The Group also holds derivatives that are used for hedging purposes which are not designated in hedge accounting relationships and are held for trading.
All derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative is entered into and are re-measured to fair value at each reporting date.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Derivative assets and derivative liabilities are offset and presented on a net basis only when both a legal right of set-off exists and the intention to net settle the derivative contracts is present.
The Group enters into certain energy derivative contracts covering periods for which observable market data does not exist.
The fair value of such derivatives is estimated by reference in part to published price quotations from active markets, to the extent that such observable market data exists, and in part by using valuation techniques, the inputs to which include data that is not based on or derived from observable markets.
Where the fair value at initial recognition for such contracts differs from the transaction price, a fair value gain or fair value loss will arise.
This is referred to as a day-one gain or day-one loss.
Such gains and losses are deferred not recognised and amortised to the Group Income Statement based on volumes purchased or delivered over the contractual period until such time as observable market data becomes available.
When observable market data becomes available, any remaining deferred day-one gains or losses are recognised within the Group Income Statement.
Recognition of the gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the Group Income Statement and are included within gross profit or investment income and financing costs.
Gains and losses arising on derivatives entered into for speculative energy trading purposes are presented on a net basis within revenue.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with gains or losses reported in the Group Income Statement.
The closely related nature of embedded derivatives is reassessed when there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the future cash flows under the contract.
Where a contract contains one or more embedded derivatives, and providing that the embedded derivative significantly modifies the cash flows under the contract, the option to fair value the entire contract may be taken and the contract will be recognised at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Group Income Statement.
i Hedge accounting For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.
Note S5 details the Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
Nuclear activity The Groups investment in Lake Acquisitions Limited Nuclear is accounted for as an associate.
The following accounting policies are specific to this nuclear activity.
a Fuel costs nuclear front end Front end fuel costs consist of the costs of procurement of uranium, conversion and enrichment services, and fuel element fabrication.
All costs are capitalised into inventory and charged to the Group Income Statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
b Fuel costs nuclear back end Advanced gas-cooled reactors AGR Spent fuel extracted from the reactors is sent for reprocessing and or long-term storage and eventual disposal of resulting waste products.
Back end fuel costs comprise of a loading related cost per tonne of uranium and a rebate surcharge to this cost which is dependent on the out-turn market electricity price in the year and are capitalised into inventory and charged to the Group Income Statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
Pressurised water reactor PWR Back end fuel costs are based on wet storage in station ponds followed by dry storage and subsequent direct disposal of fuel.
Back end fuel costs are capitalised into inventory on loading and are charged to the Group Income Statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
c Nuclear property, plant and equipment and depreciation The majority of the cost of the nuclear fleet is depreciated from the date of the Group acquiring its share of the fleet on a straight-line basis, with remaining depreciable periods currently of up to 18 years.
Other expenditure including amounts spent on major inspections and overhauls of production plant is depreciated over the period until the next outage which for AGR power stations is three years and for the PWR power station is 18 months.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES d Nuclear Liabilities Fund NLF funding arrangements Under the arrangements in place with the Secretary of State, the NLF will fund, subject to certain exceptions, qualifying uncontracted nuclear liabilities and qualifying decommissioning costs.
In part consideration for the assumption of these liabilities by the Secretary of State and the NLF, the former British Energy Group agreed to pay fixed decommissioning contributions each year and 150,000 indexed to RPI for every tonne of uranium in PWR fuel loaded into the Sizewell B reactor after the date of these arrangements.
e NLF and nuclear liabilities receivables The UK Government indemnity is provided to indemnify any future shortfall on NLF funding of qualifying uncontracted nuclear liabilities including PWR back end fuel services and qualifying nuclear decommissioning costs such that the receivable equals the present value of the associated qualifying nuclear liabilities apart from a small timing difference due to timing of receipts from NLF.
f Nuclear liabilities Nuclear liabilities represent provision for liabilities in respect of the costs of waste management of spent fuel and nuclear decommissioning.
g Unburnt fuels at shutdown Due to the nature of the nuclear fuel process there will be quantities of unburnt fuel in the reactors at station closure.
The costs relating to this unburnt fuel final core are fully provided for at the balance sheet date.
The provision is based on a projected value per tonne of fuel remaining at closure, discounted back to the balance sheet date and recorded as a long-term liability.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups normal operating, investing and financing activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including commodity price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall financial risk management processes are designed to identify, manage and mitigate these risks.
Further detail on the Groups overall risk management processes is included within the Strategic Report Principal Risks and Uncertainties on pages 52 to 62.
Commodity price risk management is carried out in accordance with individual business unit policies and directives including appropriate escalation routes.
Treasury risk management, including management of currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk is carried out by a central Group Treasury function in accordance with the Groups financing and treasury policy, as approved by the Board.
The wholesale credit risks associated with commodity trading and treasury positions are managed in accordance with the Groups credit risk policy.
Downstream customer credit risk management is carried out in accordance with individual business unit credit policies.
Market risk management Market risk is the risk of loss that results from changes in market prices commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The level of market risk to which the Group is exposed at a point in time varies depending on market conditions, expectations of future price or market rate movements and the composition of the Groups physical asset and contract portfolios.
a Commodity price risk management The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in its energy procurement and supply activities, production, generation and trading operations and uses specific limits to manage the exposure to commodity prices associated with the Groups activities to an acceptable level.
The Group uses Profit at Risk PaR limits to control exposures to market prices.
These are complemented by other limits including Value at Risk VaR, volumetric or stop-loss limits to control risk around trading activities.
i Energy price exposed business activities The Groups price exposed business activities consist of equity gas and liquids production, equity power generation, bilateral procurement and sales contracts, market-traded purchase and sales contracts and derivative positions primarily transacted with the intent of securing gas and power for the Groups supply customers, from a variety of sources at an optimal cost.
The Group actively manages commodity price risk by optimising its asset and contract portfolios and making use of volume flexibility.
The Groups commodity price risk exposure in its business activities is driven by the cost of procuring gas and electricity to serve its supply customers and selling gas, oil and electricity from its upstream production and generation, which varies with wholesale commodity prices.
The primary risk is that market prices for commodities will fluctuate between the time that sales prices are fixed or tariffs are set and the time at which the corresponding procurement cost is fixed, thereby potentially reducing expected margins or making sales unprofitable.
The Groups supply activities are also exposed to volumetric risk in the form of an uncertain consumption profile arising from a range of factors, including the weather, energy consumption changes, customer attrition and the economic climate.
There is also risk associated with ensuring that there is sufficient commodity available to secure supply to customers.
The Groups production and generation activities are also exposed to volumetric risk in the form of uncertain production profiles.
In order to manage the exposure to market prices associated with the Groups business operations the Group uses a specific set of limits including VaR and PaR established by the Board, and sub-delegated downwards through the delegation lines to the commercial leaders.
PaR measures the estimated potential loss in a position or portfolio of positions associated with the movement of a commodity price for a given confidence level, over the remaining term of the position or contract.
VaR measures the estimated potential loss for a given confidence level over a predetermined holding period.
The standard confidence level used is 95%.
In addition, regular stress and scenario tests are performed to evaluate the impact on the portfolio of possible substantial movements in commodity prices.
The Group measures and manages the commodity price risk associated with the Groups entire energy price exposed business portfolio.
Only certain of the Groups energy contracts constitute financial instruments under IAS 39 note S6.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT As a result, while the Group manages the commodity price risk associated with both financial and non-financial energy procurement, sales and purchase contracts, it is the notional value of energy contracts being carried at fair value that represents the exposure of the Groups energy price exposed business activities to commodity price risk according to IFRS 7: Financial instruments: disclosures.
This is because energy contracts that are financial instruments under IAS 39 are accounted for on a fair value basis and changes in fair value immediately impact profit.
Conversely, energy contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39 are accounted for as executory contracts and changes in fair value do not immediately impact profit, and as such, are not exposed to commodity price risk as defined by IFRS 7.
So whilst the PaR or VaR associated with energy procurement and supply contracts that are outside the scope of IAS 39 are monitored for internal risk management purposes: only those energy contracts within the scope of IAS 39 are within the scope of the IFRS 7 disclosure requirements.
ii Proprietary energy trading The Groups proprietary energy trading activities consist of physical and financial commodity purchases and sales contracts taken on with the intent of benefiting from changes in market prices or differences between buying and selling prices.
The Group conducts its trading activities in the over-the-counter market and through exchanges in the UK, North America and continental Europe.
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its proprietary energy trading activities because the value of its trading assets and liabilities will fluctuate with changes in market prices for commodities.
The Group sets volumetric and VaR limits to manage the commodity price risk exposure associated with the Groups proprietary energy trading activities.
VaR measures the estimated potential loss at a 95% confidence level over a one-day holding period.
The carrying value of energy contracts used in proprietary energy trading activities at 31 December 2017 is disclosed in note 19.
As with any modelled risk measure, there are certain limitations that arise from the assumptions used in the VaR calculation.
VaR assumes that historical price behaviours will continue in the future and that the Groups trading positions can be unwound or hedged within the predetermined holding period.
Furthermore, the use of a 95% confidence level, by definition, does not take into account changes in value that might occur beyond this confidence level.
b Currency risk management The Group is exposed to currency risk on foreign currency denominated forecast transactions, firm commitments, monetary assets and liabilities transactional exposure and on its net investments in foreign operations translational exposure.
IFRS 7 only requires disclosure of currency risk arising on financial instruments denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the commercial operation transacting.
As a result, for the purposes of IFRS 7, currency risk excludes items that are not financial instruments, such as the Groups net investments in international operations as well as foreign currency denominated forecast transactions and firm commitments.
i Transactional currency risk The Group is exposed to transactional currency risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the underlying functional currency of the commercial operation transacting.
The Group has been increasing its international presence through acquisition and the primary functional currencies remain pounds sterling in the UK, Canadian dollars in Canada, US dollars in the US, Norwegian krone in Norway, Danish krone in Denmark and euros in the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland.
The risk is that the functional currency value of cash flows will vary as a result of movements in exchange rates.
Transactional exposure arises from the Groups energy procurement, production and generation activities, where many transactions are denominated in foreign currencies.
In addition, in order to optimise the cost of funding, the Group has, in certain cases, issued foreign currency denominated debt or entered into foreign currency loans, primarily in US dollars, euros, Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollars.
It is the Groups policy to hedge material transactional exposures using derivatives to fix the functional currency value of non-functional currency cash flows, except where there is an economic hedge inherent in the transaction.
At 31 December 2017, there were no material unhedged non-functional currency monetary assets or liabilities, firm commitments or probable forecast transactions 2016: nil, other than transactions which have an inherent economic hedge and foreign currency borrowings used to hedge translational exposures.
ii Translational currency risk The Group is exposed to translational currency risk as a result of its net investments in North America and Europe.
The risk is that the pound sterling value of the net assets of foreign operations will decrease with changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups policy is to protect the pounds sterling book value of its net investments in foreign operations where appropriate, subject to certain parameters, by holding foreign currency debt, entering into foreign currency derivatives, or a mixture of both.
The Group manages translational currency risk taking into consideration the cash impact of any hedging activity as well as the risk to the net asset numbers in the Groups Financial Statements.
The translation hedging programme including the potential cash impact is managed by the Group Treasury function and monitored by the Chief Financial Officer.
c Interest rate risk management In the normal course of business the Group borrows to finance its operations.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because the fair value of fixed rate borrowings and the cash flows associated with floating rate borrowings will fluctuate with changes in interest rates.
The Groups policy is to manage the interest rate risk on long-term borrowings by ensuring the exposure to floating interest rates remains within a 30% to 70% range, including the impact of interest rate derivatives.
The return generated on the Groups cash balance is also exposed to movements in short-term interest rates.
The Group manages cash balances to protect against adverse changes in rates whilst retaining liquidity.
d Sensitivity analysis IFRS 7 requires disclosure of a sensitivity analysis that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Groups financial position and performance to changes in market variables commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates as a result of changes in the fair value or cash flows associated with the Groups financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis provided discloses the effect on profit or loss and equity at 31 December 2017, assuming that a reasonably possible change in the relevant risk variable had occurred at 31 December 2017, and has been applied to the risk exposures in existence at that date to show the effects of reasonably possible changes in price on profit or loss and equity.
Reasonably possible changes in market variables used in the sensitivity analysis are based on implied volatilities, where available, or historical data for energy prices and foreign exchange rates.
Reasonably possible changes in interest rates are based on management judgement and historical experience.
170 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 170 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Centrica Financials Back-End.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The sensitivity analysis has been prepared based on 31 December 2017 balances and on the basis that the balances, the ratio of fixed to floating rates of debt and derivatives, the proportion of energy contracts that are financial instruments, the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies and the hedge designations in place at 31 December 2017 are all constant.
Excluded from this analysis are all non-financial assets and liabilities and energy contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39.
The sensitivity to foreign exchange rates relates only to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the commercial operation transacting, and excludes the translation of the net assets of foreign operations to pounds sterling.
The sensitivity analysis provided is hypothetical only and should be used with caution as the impacts provided are not necessarily indicative of the actual impacts that would be experienced.
This is because the Groups actual exposure to market rates is changing constantly as the Groups portfolio of commodity, debt and foreign currency contracts changes.
Changes in fair values or cash flows based on a variation in a market variable cannot be extrapolated because the relationship between the change in market variable and the change in fair value or cash flows may not be linear.
In addition, the effect of a change in a particular market variable on fair values or cash flows is calculated without considering interrelationships between the various market rates or mitigating actions that would be taken by the Group.
The sensitivity analysis provided excludes the impact of proprietary energy trading assets and liabilities because the VaR associated with the Groups proprietary energy trading activities is less than 5 million.
i Transactional currency risk The Group has performed an analysis of the sensitivity of the Groups financial position and performance to changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Group deems 10% movements to US dollar, Canadian dollar and euro currency rates relative to pounds sterling to be reasonably possible.
The impact of such movements on profit and equity, both before and after taxation, is immaterial.
ii Interest rate risk The Group has performed an analysis of the sensitivity of the Groups financial position and performance to changes in interest rates.
The Group deems a one percentage point move in UK, US and euro interest rates to be reasonably possible.
The impact of such movements on profit and equity, both after taxation, is immaterial.
iii Commodity price risk The impacts of reasonably possible changes in commodity prices on profit and equity, both after taxation, based on the assumptions set out above are as follows: 2017 2016 Reasonably Reasonably possible possible change in variable change in variable ii ii Energy prices Base price i % Base price i % UK gas p therm 48 11 49 15 UK power MWh 45 7 46 14 UK emissions tonne 8 18 7 23 UK oil US$ bbl 62 10 58 14 North American gas US cents therm 28 4 37 4 North American power US$ MWh 32 6 32 6 2017 2016 Impact on Impact on profit ii profit ii Incremental profit loss m m UK energy prices combined increase decrease 68 72 82 86 North American energy prices combined increase decrease 238 238 117 117 i The base price represents the average forward market price over the duration of the active market curve used in the sensitivity analysis provided.
ii The reasonably possible change in variable and the impact on profit are calculated using both the active and inactive market curves for all UK energy prices.
The impact on equity of such price changes is immaterial.
Credit risk management Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a counterpartys inability or failure to discharge its obligations under a contract.
The Group continually reviews its rating thresholds for counterparty credit limits and updates these as necessary, based on a consistent set of principles.
It continues to operate within its limits.
In both the US and Europe, there is an effort to maintain a balance between exchange based trading and bilateral transactions.
This allows for a reasonable balance between counterparty credit risk and potential liquidity requirements.
In addition the Group actively manages the trade-off between credit and liquidity risks by optimising the use of contracts with collateral obligations and physically settled contracts without collateral obligations.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Group is exposed to credit risk in its treasury, trading, energy procurement and downstream activities.
Credit risk from financial assets is measured by counterparty credit rating as follows: 2017 2016 Receivables from Receivables from treasury, trading treasury, trading Derivative financial and energy Derivative financial and energy instruments with procurement Cash and cash instruments with procurement Cash and cash positive fair values counterparties equivalents positive fair values counterparties equivalents m m m m m m AAA to AA 15 78 2,024 8 83 1,118 AA to A 687 379 799 918 532 878 BBB to BBB 465 279 27 673 317 37 BB to BB 76 228 117 144 3 B or lower 82 59 50 76 i Unrated 65 44 14 107 90 1,390 1,067 2,864 1,873 1,242 2,036 i The unrated counterparty receivables primarily comprise amounts due from subsidiaries of rated entities, exchanges or clearing houses.
Details of how credit risk is managed across the asset categories are provided below: a Treasury, trading and energy procurement activities Wholesale counterparty credit exposures are monitored by individual counterparty and by category of credit rating, and are subject to approved limits.
The Group uses master netting agreements to reduce credit risk and net settles payments with counterparties where net settlement provisions exist see note S6 for details of amounts offset.
In addition, the Group employs a variety of other methods to mitigate credit risk: margining, various forms of bank and parent company guarantees and letters of credit.
See note 24 c for details of cash posted or received under margin or collateral agreements.
100% of the Groups credit risk associated with its treasury, trading and energy procurement activities is with counterparties in related energy industries or with financial institutions.
IFRS 7 requires disclosure of information about the exposure to credit risk arising from financial instruments only.
Only certain of the Groups energy procurement contracts constitute financial instruments under IAS 39.
As a result, whilst the Group manages the credit risk associated with both financial and non-financial energy procurement contracts, it is the carrying value of financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 note S6 that represents the maximum exposure to credit risk in accordance with IFRS 7. b Downstream activities In the case of business customers, credit risk is managed by checking a companys creditworthiness and financial strength both before commencing trade and during the business relationship.
For residential customers, creditworthiness is ascertained normally before commencing trade to determine the payment mechanism required to reduce credit risk to an acceptable level.
Certain customers will only be accepted on a prepayment basis or with a security deposit.
In some cases, an ageing of receivables is monitored and used to manage the exposure to credit risk associated with both business and residential customers.
In other cases, credit risk is monitored and managed by grouping customers according to method of payment or profile.
Liquidity risk management and going concern Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group experiences significant movements in its liquidity position due primarily to the seasonal nature of its business and margin cash arrangements associated with certain wholesale commodity contracts.
To mitigate this risk the Group maintains significant committed facilities and holds cash on deposit.
See note 24 b for further information.

Merger, capital redemption and other reserves During February 1997, BG plc formerly British Gas plc demerged certain businesses grouped together under GB Gas Holdings Limited GBGH to form Centrica plc.
Upon demerger, the share capital of GBGH was transferred to Centrica plc and was recorded at the nominal value of shares issued to BG plc shareholders.
In accordance with the Companies Act 1985, no premium was recorded on the shares issued.
On consolidation, the difference between the nominal value of the Companys shares issued and the amount of share capital and share premium of GBGH at the date of demerger was credited to a merger reserve.
On 8 December 2017, the Groups existing Exploration & Production business was combined with that of Bayerngas Norge AS to form the Spirit Energy business.
The Group acquired 69% of the Spirit Energy business and Bayerngas Norges former shareholders acquired 31%.
The non-controlling interest established on acquisition has been based on its share of the carrying value of the combined business, with the other reserve representing the difference between the fair value and this carrying value.
174 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 174 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Centrica Financials Back-End.
OTHER EQUITY In accordance with the Companies Act 1985, the Company has transferred to the capital redemption reserve an amount equal to the nominal value of shares repurchased and subsequently cancelled.
Up to 31 December 2017 the cumulative nominal value of shares repurchased and subsequently cancelled was 26 million 2016: 26 million.
Own shares reserve The own shares reserve reflects the cost of shares in the Company held in the Centrica employee share ownership trusts to meet the future requirements of the Groups share-based payment plans.
Treasury shares reserve Treasury shares are acquired equity instruments of the Company.
Share-based payments reserve The share-based payments reserve reflects the obligation to deliver shares to employees under the Groups share schemes in return for services provided.
Foreign currency translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve comprises exchange adjustments on the translation of the Groups foreign operations.
Historically the Group has hedged its net investments in these foreign operations and the opening balance of the foreign currency translation reserve includes exchange translation adjustments on borrowings and derivatives classified as net investment hedges under the requirements of IAS 39.
Note S5 provides further detail on historical net investment hedges.
Cash flow hedging reserve The cash flow hedging reserve comprises fair value movements on instruments designated as cash flow hedges under the requirements of IAS 39.
Amounts are transferred from the cash flow hedging reserve to the Group Income Statement or Group Balance Sheet as and when the hedged item affects the Group Income Statement or Group Balance Sheet which is, for the most part, on receipt or payment of amounts denominated in foreign currencies and settlement of interest on debt instruments.
Note S5 provides further detail on cash flow hedging.
HEDGE ACCOUNTING For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified either as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or, in previous periods, hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
The fair values of derivatives and primary financial instruments in hedge accounting relationships at 31 December were as follows: 2017 2016 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities 31 December m m m m Fair value hedges 128 6 158 5 Cash flow hedges 162 16 151 3 The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting under IAS 39 are described below.
Fair value hedges A derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and its relationship to a recognised asset or liability is classified as a fair value hedge when it hedges the exposure to changes in the fair value of that recognised asset or liability.
The Groups fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps used to protect against changes in the fair value of fixed-rate, long-term debt due to movements in market interest rates.
Any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument to fair value is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the Group Income Statement within net finance cost.
The Group discontinues fair value hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation.
Any adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged financial instrument for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to the Group Income Statement.
Amortisation may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and shall begin no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged.
Gains or losses arising on fair value hedges net of gains or losses arising on hedged items attributable to the hedged risk for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 were immaterial.
Cash flow hedges A derivative is classified as a cash flow hedge when it hedges exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk either associated with a recognised asset, liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
The Groups cash flow hedges consist primarily of: forward foreign exchange contracts used to protect against the variability of functional currency denominated cash flows associated with non-functional currency denominated highly probable forecast transactions: and cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts used to protect against the variability in cash flows associated with borrowings denominated in non-functional currencies.

indd 175 16 03 2018 15:49 Financial Statements | Notes to the Financial Statements Financial Statements | Notes to the Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Supplementary information continued S5.
HEDGE ACCOUNTING The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument which is effective is recognised directly in equity while any ineffectiveness is recognised in the Group Income Statement.
The gains or losses that are initially recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income are transferred to the Group Income Statement in the same period in which the highly probable forecast transaction affects income.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability on its recognition.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity remains in equity until the highly probable forecast transaction occurs.
If the transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the Group Income Statement.
Note S4 details movements in the cash flow hedging reserve.
The ineffective portion of gains and losses on cash flow hedging is immaterial and is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement.
Net investment hedges Historically the Group engaged in net investment hedging NIH whereby it would obtain foreign currency debt issued in the same currency as its net investment in a foreign operation.
Such hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity: any gain or loss on the ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in the Group Income Statement.
In 2009 the Group ceased to NIH, however the opening balance of the foreign currency translation reserve includes cumulative exchange translation adjustments on borrowings and derivatives classified as a NIH under the requirements of IAS 39.
These balances will be recycled to the Group Income Statement on disposal of the relevant foreign operation.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The Group has documented internal policies for determining fair value, including methodologies used to establish valuation adjustments required for credit risk.
a Fair value hierarchy Financial assets and financial liabilities measured and held at fair value are classified into one of three categories, known as hierarchy levels, which are defined according to the inputs used to measure fair value as follows: Level 1: fair value is determined using observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2: fair value is determined using significant inputs that may be directly observable inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data: and Level 3: fair value is determined using significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in managements best estimate of fair value.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The reconciliation of the Level 3 fair value measurements during the year is as follows: 2017 2016 Financial Financial Financial Financial assets liabilities assets liabilities m m m m Level 3 financial instruments i 1 January 44 63 35 114 Total realised and unrealised gains losses : Recognised in Group Income Statement 1 9 69 60 Purchases, sales, issuances and settlements net 18 9 6 2 ii Transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 3 30 4 Foreign exchange movements 1 7 31 December 59 33 44 63 Total gains losses for the year for Level 3 financial instruments iii held at the end of the reporting year 19 15 89 4 i Included within the opening balance of financial assets in 2016 are 53 million of liabilities, which were presented within the derivative assets in the Group Balance Sheet at the beginning of 2016, as a result of being netted off the associated Level 2 trades with the same counterparty.
ii Transfers between levels are deemed to occur at the beginning of the reporting period.
iii 19 million gains 2016: 89 million gains for the year for Level 3 financial assets held at the end of the reporting year were recognised within certain re-measurements and no gains or losses 2016: nil were recognised in other comprehensive income.
15 million losses 2016: 4 million losses for the year for Level 3 financial liabilities held at the end of the reporting year were recognised within exceptional items and certain re-measurements and no gains or losses 2016: nil were recognised in other comprehensive income.
b Valuation techniques used to derive Level 2 and Level 3 fair values and Group valuation process Level 2 interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange derivatives comprise interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Interest rate swaps are fair valued using forward interest rates extracted from observable yield curves.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are fair valued using forward exchange rates that are quoted in an active market, with the resulting market value discounted back to present value using observable yield curves.
Level 2 energy derivatives are fair valued by comparing and discounting the difference between the expected contractual cash flows for the relevant commodities and the quoted prices for those commodities in an active market.
The average discount rate applied to value this type of contract during 2017 was 1% 2016: 1% Europe and 3% 2016: 3% North America per annum.
For Level 3 energy derivatives, the main input used by the Group pertains to deriving expected future commodity prices in markets that are not active as far into the future as some of our contractual terms.
This applies to certain contracts within the UK and US.
Fair values are then calculated by comparing and discounting the difference between the expected contractual cash flows and these derived future prices using an average discount rate of 1% 2016: 1% UK and 3% 2016: 7% US per annum for 2017.
Active period of markets Gas Power Coal Emissions Oil UK years 3 3 3 3 3 North America years 5 Up to 5 N A Up to 5 3 Because the Level 3 energy derivative valuations involve the prediction of future commodity market prices, sometimes a long way into the future, reasonably possible alternative assumptions for gas, power, coal, emissions or oil prices may result in a higher or lower fair value for Level 3 financial instruments.
Given the relative size of these fair values, it is unlikely that the impact of these reasonably possible changes would be significant when judged in relation to the Groups profit and loss or total asset value.
It should be noted that the fair values disclosed in the tables above only concern those contracts entered into which are within the scope of IAS 39.
The Group has numerous other commodity contracts which are outside of the scope of IAS 39 and are not fair valued.
The Groups actual exposure to market rates is constantly changing as the Groups portfolio of energy contracts changes.
The Groups valuation process includes specific teams of individuals that perform valuations of the Groups derivatives for financial reporting purposes, including Level 3 valuations.
The Group has an independent team that derives future commodity price curves based on available external data and these prices feed in to the energy derivative valuations, subject to adjustments to ensure they are compliant with IFRS 13: Fair value measurement.
The price curves are subject to review and approval by the Groups Executive Committee and valuations of all derivatives, together with other contracts that are not within the scope of IAS 39, are also reviewed regularly as part of the overall risk management process.
Where the fair value at initial recognition for contracts which extend beyond the active period differs from the transaction price, a day-one gain or loss will arise.
Such gains and losses are deferred and amortised to the Group Income Statement based on volumes purchased or delivered over the contractual period until such time as observable market data becomes available see note S2 for further detail.
The amount that has yet to be recognised in the Group Income Statement relating to the differences between the transaction prices and the amounts that would have arisen had valuation techniques used for subsequent measurement been applied at initial recognition, less subsequent releases, is immaterial.

The fair values of Level 2 bonds and bank loans have been determined by discounting cash flows with reference to relevant market rates of interest.
The fair values of overdrafts, short-term loans and commercial paper are assumed to equal their book values due to the short-term nature of these amounts.
The fair values of obligations under finance leases have been determined by discounting contractual cash flows with reference to the Groups cost of borrowing.
Other financial instruments Due to their nature and or short-term maturity, the fair values of trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables and provisions are estimated to approximate their carrying values.

FIXED-FEE SERVICE AND INSURANCE CONTRACTS This section includes fixed-fee service FFS and insurance contract disclosures for services related to UK Home and North America Home.
FFS contracts in North America are entered into with home and business services customers.
Insurance contracts in North America are entered into with home services customers.
FFS contracts in the UK are entered into with home services customers by British Gas Services Limited BGSL.
Insurance contracts in the UK are entered into with home services customers by British Gas Insurance Limited BGIL, authorised by the PRA and regulated by the FCA and the PRA.
Product offerings include central heating, boiler and controls, plumbing and drains and electrical appliance insurance cover.
FFS contracts continue until cancelled by either party: insurance contracts normally provide cover for 12 months with the option of renewal.
The contracts which protect policyholders against the risk of breakdowns result in the transfer of risk to the contract provider.
Benefits provided to customers vary in accordance with terms and conditions of the contracts entered into.
However, they generally include maintenance, repair and or replacement of the items affected.
The levels of risk exposure and service provision to customers under the contract terms are dependent on the occurrence of uncertain future events, in particular the nature and frequency of faults and the cost of repair or replacement of the items affected.
Accordingly, the timing and amount of future cash outflows associated with the contracts is uncertain.
The key terms and conditions that affect future cash flows are as follows: provision of labour and parts for repairs, dependent on the agreement and associated level of service: a specified number of safety and maintenance inspections are carried out as set out in the agreement usually once a year : no limit to the number of call-outs to carry out repair work: and limits on certain maintenance and repair costs.
Revenue is recognised over the life of contracts having regard to the incidence of risk, in particular the seasonal propensity of claims which span the life of the contract as a result of emergency maintenance being available throughout the contract term.
Costs incurred to settle claims represent principally the engineer workforce employed by the Group within home services and the cost of parts utilised in repair or maintenance.
These costs are accounted for over a 12-month period with adjustments made to reflect the seasonality of workload over a given year.
Weather conditions and the seasonality of repairs both affect the profile of the workload and associated costs incurred across the year.
The risk exposure of these uncertain events is actively managed by undertaking the following risk mitigation activities: an initial service visit is provided to customers taking up most central heating contracts and in some instances pre-existing faults may lead to the contract being cancelled and no further cover being provided: an annual maintenance inspection is performed as part of most central heating contracts to help identify and prevent issues developing into significant maintenance or breakdown claims: and contract limits are applied to certain types of maintenance and repair work considered to be higher risk in terms of frequency and cost.
The costs of FFS claims and insurance claims incurred during the year were 44 million 2016: 48 million and 389 million 2016: 391 million respectively and are included in the table below in Expenses relating to FFS and insurance contracts.
All claims are settled immediately and in full.
Due to the short average lead time between claims occurrence and settlement, no material provisions were outstanding at the balance sheet date 2016: nil.
2017 2016 m m Total revenue 974 1,177 Expenses relating to FFS and insurance contracts 992 1,013 Deferred income 88 97 Accrued income 31 29 The Group considers whether estimated future cash flows under the contracts will be sufficient to meet expected future costs.
Any deficiency is charged immediately to the Group Income Statement.
Claims frequency is sensitive to the reliability of appliances as well as the impact of weather conditions.
The contracts are not exposed to any interest rate risk or significant credit risk and do not contain any embedded derivatives.

AUDITORS REMUNERATION During 2017,  LLP PwC ceased to hold office as auditor and following a rigorous and competitive tender process, Deloitte LLP were appointed auditors of the Group.
Deloitte had been engaged to perform certain activities for the Group prior to their appointment as auditors, and before this the Group undertook a thorough review of all pre-existing arrangements.
As a result of this, certain arrangements were terminated during 2016 and whilst others were permissible under all relevant regulatory requirements, the decision was taken to wind them down during the first half of 2017.
The majority of fees noted in the caption All other services above, relate to such transitional arrangements, which have now ceased.
It is the Groups policy to seek competitive tenders for all major consultancy and advisory projects.
Appointments are made taking into account factors including expertise, experience and cost.
In addition, the Audit Committee has approved a detailed policy defining the types of work for which the Companys auditors can tender and the approvals required.
In the past, the Companys auditors have been engaged on assignments in addition to their statutory audit duties where their expertise and experience with the Group are particularly important, including due diligence reporting and corporate finance support for acquisitions and disposals.
RELATED UNDERTAKINGS The Group has a large number of related undertakings principally in the UK, US, Norway, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland.
