This price is usually set at a 20% discount to the market price for five-year plans and 10% for three-year plans.
The options must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract, otherwise they lapse.
Similar plans operate for our overseas employees.
Incentive Share Plan ISP Under the ISP, participants are only entitled to these shares in full at the end of a three-year period if the company has met the relevant predetermined corporate performance measures and if the participants are still employed by the group.

Deferred Bonus Plan DBP Under the DBP, awards are granted annually to selected employees.
Shares in the company are transferred to participants at the end of three years if they continue to be employed by the group throughout that period.
