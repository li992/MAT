Ascential plc Annual Report 2017 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2017 1.
Basis of preparation and accounting policies Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee, as adopted by the EU, and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Ascential plc the Company is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The registered office is located at The Prow, 1 Wilder Walk, London W1B 5AP.
The Company was admitted to unconditional trading on the London Stock Exchange and to the premium listing segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct authority on 12 February 2016 following a restructuring of the Group.
The restructuring resulted in the principles of reverse acquisition accounting under IFRS 3 Business Combinations being applied.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling GBP, which is the Companys functional currency, and have been rounded to the nearest one decimal place except where otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis see page 18 and under the historical cost convention, with the exception of items that are required by IFRS to be measured at fair value, principally certain financial instruments.
Accounting policies Note 33 details the principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and have been applied consistently to both periods presented.
Accounting developments and changes At the date of this report a number of accounting standards were issued, but not yet effective.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Endorsed by the EU effective 1 January 2018 Revenue from contracts with customers is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer and provides a single, principle based five-step model to be applied to all sales contracts.
It replaces the separate models for goods, services and construction contracts under current IFRS.
It also provides further guidance on the measurement of sales on contracts which have discounts and rebates.
During the year the group carried out a detailed review of the current recognition criteria for revenue against the requirements of IFRS 15.
This review examined subscription, exhibition, sponsorship, delegate and advisory revenue as well as the related costs to obtain and fulfil any of these contracts.
The expected impact of these changes on the 2017 consolidated income statement is immaterial at less than 0.2% of total revenue and less than 0.1% of retained earnings.
The estimated impact of the adoption of this new standard is based on the assessments undertaken to date.
The actual impact of adopting the standard at 1 January 2018 may differ as the new accounting policies are subject to change until the Group presents its first financial statements that include the date of initial application.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Endorsed by the EU effective 1 January 2018 The Group is required to adopt IFRS 9 Financial Instruments from 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 applies a forward-looking impairment model that will replace the currently applicable incurred loss model.
In contrast to the complex and rules based approach of IAS 39, the new hedge accounting requirements will provide an improved link to risk management and treasury operations and will be simpler to apply.
Based on the assessment carried out the Group believes that IFRS 9 will not have a material impact on its consolidated results or financial position and will not require a restatement of comparative figures in the 2018 Annual Report.
IFRS 16 Leases Endorsed by the EU effective 1 January 2019 IFRS 16 replaces the existing accounting requirements in IAS 17 Leases.
A single model for lessees will be required, eliminating off balance sheet accounting for non-exempt operating leases.
Related lease assets and liabilities will therefore come onto the balance sheet with interest charged on the lease liabilities.
The interest and the assets depreciation will replace the rental cost previously recognised in the income statement causing a change in the presentation and timing of income and expense recognition in the income statement.
The Group has commenced its initial assessment of the potential impact on the consolidated financial statements resulting from the application of IFRS 16 and it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of IFRS 16 until the detailed review has been completed although the impact is not expected to be material.
The current level of operating leases held by the Group is disclosed in Note 30.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of these financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
The actual future outcomes may differ from these estimates and give rise to material adjustments to the reported results and financial position of the Group.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity and assumptions or estimation are set out below and in more detail in the related notes.
80 Ascential plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements 2.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates continued Critical accounting judgements Alternative Performance Measures Note 5 The Group uses alternative performance measures which are not defined or specified under IFRS and comprises adjusting items.
Adjusting items include amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles, share-based payments and exceptional items.
The classification of exceptional items requires significant management judgement to determine the nature and presentation of such transactions.
Exceptional items are those which are considered significant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence.
These items are presented as a separate column on the face of the income statement but within their relevant income statement caption.
The Board view this as a relevant analysis to assist the reader in their understanding of the underlying performance and financial results of the Group.
Note 5 provides an analysis of exceptional items.
Key sources of estimation Business combinations Initial recognition of goodwill and intangible assets Note 12 Accounting for a business acquisition requires an assessment of the existence, fair value and expected useful economic lives of separable intangible assets such as brands, customer relationships and technology assets at the date of acquisition.
The fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed on acquisition is based on a number of estimates, including estimates of future performance of related businesses, as is determining the expected useful economic life of assets acquired.
The value attributed to these separable assets affects the amount of goodwill recognised and the value, together with the assessment of useful economic lives, determines future amortisation charges.
Acquired brands are valued using the relief-from-royalty method which requires estimation of future revenues and estimation of a royalty rate that an acquirer would pay in an arms length licensing arrangement to secure access to the same rights.
The theoretical royalty payments are discounted to obtain the cash flows to determine the asset value, which also requires estimation of an appropriate discount rate.
A TAB Tax amortisation benefit is then applied.
Acquired customer relationships are valued using the multi-period excess earnings method MEEM approach which starts with the total expected income streams for a business or group of assets as a whole and then deducts charges for all the other assets used to generate income.
Residual income streams are discounted and a TAB is applied.
The method requires estimation of future forecasts of the business and an appropriate discount rate.
Technology assets are valued using a reproduction cost method, which requires an estimate of all the costs a typical market participant would incur to generate an exact replica of the intangibles asset in the context of the acquired business.
In establishing the fair value and useful economic lives, the Group considers, for each acquisition and each asset or liability, the complexity of the calculations, the sources of estimation uncertainty and the risk of such estimations resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Details of those estimations that have a significant risk and the at-risk assets liabilities are disclosed as appropriate in Notes 12 and 33: the significance of the risk will depend on the size of the acquisition.
Such sources of estimation uncertainty include estimation of future cash flows, the determined weighted average cost of capital and estimated useful lives.
Valuation of contingent consideration and acquisition-related employment costs Note 22 Where a business combination agreement provides for an adjustment to the cost, contingent on future performance over the contractual earn-out period, the Group accrues the fair value, based on the estimated additional consideration payable as a liability at acquisition date.
To the extent that deferred contingent consideration is payable as part of the acquisition cost and is payable after one year from the acquisition date, the deferred consideration is discounted at an appropriate discount rate and accordingly carried at net present value in the consolidated balance sheet.
The liability is measured against the contractually agreed performance targets at each subsequent reporting date with any adjustments recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Acquisition-related employment costs are linked to continued employment over the contractual agreed period and contingent on future performance of the acquired business and are treated as remuneration and recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement.
The estimation of the likely liability requires the Group to make judgements concerning the future performance of related business over the deferred contingent consideration period or the period of employment.
Taxation Note 17 Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that their utilisation is probable.
The utilisation of deferred tax assets will depend on the judgement whether it is more likely than not that the Group will generate sufficient and suitable taxable income of the correct tax type and jurisdiction in the future, taking into account any legal restrictions on the length of the loss carryforward period.
Various factors are used to assess the probability of the future utilisation of deferred tax assets, including past operating results, operational plans and loss carryforward periods.
81 Ascential plc Annual Report 2017 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2017 3.
Operating segments The Group has three reportable segments under IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
In addition, there is a Group corporate function providing central services including finance, management and IT services to the Groups reportable segments.
The reportable segments offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different capabilities, technology and marketing strategies.
For each of the reportable segments, the Board the chief operating decision maker reviews internal monthly management reports.
The following summary describes the operations in each of the Groups reportable segments: Exhibitions & Festivals: organiser of market-leading exhibitions, congresses and festivals.
Information Services: produces intelligence, analysis and forecasting tools, subscription content including real-time online resources, live events and awards as well as advisory services.
The products are served across several industry sectors including fashion, retail, property, construction and politics.
The advisory and business services are targeted at media platforms and brands to drive growth through better marketing.
Discontinued operations: the disposal group of 13 Heritage Brands previously formed part of the Information Services segment before it was separately classified as held for sale and a discontinued operation on 31 December 2016.
Refer to Note 10 for further details on discontinued operations.
As at 31 December 2017 all discontinued operations have successfully been disposed of.
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below.
Reportable segment profits are measured at an Adjusted operating profit level, defined as reportable segment Adjusted EBITDA, less depreciation costs and amortisation in respect of software intangibles, without allocation of central Group costs.
This is the measure included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Board.
Reportable segment Adjusted EBITDA and reportable segment Adjusted operating profit are used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of the reportable segments relative to other comparable entities.
Total assets and liabilities for each reportable segment are not disclosed because they are not provided to the Board on a regular basis.
Total assets and liabilities are internally reviewed on a Group basis.

For the Sharesave, the range of exercise prices for shares and options outstanding at 31 December 2017 was 2.04 to 3.03 2016: 2.04 to 2.41.
For the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DABP and the PSP, all share options outstanding at 31 December 2017 had an exercise price of nil 2016: nil.
The free shares awarded under the SIP do not require payment from the participant to vest.
For further information refer to Note 33.
For shares and options outstanding at 31 December 2017, the weighted average remaining contractual life was 1.81 years 2016: 2.42 years.
Measurement of fair values The SIP, PSP, Sharesave and DABP are equity-settled plans, the fair value of which is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently remeasured unless conditions on which the award was granted are modified.
The fair values of the SIP, Sharesave, and DABP have been measured using the Black-Scholes model, while the PSP has been measured using a combination of both the Black-Scholes and stochastic models.
A Chaffe model an at-market put option variance of the Black-Scholes model has been used for the PSP awards subject to a holding period.
Non-market performance conditions were not taken into account in measuring fair values.
The principal assumptions required by these methodologies in 2017 awards were: PSP Sharesave SIP PSP subject to holding period Sharesave US Expected life 3 years 3 years 2 years 3 years 2 years Risk-free interest rate N A 0.08%-0.27% 0.33% 0.57% 0.47% Expected volatility N A 19%-20% 20.00% 26.80% 19.10% Expected dividend yield 1.93% 1.93% Expected volatility is usually calculated over the period of time commensurate with the remainder of the performance period immediately prior to the date of the grant.
Since the Company has only recently listed in February 2016, a proxy volatility figure had been applied to all PSP options granted in 2017.
The expected terms represent the term until vesting of the shares and options, as well as the holding period from the date of vesting.
For Sharesave share options, granted in September 2017, actual volatility of the Company since IPO has been applied and benchmarked against a 3-year average volatility of comparable companies.

86 Ascential plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements 9.
Taxation continued The Groups effective tax rate is higher than the UKs statutory tax rate mainly due to its mix of profits with increased profits coming from the US.
The impact of rate changes arises from the enactment of US tax reform on 22 December 2017 and the continuing reduction of the UK tax rate.
The tax rate change included 17.2 million in respect of the US and 0.4 million for the UK.
See Note 17 for further details.
The Group is subject to many different forms of taxation including, but not limited to, income and corporation tax, withholding tax and value added and sales taxes.
The Group has operations in 15 countries and multiple states in the US and sells its products and services into around 140 countries.
Furthermore, the Group renders and receives cross-border supplies and services in respect of affiliated entities which exposes the Group to tax risk due to transfer pricing rules that apply in many jurisdictions.
Tax law and administration is complex and often requires subjective determinations.
In addition tax audits, by their nature, can take a significant period of time to be agreed with the tax authorities.
Therefore, management is required to apply judgement to determine the level of provisions required in respect of its tax liabilities.
The Directors estimates of the level of risk arising from tax audit may change in the next year as a result of changes in legislation or tax authority practice or correspondence with tax authorities during specific tax audits.
It is not possible to quantify the impact that such future developments may have on the Groups tax positions.
Actual outcomes and settlements may differ from the estimates recorded in these consolidated financial statements.
The Group currently anticipates that the outcome of these uncertainties will only be resolved after more than one year.
However even where uncertainties may not be resolved within one year, material adjustments may arise as a result of a reappraisal of the assets or liabilities within the next year.

87 Ascential plc Annual Report 2017 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2017 11.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
For the purpose of proforma earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2016, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is stated as if the IPO completed on 12 February 2016 had occurred at the beginning of the 2016 financial year.

This intangible asset is included within the Exhibitions & Festivals segment.
This relates to Cannes Lions and was identified on acquisition in 2008.
It is managements judgement that this brand has an indefinite life due to the strength of its recognition and revenue stream and is tested annually for impairment.
It was tested for impairment using the value-in-use inputs for the Exhibitions & Festivals cash-generating unit CGU disclosed below and resulted in no impairment charge.
In the view of the Directors, no reasonable plausible change in assumptions would lead to an impairment.
Included within software intangible assets at 31 December 2017 is 3.3 million 2016: 2.1 million of assets under construction which were not being amortised at 31 December 2017.
Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets For reporting purposes, the CGUs have been aggregated into reportable segments.
The goodwill in CGUs are individually assessed for impairment each year as follows: Information Services Exhibitions & Discontinued million Festivals Clavis MediaLink WGSN Plexus OCR operations Total Net book value At 31 December 2017 184.1 56.8 32.7 151.3 38.2 26.0 489.1 At 31 December 2016 188.6 N A N A 157.8 34.8 28.2 18.5 427.9 The Group tests goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications of impairment.
The CGUs used in testing for impairment are defined as parts of the organisation, which the Directors judge to have largely independently managed cash flows.
During 2016, the creation of the disposal group and associated operational separation meant that the disposal group met the criteria for treatment as a separate CGU.
While the Exhibitions & Festivals segment and the discontinued operations segment in the segmental note disclosure Note 3 each represents one CGU, the Information Services segment consists of four CGUs and Clavis and OCR will be considered as a single CGU in 2018.
When testing for impairment, recoverable amounts for all of the Groups CGUs are measured at their value-in-use by discounting the future expected cash flows from the assets in the CGUs.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on Board-approved budgets and plans.
93 Ascential plc Annual Report 2017 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2017 14.
Intangible assets and goodwill continued The key assumptions and estimates used for value-in-use calculations are as follows: Future expected cash flows Cash flow forecasts for years one to three are derived from the most recent Board approved three-year Strategic Plan, which has been prepared after considering the current economic environment in each of our markets.
Cash flows beyond the plan period are extrapolated using an inflationary only growth rate of 2% for years four and five, and a 1% long-term growth rate is applied for the terminal value.
The estimates of future cash flows are consistent with past experience adjusted for the Groups estimate of future performance.
The other inputs include a risk-adjusted, pre-tax discount rate, calculated by reference to the weighted average cost of capital WACC of each country, or countries, the CGU operates in or a weighted average if the CGU operates in more than one country.
The long-term growth rate assumptions, and the discount rates applied to the risk-adjusted cash flow forecasts, are set out below.

The sensitivity testing identified no reasonable changes in key assumptions that would cause the carrying amount of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures as the Group is in a position to control the timing of their reversal and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
On 22 December 2017, the US Government enacted the Tax Cut and Jobs Act which reduces the US Federal tax rate from 35% to 21% with effect for periods beginning after 31 December 2017.
This results in a revaluation of US deferred tax assets and liabilities and an overall reduction of 16.6 million.
Net deferred tax assets have been recognised on the basis that sufficient taxable profits are forecast to be available in the future to enable them to be utilised.
At 31 December 2017, the Group has the following tax losses: Recognised Recognised Unrecognised Unrecognised Total Total million 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 US net operating losses 66.0 49.7 127.1 160.2 193.1 209.9 UK non-trading losses 54.1 59.7 54.1 59.7 Irish trading losses 16.4 16.4 UK capital losses 18.5 115.1 127.8 115.1 146.3 Total 120.1 127.9 258.6 288.0 378.7 415.9 96 Ascential plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements 17.

It has been agreed with the US tax authorities that these losses are available to offset against taxable profits subject to a restriction following the change of ownership that was deemed to have occurred upon the listing of Ascential plc in 2016.
In line with the US tax rules, the restriction of losses is, to a large extent, based on the valuation of the US tax group at the change of control date and this will be agreed with the US tax authorities in due course.
The valuation of the US tax group is therefore a source of estimation and an external valuation was commissioned to support the Groups position.
The recognised deferred tax asset is sensitive to a change in this valuation.
A total credit of 12.7 million was recognised as a result of the latest valuation and this was offset by a 10.1 million charge as a result of the reduced US tax rate.
The Board expects the deferred tax asset to be recovered over a number of years and considers it to be unlikely that there will be a consequential change in the estimates made that would lead to a material movement in the asset in the next 12 months.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements are the determined weighted average cost of capital and the forecast future profits of the acquired businesses.
For details of deferred and contingent consideration on current and comparative year acquisitions refer to Note 12 and for Money20 20 see below.
On 29 August 2014 the Group acquired 100% of the shares in Money2020, LLC Money20 20, an unlisted company based in the US whose primary activity is the organisation of global events on payments and financial services innovation.
The purchase price included consideration contingent on the results of 2015, 2016 and 2017 financial years payable in 2016 to 2018, recorded initially as a liability on acquisition, discounted to present value.
In addition, and subject to continued employment, certain vendors were also entitled to payments contingent on the results of 2015, 2016 and 2017 financial years and payable in 2016 to 2018, recorded as an acquisitionrelated employment cost accrued over the period in which the related services are being received.
There is no maximum or minimum limit on the total consideration payable including acquisition-related employment cost however there is a cap on the total amount paid as employment payments.
At 31 December 2017, there is only one payment outstanding estimated to total $21.5 million which was paid in February 2018.
Borrowings The maturity profile of the Groups borrowings, all of which are secured loans, was as follows: million 2017 2016 Non-current Two to five years 317.4 286.0 Total borrowings 317.4 286.0 Borrowings are shown net of unamortised issue costs of 3.3 million 2016: 4.3 million.

Reserves The restructure of the Group between 8 and 12 February 2016 resulted in the Company issuing 400,000,000 ordinary 0.10 shares to become the ultimate Parent of the Group, and to convert existing shareholder debt to equity.
This resulted in the recognition of 252.9 million in share premium, 8.8 million in the capital reserve and 157.9 million in a Group restructure reserve.
A merger reserve was recognised, reflecting the difference between the share capital and share premium of the Company on 8 February 2016, and the share capital, share premium and non-distributable reserves of the previous Parent of the Group at the same date.
On 8 June 2016, the Company completed a reduction of its share capital, whereby its nominal share capital was reduced to approximately 4.0 million.
The amount standing to the share premium account was cancelled, and 876,266,690 deferred shares of 0.01 each, which were issued by way of a bonus issue on 7 June 2016 for the purpose of capitalising the Companys capital reserve, were cancelled.
These steps resulted in distributable reserves of approximately 476.2 million.
Dividends Amounts recognised and paid as distributions to ordinary shareholders in the year comprise: 2017 2016 Pence Pence per m per share m share 2016 Interim dividend 6.0 1.5 2016 Final dividend 12.8 3.2 2017 Interim dividend 7.2 1.8 Dividends paid 20.0 5.0 6.0 1.5 After the reporting date, the Board proposed a final dividend of 3.8p per ordinary share from distributable reserves, resulting in a total dividend of 5.6p per ordinary share for the year ended 31 December 2017.
The final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and is therefore not included in the consolidated balance sheet as a liability at 31 December 2017.

Additional information i Group accounting policies Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Parent Company, its subsidiaries and share of the results of its associates and joint ventures drawn up to 31 December 2017 using consistent accounting policies throughout the current and preceding years.
The trading results of business operations are included in profit from continuing operations from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Foreign currency translation The functional currency of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures is the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group and the functional currency of the Parent Company.
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date of transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the consolidated income statement except for those on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against an investment in a foreign entity.
These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the investment, at which time they are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are also dealt with in equity.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate in force at the date of the initial transaction.
102 Ascential plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements 33.
Additional information continued As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated into pounds sterling at the rate of exchange applicable at the reporting date and their consolidated income statements are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
The exchange differences arising from the retranslation of foreign operations are taken directly to a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that operation is recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate at the reporting date.
Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments entered into to hedge foreign currency net assets and that satisfy the hedging conditions of IAS 39, are recognised in the currency translation reserve see separate accounting policy on derivative financial instruments.
Discontinued operations The Group classifies an operation as discontinued when it has disposed of or intends to dispose of a business component that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.
The post-tax profit or loss of the discontinued operations is shown as a single line on the face of the consolidated income statement, separate from the continuing operating results of the Group.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative consolidated income statement is represented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.
Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, net of discounts, customs duties and sales taxes.
Revenue is only recognised for barter transactions which are considered dissimilar to each other in nature, and a corresponding amount is included in operating costs.
Revenue for goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer.
Events revenue is recognised when the event takes place.
Data and online subscription revenues are recognised evenly over the life of the subscription.
Magazine subscriptions and advertising revenues are recognised according to the dispatch date of the publication.
Pre-paid subscription and event revenues are shown as deferred income and released to the income statement in accordance with the revenue recognition criteria above.
Effective 1 January 2018, the Group will adopt IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and the impact of the adoption of IFRS 15 for the 2017 results is quantified in Note 1 on page 80.
Alternative Performance Measures The consolidated financial statements include Alternative Performance Measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, as a measure of profitability in order to provide a better understanding of the trading performance of the Group.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure, defined as the Groups operating profit before expensing depreciation of tangible fixed assets and amortisation of software, exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, impairment of tangible fixed assets and software intangibles and share-based payments.
Refer to pages 19 to 21 for further details on Alternative Performance Measures.
These items are presented as exceptional within their relevant income statement category to assist in the understanding of the performance and financial results of the Group as these types of cost do not form part of the underlying business.
Examples of items that are considered by the Directors for designation as exceptional items include, but are not limited to: Significant capital structuring costs such as for the IPO as these are material and not a reflection of the ongoing business.
Costs incurred as part of the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses as these are considered to be material.
Gains or losses on disposals of businesses are considered to be exceptional in nature as these do not reflect the performance of the Group.
Material restructuring and separation costs within a segment incurred as part of a significant change in strategy as these are not expected to be repeated on a regular basis.
If provisions have been made for exceptional items in previous years, then any reversal of these provisions is treated as exceptional.
Finance costs and income Finance costs are recognised on an effective yield basis.
Finance income is recognised on the accruals basis.
Income tax The Group is primarily subject to corporation tax in the UK, the US, Brazil and China, and judgement and estimates of future profitability are required to determine the Groups deferred tax position.
If the final tax outcome is different to that assumed, resulting changes will be reflected in the consolidated income statement, unless the tax relates to an item charged to equity, in which case the changes in tax estimates on those items will be reflected in equity.
Income tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current tax and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is tax payable based on taxable profits for the period, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date along with any adjustment relating to tax payable in previous years.
Taxable profit differs from net profit in the consolidated income statement in that income or expense items that are taxable or deductible in other years are excluded, as are items that are never taxable or deductible.
103 Ascential plc Annual Report 2017 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2017 33.
Additional information continued Using the liability method, deferred tax is provided on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, except for certain temporary differences, such as goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year in which the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where they relate to the same taxing authority and the Group has a legal right to offset.
Business combinations In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the fair value of consideration paid for a business combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed in exchange for control.
The assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity are measured at fair value as at the acquisition date.
When the initial accounting for a business combination is determined, it is done so on a provisional basis with any adjustments to these provisional values made within 12 months of the acquisition date and are effective as at the acquisition date.
To the extent that deferred consideration is payable as part of the acquisition cost and is payable after one year from the acquisition date, the deferred consideration is discounted at an appropriate interest rate and, accordingly, carried at net present value in the consolidated balance sheet.
The discount component is then unwound as an interest charge in the consolidated income statement over the life of the obligation.
Where a business combination agreement provides for an adjustment to the cost of a business acquired contingent on future events, the Group accrues the fair value of the additional consideration payable as a liability at acquisition date.
This amount is reassessed at each subsequent reporting date with any adjustments recognised in the consolidated income statement.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured at the acquisition date through the consolidated income statement.
Transaction costs are expensed to the consolidated income statement as incurred.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of net identifiable assets of the business at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is allocated or grouped at the lowest levels.
for which there are identifiable cash flows, known as cashgenerating units or CGUs.
The Group considers that a CGU is a business unit because independent cash flows cannot be identified below this level.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is capitalised and subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
For goodwill impairment purposes, no CGU is larger than the reporting segments determined in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is assessed on the basis of the value-in-use estimate for CGUs to which the goodwill relates.
Where the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount the goodwill is considered impaired.
Any impairment is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Other intangibles Intangible assets other than goodwill are those that are distinct and can be sold separately or arise from legal rights.
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets purchased separately are capitalised at cost.
The cost of intangible assets is amortised and charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Brands 10-30 years Customer relationships 8-20 years Databases 3-10 years Software 2-5 years Useful lives are examined every year and adjustments are made, where applicable, on a prospective basis.
Website development costs included under databases relating to websites which are revenue generating are capitalised and amortised over three to five years.
Development costs relating to websites which are not revenue generating are taken immediately to the consolidated income statement.
Assets held for sale Where the Group expects to recover the carrying amount of a group of assets through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, and a sale is considered to be highly probable at the reporting date, the assets are classified as held for sale and measured at the lower of cost and fair value less costs to sell.
No depreciation or amortisation is charged in respect of non-current assets classified as held for sale.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost comprises expenditure directly attributable to the purchase of the asset.
Assets are depreciated to their estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life as follows: Short leasehold property over the period of the lease Office equipment 2-5 years Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.
104 Ascential plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements 33.
Additional information continued An item of property, plant or equipment is written off either on disposal or when there is no expected future economic benefit from its continued use.
Any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value of the asset is included in the consolidated income statement in the year the item is derecognised.
Investments in associates and joint ventures The Groups investments in its associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and thereafter are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost less any impairment in value.
The consolidated income statement reflects the Groups share of an associate or joint ventures profit after tax.
Where the Groups share of losses in an associate or joint venture exceeds its investment, the Group ceases to recognise further losses unless an obligation exists for the Group to fund the losses.
Where a change in net assets has been recognised directly in the associate or joint ventures equity, the Group recognises its share of those changes in the statement of changes in equity when applicable.
Adjustments are made to align the accounting policies of the associate or joint venture with the Groups and to eliminate the Groups share of unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost represents purchase cost, including attributable overheads, and is determined using a first-in, first-out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.
Costs relating to future exhibitions, festivals and congresses are deferred within inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
These costs are charged to the consolidated income statement when the event takes place.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for impairment.
Specific provisions are made and charged to the consolidated income statement when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms.
Collective provisions are made based on estimated losses inherent within receivables, based on the overall level of receivables past due.
These provisions are developed over time based on the review of aged debt, the type of debt and experience.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the consolidated income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash, short-term deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Derivatives and other financial instruments Derivatives, including currency options and swaps, forward exchange contracts, and interest rate swaps and caps, are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting date.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classified as a separate asset or liability.
The fair value is determined by using market data and the use of established estimation techniques such as discounted cash flow and option valuation models.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged as described below.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the consolidated income statement as they arise.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months.
Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed below.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method, with the exception of debt repurchases which are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the year of the repurchase.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised only when it is virtually certain.
The expense relating to any provision is presented in the consolidated income statement net of any reimbursement.
If the time value of money has a material effect on quantifying the provision, the provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance charge.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating losses are not provided for.
105 Ascential plc Annual Report 2017 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2017 33.
Additional information continued Shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust The Employee Benefit Trust EBT provides for the issue of shares to Group employees under share incentive schemes.
The Company has control of the EBT and accounts for the EBT as an extension to the Company in the consolidated financial statements.
Accordingly, shares in the Company held by the EBT are included in the consolidated balance sheet at cost as a deduction from equity.
Leases Assets held by the Group under leases which transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
On initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.
Assets held under other leases are classified as operating leases and are not recognised in the Groups consolidated balance sheet.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The benefit of any lease incentives is recognised as a reduction in rental expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
ii Additional information about financial instruments and financial risk management Financial risk management Information about the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, the Groups exposure to the risks arising from financial instruments, and the Groups management of capital, is disclosed below.
Market risk a Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar and the euro.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions to which the Group is already committed, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Foreign currency movements impact on the consolidated income statement together with its cash flow profile and leverage ratio position.
The impact depends on whether there is a surplus or deficit in each currency from operating activities together with the interest and finance charge in those currencies.
The Groups policy has been to protect its cash flow and leverage ratio position by maintaining a proportion of currency debt in proportion to its currency earnings to obtain natural offsets.
For illustrative purposes, the table below provides details of the impact on revenue and Adjusted EBITDA if the actual reported results were restated for sterling weakening by 1% against the USD and Euro rates in isolation.
2017 2016 Adjusted Adjusted million Revenue EBITDA Revenue EBITDA Increase in revenue Adjusted EBITDA if: Sterling weakens by 1% against US dollar in isolation 1.2 0.6 0.7 0.4 Sterling weakens by 1% against euro in isolation 1.1 0.9 0.9 0.7 Additionally, each 1% movement in the euro to pounds sterling exchange rate has a circa 1.5 million 2016: 1.5 million impact on the carrying value of borrowings.
Each 1% movement in the US dollar to pounds sterling exchange rate has a circa 1.0 million impact on the carrying value of borrowings 2016: 0.8 million.
b Cash flow and interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from medium and long-term borrowings to the extent that the underlying debt instruments are not at fixed rates of interest.
The Group has entered into interest rate caps to convert a portion of its bank borrowings from fully floating to capped rates to mitigate this risk.
As at 31 December 2017, the total notional amount of outstanding interest rate caps to which the Group is committed is 109.2 million 2016: 182.9 million.
The fair value of the interest rate caps as at 31 December 2017 was a 0.1 million asset 2016: 0.1 million asset of which nil 2016: 0.1 million is included within non-current assets.
These interest rate caps are measured at fair value through profit or loss and are Level 2 financial instruments.
These derivative instruments were not traded in an active market and the fair value is determined by using third party valuations based on forward yield curves.
This technique maximises the use of observable market data where it is available and relies as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
All significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable.
In the year ended 31 December 2017, if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 31 December 2017 would have decreased or increased by 1.4 million 2016: 1.3 million.
The effective annual interest rate at 31 December 2017 was 1.9% 2016: 2.3%.

Additional information continued Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the financial assets in the consolidated balance sheet as disclosed in Note 24. a Treasury-related credit risk The Group has treasury policies in place which manage the concentration of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties.
Each counterparty has an individual limit which comprises of their long-term and short-term ratings by Standard & Poors and Moodys as well as their individual five year Credit Default Swap price.
As at 31 December 2017, cash and cash equivalents totalled 45.8 million 2016: 61.9 million, of which 83% 2016: 87% was held with banks or financial institutions with long-term ratings of AA3 or better or short-term ratings of A-1 P-1.
In accordance with the Groups treasury policies and exposure management practices, counterparty credit exposure limits are continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity.
Management does not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
b Trading risk Risk arises principally from payment default by customers.
The general policy of the Group is not to risk assess all new customers and so retail credit risk information has not been included in these consolidated financial statements.
Management does not, however, expect any significant losses in respect of receivables that have not been provided for as shown in Note 19.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity in the form of sufficient cash or funding from adequate credit facilities to meet such liabilities under both normal and stressed conditions.
The Groups major banking facilities are detailed below: Facility Drawn As at 31 December 2017 Local Local million currency currency Final maturity Interest Facility A 66.0 66.0 66.0 66.0 Feb-21 LIBOR plus 1.50% Facility B $96.0 71.1 $96.0 71.1 Feb-21 LIBOR plus 1.50% Facility C 171.0 151.8 171.0 151.8 Feb-21 LIBOR plus 1.50% Revolving credit facility 95.0 95.0 $43.0 31.8 Feb-21 LIBOR plus 1.25% Total facilities 383.9 320.7 Facility Drawn As at 31 December 2016 Local Local million currency currency Final maturity Interest Facility A 66.0 66.0 66.0 66.0 Feb-21 LIBOR plus 2.25% Facility B $96.0 77.9 $96.0 77.9 Feb-21 LIBOR plus 2.25% Facility C 171.0 146.4 171.0 146.4 Feb-21 LIBOR plus 2.25% Revolving credit facility 95.0 95.0 Feb-21 LIBOR plus 2.00% Total facilities 385.3 290.3 Subsequent to refinancing on 12 February 2016, the Group was required to adhere to a net leverage ratio covenant of 4.5x which was measured at December 2016 and then semi-annually thereafter.
The covenant ratio fell to 4.0x in December 2017.
The Group operated within this covenant limit during the period to 31 December 2017.
The Group has a margin ratchet on its current facilities based on its covenant leverage position reported in its semi-annual covenant compliance certificate.
Due to the covenant leverage ratio falling to below 2.0x at the annual compliance certificate for 31 December 2016, the margins were reduced by 0.75% from 21 March 2017 and these remained unchanged for the remainder of 2017.

2 No amounts are due in more than five years.
The financial and derivative liabilities are shown in the period in which they are due to be repaid.
The interest payments on borrowings due in less than one month represents the actual interest due, while the interest due greater than one month is an estimate based on current interest rates and exchange rates.
Cash flows in respect of borrowings represent contractual payments under the Groups lending facilities in place as at 31 December 2017.
Borrowings as disclosed in Note 23 are stated net of unamortised arrangement fees of 3.3 million as at 31 December 2017 2016: 4.3 million.
Both contingent consideration and acquisition related employment costs are based on the future performance of the acquired business to which they relate.
Performance is assessed using forecast profits and the current three-year plan which is updated annually.
Forecasts are inherently a source of management estimation, resulting in a range of outcomes.
The likely range of outcomes of the combined contingent consideration and acquisition-related employment costs are disclosed in Note 12 for current and prior year acquisitions and Note 22 for Money20 20.
The above table includes: contingent consideration of 65.5 million 2016: 57.3 million, representing anticipated undiscounted future payments: acquisition-related employment costs, to the extent to which they are accrued at 31 December 2017, of 33.4 million 2016: 23.1 million.
The anticipated future payments on acquisition-related employment costs total 60.2 million: and deferred consideration of 5.2 million 2016: 2.9 million which is not impacted by performance.
Capital risk management The Treasurer of the Group is responsible for managing compliance with bank covenants.
Reports on both actual and projected bank covenant ratios are provided to the Board on a regular basis.
