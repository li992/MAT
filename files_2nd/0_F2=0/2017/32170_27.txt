The Company directly holds investments in Assura Group Limited and Assura IH Limited, which are both intermediate holding companies for the property owning subsidiaries in the Assura plc group.
During the period the Company received a dividend of 150 million from its wholly owned subsidiary company, Assura Group Limited, which was settled by clearing an intercompany balance owed by Assura plc to Assura Group Limited.
The resulting reduction in net assets of Assura Group Limited led to management completing an impairment assessment of the investment held in Assura Group Limited.
Following this assessment, an impairment charge of 111.7 million was recorded.
A corresponding amount has been transferred from the merger reserve to retained earnings which is considered distributable.

com 103 Notes to the Company accounts continued For the year ended 31 March 2017 F. Risk management Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Company.
Credit risks within the Company derive from non-payment of loan balances.
However, as the balances are receivable from subsidiary companies the risk of default is considered minimal.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
The Company balance sheet largely comprises illiquid assets in the form of investments in subsidiaries and loans to subsidiaries, which have been used to finance property investment and development activities.
Accordingly the realisation of these assets may take time and may not achieve the values at which they are carried in the balance sheet.
The Company had trade and other payables of 1.0 million at 31 March 2017 31 March 2016: 1.5 million.
There are no differences between the book value of cash and trade payables, nor is there any meaningful interest rate sensitivity.
