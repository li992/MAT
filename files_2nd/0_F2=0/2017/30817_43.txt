Consolidated Financial Statements Alternative Performance Measures Financial statements Alternative Performance Measures 95 Consolidated Income Statement Introduction 96 Consolidated Statement We assess the performance of the Group using a variety of alternative performance measures.
We principally discuss the Groups results on of Comprehensive an adjusted and or underlying basis.
Results on an adjusted basis are presented before exceptional and other items.
Income Alternative performance measures have been defined and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure below, along with the rationale behind 97 Consolidated Balance Sheet using the measures.
98 Consolidated Cash Flow The alternative performance measures we use are: organic revenue growth, underlying operating profit and margin, EBITDA and underlying Statement EBITDA, underlying profit before tax, underlying deferred tax, adjusted basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share, return on invested 99 Consolidated Statement capital, operating cash flow, free cash flow, cash conversion, and net debt.
A reconciliation from these adjusted performance measures of Changes in Equity to the nearest measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is presented below.
The alternative performance measures we use may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies.
100 Accounting Policies of theGroup Where applicable, divisional measures are calculated in accordance with Group measures.
107 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Exceptional and other items Statements The Groups income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results before exceptional and other items.
The 155 Company Balance Sheet directors believe that presentation of the Groups results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the Groups financial performance, as exceptional and other items are identified by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.
This presentation is consistent with the way that financial 156 Company Statement of performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Executive Committee and assists in providing a meaningful Changes in Equity analysis of the trading results of the Group.
In determining whether an event or transaction is treated as an exceptional and other item, 157 Accounting Policies of management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.
theCompany Examples of charges or credits meeting the above definition and which have been presented as exceptional items in the current and or prior 159 Notes to the Company Financial Statements years include costs relating to significant acquisitions disposals of significant businesses and investments, significant business restructuring programmes, asset impairment charges and impact of the US Tax Cuts and Job Act 2017.
In the event that other items meet the criteria, 166 Subsidiaries and Related which are applied consistently from year to year, they are treated as exceptional and other items.
Other items include amortisation of Undertakings intangible assets arising onacquisition and valued in accordance withIFRS 3.
These charges are presented separately to improve comparability 173 Five Year Summary of the Groups underlying profitability with peer companies.

Measures 179 Shareholder Information Organic revenue growth Organic revenue growth is a measure which seeks to reflect the performance of the Group that will contribute to long-term sustainable growth.
As such, organic revenue growth excludes the impact of acquisitions or disposals, fuel price movements and foreign exchange movements.
We focus on the trends in organic revenue growth.
A reconciliation from the growth in reported revenue, the most directly comparable IFRS measures, to the organic revenue growth, is set out below.

As such, they exclude the impact of exceptional and other items.
We focus on the trends in underlying operating profit and margins.

EBITDA is defined as the Group profit or loss before depreciation, amortisation, net finance expense and taxation.
Underlying EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before exceptional and other items.
EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate the operating financial performance of companies.
We consider EBITDA and underlying EBITDA to be useful measures of our operating performance because they approximate the underlying operating cash flow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation.
EBITDA and underlying EBITDA are not direct measures of our liquidity, which is shown by our cash flow statement, and need to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.

ROIC is calculated by dividing underlying operating profit for ROIC by net assets for ROIC, both of which are at the same exchange rate which is the average of the last 13 months spot rate.
The net assets for ROIC are calculated by averaging the net assets over the last 13 months.
A reconciliation from underlying operating profit to underlying operating profit for ROIC is set out below.

Operating cash flow of Comprehensive is defined as the aggregate of cash generated by operations, purchase of property, plant and equipment, purchase of intangible assets less Income Ontic licences not accounted for under IFRS 3, and proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment.
97 Consolidated Balance Sheet Operating cash flow is primarily an overall operational performance measure.
However, we also believe it is an important indicator of our liquidity.
98 Consolidated Cash Flow Statement Operating cash flow reflects the cash we generate from operations after net capital expenditure which is a significant ongoing cash outflow 99 Consolidated Statement associated with investing in our infrastructure.
In addition, operating cash flow excludes cash flows that are determined at a corporate level of Changes in Equity independently of ongoing trading operations such as dividends, share buy-backs, acquisitions and disposals, financing costs, tax payments, dividends from associates and the repayment and raising of debt.
Operating cash flow is not a measure of the funds that are available for 100 Accounting Policies of theGroup distribution to shareholders.

Cash conversion is defined as operating cash flow as a percentage of continuing and discontinued operating profit.

Free cash flow is set out in note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and reconciled to net cash inflow from operating activities, the most directly comparable IFRS measure.
Net debt Net debt consists of borrowings both current and non-current, less cash and cash equivalents and the fair value adjustment on the US Private Placement loan.
Net debt is a measure of the Groups net indebtedness that provides an indicator of the overall balance sheet strength.
It is also a single measure that can be used to assess both the Groups cash position and its indebtedness.
The use of the term net debt does not necessarily mean that the cash included in the net debt calculation is available to settle the liabilities included in this measure.
Net debt is considered to be an alternative performance measure as it is not defined in IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure is the aggregate of borrowings current and non-current, and cash and cash equivalents.
A reconciliation from these to net debt is given below.
