MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING In accordance with the requirements of Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the following report is provided by management in respect of the Groups internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15 f or rule 15d15 f under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 : Unilevers management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Group: Unilevers management has used the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO framework 2013 to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

Managements assessment and conclusion excludes Carver Korea Co, Ltd, Mae Terra, TAZO, Sundial, and Schmidts Naturals from this assessment, as they were acquired on 1 November 2017, 1 December 2017, 11 December 2017, 18 December 2017 and 31 December 2017 respectively.
