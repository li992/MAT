Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Financial statements and other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements 147 19 Financial instruments Accounting policy Financial instruments comprise investments other than investments in joint ventures or associates, trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, payables and accruals, borrowings and derivative financial instruments.
Investments other than investments in joint ventures and associates are classied as either held for trading or available for sale, as described in note 17.
These investments are typically classied as either Level 2 or 3 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of such investments is based on standard valuation techniques, including market comparisons and discounts of future cash ows, having regard to maximising the use of observable inputs and adjusting for risk.
Trade receivables are carried in the statement of financial position at invoiced value less allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Irrecoverable amounts are estimated based on the ageing of trade receivables, experience and circumstance.
Borrowings and payables are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost other than xed rate borrowings in designated hedging relationships for which the carrying amount of the hedged portion of the borrowings is subsequently adjusted for the gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
Where an effective hedge is in place against changes in the fair value of xed rate borrowings, the hedged borrowings are adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged with a corresponding income or expense included in the income statement within finance costs.
The offsetting gains or losses from remeasuring the fair value of the related derivatives are also recognised in the income statement within finance costs.
When the related derivative expires, is sold or terminated, or no longer qualies for hedge accounting, the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged borrowing is amortised in the income statement over the period to maturity of the borrowing using the effective interest method.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash ows are recognised net of tax in other comprehensive income and accumulated in thehedge reserve.
If a hedged rm commitment or forecasted transaction results in therecognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time that the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of anasset or a liability, amounts deferred in the hedge reserve are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Any ineffective portion of hedges is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash ow hedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is either retained in the hedge reserve until the rm commitment or forecasted transaction occurs, or, where a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, is immediately credited or expensed in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments are classied as held for trading and recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The fair values of interest rate swaps, interest rate options, forward rate agreements and forward foreign exchange contracts represent the replacement costs calculated using observable market rates of interest and exchange.
The fair value of long-term borrowings is calculated by discounting expected future cash ows at observable market rates.
These instruments are accordingly classied as Level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
The main financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity risk, market risk comprising interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk andcredit risk.
Financial instruments are used to finance the Group's businesses and to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
The Groups businesses do not enter into speculative derivative transactions.
Details of financial instruments subject to liquidity, marketand credit risks are described below.
Liquidity risk The Group maintains a range of borrowing facilities and debt programmes to fund its requirements at competitive rates.
The balance of long-term debt, short-term debt and committed bank facilities is managed to provide security of funding, taking into account the cash generation cycle of the business and the uncertain size and timing of acquisition spend.
To accommodate the significant free cash ow generated by the Group and to capitalise on an inexpensive source of funding, a meaningful portion of the overall debt portfolio is typically kept short-term as long as there exists acceptable liquidity in the commercial paper markets and sufficient capacity under committed credit lines.
The Group's treasury policies ensure adequate liquidity by requiring that a no more than $1.5bn of term debt matures in any 12-month period, b the sum of term debt maturing over the ensuing 12 months plus short-term borrowings is less than the sum of available cash plus committed facilities and c minimum levels of borrowing with maturities over three and five years are maintained.
The treasury policies ensure debt efficiency by a targeting certain levels of short-term borrowings across a given year, b maintaining a weighted average maturity of the gross debt portfolio of approximately five years and c minimising surplus cash balances.
From time to time, based on cash ow and market conditions, the Group may redeem term debt early or repurchase outstanding debt in the open market.
148 RELX Group Annual reports and financial statements 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 19 Financial instruments continued Debt is issued to meet the funding requirements of various jurisdictions and in the currencies that are needed.
It is recognised that debt can act as a natural translation hedge of earnings, net assets and net cash ow in currencies other than the reporting currency.
For this reason, the majority of the Groups net debt is denominated in US dollars and euros, reecting the Groups largest geographical markets.
There were no changes to the Groups long-term approach to capital and liquidity management during the year.
The remaining contractual maturities for borrowings and derivative financial instruments are shown in the table below.
The table shows undiscounted principal and interest cash ows and includes contractual gross cash ows to be exchanged as part of cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts where there is a legal right of set-off.

Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Financial statements and other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements 149 19 Financial instruments continued At 31 December 2017, the Group had access to a $2,000m committed bank facility maturing in July 2020, which was undrawn.
This facility backs up short-term borrowings.
All borrowings that mature within the next two years can be covered by the facility and by utilising available cash resources.
The committed bank facility is subject to financial covenants typical to the Groups size and financial strength.
The Group had significant headroom within these covenants for the year ended 31 December 2017.
There are no financial covenants in any outstanding public bonds.
Market risk The Groups primary market risks are to interest rate uctuations and exchange rate movements.
Derivatives are used to manage the risks associated with interest rate and exchange rate movements and the Group does not enter into speculative derivatives.
Derivatives used by theGroup for hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources.
The impact of market risks on net post-employment benefit obligations and taxation is excluded from the following market risk sensitivity analysis.
Interest rate exposure management The Groups interest rate exposure management policy aims to minimise interest costs with an acceptable level of year on year volatility.
To achieve this, the Group uses xed rate term debt, interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and interest rate options.
Interest rate derivatives are used only to hedge an underlying risk and no net market positions are held.
At 31 December 2017, 44% of gross borrowings were either xed rate or had been xed through the use of interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated decrease in net finance costs of 26m 2016: 25m, based on the composition of financial instruments including cash, cash equivalents, bank loans and commercial paper borrowings at 31 December 2017.
A 100 basis point rise in interest rates would result in an estimated increase in net finance costs of 26m 2016: 25m.
The impact on net equity of a theoretical change in interest rates as at 31 December 2017 is restricted to the change in carrying value ofoating rate to xed rate interest rate derivatives in a designated cash ow hedge relationship and undesignated interest rate derivatives.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated increase in net equity of 2m 2016: 2m and a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would reduce net equity by an estimated 2m 2016: 2m.
The impact of a change in interest rates on the carrying value of xed rate borrowings in a designated fair value hedge relationship would be offset by the change in carrying value of the related interest rate derivative.
Fixed rate borrowings not in a designated hedging relationship are carried at amortised cost.
Foreign currency exposure management Translation exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of individual businesses whose operational currencies are other than sterling.
Some of these exposures are offset by denominating borrowings in US dollars, euros and other currencies.
Currency exposures on transactions denominated in a foreign currency are generally hedged using forward contracts.
In addition, recurring transactions and future investment exposures may be hedged, in advance of becoming contractual.
The precise policy differs according to the specic circumstances of the individual businesses.
Highly predictable future cash ows may be covered for transactions expected to occur during the next 24 months 50months for the scientific, Technical & Medical subscription businesses within limits dened according tothe period before the transaction is expected to become contractual.
Cover takes the form of foreign exchange forward contracts.
As at 31 December 2017, the amount of outstanding foreign exchange cover against future transactions was 1.3bn 2016: 1.5bn.
A theoretical weakening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2017 would decrease the carrying value of net assets, excluding net borrowings, by 630m 2016: 658m.
This would be offset to a degree by a decrease in net borrowings of 448m 2016: 389m.
A strengthening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2017 would increase the carrying value of net assets, excluding net borrowings, by 630m 2016: 658m and increase net borrowings by 448m 2016: 389m.
A retranslation of the Group's net profit for the year, assuming a 10% weakening of all foreign currencies against sterling but excluding transactional exposures, would reduce net profit by 148m 2016: 105m.
A 10% strengthening of all foreign currencies against sterling on this basis would increase net profit for the year by 148m 2016: 105m.
150 RELX Group Annual reports and financial statements 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 19 Financial instruments continued Credit risk The Group seeks to manage interest rate risk and limit foreign exchange risks described above by the use of financial instruments and as a result hasa credit risk from the potential non-performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which are unsecured.
The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged.
The Group also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long-term credit ratings, and the amounts outstanding with each of them.
In certain situations, the Group enters into credit support arrangements with derivative counterparties to mitigate the credit exposures arising from hedge gains on the related financial instruments.
Under these arrangements, the Group receives or pays cash collateral equal to the mark to market valuation of the related derivative asset or liability on monthly settlement dates.
At 31 December 2017, nil cash collateral had been received, resulting in no payable balance to be offset against the related derivative assets of 2m in the statement of financial position 2016: 4m of cash collateral paid and the resulting receivable balance offset against the related derivative liabilities of 5m.
The Group has treasury policies in place which do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated lower than AA3 by Standard & Poors, Moodys and Fitch.
At 31 December 2017, cash and cash equivalents totalled 111m 2016: 162m, of which 90% 2016: 94% was held with banks rated AA3 or better.
The Group also has credit risk with respect to trade receivables due from its customers, which include national and state governments, academic institutions and large and small enterprises including law rms, book stores and wholesalers.
The concentration of credit risk from trade receivables is limited due to the large and broad customer base.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the business units where they arise.
Where appropriate, business units seek to minimise this exposure by taking payment in advance and through management of credit terms.
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on managements assessment of the risk taking into account the ageing prole, experience and circumstance.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, recorded in the statement of financial position.
Included within trade receivables are the following amounts which are past due but for which no allowance has been made: past due up to one month 220m 2016: 187m : past due two to three months 97m 2016: 96m : past due four to six months 44m 2016: 45m : and past due greater than six months 40m 2016: 31m.
Examples of trade receivables which are past due but for which no allowance has been made include those receivables where there is no concern over the creditworthiness of the customer and where the history ofdealings with the customer indicate the amount will be settled.
Hedge accounting The hedging relationships that are designated under IAS 39 Financial Instruments are described below.
Fair value hedges The Group has entered into interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of xed rate borrowings due to interest rate and foreign currency movements which could affect the income statement.
Interest rate derivatives including cross-currency interest rate swaps with a principal amount of 2,021m 2016: 1,403m were in place at 31 December 2017 swapping xed rate term debt issues denominated in US dollars USD and euros to oating rate USD and euro debt respectively for the whole or part of their term.

152 RELX Group Annual reports and financial statements 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 19 Financial instruments continued Gross borrowings as at 31 December 2017 included 24m 2016: 30m in relation to fair value adjustments to borrowings previously designated in a fair value hedge relationship which were fide-designated in 2008.
The related derivatives were closed out on fide-designation with a cash inow of 62m.
3m 2016: 3m of these fair value adjustments were amortised in the year as a reduction tonance costs.
Gross borrowings were also reduced by 2m 2016: increased by 6m in relation to fair value adjustments to borrowings previously designated in a fair value hedging relationship which were fide-designated during the year or prior year.
6m 2016: 8m of these fair value adjustments were amortised in the year as a reduction to finance costs.
The related derivatives remained on the balance sheet at 31 December 2017 with a carrying value of 2m 2016: 8m.
Cash ow hedges The Group enters into two types of cash ow hedge: 1 Debt hedges comprising interest rate derivatives which x the interest expense on a portion of forecast oating rate debt including commercial paper, short-term bank loans and oating rate term debt, and cross-currency interest rate derivatives which hedge the cash ow exposure arising from foreign currency denominated debt.
2 Revenue hedges comprising forward foreign exchange contracts which x the exchange rate on a portion of future foreign currency subscription revenues forecast by the businesses for up to 50 months.
Movements in the hedge reserve in 2016 and 2017, including gains and losses on cash ow hedging instruments, were asfollows: Total hedge Debt Revenue reserve hedges hedges pre-tax m m m Hedge reserve at 1 January 2016: gains losses deferred 6 44 38 Losses arising in 2016 26 139 165 Amounts recognised in income statement 27 19 46 Exchange translation differences 1 5 4 Hedge reserve at 1 January 2017: gains losses deferred 8 169 161 Gains arising in 2017 63 74 137 Amounts recognised in income statement 65 90 25 Exchange translation differences 1 2 3 Hedge reserve at 31 December 2017: gains losses deferred 5 7 2 All cash ow hedges were highly effective throughout the two years ended 31 December 2017.
A deferred tax charge of 1m 2016: credit of 28m: 2015: credit of 8m in respect of the above gains and losses at 31 December 2017 was also deferred in the hedge reserve.
Of the amounts recognised in the income statement in the year, losses of 90m 2016: losses of 19m: 2015: gains of 19m were recognised in revenue, and gains of65m 2016: losses of 27m: 2015: losses of 48m were recognised in finance costs.
A tax credit of 1m 2016: 12m: 2015: 1m was recognised in relation to these items.
The deferred gains and losses on cash ow hedges at 31 December 2017 are currently expected to be recognised in the income statement in future years as follows: Total hedge Debt Revenue reserve hedges hedges pre-tax m m m 2018 3 18 15 2019 1 1 2020 2 10 8 2021 2 1 1 2022 and beyond 7 7 Gains losses deferred in hedge reserve at end of year 5 7 2 The cash ows for these hedges are expected to occur in line with the recognition of the gains and losses in the income statement, other than in respect of certain forward foreign exchange hedges on subscriptions, where cash ows may be expected to occur in advance of the subscription year.
