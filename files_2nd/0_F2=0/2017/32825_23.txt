Strategic Report Governance Financial Additional Statements Information Alternative performance measures Alternative performance measures are denoted by the symbol When assessing and discussing the Groups reported financial performance, financial position and cash flows, Glencore makes reference to Alternative performance measures APMs, which are not defined or specified under the requirements of IFRS, but are derived from the financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The APMs are consistent with how the business performance is measured and reported within the internal management reporting to the Board and management and assist inproviding meaningful analysis of the Groups results both internally and externally in discussions with the financial analyst and investment community.
The Group uses APMs to improve the comparability of information between reporting periods and segments and to aid the understanding of the activity taking place across the Group by adjusting for items that are of an infrequent nature and by aggregating or disaggregating notably in the case of relevant material associates and joint ventures accounted for on an equity basis certain IFRS measures.
APMs are also used to approximate the underlying operating cash flow generation of the operations Adjusted EBITDA.
Investments in the extractive industry are typically significant and the initial spend generally occurs over several years, upfront, prior to the operations generating cash.
As a result, the investments are sometimes made with partners and an assessment to approximate the operating cash flow generation pay-back of the investment Adjusted EBITDA is required.
Against this backdrop, the key APMs used by Glencore are Adjusted EBITDA, Net funding Net debt and the disaggregation of the equivalent key APMs of our relevant material associates and joint ventures Proportionate adjustment to enable a consistent evaluation of the financial performance and returns attributable to the Group.
Adjusted EBITDA is a useful approximation of the operating cash flow generation by eliminating depreciation and amortisation adjustments.
Adjusted EBITDA is not a direct measure of our liquidity, which is shown by our cash flow statement and needs to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.
Proportionate adjustments are useful to enable a consistent evaluation of the financial performance and returns available to the Group, irrespective of the differing accounting treatments required to account for our minority joint ownership interests of our relevant material investments.
Net funding is an aggregation of IFRS measures Borrowings less cash and cash equivalents and Net debt is Net funding less Readily marketable inventories and provides a measure of our financial leverage and, through Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA relationships, provides an indication of relative financial strength and flexibility.
APMs used by Glencore may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies.
APMs have limitations as an analytical tool, and a user of the financial statements should not consider these measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of the Groups results of operations: and they may not be indicative of the Groups historical operating results, nor are they meant to be a projection or forecast of its future results.
Listed below are the definitions and reconciliations to the underlying IFRS measures of the various APMs used by the Group.
Proportionate adjustment For internal reporting and analysis, management evaluates the performance of Antamina copper zinc mine 34% owned, Cerrejn coal mine 33% owned, Collahuasi copper mine 44% owned and Glencore Agri 50% owned under the proportionate consolidation method reflecting Glencores proportionate share of the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of these investments.

Adjusted EBIT EBITDA Adjusted EBIT EBITDA provide insight into our overall business performance a combination of cost management, seizing market opportunities and growth, and are the corresponding flow drivers towards our objective of achieving industry-leading returns.
Adjusted EBIT is the net result of revenue less cost of goods sold and selling and administrative expenses, plus share of income from associates and joint ventures, dividend income and the attributable share of Adjusted EBIT of relevant material associates and joint ventures, which are accounted for internally by means of proportionate consolidation, excluding Significant items, see definition below.
In addition, the segment information includes Glencore Agri, which was disclosed as a discontinued operation until close of transaction on 1 December 2016, see note 24 of the financial statements.
Adjusted EBITDA consists of Adjusted EBIT plus depreciation and amortisation, including the related Proportionate adjustments.

Glencore Annual Report 2017 199 Alternative performance measures continued APMs derived from the statement of financial position Net funding Net debt and Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA Net funding debt demonstrates how our debt is being managed and is an important factor in ensuring we maintain an investment grade rating status and a competitive cost of capital.
Net debt is defined as total current and non-current borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, readily marketable inventories and related Proportionate adjustments.
The net debt assumed in the Volcan acquisition completed mid-November 2017 has also been adjusted to provide a more consistent and comparative analysis, but mostly to reflect the Groups relatively low 23.3% economic ownership compared to its 63.0% voting interest in this still fully ring-fenced listed entity, with its standalone, independent and separate capital structure.
In addition, the relationship of Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA provides an indication of financial flexibility.
Readily marketable inventories RMI RMI comprising the core inventories which underpin and facilitate Glencores marketing activities, represent inventories, that in Glencores assessment, are readily convertible into cash in the short term due to their liquid nature, widely available markets and the fact that price risk is primarily covered either by a forward physical sale or hedge transaction.
Glencore regularly assesses the composition of these inventories and their applicability, relevance and availability to the marketing activities.
As at 31 December 2017, $22,225 million 2016: $17,093 million of inventories were considered readily marketable.
This comprises $16,649 million 2016: $12,707 million of inventories carried at fair value less costs of disposal and $5,576 million 2016: $4,386 million carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Total readily marketable inventories includes $1,559 million related to the relevant material associates and joint ventures see note 2 presented under the proportionate consolidation method, comprising $1,305 million of inventory carried at fair value less cost of disposal and $254 million carried at lower of cost or net realisable value.
Given the highly liquid nature of these inventories, which represent a significant share of current assets, the Group believes it is appropriate to consider them together with cash equivalents in analysing Group net debt levels and computing certain debt coverage ratios and credit trends.
