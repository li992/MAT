Accounting Policies The Company is a public limited company PLC incorporated in England and Wales, with registered office of 50 Lothian Road, Festival Square, Edinburgh EH3 9WJ.
The principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year in the preparation of these Financial Statements, are set out below: a Basis of preparation The Financial Statements have been prepared under UK Company Law, FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Ireland and under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of investments, and in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice GAAP and the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies and dated November 2014 and updated in January 2017 with consequential amendments, and the Companies Act 2006.
Presentation of the Income Statement In order to reflect better the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with the SORP, supplementary information which analyses the Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Income Statement.
The net revenue return is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Companys compliance with certain requirements set out in Sections 1158 and 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
Judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty The preparation of the financial statements requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the Statement of Financial Position date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year.
However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
In the process of applying the Companys accounting policies, the Directors have made the following judgement, apart from those involving estimations, which has the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements: The unquoted investment in Frostrow Capital LLP has been valued by the Directors at twice Frostrows annual recurring revenues with a 10% liquidity discount applied.
b Investments held at fair value through profit or loss As the Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of dividends, interest or increases in fair value, investments are held at fair value through profit or loss and are initially recognised at fair value.
The Company manages and evaluates the performance of these investments on a fair value basis in accordance with its investment strategy, and information about the investments is provided internally on this basis to the Board.
Fair value for quoted investments is deemed to be bid market prices, or last traded price, depending on the convention of the stock exchange on which they are quoted.
Changes in the fair value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss, and gains and losses on disposal are recognised in the Income Statement as a capital item.
All purchases and sales of investments are accounted for on the trade date basis.
The Companys policy is to expense transaction costs on acquisition through the gains on investment at fair value through profit or loss.
The total of such expenses, showing the total amounts included in disposals and acquisitions are disclosed in note 9 on page 57. c Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are recognised in Revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is Capital in nature, in which case it is included in Capital.
Overseas dividends are stated gross of any withholding tax.
When the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of cash dividend foregone is recognised in Revenue.
Fixed returns on non-equity shares are recognised on a time apportionment basis.

Accounting Policies continued Income continued Special dividends: In deciding whether a dividend should be regarded as a Capital or Revenue receipt, the Company reviews all relevant information as to the reasons for and sources of the dividend on a case by case basis depending upon the nature of the receipt.
The limited liability partnership LLP profit share is recognised in the financial statements when the entitlement to the income is established.
Deposit interest receivable is taken to revenue on an accruals basis.
d Dividend Payments Dividends paid by the Company on its shares are recognised in the financial statements in the period in which they are paid and are shown in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
e Expenditure and Finance Charges All the expense and finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged through the revenue column of the Income Statement except as follows: 1 expenses which are incidental to the acquisition or disposal of an investment are treated as part of the cost or proceeds of that investment as explained in 1 b above : 2 expenses are taken to the Capital reserve via the capital column of the Income Statement, where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In line with the Boards expected long term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income from the Companys portfolio, 67% of the portfolio management fee, AIFM fee and finance costs are taken to the Capital reserve and the balance to the Revenue reserve.
f Taxation Current tax is provided at the amounts expected to be paid or recovered.
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not been reversed by the Statement of Financial Position date other than those differences regarded as permanent.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the reversal of timing differences can be deducted.
Any liability to deferred tax is provided for at the rate of tax enacted or substantially enacted.
Any tax relief obtained in respect of AIFM and portfolio management fees, finance costs and other capital expenses charged or allocated to the capital column of the Income Statement is reflected in the capital reserve and a corresponding amount is charged against the revenue column of the Income Statement.
The tax relief is the amount by which corporation tax payable is reduced as a result of these capital expenses.
g Foreign currency Transactions recorded in overseas currencies during the year are translated into Sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in overseas currencies at the Statement of Financial Position date are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date.
h Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and demand deposits readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
i Nature and purpose of reserves Special reserve The special reserve arose following Court approval in July 2002 to transfer 13.16 million from the share premium account.
This reserve is distributable and has historically been used to fund any share buy-backs by the Company.
Capital redemption reserve This reserve arose when ordinary shares were redeemed by the Company and subsequently cancelled, at which point the amount equal to the par value of the ordinary share capital was transferred from the ordinary share capital to the capital redemption reserve.

Risk Management As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objective as stated on page 16.
In pursuit of its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the revenue returns available for distribution.
The Companys financial instruments comprise mainly of equity investments, cash balances, borrowings, debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The principal risks inherent in managing the Companys financial instruments are market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
These risks and the Directors approach to the management of them are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 23 to 25.
Market risk Market risk comprises three types of risk: market price risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.
Market price risk As an investment company, performance is dependent on the performance of the underlying companies and securities in which it invests.
The market price of investee companies shares is subject to their performance, supply and demand for the shares and investor sentiment regarding the company or the industry sector in which it operates.
Consequently market price risk is one of the most significant risks to which the Company is exposed.
At 30 September 2017, the fair value of the Companys assets exposed to market price risk was 1,186,911,000 2016: 956,592,000 see page 62.
If the fair value of the Companys investments at the Statement of Financial Position date increased or decreased by 10%, while all other variables remained constant, the capital return and net assets attributable to shareholders for the year ended 30 September 2017 would have increased or decreased by 118,691,000 or 74.7p per share 2016: 95,659,000 or 67.2p per share.
No derivatives or hedging instruments are currently utilised to manage market price risk.

Risk Management continued Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
Interest rate movement may affect: the interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings the level of income receivable from variable interest securities and cash deposits the fair value of investments of fixed rate securities The Companys main exposure to interest rate risk during the year ended 30 September 2017 was through its three year 75,000,000 secured multicurrency committed revolving credit facility with an additional 25 million facility available if required with Scotiabank Europe PLC maturing in October 2019.
Borrowings varied throughout the year as part of the Boards endorsed policy.
Borrowings at the year-end amounted to 36,700,000 2016: 34,500,000 at an interest rate of 1.39% LIBOR plus 1.05% per annum.
If the above level of borrowing was maintained for a year a 1% increase decrease in LIBOR would decrease increase the revenue return by 121,000, 2016: 114,000 decrease increase the capital return by 246,000 2016: 231,000, and decrease increase the net assets by 367,000 2016: 345,000.
The weighted average interest rate, during the year, on borrowings under the above mentioned revolving credit facility was 1.40% 2016: 1.88%.
On the 4 October 2016 the Board renewed the facility agreement with Scotiabank, for a further three years.
Under the new agreement interest is charged at LIBOR plus 1.05% per annum, previously charged at LIBOR plus 1.30% per annum.
At 30 September 2017, the Companys financial assets and liabilities exposed to interest rate risk were as follows: 2017 2017 2016 2016 within more than within more than one year one year one year one year 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating rates: Assets Cash and cash equivalents 11,482 12,198 Liabilities Creditors: amount falling due within one year borrowings under the loan facility 34,500 Creditors: amount falling due after more than one year borrowings under the loan facility 36,700 Exposure to fixed rates: Assets Investments at fair value through profit or loss# 634 492 Liabilities #Celtic 6% cumulative convertible preference shares and Frostrow Capital LLP AIFM Investment.

Risk Management continued Currency risk The Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the functional currency and presentational currency of the Company.
At 30 September 2017, the Companys investments, with the exception of six, were priced in sterling.
The six exceptions, Heineken, listed in the Netherlands, Remy Cointreau listed in France, and Dr. Pepper Snapple, The Kraft Heinz Company, Manchester United and Mondelez International, all listed in the United States together represent 19% of the portfolio.
The AIFM and the Portfolio Manager monitor the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a continuous basis and regularly report to the Board.
The Company does not hedge against foreign currency movements, but the Portfolio Manager takes account of the risk when making investment decisions.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between its receipt and the time that the income is included in the Financial Statements.
Foreign currency exposure At 30 September 2017 the Company held 113,264,000 2016: 84,704,000 of investments denominated in U. S. dollars and 111,520,000 2016: 86,306,000 in Euros.
Currency sensitivity The following table details the sensitivity of the Companys profit or loss after taxation for the year to a 10% increase or decrease in the value of sterling compared to the U. S. dollar and Euros 2016: 10% increase and decrease.
The analysis is based on the Companys foreign currency financial instruments held at each Statement of Financial Position date.
If sterling had weakened against the U.
S dollar and Euros, as stated above, this would have had the following effect: 2017 2016 000 000 Impact on revenue return 67 100 Impact on capital return 24,980 18,982 Total return after tax increase in shareholders funds 25,047 19,082 If sterling had strengthened against the foreign currencies as stated above, this would have had the following effect: 2017 2016 000 000 Impact on revenue return 55 82 Impact on capital return 20,438 15,530 Total return after tax decrease in shareholders funds 20,493 15,612 Credit Risk Credit risk is the Companys exposure to financial loss from the failure of a counterparty to deliver securities or cash for acquisition or disposals of investments which could result in the Company suffering a financial loss.
Credit risk is managed as follows: Investment transactions are carried out only with brokers whose creditworthiness is reviewed by the Portfolio Manager.
Transactions are ordinarily undertaken on a delivery versus payment basis whereby the Companys custodian bank ensures that the counterparty to any transactions entered into by the Company has delivered its obligation before any transfer of cash or securities away from the Company is completed.
Any failing trades in the market are closely monitored by both the AIFM and the Portfolio Manager.
Cash is only held at banks that have been identified by the Board as reputable and of high credit quality.
Bank of New York Mellon has a credit rating of Aa1 Moodys and AAS&P.

Risk Management continued At 30 September 2017, the exposure to credit risk was 15,572,000 2016: 15,554,000, comprising: 2017 2016 000 000 Fixed assets: Non-equity investments preference shares 154 72 Current assets: Other receivables amounts due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable 3,936 3,284 Cash and cash equivalents 11,482 12,198 Total exposure to credit risk 15,572 15,554 Liquidity risk of investments Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted equities and other quoted securities which are readily realisable: their value is significantly in excess of the Companys financial liabilities.
Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the Statement of Financial Position at their fair value or at a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Valuation of financial instruments The Company measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset as follows: Level 1 quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2 prices of recent transactions for identical instruments.
Level 3 valuation techniques using observable and unobservable market data.
The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the Statement of Financial Position are grouped into the fair value hierarchy at the reporting date as follows: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 30 September 2017 000 000 000 000 Equity investments 1,185,077 1,185,077 Limited liability partnership interest Frostrow Capital LLP 1,200 1,200 AIFM Capital contribution Frostrow Capital LLP 480 480 Preference share investments 154 154 1,185,231 1,680 1,186,911 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 30 September 2016 000 000 000 000 Equity investments 955,100 955,100 Limited liability partnership interest Frostrow Capital LLP 1,000 1,000 AIFM Capital contribution Frostrow Capital LLP 420 420 Preference share investments 72 72 955,172 1,420 956,592 The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained on page 52.

The Board, with the assistance of the AIFM and the Portfolio Manager, regularly monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital.
These reviews include: the level of gearing, set at limits in normal market conditions, between 5% and 25% of net assets, which takes account of the Companys position and the views of the Board, the AIFM and the Portfolio Manager on the market: the extent to which revenue reserves should be retained or utilised: and ensuring the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
