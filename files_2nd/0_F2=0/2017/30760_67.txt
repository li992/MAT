ii Change in insurance liabilities recognised as an expense The purpose of the following table is to reconcile the change in insurance liabilities, net of reinsurance, shown on the income statement, to the change in insurance liabilities recognised as an expense in the relevant movement tables in this note.
The components of the reconciliation are the change in provision for outstanding claims on long-term business which is not included in a separate movement table, and the unwind of discounting on general insurance reserves which is included within finance costs in the income statement.
For general insurance and health business, the change in the provision for unearned premiums is not included in the reconciliation as, within the income statement, this is included within earned premiums.

Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2017 167 Strategic report Governance IFRS financial statements Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 40 Insurance liabilities continued b Long-term business liabilities i Business description The Group underwrites long-term business in a number of countries as follows: In the UK, in Aviva Life & Pensions UK UKLAP mainly in: New With-Profits Sub-Fund NWPSF where the with-profits policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits, with the shareholders receiving the balance.
Any surplus or deficit emerging in NWPSF that is not distributed as bonus will be transferred from this sub-fund to the Reattributed Inherited Estate External Support Account RIEESA see below.
Old With-Profits Sub-Fund OWPSF, UKLAP With-Profits Sub-Fund UKLAP WPSF and Provident Mutual Sub-Fund PMSF of UKLAP, where the with-profits policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits, with the shareholders receiving the balance.
The FP With-Profits Sub-Fund FP WPSF, which was formally closed to new business during 2017 and where shareholders are entitled to 10% of the distributed profits, plus 60% of the surplus arising on pre-demutualisation non-profit and unitised business and noninvestment sources of surplus on policies held by post-demutualisation policyholders.
The Friends Provident demutualisation occurred in 2001.
The FLC New With-Profits Sub-Fund FLC New WPSF, the FLC Old With-Profits Sub-Fund FLC Old WPSF, the WL With-Profits Sub-Fund WL WPSF and FLAS With-Profits Sub-Fund FLAS WPSF which are closed to new business and where policyholders are entitled to 90% of the distributed profits aside from certain policies in the FLC New WPSF and the FLC Old WPSF with guaranteed bonus rates, and certain policies in the WL WPSF which are reinsured into the fund where the shareholders do not receive one-ninth of the bonus.
FPLAL With-Profits Sub-Fund FPLAL WPSF and Secure Growth Fund SGF, which are closed to new business and where policyholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits.
The Non-profit fund, where shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits.
Shareholder profits on unitised with-profits business written in UKLAP WPSF and on stakeholder unitised with-profits business written in NWPSF and OWPSF are derived from management fees and policy charges, and emerge in the non-profit funds.
RIEESA is a non-profit fund where shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits, but these cannot be distributed until the lock-in criteria set by the Reattribution Scheme have been met.
RIEESA is used to provide capital support to NWPSF, and has been used in the past to write non-participating business.
In France, the majority of policyholders benefits are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
In addition, a substantial number of policies participate in investment returns, with the balance being attributable to shareholders.
In other operations in Europe and Asia, a range of long-term insurance and savings products are written.
ii Group practice The long-term business provision is calculated separately for each of the Groups life operations.
The provisions for overseas subsidiaries have generally been included on the basis of local regulatory requirements, modified where necessary to reflect the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Material judgement is required in calculating the provisions and is exercised particularly through the choice of assumptions where discretion is permitted.
In turn, the assumptions used depend on the circumstances prevailing in each of the life operations.
Provisions are most sensitive to assumptions regarding discount rates and mortality morbidity rates.
Where discount rate assumptions are based on current market yields on fixed interest securities, allowance is made for default risk implicit in the yields on the underlying assets.
Bonuses paid during the year are reflected in claims paid, whereas those allocated as part of the bonus declaration are included in the movements in the long-term business provision.
For UK with-profits life funds falling within the scope of FRS 27, which was grandfathered from UK regulatory requirements under IFRS 4 prior to the adoption of Solvency II, an amount may be recognised for the present value of future profits PVFP on non-participating business written in a with-profits fund where the determination of the realistic value of liabilities in that with-profits fund takes account, directly or indirectly, of this value.
For NWPSF, OWPSF, UKLAP WPSF and PMSF no adjustment for this value is made to the participating insurance and investment contract liabilities or the unallocated divisible surplus.
For FP WPSF, FPLAL WPSF, FLC New WPSF, FLC Old WPSF, FLAS WPSF, WL WPSF and SGF the non-participating liabilities are measured on a realistic basis with implicit recognition of the present value of future profits and hence no additional explicit adjustment is required for this value.
iii Methodology and assumptions The main method of actuarial valuation of liabilities arising under long-term insurance contracts is the gross premium method which involves the discounting of projected premiums and claims.
The gross premium method uses the amount of contractual premiums payable and includes explicit assumptions for interest and discount rates, mortality and morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions can vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience.
Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2017 168 Strategic report Governance IFRS financial statements Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 40 Insurance liabilities continued a UK With-profits business The Groups UK with-profit liabilities are evaluated by reference to FRS27, which was grandfathered under IFRS 4, prior to the adoption of Solvency II.
Under these rules, provision for guarantees and options within realistic liabilities are measured using market-consistent stochastic models.
A stochastic approach includes measuring the time value of guarantees and options, which represents the additional cost arising from uncertainty surrounding future economic conditions.
The key elements of the realistic liabilities are the with-profits benefit reserve WPBR and the present value of the expected cost of any payments in excess of the WPBR referred to as the cost of future policy-related liabilities.
The realistic liability for any contract is equal to the sum of the WPBR and the cost of future policy-related liabilities, which includes the value of any planned enhancements to benefits agreed by the Company.
The WPBR for an individual contract is generally calculated on a retrospective basis, and represents the accumulation of the premiums paid on the contract, allowing for investment return, taxation, expenses and any other charges levied on the contract.
For a small proportion of business, a prospective valuation approach is used, including allowance for anticipated future regular and final bonuses.
The cost of future policy-related liabilities include: Maturity Guarantees: Guarantees on surrender, including no-MVR Market Value Reduction Guarantees and Guarantees linked to inflation: Guaranteed Annuity Options: GMP Guaranteed Minimum Pension underpin on Section 32 transfers: and Expected payments under Mortgage Endowment Promise.
The cost of future policy-related liabilities is determined using a market-consistent approach and, in the main, this is based on a stochastic model calibrated to market conditions at the end of the reporting period.
Non-market-related assumptions for example, persistency, mortality and expenses are assessed on a best estimate basis with reference to Company and wider industry experience, adjusted to take into account future trends.
On 1 January 2016 the Solvency I Pillar 1 regulatory regime was replaced with Solvency II, under which realistic liabilities were replaced with Best Estimate Liabilities BEL.
Key differences between the realistic liabilities and the Solvency II BEL are that BEL excludes the shareholders share of future bonuses, excludes certain planned and approved enhancements to benefits part of Solvency II surplus funds and uses a higher yield EIOPA specified for future investment returns and discounting.
Adjusting the yield used in the calculation of the BEL by removing the volatility and credit risk adjustments, including planned enhancements that are part of Solvency II surplus funds and making other less significant adjustments, results in a valuation in accordance with FRS 27.
For periods subsequent to 31 December 2015, the with-profits business is valued based on an adjusted Solvency II BEL assessment.
The principal assumptions underlying the cost of future policy-related liabilities are as follows: Future investment return A risk-free rate equal to the spot yield on UK swaps is used for the valuation of with-profits business.
The rates vary according to the outstanding term of the policy, with a typical rate as at 31 December 2017 of 1.29% 2016: 1.25% for a policy with ten years outstanding.
Volatility of investment return Volatility assumptions are set with reference to implied volatility data on traded market instruments, where available, or on a best estimate basis where not.
Volatility 2017 2016 Equity returns 20.9% 23.9% Property returns 16.4% 16.4% The equity volatility used depends on term, money-ness and region.
The figure shown is for a sample UK equity, at the money, with a tenyear term.
Future regular bonuses Annual bonus assumptions for 2018 have been set consistently with the year-end 2017 declaration.
Future annual bonus rates reflect the principles and practices of each fund.
In particular, the level is set with regard to the projected margin for final bonus and the change from one year to the next is limited to a level consistent with past practice.
Mortality Mortality assumptions for with-profits business are set with regard to recent Company experience and general industry trends.
The mortality tables used in the valuation are summarised below: Mortality table used 2017 2016 Assurances, pure endowments and deferred annuities before vesting Nil or Axx00 adjusted Nil or Axx00 adjusted Pensions business after vesting and pensions annuities in payment PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus allowance for future mortality allowance for future mortality improvement improvement Allowance for future mortality improvement is in line with the rates shown for non-profit business below.
Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2017 169 Strategic report Governance IFRS financial statements Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 40 Insurance liabilities continued Expenses Maintenance charge assumptions for with-profits business are generally expressed as a fixed per policy charge in line with agreements between Aviva Life Services UK UKLS and Aviva Life & Pensions UK UKLAP.
The assumptions increase by future charge inflation over the lifetime of each contract, which is 50% RPI, 100% RPI or 100% RPI 1% depending on product type.
Any excess of expenses charged by UKLS to UKLAP over the charges specified by the agreements is borne by the non-profits business.
Non-profit business The valuation of non-profit business is based on grandfathered regulatory requirements under IFRS 4 prior to the adoption of Solvency II, adjusted to remove certain regulatory reserves and margins in assumptions, notably for annuity business.
Conventional non-profit contracts, including those written in the with-profits funds, are valued using gross premium methods which discount projected future cash flows.
The cash flows are calculated using the amount of contractual premiums payable, together with explicit assumptions for investment returns, inflation, discount rates, mortality, morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience with an allowance for prudence.
For FP WPSF, FPLAL WPSF, FLC New WPSF, FLC Old WPSF, FLAS WPSF, WL WPSF and SGF the non-participating liabilities are measured on a realistic basis with implicit recognition of the present value of future profits.
For unit-linked and some unitised with-profits business, the provisions are valued by adding a prospective non-unit reserve to the bid value of units.
The prospective non-unit reserve is calculated by projecting the future non-unit cash flows using prudent assumptions and on the assumption that future premiums cease, unless it is more onerous to assume that they continue.
Where appropriate, allowance for persistency is based on actual experience.
Valuation discount rate assumptions are set with regard to yields on the supporting assets and the general level of long-term interest rates as measured by gilt yields.
An explicit allowance for risk is included by making an explicit deduction from the yields on corporate bonds, mortgages and deposits, based on historical default experience of each asset class.
A further margin for risk is then deducted for all asset classes.
The provisions held in respect of guaranteed annuity options are a prudent assessment of the additional liability incurred under the option on a basis and method consistent with that used to value basic policy liabilities, and includes a prudent assessment of the proportion of policyholders who will choose to exercise the option.
Maintenance expense assumptions for non-profit business are generally expressed as a per policy charge set with regards to an allocation of current year expense levels by broad category of business and using the policy counts for in-force business.
The assumptions also include an allowance for prudence and increase by future expense inflation over the lifetime of each contract.
Expense inflation is assumed to be in line with RPI.
An additional liability is held if projected per-policy expenses in future years are expected to exceed current assumptions.
Further, explicit project expense liabilities are held for non-discretionary project costs that typically relate to mandatory regulatory requirements.
Expense-related liabilities are only held where expenses are not covered by anticipated future profits in the liability methodology, notably for unit-linked contracts.
Valuation discount rates for business in the non-profit funds are as follows: Valuation discount rates Gross of investment expenses 2017 2016 Assurances Life conventional non-profit 0.8% to 2.5% 0.5% to 2.6% Pensions conventional non-profit 1.0% to 2.4% 0.8% to 2.1% Annuities Conventional immediate and deferred annuities 1.0% to 2.8% 0.6% to 2.8% Non-unit reserves on Unit Linked business Life 0.8% to 1.2% 0.7% to 1.3% Pensions 0.8% to 1.5% 0.7% to 1.6% 1 Income Protection Active lives 1.0% to 2.5% 1.0 to 2.6% Claims in payment level and index linked 1.0% to 1.5% 0.2 % to 1.6% 1 Income protection business pre-existing UKLAP now uses a nominal swaps curve for all sub-classes and has been shown as an equivalent flat rate in the table above.
Previously, a real interest rate was used for the index linked claims in payment.
The above valuation discount rates are after reduction for risk, but before allowance for investment expenses.
For conventional immediate annuity business the allowance for risk comprises long-term assumptions for defaults or in the case of equity release assets expected losses arising from the No-Negative-Equity guarantee.
These allowances vary by asset category and for some asset classes by rating.
The risk allowances made for corporate bonds, mortgages including healthcare mortgages, commercial mortgages and infrastructure assets, and Equity Release for business transferred in from Aviva Annuity UK Ltd in 2017 equated to 48 bps, 40 bps, and 102 bps respectively at 31 December 2017 2016: 47 bps, 48 bps, and 102 bps respectively.
The risk allowances made for corporate bonds and mortgages for business transferred in from Friends Life Limited in 2017 equated to 47 bps and 33 bps respectively at 31 December 2017 2016: 37 bps and 42 bps respectively.
For corporate bonds, the allowance represented approximately 37% and 39% respectively of the average credit spread for the portfolios transferred in from Aviva Annuity UK Limited and from Friends Life Limited 2016: 31% and 31% respectively.
The total valuation allowance for business transferred from Aviva Annuity UK Limited in respect of corporate bonds and mortgages, including healthcare mortgages but excluding equity release, was 1.3 billion 2016: 1.3 billion over the remaining term of the portfolio while for Friends Life Limited it was 0.5 billion 2016: 0.5 billion.
The total valuation allowance for business transferred from Aviva Annuity UK Limited in respect of equity release assets was 1.2 billion 2016: 1.1 billion.
Total liabilities for the annuity business were 52 billion at 31 December 2017 2016: 50 billion.
Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2017 170 Strategic report Governance IFRS financial statements Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 40 Insurance liabilities continued Mortality assumptions for non-profit business are set with regard to recent Company experience and general industry trends.
The mortality tables used in the valuation are summarised below: Mortality tables used 2017 2016 Assurances Non-profit AM00 AF00 or TM08 TF08 AM00 AF00 or TM00 TF00 adjusted for smoker status adjusted for smoker status and and age sex specific factors age sex specific factors Pure endowments and deferred annuities before vesting AM00 AF00 adjusted AM00 AF00 adjusted Annuities in payment Pensions business and general annuity business PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus allowance for future mortality allowance for future mortality improvement improvement For the largest portfolio of pensions annuity business transferred from Aviva Annuity UK Limited, the underlying mortality assumptions for Males are 104.0% of PCMA00 2016: 98.0% of PCMA00 with base year 2000: for Females the underlying mortality assumptions are 94.5% of PCFA00 2016: 91.0% of PCFA00 with base year 2000.
A negative provision of 0.1billion is also held to allow for higher mortality at old ages being experienced in our portfolio relative to the above assumptions.
For the largest portfolio of pensions annuity business transferred from Friends Life Limited, the underlying mortality assumptions for Males are 103.4% of PCMA00 2016: 98.5% of PCMA00 with base year 2000: for Females the underlying mortality assumptions are 104.4% of PCFA00 2016: 98.5% of PCFA00 with base year 2000.
For all the main portfolios of annuities, improvements are based on CMI 2016 S 7.5 Advanced with adjustments 2016: CMI 2015 with a long-term improvement rate of 1.75% 2016: 1.75% for males and 1.5% 2016: 1.5% for females, both with an addition for prudence of 0.5% 2016: 0.5% to all future annual improvement adjustments.
The CMI 2016 tables have been adjusted by adding 0.25% and 0.35% to the initial rate of mortality improvements for males and females respectively to allow for greater mortality improvements in the annuitant population relative to the general population on which CMI 2016 is based, and uses the advanced parameters to taper the long-term improvement rates to zero between ages 90 and 115 the core parameters taper the long-term improvement rates to zero between ages 85 and 110.
For pension annuity business transferred in from Aviva Annuity UK limited, year-specific adjustments are made to allow for potential selection effects due to the development of the Enhanced Annuity market and covering possible selection effects from pension freedom reforms.
b France The majority of reserves arise from single premium savings products and are based on the accumulated fund values, adjusted to maintain consistency with the value of the assets backing the policyholder liabilities.
For traditional business, the net premium method is used for prospective valuations, in accordance with local regulation, where the valuation assumptions depend on the date of issue of the contract.
The valuation discount rate also depends on the original duration of the contract and mortality rates are based on industry tables.
Valuation discount rates Mortality tables used 2017 2016 2017 and 2016 TD73-77, TD88-90, TH00-02 TF00-02, H AVDBS, F AVDBS Life assurances 0% to 4.5% 0% to 4.5% H SSDBS, F SSDBS Annuities 0% to 2.0% 0% to 4.5% TGF05 TGH05 c Other countries In all other countries, local generally accepted interest rates and published standard mortality tables are used for different categories of business as appropriate.
The tables are based on relevant experience and show mortality rates, by age, for specific groupings of people.
iv Movements The following movements have occurred in the gross long-term business provisions during the year 2017 2016 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 137,218 125,348 Provisions in respect of new business 5,731 5,224 Expected change in existing business provisions 7,747 8,235 Variance between actual and expected experience 1,520 4,752 Impact of non-economic assumption changes 1,175 536 Impact of economic assumption changes 2,115 5,930 1 Other movements recognised as an expense 180 29 Change in liability recognised as an expense note 40a ii 624 7,164 2 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 8,124 Foreign exchange rate movements 1,252 4,761 Other movements 2 55 Carrying amount at 31 December 130,972 137,218 1 Other movements during 2017 primarily relates to a special bonus distribution to with-profits policyholders UK Life.
2 The movement during 2017 primarily relates to the disposal of Antarius in France and a major share of the business in Spain offset by the consolidation of the Poland and Vietnam joint ventures.
Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2017 171 Strategic report Governance IFRS financial statements Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 40 Insurance liabilities continued For many types of long-term business, including unit-linked and participating funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
The 1.5 billion impact of variance between actual and expected experience in 2017 is mainly due to higher than expected equity returns in the UK increasing with-profits and unit-linked liabilities.
The impact of non-economic assumption changes of 1.2 billion in 2017 reduces the carrying value of insurance liabilities and relates mainly to release of reserves for longevity which is partially offset by increase in expense and persistency reserves for the UK business with the impact on profit partially offset by a corresponding reduction in reinsurance assets.
The 2.1 billion impact of economic assumption changes in 2017 reflects a decrease in valuation interest rates in response to increasing interest rates and narrowing spreads, primarily in respect of immediate annuity and participating insurance contracts in the UK.
For participating business, a movement in liabilities is generally offset by a corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus and does not impact on profit.
Where assumption changes do impact on profit, these are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 44, together with the impact of movements in related non-financial assets.
c General insurance and health liabilities i Provisions for outstanding claims Delays occur in the notification and settlement of claims and a substantial measure of experience and judgement is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost of which cannot be known with certainty at the statement of financial position date.
The reserves for general insurance and health business are based on information currently available.
However, it is inherent in the nature of the business written that the ultimate liabilities may vary as a result of subsequent developments.
Provisions for outstanding claims are established to cover the outstanding expected ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses LAE in respect of all claims that have already occurred.
The provisions established cover reported claims and associated LAE, as well as claims incurred but not yet reported and associated LAE.
The Group only establishes loss reserves for losses that have already occurred.
The Group therefore does not establish catastrophe equalisation reserves that defer a share of income in respect of certain lines of business from years in which a catastrophe does not occur to future periods in which catastrophes may occur.
When calculating reserves, the Group takes into account estimated future recoveries from salvage and subrogation, and a separate asset is recorded for expected future recoveries from reinsurers after considering their collectability.
The table below shows the split of total general insurance and health outstanding claim provisions and IBNR provisions, gross of reinsurance, by major line of business.
As at 31 December 2017 As at 31 December 2016 Outstanding Outstanding claim IBNR Total claim claim IBNR Total claim provisions provisions provisions provisions provisions provisions m m m m m m Motor 5,039 1,339 6,378 4,690 1,623 6,313 Property 1,734 114 1,848 1,711 57 1,768 Liability 1,814 1,270 3,084 1,907 1,257 3,164 Creditor 24 11 35 23 20 43 Other 353 103 456 418 3 421 8,964 2,837 11,801 8,749 2,960 11,709 ii Discounting Outstanding claims provisions are based on undiscounted estimates of future claim payments, except for the following classes of business for which discounted provisions are held: Rate Mean term of liabilities Class 2017 2016 2017 2016 Reinsured London Market business 0.7% to 2.6% 2.0% 9 years 9 years Latent claims 0.7% to 1.9% 0.00% to 2.31% 8 to 17 years 6 to 15 years Structured settlements 0.5% to 3.0% 0.15% to 2.98% 7 to 39 years 13 to 39 years The gross outstanding claims provision before discounting was 11,346 million 2016: 12,196 million.
The period of time which will elapse before the liabilities are settled has been estimated by modelling the settlement patterns of the underlying claims.
The discount rate that has been applied to latent claims reserves and reinsured London Market business is based on the relevant swap curve in the relevant currency having regard to the expected settlement dates of the claims.
The range of discount rates used depends on the duration of the claims and is given in the table above.
The duration of the claims span over 35 years, with the average duration being between 6 and 15 years depending on the geographical region.
Any change in discount rates between the start and the end of the accounting period is reflected outside of Group adjusted Operating profit as an economic assumption change.
iii Assumptions Outstanding claims provisions are estimated based on known facts at the date of estimation.
Case estimates are set by skilled claims technicians and established case setting procedures.
Claims technicians apply their experience and knowledge to the circumstances of individual claims.
They take into account all available information and correspondence regarding the circumstances of the claim, such as medical reports, investigations and inspections.
Claims technicians set case estimates according to documented claims department policies and specialise in setting estimates for certain lines of business or types of claim.
Claims above certain limits are referred to senior claims handlers for estimate authorisation.
Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2017 172 Strategic report Governance IFRS financial statements Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 40 Insurance liabilities continued No adjustments are made to the claims technicians case estimates included in booked claim provisions, except for rare occasions when the estimated ultimate cost of individual large or unusual claims may be adjusted, subject to internal reserve committee approval, to allow for uncertainty regarding, for example, the outcome of a court case.
The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is then estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques, such as the Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods.
The main assumption underlying these techniques is that a companys past claims development experience can be used to project future claims development and hence ultimate claims costs.
As such, these methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers based on the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios.
Historical claims development is mainly analysed by accident period, although underwriting or notification period is also used where this is considered appropriate.
Claim development is separately analysed for each geographic area, as well as by each line of business.
Certain lines of business are also further analysed by claim type or type of coverage.
In addition, large claims are usually separately addressed, either by being reserved at the face value of loss adjuster estimates or separately projected in order to reflect their future development.
The assumptions used in most non-life actuarial projection techniques, including future rates of claims inflation or loss ratio assumptions, are implicit in the historical claims development data on which the projections are based.
Additional qualitative judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in the future, for example, to reflect one-off occurrences, changes in external or market factors such as public attitudes to claiming, economic conditions, levels of claims inflation, judicial decisions and legislation, as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy conditions and claims handling procedures in order to arrive at a point estimate for the ultimate cost of claims that represents the likely outcome, from a range of possible outcomes, taking account of all the uncertainties involved.
The range of possible outcomes does not, however, result in the quantification of a reserve range.
The following explicit assumptions are made which could materially impact the level of booked net reserves: a UK mesothelioma claims The level of uncertainty associated with latent claims is considerable due to the relatively small number of claims and the long-tail nature of the liabilities.
UK mesothelioma claims account for a large proportion of the Groups latent claims.
The key assumptions underlying the estimation of these claims include claim numbers, the base average cost per claim, future inflation in the average cost of claims and legal fees.
The best estimate of the liabilities reflects the latest available market information and studies.
Many different scenarios can be derived by flexing these key assumptions and applying different combinations of the different assumptions.
An upper and lower scenario can be derived by making reasonably likely changes to these assumptions, resulting in an estimate of 35 million 2016: 25 million greater than the best estimate, or 40 million 2016: 45 million lower than the best estimate.
These scenarios do not, however, constitute an upper or lower bound on these liabilities.
b Interest rates used to discount latent claim liabilities and structured settlements The discount rates used in determining our latent claim liabilities and structured settlements are based on the relevant swap curve in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement of claims.
The range of discount rates used is shown in section ii above and depends on the duration of the claim and the reporting date.
At 31 December 2017, it is estimated that a 1% fall in the discount rates used would increase net claim reserves by approximately 110 million 2016: 220 million, excluding the offsetting effect on asset values as assets are not hypothecated across classes of business.
The impact has fallen during 2017 due to a reduction in bodily injury claims in the UK settled by periodic payment orders PPOs or structured settlements as a result of a reduction in the Ogden rate from 2.5% to -0.75% making them less attractive compared to a lump sum settlement.
The impact of a 1% fall in interest rates across all assets and liabilities of our general insurance and health businesses is shown in note 56. c Allowance for risk and uncertainty The uncertainties involved in estimating loss reserves are allowed for in the reserving process and by the estimation of explicit reserve uncertainty distributions.
The reserve estimation basis for non-life claims requires all non-life businesses to calculate booked claim provisions as the best estimate of the cost of future claim payments, plus an explicit allowance for risk and uncertainty.
The allowance for risk and uncertainty is calculated by each business unit in accordance with the requirements of the Group non-life reserving policy, taking into account the risks and uncertainties specific to each line of business and type of claim in that territory.
The requirements of the Group non-life reserving policy also seek to ensure that the allowance for risk and uncertainty is set consistently across both business units and reporting periods.
Changes to claims development patterns can materially impact the results of actuarial projection techniques.
However, allowance for the inherent uncertainty in the assumptions underlying reserving projections is automatically allowed for in the explicit allowance for risk and uncertainty included when setting booked reserves.
Lump sum payments in settlement of bodily injury claims decided by the UK courts are calculated in accordance with the Ogden Tables and discount rate.
The Ogden discount rate is set by the Lord Chancellor in accordance with the Damages Act 1996 and is applied when calculating the present value of future care costs and loss of earnings for claims settlement purposes.
Due to the uncertainty around the Ogden discount rate, the claim reserves in the UK have been calculated using the current Ogden discount rate of -0.75%, as this is the enacted legislative rate that was announced by the Lord Chancellor last year.
However, the discount rate used in the Ogden Tables is currently being reviewed by the Lord Chancellor and draft legislation has been proposed but not yet enacted which, at the time it was published, indicated a discount rate in the range of 0% to 1%.
By way of illustration, should the Ogden discount rate increase in the future by 1% then this would be expected to reduce reserves by approximately 250 million with an equivalent positive impact on profit before tax.

Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2017 174 Strategic report Governance IFRS financial statements Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 40 Insurance liabilities continued d Loss development tables i Description of tables The tables that follow present the development of claim payments and the estimated ultimate cost of claims for the accident years 2008 to 2017.
The upper half of the tables shows the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to each accident year.
For example, with respect to the accident year 2008, by the end of 2017 9,033 million had actually been paid in settlement of claims.
In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the original estimated ultimate cost of claims of 9,508 million was re-estimated to be 9,195 million at 31 December 2017.
The original estimates will be increased or decreased, as more information becomes known about the individual claims and overall claim frequency and severity.
The Group aims to maintain reserves in respect of its general insurance and health business that protect against adverse future claims experience and development.
The Group establishes reserves in respect of the current accident year 2017, where the development of claims is less mature, that allow for the greater uncertainty attaching to the ultimate cost of current accident year claims.
As claims develop and the ultimate cost of claims become more certain, the absence of adverse claims experience will result in a release of reserves from earlier accident years, as shown in the loss development tables and movements table c iv above.
Releases from prior accident year reserves are also due to an improvement in the estimated cost of claims.
Key elements of the release from prior accident year general insurance and health net provisions during 2017 were: 107 million release from UK due to favourable claims experience in Personal Motor offset by the less favourable experience in 2017 of Commercial Liability claims and large claims in Personal and Commercial Property.
2 million strengthening from Canada due to the better than expected claims experience following the 2010 Ontario auto reforms tailing off, unfavourable development in the Ontario Accident Benefits coverage in the RBC book in 2017, deterioration of experience in Alberta Auto Bodily Injury and Newfoundland Auto Bodily Injury.
79 million release from Europe including Ireland mainly due to continued favourable development in France and Italy.
Key elements of the release from prior accident year general insurance and health net provisions during 2016 were: 208 million strengthening from UK & Ireland due to the impact of the change in the Ogden discount rate in the UK partly offset by other favourable developments on personal motor and commercial liability claims.
154 million release from Canada mainly due to continued favourable experience on motor, following the legislative changes in Ontario.
90 million release from Europe mainly due to favourable development in France and Italy.
There was also a 78 million reduction in net claim reserves relating to an outwards reinsurance contract completed by the UK General Insurance business.
The impact of using varying exchange rates is shown at the bottom of each table.
Disposals are dealt with by treating all outstanding and IBNR claims of the disposed entity as paid at the date of disposal.
The loss development tables above include information on asbestos and environmental pollution claims provisions from business written before 2008.
The undiscounted claim provisions, net of reinsurance, in respect of this business at 31 December 2017 were 95 million 2016: 134 million.
The movement in the year reflects a reduction of 14 million due to favourable claims development, claim payments net of reinsurance recoveries and foreign exchange rate movements.
e Provision for unearned premiums Movements The following changes have occurred in the provision for unearned premiums UPR during the year: 2017 2016 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 4,766 4,048 Premiums written during the year 10,523 9,694 Less: Premiums earned during the year 10,365 9,503 Changes in UPR recognised as an income expense 158 191 1 Gross portfolio transfers and acquisitions 46 124 Foreign exchange rate movements 10 403 Carrying amount at 31 December 4,980 4,766 1 The 46 million in respect of 2017 relates to the full consolidation of the Poland Joint Venture.
The 124 million in respect of 2016 relates to the acquisition of Royal Bank of Canada General Insurance Company.
