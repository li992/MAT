5 Subsequent events As set out on page 3, a set of measures that will further simplify the RELX Group corporate structure into a single parent company have been proposed.
The simplication is subject to the approval of both RELX NV and RELX PLC shareholders.
We expect a circular to be sent to shareholders in the second quarter of 2018, with implementation in the third quarter of 2018, subject to various conditions including shareholder approval.
An implementation of the proposal would result in the merger of RELX NV's assets and liabilities into RELX PLC.
