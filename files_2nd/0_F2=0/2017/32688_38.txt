Net gain on sale of joint venture interests On 1 January 2017, Wichford VBG Holding S.. r. l. Wichford VBG, exchanged contracts to dispose of all its propertyowning subsidiaries.
The value attributed by the purchaser to the property portfolio, on which the sale was based, was 106.0 million 90.6 million.
The carrying value of the portfolio was 97.6 million 83.2 million.
Net consideration for the subsidiary interests was agreed at 49.7 million 42.4 million.
The transaction completed on 13 January 2017 subject to final completion adjustments which were negligible.
The equity of the subsidiaries was acquired for nominal value and the consideration receivable was comprised of: 29.4 million 25.1 million in settlement of the shareholder loans outstanding to the joint venture partners Group share: 14.4 million 12.5 million : and 20.3 million 17.3 million in settlement of loans that had been advanced by the retained structure of Wichford VBG Finco Loans to the disposed subsidiaries Group share: 9.9 million 8.5 million.
The Finco Loans had previously eliminated on consolidation of the joint venture.
Cash consideration of 47.9 million 40.8 million was initially received by the joint venture after the deduction of transaction costs of 0.8 million 0.7 million by thepurchaser.
In addition, 1.0 million 0.8 million was deferred pending the outcome of certain conditions.
The conditions were satisfied and the deferred consideration was received in advance of the balance sheet date.
The net assets of the subsidiaries on disposal were 11.2 million 9.4 million and, after adjusting for the Shareholder Loans and additional transaction costs incurred of 1.8 million 1.5 million, an initial gain on sale of 6.5 million 5.7 million was recognised by the joint venture.
The Group share of this gain was 3.2 million 2.8 million.
The Group recognised a total gain of 4.9 million after the recycling of cumulative foreign currency translation gains of 2.2 million to the income statement and the deduction of 0.1 million of Group transaction costs.
The Directors believe that the recycling of the translation reserve is appropriate as the retained Wichford VBG structure has only residual cash to settle final working capital balances at 31 August 2017.
The Finco Loans originated during the Wichford VBG restructuring in September 2012, when a financing vehicle of the retained structure acquired the residual bank debt from the existing lender for nominal value.
Loan notes of 1 Finco Loan Notes were issued to the joint venture partners by the vehicle to finance the acquisition of the Finco Loans.
Under the terms of the Finco Loan Notes, any termination payments received under the Finco Loans would be payable to the Finco Loan Note holders after settlement of the Performance Fee refer to Note 5 and any interest outstanding so that surplus cash could be repatriated efficiently to the joint venture partners.
Following the disposal of the Finco Loans, a loss was therefore recognised in the financial statements of the joint venture on settlement of the Finco Loan Notes Group share: 3.9 million 3.5 million and a corresponding gain was recognised by the joint venture partners.
The net impact of the Finco Loan Note settlement is Nil in the Group financial statements.
For presentation purposes and to reflect the substance of the transaction, all gains and losses incurred by both the Group 5.6 million gain and the joint venture on an equity accounted basis 0.7 million loss, as a result of the disposal, are included within one line in the income statement, Net gain on sale of joint venture interests.

On 4 December 2013, the Group converted to a UKREIT.
As a result, the Group does not pay UK Corporation Tax on the profits and gains from qualifying rental business in the UK provided certain conditions are met.
Nonqualifying profits and gains of the Group continue to be subject to corporation tax.
The Directors intend the Group to continue as a REIT for the foreseeable future.
As a result, deferred tax is no longer recognised on temporary differences relating to the UK property rental business which is within the REIT structure.

Investment property continued Recognition Judgement may be required to determine whether a property qualifies as an investment property.
Investment property comprises a number of retail and commercial properties in the UK and Europe that are leased to unconnected third parties.
In addition, the hotel portfolio is held for capital appreciation and to earn rental income.
The hotels have been let to RHML and RECML with the exception of Travelodge, Enfield to separately manage the operating business for a fixed rent which is subject to annual review.
The review takes into account the forecast EBITDA when setting the revised rent for each hotel.
As detailed in the key judgements and estimates in Note 2, aside from the Groups associate interest in RedefineBDL and the receipt of rental income, Redefine International is not involved in the hotel management business and there are limited transactions between Redefine International, RHML and RECML.
As a result, the Directors consider it appropriate to classify the hotel portfolio as investment property in line with IAS 40.
Valuation The carrying amount of investment property is the market value of the property as determined by appropriately qualified independent valuers and adjusted for minimum payments under head leases and tenant lease incentives.
Valuations are based on what is determined to be the highest and best use.
When considering the highest and best use a valuer will consider, on a property by property basis, and in limited circumstances in aggregation with other assets, its actual and potential uses which are physically, legally and financially viable.
Where the highest and best use differs from the existing use, the valuer will consider the cost and the likelihood of achieving and implementing this change to determine an appropriate valuation.
Fees paid to valuers are based on arms length fixed price contracts.
The fair value of the Groups property for the year ended 31 August 2017 was assessed by independent and appropriately qualified valuers in accordance with the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors RICS standards and IFRS 13.
The valuations are performed by Strutt & Parker LLP for the UK Shopping Centres, BNP Paribas Real Estate for the Esplanade and Savills for rest of the portfolio.
The valuations are reviewed internally by senior management and presented to the Audit and Risk Committee.
The presentation includes discussion around the assumptions used by the external valuers, as well as a review of the resulting valuations.
Valuation inputs The fair value of the property portfolio has been determined using either a discounted cash flow or a yield capitalisation technique, whereby contracted and market rental values are capitalised at a market rate.
The resulting valuations are crosschecked against the net initial yield and the fair market values per sqft of comparable recent market transactions.
The valuation techniques described above are consistent with IFRS 13 and use significant unobservable inputs.
Valuation techniques can change at each valuation round depending on prevailing market conditions and the propertys highest and best use at the reporting date.
The Group considers that all of its investment property falls within Level 3, as defined by IFRS 13 refer to Note 31.
There has been no transfer of property within the fair value hierarchy during the year.

Although over the longterm property is considered a low risk asset, investors must be aware that significant short and mediumterm risk factors are inherent in the asset class.
Investments in property are relatively illiquid and usually more difficult to realise than listed equities or bonds and this restricts the Groups ability to realise value in cash in the shortterm.

On the date of listing this represented 25.4 per cent of the entitys issued share capital and the investment was classified as an associate on initial recognition.
On 20 October 2015, the Groups interest was diluted to 13.2 per cent and reclassified as an investment at fair value through profit or loss refer to Note 14.
On 30 August 2016, the Group settled amounts previously advanced to RedefineBDL by way of an equity contribution of 6.0 million.
The equity contribution did not result in a further issue of shares to the Group or increase the Groups percentage interest in the associate.
The equity contribution has been recognised in other reserves in the underlying financial statements of RedefineBDL.
During the year ended 31 August 2017, the Groups cumulative investment in RedefineBDL increased from 25.3 to 30.4 per cent.
On 7 February 2017, the Group acquired an additional 5.1 per cent interest in RedefineBDL for 1.3 million to partially settle a loan advanced to 4C Investments.
This portion of the Groups investment has been classified as held for sale on initial recognition as the shares were acquired exclusively with a view to subsequent resale.
The table above presents movements in the Groups existing 25.3 per cent interest in RedefineBDL only.

Following an internal impairment assessment and on receipt of an independent valuation of RedefineBDL, the Directors considered that the recoverable amount of the Groups net investment in RedefineBDL was 9.4 million at 31 August 2017 31 August 2016: 10.2 million.
The independent valuation was determined on a valueinuse basis but was also crosschecked to market comparables.
Using a discount rate range of 11.5 12.5 per cent, an enterprise value range of 33.540.5million was attributed to the investment, with a midpoint valuation of 37.0 million Group share: 9.4 million.
This has resulted in an impairment chargeof 0.5million 31 August 2016: 3.2 million.

Accordingly, there has been no transfer within the fair value hierarchy over the year.
Investment property held for sale During the year ended 31 August 2017, ten properties were reclassified as held for sale, six of which remained classified as such at the reporting date.
Four of these assets are being actively marketed and management are committed to a plan for their sale.
It is considered highly probable that the carrying value of these assets will be recovered through a sale transaction, rather than through continuing use, within the next twelve months.
On 16 September 2016 the Group exchanged contracts for the future disposal of a UK Commercial office in 2 Duchess Place, Edgbaston, for 1.6 million.
The purchaser has the right to call completion at any point up to 1April2018.
As there is a firm commitment from the purchaser and the Group to complete the transaction and the delay in completion is outside of the Companys control, the asset has also been classified as held for sale at 31 August 2017.
The Group disposed of four held for sale assets from the UK Commercial portfolio and one German property during the year realising a net gain, after disposal costs, of 1.5 million.
As at 31 August 2017, net proceeds of 40.9 million had been received by the Group, as the Brckmuhl property sale had only exchanged at the balance sheet date and 0.2 million of disposal costs had been accrued.

Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Other information Redefine International P. L. C. Annual Report 2017 129 The Groups bank loans are secured over investment property of 1,484.1 million 31 August 2016: 1,383.0 million and are carried at amortised cost.
On a proportionately consolidated basis, bank loans are secured over investment property of 1,509.7 million 31 August 2016: 1,523.9 million.
The Group has reduced the nominal value of drawn debt on a proportionately consolidated basis during the year to 842.2 million 31 August 2016: 850.6 million following a number of successful refinancings: in November 2016 the facility held against West Orchards Coventry was restructured after the repayment of 5.2 million which reduced the balance outstanding to 11.9 million and extended the maturity to 2021.
The restructuring was not considered a significant modification and no extinguishment of the existing loan was therefore required: in December 2016 and January 2017, the Group drew down on funds from the revolving credit facility RCF secured against the AUK Portfolio and repaid loans previously held with AIB Group UK p. l. c. 5.4 million and Commerzbank AG 9.7 million.
During the year ended 31 August 2017, the Group also sold eight properties secured against the AUK facility and applied 40.0 million of sale proceeds against the RCF.
Net movements on the drawn facility for the year are 10.5million: Wichford VBG disposed of its propertyowning subsidiaries including associated bank debt with DG Hyp Group share: 23.5 million, effective 1 January 2017.
SeeNotes 10 and 15: in April 2017, the Group refinanced 167.8 million of existing debt facilities secured over four of its UK Shopping Centre assets with Aviva.
Following a prepayment of 21.7 million, the four facilities were amalgamated into one carrying a fixed rate of interest of 5.52 per cent previous range: 5.7 6.4 per cent.
The restructure qualifies as a substantial modification the existing facilities have been derecognised and the refinanced debt has been recognised at fair value: in April 2017, the Group acquired control of the previously held joint venture interest in the Leopard Portfolio and the Group assumed bank debt with Berlin Hyp AG and BayernLB of 73.6 million at rates of 1.3 2.9 per cent.
See Note 30 for further information: the Group refinanced its HSH Nordbank facility, secured over the CMC Shopping Center Altona, Hamburg effective 28 April 2017 with the facility being extended to February 2024.
Following a prepayment of 5.5 million, the nominal value of debt outstanding was reduced to 37.9 million.
The refinancing was not considered a significant modification and no extinguishment of the existing loan was therefore required: in June 2017, the Group completed the refinancing of three facilities held with BayernLB in the RI Menora joint venture.
This included a prepayment of 1.7 million Group share: 0.9 million, of which 1.3 million Group share: 0.7 million was paid in June and the remainder was paid post year end in September 2017.
Thefacilities have been extended to 2024 and carry fixed rates of interest from 1.69 1.72 per cent: and in August 2017, the Group agreed extensions for two BayernLB facilities secured against the German OBI properties due to mature in October 2017.
Under the amended agreements, both loans will now run to December 2022 and carry fixed interest rates of 1.59 1.62 per cent.
Fair value disclosures The nominal value of floating rate borrowings is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value.
The fair value of fixed rate borrowings at the reporting date has been calculated by discounting cash flows under the relevant agreements at a market interest rate for similar debt instruments.
The market interest rate has been determined having regard to the term, duration and security arrangements of the relevant loan and an estimation of the current rates charged in the market for similar instruments issued to companies of similar sizes.
With the exception of the Aviva debt refinanced during the year, the Group considers that all bank loans, including the Groups share of joint venture bank loans at a total carrying value of 690.9 million, fall within Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13 at the reporting date refer to Note 31.
The Aviva debt was recognised at fair value on refinancing in April 2017.
This resulted in a fair value adjustment of 14.3 million as the refinanced debt was considered to have been negotiated on offmarket terms.
The fair value was determined with reference to observable inputs and was classified as Level 2 on initial recognition.
The carrying value of the Aviva debt at 31August2017, being 131.6 million, is still considered by the Group to be a reasonable approximation of fair value and therefore falls within Level 2.
All bank loans at 31 August 2016 were considered Level 3.
The maturity of Group bank loans, gross of unamortised debt issue costs and fair value adjustments is as follows: 31 August 31 August 2017 2016 m m Less than one year 3.1 13.8 Between one year and five years 620.5 471.8 More than five years 202.3 288.0 825.9 773.6 Certain borrowing agreements contain financial and other covenants that, if contravened, could alter the repayment profile.
Aviva profit share As part of the Aviva debt restructure in 2013, Aviva retained the right to participate in 50 per cent of the income generated by Grand Arcade Shopping Centre, Wigan after all costs, expenses and interest.
The profit share participation right was recognised as a financial liability, initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost in prior years.
During the year ended 31 August 2017 the debt was again restructured and, following a break cost payment of 5.5 million to terminate the existing facility, the Group was released from the historic profit arrangement with Aviva.

Finance leases are effectively secured obligations, as the rights to the leased asset revert to the lessor in the event of default.
The discount rates used in calculating the present value of the minimum lease payments range from 1.8 to 6.3percent.
Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements to manage the risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
Interest rate swaps and caps are employed by the Group to manage the interest rate profile of financial liabilities.
In accordance with the terms of the majority of bank debt arrangements, the Group has entered into interest rate swaps to convert the rates from floating to fixed which has eliminated exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Likewise, interest rate caps are used to limit the downside exposure to significant changes to the low interest rates currently prevailing in the market.
It is the Groups policy that no economic trading in derivatives is undertaken.

Shareholder approval was subsequently received on 25 April 2017 and the transaction completed on 26 April 2017 but with economic effect from 1March 2017.
Aggregate consideration paid to RPL was 49.0 million 41.9 million and allocated as follows: 0.3 million 0.3 million for the equity interests acquired: and 48.7 million 41.6 million for the shareholder loans acquired.
Including transaction costs, the total cash outflow in respect of the acquisition was 42.1 million.
On completion, the Group obtained control of the Leopard Portfolio.

The Group has therefore consolidated the Leopard Portfolio on a linebyline basis from 1March2017, with the resulting elimination of intragroup shareholder loans.
The transaction was not considered a business combination, having regard to associated processes acquired, and has therefore been recognised as an asset acquisition.
The net assets of Leopard on acquisition were 87.2 million 74.5 million.
The carrying value of the Groups existing joint venture interest, which was derecognised on loss of joint control, was 44.3 million 37.7 million.
The premium paid to RPL on acquisition of 6.8 million 5.9 million including transactions costs, has been solely allocated to investment property as it was not separately identifiable.
The carrying value of the Leopard property portfolio on 1 March 2017 was 175.5 million 149.9 million and, as a result, the total amount recognised as an addition on consolidation was 182.3 million 155.8 million.
The noncontrolling interest, being 6 per cent of the equity of the Leopard Portfolio, has been recognised on the basis of its proportionate share in the identifiable net assets on completion and share of results to the reporting date.

Fair value of financial instruments Basis for determining fair values The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
Level 1: quoted market price unadjusted in an active market for an identical instrument.
Level 2: valuation techniques based on observable inputs, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
This category includes instruments valued using: quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments: quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active: or other valuation techniques where all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data.
Level 3: valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs.
This category includes all instruments where the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the instruments valuation.
This category includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments where significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments.
The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices or dealer price quotations.
For all other financial instruments, the Group uses valuation techniques to arrive at a fair value that reflects a price that would have been determined by willing market participants acting at arms length at the reporting date.
For common and simple financial instruments, such as overthecounter interest rate swaps and caps, the Group uses widely recognised valuation models for determining the fair value.
The models use only observable market data and require little management judgement which reduces the uncertainty associated with determination of fair values.
For other financial instruments, the Group determines fair value using net present value or discounted cash flow models and comparisons to similar instruments for which market observable prices exist.
Varying degrees of judgement are required in the determination of an appropriate market benchmark.
Assumptions and inputs used in valuation techniques include riskfree and benchmark interest rates, credit spreads and other premia used in estimating discount rates, foreign currency exchange rates and expected price volatilities and correlations.
Availability of observable market prices and inputs vary depending on the products and markets and is prone to changes based on specific events and general conditions in the financial markets.
The tables below present information about the Groups financial instruments carried at fair value as of 31 August 2017 and 31 August 2016: Total fair Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 value Group m m m m 31 August 2017 Financial assets Investment at fair value Note 14 8.5 8.5 Derivative financial assets Note 22 0.4 0.4 8.5 0.4 8.9 Financial liabilities Derivative financial liabilities Note 22 7.8 7.8 7.8 7.8 31 August 2016 Financial assets Investment at fair value Note 14 7.9 7.9 Derivative financial assets Note 22 0.8 0.8 7.9 0.8 8.7 Financial liabilities Derivative financial liabilities Note 22 12.6 12.6 12.6 12.6 The investment in IHL has been categorised as a Level 1 investment and priced using quoted prices in an active market: the AltX of the JSE.
Derivative financial instruments have been categorised as Level 2, as although they are priced using directly observable inputs, the instruments are not traded in an active market.
As stated in Note 12 and 20 respectively, the Group considers investment property and noncurrent assets held for sale to be categorised as Level 3.
As stated in Note21, the Group considers all bank loans to be categorised as Level 3 with the exception of the Aviva debt which is categorised as Level 2.
The carrying values of loans to joint ventures, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, finance leases and trade and other payables are considered tobea reasonable approximation of fair value.

Sharebased payments Group and Company 31 August 31 August 2017 2016 Sharebased payment reserve m m Opening balance at 1 September 2.2 1.0 Sharebased payment expense in the year 1.0 1.2 Closing balance at 31 August 3.2 2.2 The Companys sharebased payments are all equitysettled and comprise the LongTerm Performance Share Plan PSP for Executive Directors and the LongTerm Restricted Stock Plan RSP for employees.
In accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of equitysettled sharebased payments to employees is determined at the grant date.
The expense is recognised on a straightline basis over the vesting period based on estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest at each reporting date, with a corresponding credit to the sharebased payments reserve.
The Company engages external advisers to determine the fair value of each award at the grant date who use the Monte Carlo and BlackScholes models in their valuations.
During the year ended 31 August 2017, the total IFRS 2 charge recognised in the income statement in relation to the PSP awards was 0.9 million .
During the year ended 31 August 2017, the total IFRS 2 charge recognised in the income statement in relation to the RSP awards was 0.1million 31August 2016: 0.1 million.

As at 31 August 2017, 1.3 million PSP awards and 0.7 million RSP awards were considered to be dilutive 31 August 2016: 0.2 million and 0.5 million respectively.
Full disclosure of the PSP award scheme granted to the Executive Directors is given on pages 88 and 89 of the Annual Report.
LongTerm Performance Share Plan Subsequent to shareholder approval on 23 January 2017 and with effect from 1 September 2016, PSP performance conditions were revised to include nonmarket based objectives in addition to market based objective.
This followed a review by the Remuneration Committee of the existing remuneration policy to better align the awards with the Companys strategic objectives and shareholder interests.
The revised PSP awards authorise the Remuneration Committee to make grants of PSP shares with a face value of up to 200 per cent of the salary of Executive Directors.
The awards are subject to a threeyear vesting period and to the following performance conditions: 50 per cent of the award will vest dependent on underlying distributable earnings per share.
25 per cent of the award will vest upon attaining earnings per share comparable with the immediately preceding financial year, with 100 per cent vesting achieved for average annual outperformance of CPI during the performance period of 1 per cent: 25 per cent of the award will vest dependent on the relative total property return of the Companys UK assets in comparison to the IPD UK All Property Index.
25percent of the award will vest once performance reaches that of the benchmark with 100 per cent vesting achieved for 2 per cent outperformance: and 25 per cent of the award will vest dependent on the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR equalling, or exceeding, the TSR relative to that of each of the members of the FTSE EPRA REIT Developed Europe Index the Index.
25 per cent of the award will vest for median performance with 100 per cent vesting achieved for upper quartile performance.
On 25 January 2017, 4.9 million shares were granted for the performance period from 1 September 2016 to 31 August 2019.
The share price on 1 September 2016 was 39.0 pence and the fair value on the grant date was 1.2 million assuming maximum vesting over the performance period.
The former PSP scheme authorised the Remuneration Committee to make grants of PSP shares with a face value of up to 250 per cent of the salary of Executive Directors.
These remaining outstanding awards are subject to a threeyear vesting period and to the following performance conditions: 50 per cent of the award will vest dependent on the TSR equalling, or exceeding, the TSR relative to that of each of the members of the Index: and 50 per cent of the award will vest dependent on the Companys TSR relative to that of the members of a bespoke comparator group the Comparator Group.
Vesting is on the same sliding scale for both of these conditions 25 per cent for median performance and 100 per cent for upper quartile performance, with 0 per cent vesting below a median performance.
The following outstanding awards were granted under the former PSP remuneration scheme: On 3 February 2015, 3.4 million shares were granted for the performance period from 1 September 2014 to 31 August 2017.
The share price on 1 September 2014 was 52.4 pence and the fair value on the grant date was 0.9 million.
Performance during the period was determined to be below median and therefore all awards lapsed on 31 August 2017.
On 28 October 2015, 5.0 million shares were granted for the performance period from 1 September 2015 to 31 August 2018.
The share price on 1 September 2015 was 52.2 pence and the fair value on the grant date was 1.5 million.
LongTerm Restricted Stock Plan Awards of RSPs to certain employees are subject to a threeyear vesting period and to performance measures evenly balanced between corporate performance objectives and personal performance objectives.
The performance conditions of RSP awards were also revised effective 1 September 2016.
50 per cent of the award will vest dependent on corporate targets, being the same as those conditions set out above for the PSP under both the revised and existing remuneration policies and with the same relative weighting.
50 per cent of the award will vest dependent on personal objectives, linked to average performance grades achieved over the threeyear vesting period.

Sharebased payments continued LongTerm Restricted Stock Plan continued On 3 December 2015, 0.9 million shares were granted to employees under the old RSP scheme for the performance period 1 September 2015 to 31 August 2018.
Theshare price on 1 September 2015 was 52.2 pence and the fair value on the date of grant was 0.3 million.
On 25 January 2017, 1.1 million shares were granted to employees under the revised RSP scheme for the performance period from 1 September 2016 to 31August2019.
The share price on 1 September 2016 was 39.0 pence and the fair value on the grant date was 0.3 million assuming maximum vesting over the performance period.
Fair value of sharebased payments For the marketbased performance conditions, the effect of the performance conditions is incorporated into the grant date fair value of the award.
No subsequent adjustment to the charge can be made to reflect the outcome of the performance test.
Adjustments can be made for estimated and actual leavers who forfeit their awards during the vesting period.
The probability of meeting market based performance conditions is required to be incorporated into the calculation of fair value.
TheMonte Carlo model has therefore been used to value the element of the Awards with a TSR performance condition.
The remaining nonmarket based performance conditions have been valued using a BlackScholes model.
It was necessary to make a number of assumptions to calculate the fair value under both models.
Reference was made to the Companys LSE listing in developing share price volatility, dividend yield, riskfree rate and index correlation assumptions.
The table below sets out the assumptions made: Award year Award year Assumptions 2017 % 2016 % Volatility 20.7 20.0 Riskfree rate 0.4 0.85 Dividend yield 8.2 Correlation of the comparator group companies 28.5 Correlation of the Index companies 24.2 30.1 The fair value calculation under the revised PSP award scheme assumes 28.2 per cent 2016: 53 per cent of the face value will be awarded at the date of grant relative to the Index.
Financial risk management The Group is exposed to the following financial risks through its operations: Credit risk: Liquidity risk: and Market risk.
In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments.
The following quantitative and qualitative disclosures describe the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing these risks, and the Groups management of capital.
The Groups risk management policies require the identification and analysis of the risks faced by the Group, the setting of appropriate risk limits and controls, and the monitoring of risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly and adjusted to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Groups Board of Directors has responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Groups flexibility and ability to maximise returns.
The Group Audit Committee oversees managements compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
There are no significant concentrations of risk and there has been no significant change during the financial year, or since year end, to the types of financial risks faced by the Group or the Groups approach to the management of such risks.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the Groups maximum credit risk exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: Group 31 August 31 August 2017 2016 m m Loans to joint ventures 4.3 52.9 Derivative financial instruments 0.4 0.8 Trade and other receivables 13.6 25.3 Cash and cash equivalents 52.8 32.0 71.1 111.0 The above tables exclude prepayments and accrued income, letting costs and tenant lease incentives which are not exposed to credit risk.
Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Other information Redefine International P. L. C. Annual Report 2017 141 Cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments Credit risk arises on the Groups undrawn commitments, its holding of assets such as cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks or financial institutions and its derivative financial instruments.
However, the Group limits such exposure by investing in liquid deposits with material counterparties that have a credit rating of A, A2 or above from Standard & Poors or Moodys, except where specific exemptions are granted by the Board.

Trade and other receivables The Group is also exposed to credit risk from lease contracts in relation to its property portfolio.
This risk is actively managed by the asset and property managers who continuously monitor and work with tenants, anticipating and wherever possible, identifying and addressing risks prior to default.
If there is objective evidence that the Group may not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the lease concerned a specific impairment is made.
The Group also makes a general provision of 25 per cent against all receivables 120 days or more past due that have not been specifically impaired.
Rent receivables exposed to credit risk were less than 0.1 per cent of total assets at 31 August 2017 31 August 2016: less than 0.1 per cent.
The credit risk associated with rent receivables is considered to be low, owing to the longterm nature and diversity of the Groups tenancy agreements.
The Group has set a mediumterm target of a 95 per cent collection rate within seven days.
The Groups rent collection rate at 31 August 2017 was 94.3 per cent.
Other receivables, including loans to external parties and consideration outstanding on disposal of investment property are secured and therefore they are also considered to be of low credit risk.
Included in trade and other receivables, subject to credit risk, are debtors with the following age profile: 2017 2016 Gross Impairment Recoverable Gross Impairment Recoverable m m m m m m Not past due 10.9 10.9 25.5 25.5 Past due 0 120 days 2.0 2.0 Past due over 120 days 2.0 1.3 0.7 0.9 0.9 14.9 1.3 13.6 26.4 0.9 25.5 Loans to joint ventures The credit risk associated with loans to joint ventures is the risk that the loans advanced may not be recoverable.
As at 31 August 2017, the recognised loan to joint ventures relates to the loan advanced to RI Menora German Holdings S.. r. l. This joint venture group is in a net asset position and has serviced all of its payment obligations to date under the terms of the loan.
The Group is also responsible for the investment management of the joint venture and therefore has oversight of working capital and can manage cash flow requirements.
The recoverability of the loan is considered low risk.
The Group has also advanced a loan of 3.3 million to the Esplanade.
This investment is in a net liability position with the cumulative losses exceeding the cost of the Groups investment due to the fair value losses that have arisen on derivative financial instruments.
The Group has therefore fully impaired the loan advanced in line with the requirements of IAS 28.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups working capital and debt servicing obligations.
There is a risk that the Group will encounter difficulties in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that there will always be sufficient resources to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
Liquidity risk is actively managed by the Groups finance department.
Bimonthly, management receive and review rolling threemonth cash flow projections to ensure that there is sufficient headroom in the nearterm to meet ongoing operational requirements and upcoming capital commitments.
In addition, management regularly receive and review rolling threeyear cash flow and loan balance projections as part of the Groups forecasting process.
At the balance sheet date, these projections indicated that the Group had sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances.
The monitoring of liquidity is also assisted by the quarterly review of covenants imposed by financial institutions, such as loantovalue and interest covenant ratios.
Loans are renegotiated in advance of any potential covenant breaches insofar as the factors are within the control of the Group.
The Board will ensure during periods of increased market uncertainty that sufficient cash resources are available for potential loan repayments or cash deposits as may be required by financial institutions.
The Groups loan facilities and other borrowings are also spread across a range of banks and financial institutions so as to minimise any potential concentration of risk.

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Since the UK referendum on European membership there has been a change in the potential scale and likelihood of volatility in all aspects of market risk, with softening yields, volatility in currency and equity markets and increased inflationary expectations experienced.
Refer to the Groups Principal Risk disclosures on pages16 and 17 for further information.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments in the ordinary course of business, and incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
The Board of Directors receives reports on a quarterly basis with regards to currency exposures as well as interest rate spreads and takes the necessary steps to hedge and limit the risk the Group is exposed to.
The Group does not apply hedge accounting.
Currency risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk, primarily with respect to the Euro EUR.
Foreign exchange risk arises from the Groups exposure to monetary assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations recognised in EUR.
The Groups income from incomeproducing rental properties is denominated in the same currencies as the loans that are financing those properties.
The Groups investments in foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures are not hedged as the currency positions are considered to be longterm in nature.
Foreign exchange risk also arises on the payment of the Groups dividend to its JSE shareholders in South African Rand ZAR biannually.
The Group enters into forward rate contracts in advance of settlement of the dividends to mitigate this risk.
The carrying amount of the Groups foreign denominated assets and liabilities are as follows: 31 August 31 August 2017 2016 Group m m Assets EUR 432.8 291.5 ZAR 0.3 2.2 Liabilities EUR 221.1 143.8 The following exchange rates were applied during the year: Average rate Year end rate 2017 2016 2017 2016 EUR 1.151 1.295 1.086 1.177 ZAR 17.031 21.127 16.820 19.333 Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Other information Redefine International P. L. C. Annual Report 2017 143 Sensitivity analysis A five percent strengthening in the GBP exchange rate against the EUR at year end would have decreased equity by 9.9 million 31 August 2016: 7.0 million and profit by 0.6 million 31 August 2016: 1.4 million.
A five percent weakening in the GBP exchange rate against the EUR at year end would have had the equal but opposite effect.
This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Groups longterm debt obligations with floating interest rates.
The Group uses interest rate derivatives to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
At the year end, as a result of the use of interest rate swaps and caps, the majority of the Groups borrowings were at fixed interest.
Fixed capped Floating Fixed capped Floating 31 August 31 August 31 August 31 August 2017 2017 2016 2016 Group proportionately consolidated m m m m Nominal value of Group bank loans 188.7 637.2 206.7 566.9 Nominal value of joint venture bank loans 7.5 8.8 77.0 196.2 646.0 206.7 643.9 Derivative impact 587.3 587.3 604.7 604.7 783.5 58.7 811.4 39.2 Interest rate protection % 93.0 95.4 The table above is presented on a proportionately consolidated basis.
The detail included is not a requirement of IFRS and is presented for informational purposes only as it is used in reports presented to the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker for monitoring interest rate risk.
The Group targets interest rate protection against 75 per cent or more of external debt.
The Groups EPRA earnings has limited exposure to interest rate fluctuations until the repayment dates of the loans for which the interest rate swaps and caps have been arranged.
Refer to Note 22 for further details on the Groups interest rate swap and cap agreements.
Capital structure and management The Group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the balance between its net debt and capital.
The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Group manages the capital structure and takes reasonable steps in light of changes in the economic conditions and the risk characteristics of its underlying business and assets.
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group, as presented in the following table, are the loantovalue and the interest cover ratios: 31 August 31 August 2017 2016 Group proportionately consolidated Note m m Loantovalue Net debt 21 788.8 816.3 Investment property 12 1,538.7 1,529.0 Loantovalue % 51.3 53.4 Interest cover Net rental income 3 93.5 89.3 Net finance expense 3 29.0 33.1 Interest cover times 3.2 2.7 The tables above are presented on a proportionately consolidated basis.
The ratios are not a requirement of IFRS and are presented for informational purposes only as they are used in reports presented to the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker for monitoring the Groups capital structure.
The Groups mediumterm target is that the loantovalue ratio is between 4550 per cent and the interest cover is above three times.
The Board also monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders, as well as the return on capital, which the Group defines as total shareholders equity, excluding noncontrolling interests, and the dividends paid to ordinary shareholders.
In order to improve its capital structure, the Company may issue new shares, sell assets to reduce debt, refinance existing borrowings, and adjust the amount of any distribution of dividends.
At the 2015 AGM the Company received the necessary authorisation from shareholders to purchase its own shares on the market, subject to such shares being cancelled immediately upon acquisition.
The timing of purchases will depend on market conditions and purchase and sale decisions will be made on a transaction by transaction basis by the Board of Directors.
No share purchases took place during the year.
The Group does not have a defined share buyback plan.
The level of the Companys borrowings, in terms of its Articles of Association, shall not at any time, without the previous sanction of an ordinary resolution of the Company, exceed ten times the aggregate of: i the amount paid up on the issued share capital of the Company: and ii the total of capital and revenue reserves.
The Companys dividend policy is to distribute the majority of its earnings available for distribution in the form of dividends to shareholders.
