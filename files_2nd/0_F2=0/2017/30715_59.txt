Accruals are made at the time of sale but the actual amounts paid are based on claims made some time after the initial recognition of the sale.

The level of accrual is reviewed and adjusted quarterly in light of historical experience of actual rebates, discounts or allowances given and returns made and any changes in arrangements.
Future events could cause the assumptions on which the accruals are based to change, which could affect the future results of the Group.
