The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which allowance is made for projected earnings None of the fair values of the assets shown above include any directly-held financial instruments of the Group or property occupied increases for active members.
The accumulated benefit obligation is an alternative actuarial measure of the schemes liabilities, by, or other assets used by, the Group.
All of the scheme assets have a quoted market price in an active market with the exception whose calculation differs from that under the projected unit credit method in that it includes no assumption for future earnings of the Trustees bank account balance representing Level 1 fair value measurement as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
In assessing this figure for the purpose of these disclosures, allowance has been made for future statutory revaluation of benefits up to retirement.
At the balance sheet date the accumulated benefit obligation was 18.0m 2016: 16.2m.
It is the policy of the trustees and the Group to review the investment strategy at the time of each funding valuation.
The Trustees All actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the year in which they occur in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
investment objectives and the processes undertaken to measure and manage the risks inherent in the plan investment strategy are illustrated by the asset allocation at 31 December 2017.

This would detrimentally impact the balance sheet position and may give rise to increased charges in the income statement.
