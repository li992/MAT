Dividend Resources The Companys expected dividend policy is based on a pay-out ratio to Underlying cash of 80%.
The capacity of the Company to make dividend payments to shareholders is determined by the availability of distributable reserves and cash resources.
Distributable Reserves The Company is a non-trading investment holding Company which derives its distributable reserves from dividends paid by its subsidiaries.
The primary subsidiary which pays dividends to the Company is St. Jamess Place Wealth Management Group Limited formerly known as St. Jamess Place Wealth Management Group plc, an intermediate holding company which in turn receives dividends primarily from St. Jamess Place UK plc, St. Jamess Place Unit Trust Group Limited and St. Jamess Place Investment Administration Limited.
Ongoing solvency requirements within the life assurance, unit trust and financial services companies of the Group limit their ability to distribute all their distributable reserves.
Analysis of solvency requirements is included in the Solvency section of the Financial Review on page 40 and further information about regulation and capital requirements is included in Note 17 on page 168.
The Directors review the distributable reserves of the Company ahead of each interim and final dividend being proposed to ensure the Company has sufficient distributable reserves to allow a lawful dividend to be paid.
As at 31 December 2017, the total distributable reserves of the Company were 409.6 million 2016: 294.6 million.
The Directors are satisfied that this is sufficient to support the proposed dividend of 145.2 million.
Cash Resources The shareholder cash resources within the Group at 31 December 2017 were 274.4 million 2016: 345.9 million as set out in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
These cash resources are held by the operating entities within the Group.
The cash generated by the Group during the year was 281.2 million on an Underlying cash basis 2016: 199.5 million, and 252.6 million on a Cash basis 2016: 175.4 million as set out in the Financial Review on page 37.
Under both bases the cash generated during the year is sufficient to cover the total proposed dividend for 2017 of 145.2 million.
The cash and underlying cash bases should not be confused with the IFRS Statement of Cash Flows, which is presented in accordance with IAS 7 on page 129.
