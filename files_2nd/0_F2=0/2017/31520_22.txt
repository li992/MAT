The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 50 and note 2.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with our accounting policies.
Basis of accounting The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as issued bythe IASB.
The Group financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union.
The Group financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except where certain assets or liabilities are held at amortised cost or at fair value as described in our accounting policies.
The key accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Adoption of new and revised standards In preparing the Group financial statements for the current period, the Group has adopted a number of new IFRSs, amendments to IFRSs and IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations, none of which have had a significant effect on the results or net assets of the Group.
A list is provided in an appendix to the Annual Report.
Standards in issue but not effective A complete list of standards that are in issue but not yet effective is included with our full accounting policies in an appendix to the Annual Report.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces IAS 39 and is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The Group has performed a high-level impact assessment of the key aspects of IFRS 9.
This preliminary assessment is based on currently available information and may be subject to changes in the future.
Classification and measurement New classification and measurement criteria require financial instruments to be classified into one of the three categories being amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair value through profit or loss.
The Group expects there to be nil impact based on our current profile of financial instruments, excluding those held relating to NYX, which have been disposed of in January 2018.
Impairment IFRS 9 requires the Group to use an expected credit loss model for its financial assets measured at amortised cost, either on a 12-month or a lifetime basis.
The Group financial assets at amortised cost currently consist of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and loans receivable.
None of these financial assets have a significant financing component and the Group expects to apply the simplified approach and record lifetime expected losses on all trade receivables and loans receivable measured at amortised cost.
The Group does not expect these changes will have a significant impact.
Hedge accounting The general hedge accounting mechanism of IAS 39 has been retained, however greater flexibility has been introduced over the instruments eligible for hedge accounting and effectiveness testing.
The changes relating to hedge accounting are not expected to impact the Group.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers, with an effective date for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
Under IFRS 15, an entity recognises revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied, i. e. when control of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer.
The Groups core revenues of sports betting and gaming are not within the scope of IFRS 15.
Other operating income mostly represents rents receivable on properties let by the Group, bookmaking software licensing income, bookmaking services income and income from software development.
Rents receivable is also not within the scope of IFRS 15.
Early assessment of the new standard suggests that the performance obligations of bookmaking software licensing income, bookmaking services income and income from software development are satisfied over time and that the method currently used to measure the progress towards complete satisfaction of these performance obligations will continue to be appropriate under IFRS 15.
The Group expects there to be an immaterial impact on the financial statements on adoption of IFRS 15.
IFRS 16 Leases will replace IAS 17 in its entirety and is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
It will result in most leases being recognised on the Statement of Financial Position.
The Group continues to assess the full impact of IFRS 16 but since the impact is influenced by interest rates in future years, it is not yet possible to reasonably quantify its effects.
At this stage, the directors assess that the implementation of the new standard will likely have a material impact upon the Groups reported performance, Statement of Financial Position and operating cash flows.
William Hill PLC 114 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Statement of Group Accounting Policies continued Key accounting policies Below we set out our key accounting policies.
A complete list of our accounting policies is included in the Annual Report as an appendix on pages158 to 162.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable from customers and represents amounts receivable for goods and services that the Group is in business to provide, net of discounts, marketing inducements and VAT, as set outbelow.
In the case of the LBO including gaming machines, US, Online Sportsbook and telebetting, Online casino including games on theOnline arcade and other numbers bets and Australian operations, revenue represents gains and losses from gambling activity in the period.
Openpositions are carried at fair value and gains and losses arising on this valuation are recognised in revenue, aswell as gains and losses realised on positions that have closed.
Revenue from the Online poker business reflects the net income rake earned from poker games completed by theperiodend.
Other operating income mostly represents rents receivable on properties let by the Group, bookmaking software licensing income, bookmaking services income and income from software development, which are recognised on an accruals basis.
Going concern A full description of the Groups business activities, financial position, cash flows, liquidity position, committed facilities and borrowing position, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and performance, is set out in the Strategic Report, including the Financial Review, and in notes 22 and 23 to the financial statements.
As highlighted in notes 22 and 23 to the Group financial statements, the Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements from the positive cash flows generated by its trading activities and its available cash resources.
These are supplemented when required by additional drawings under the Groups revolving credit bank loan facilities, which are committed until May 2019.
Whilst there are a number of risks to the Groups trading performance, as summarised in the Managing our risks section on pages 45 to 50, the Group is confident of its ability to continue to access sources of funding in the medium term.
The Groups strategic forecasts, based on reasonable assumptions, indicate that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its currently available and expected future facilities and its banking covenants for the period of the strategic forecast.
After making enquiries and after consideration of the Groups existing operations, cash flow forecasts and assessment of business, regulatory and financing risks, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Exceptional items and adjustments The Group presents adjusted results, as described in note 3, which differ from statutory results due to the exclusion of exceptional items and adjustments.
Exceptional items are those items the directors consider to be one-off or material in nature that should be brought to the readers attention inunderstanding the Groups financial performance.
Adjustments are recurring items that are excluded from internal measures of underlying performance and which are not considered by the directors to be exceptional.
They comprise the following: the amortisation of specific intangible assets recognised in acquisitions: the recognition of interest income on redeemable convertible preference shares see notes 16 and 24 : and fair value movements relating to redeemable convertible preference shares and warrants over equity instruments see notes 16 and 24.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in the key accounting policies above and in the Statement of Group Accounting Policies included on pages158 to 162, thedirectors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from theseestimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical accounting judgements The following are the critical accounting judgements, apart from those involving estimates which are dealt with separately below that the directors have made in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements William Hill PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 115 Taxation Due to the multi-national nature of the Group and the complexity of tax legislation in various jurisdictions in which the Group operates, the directors must apply judgement in assessing the likely outcome of certain tax matters whose final outcome may not be determined for a number of years.
In forming that judgement, the directors make assumptions regarding the interpretation and application of tax laws to the circumstances of those specific items.
These judgements are reassessed in each period until the outcome is finally determined through resolution with a tax authority and or through a legal process.
Differences arising from changes in judgement or from final resolution may be material and will be charged or credited to the Income Statement in the relevant period.
Within the Groups net current tax liability of 8.3m 27 December 2016: 25.7m are amounts of 11.6m 27 December 2016: 21.4m that relate to uncertain tax positions see note 9.
The Group evaluates uncertain items, where the tax treatment is subject to interpretation and remains to be agreed with the relevant tax authority.
Provisions for uncertain items are made using judgement of the most likely tax expected to be paid, based on a qualitative assessment of all relevant information.
In assessing the appropriate provision for uncertain items, the Group considers progress made in discussions with tax authorities, expert advice on the likely outcome and recent developments in case law.
Exceptional items and restructuring costs The Group separately reports exceptional items in order to calculate adjusted results, as it believes these measures provide additional useful information on underlying performance and trends to shareholders.
Specifically the Group has incurred a range of costs relating to the current Group-wide transformation programme, many of which have been presented as restructuring costs within exceptional items.
Judgement is required in determining whether an item should be classified as an exceptional item within restructuring costs or included within the underlying results.
The Groups definition of exceptional items and restructuring costs are outlined in note 3.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts ofassets and liabilities within the next financial period are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are impaired requires an estimation of the value in useofthe cashgenerating units to which the goodwill or intangible assets have been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the directors to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Note 12 provides information on the assumptions used in these financial statements, as well as the degree of sensitivity to changes in assumptions.
The Triennial Review of Stakes and Prizes is currently ongoing and the timing of recommendations from the UK Government remains unclear.
These will likely include changes to the regulation of the maximum stakes on gaming machines.
A severely adverse outcome would significantly increase the risk of a material impairment of assets in the Retail division.
Although the result of the Triennial Review is not yet known, based on the impairment review conducted at 26 December 2017 for the Retail CGU, a 20% fall in future cash flows, with all other things being equal, would lead to an impairment of 110.9m: a 30% fall in future cash flows would lead to an impairment of 270.3m: a 40% fall in future cash flows would lead to an impairment of 429.6m and a 50% fall would lead to an impairment of 588.9m.
In Australia, the South Australia State Government introduced a Point of Consumption Tax POCT on betting at 15% of gross win.
The Western Australia State Government has also announced a POCT of 15% commencing on 1 January 2019.
Other states are expected to follow this trend and the impairment review performed at 26 December 2017 incorporates probability weighted cash flows of POCT being enacted by these other states note 12.
The actual decisions made by the different states may differ from the estimated probabilities and an adverse outcome could lead to further impairments in the Australia CGU.
Retirement benefit costs The determination of the pension cost and defined benefit obligation of the Groups defined benefit pension scheme depends on the selection of certain assumptions which include discount rate, inflation rate and mortality assumptions.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in subsequent periods.
Note 32 provides information on the assumptions used in these financial statements, including a sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure scheme liabilities.

Non-current asset information is based on physical location for property, plant and equipment or primary operating location of the Company using the asset for all other assets.
Exceptional items and adjustments Adjusted results The Group reports adjusted results, both internally and externally, that differ from statutory results prepared in accordance with IFRS.
These adjusted results, which include our KPIs of adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS, are considered by the directors to be a useful reflection of the underlying performance of the Group and its businesses, since they exclude transactions which impair visibility of the underlying activity indivisions.
More specifically, the directors judge that visibility can be impaired in one or both of the following instances: a transaction is of such a material or infrequent nature that it would obscure an understanding of underlying outcomes and trends in revenues, costs or other components of performance for example, a significant impairment charge : or a transaction that results from a corporate activity that has neither a close relationship to our businesses operations nor any associated operational cash flows for example, the amortisation of intangibles recognised on acquisitions.
Adjusted results are used as the primary measures of business performance within the Group and align with the results shown in management accounts, with the key uses being: management and Board reviews of performance against expectations and over time, including assessments of divisional performance see note 2 and the Strategic Report : Remuneration Committee assessments of targets and performance for management remuneration purposes see pages 77 to 97 : in support of business decisions by the Board and by management, encompassing both strategic and operational levels of decision-making: and assessments of loan covenant compliance, which refer to adjusted results.
The Groups policies on adjusted measures have been consistently applied over time, but they are not defined by IFRS and, therefore, may differ from adjusted measures as used by other companies.
The Consolidated Income Statement presents adjusted results alongside statutory measures, with the reconciling items being itemised and described below.
We discriminate between two types of reconciling items: exceptional items and defined other adjustments.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are those items the directors consider to be one-off or material in nature that should be brought to the readers attention in understanding the Groups financial performance.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements William Hill PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 119 3.
Exceptional items and adjustments continued Adjustments Adjustments are recurring items that are excluded from internal measures of underlying performance and which are not considered by the directors to be exceptional.
They comprise the following: the amortisation of specific intangible assets recognised in acquisitions: the recognition of interest income on redeemable convertible preference shares see notes 16 and 24 : and fair value movements relating to redeemable convertible preference shares and warrants over equity investments see notes 16 and 24.
These items are defined as adjustments as the directors believe they would impair the visibility of the underlying activities across the divisions as they are not closely related to the businesses or any associated operational cash flows.
These items are recurring, with the amortisation of specific intangible assets recognised in acquisitions recognised over their useful life and for the interest income and fair value movements on the redeemable convertible preference shares, these are recognised over the ten-year life of the instrument.
Although the sale of the redeemable convertible preference shares was agreed in the period, it was assessed the disposal did not complete until January 2018 see note 16 and therefore these items have been classified as adjustments as they are considered recurring up to the point of disposal.
Exceptional items and adjustments are as follows: 52 weeks 52 weeks ended ended Exceptional 26 December Exceptional 27 December items Adjustments 2017 items Adjustments 2016 m m m m m m Operating Cost of sales Indirect taxation 17.1 17.1 Other operating expenses Restructuring costs 54.4 54.4 10.2 10.2 Portfolio shop closures 7.3 7.3 0.4 0.4 Impairment of Australia goodwill 238.3 238.3 Onerous contract 10.0 10.0 Compliance fines 6.2 6.2 Disposal of Stadia operations 2.5 2.5 Legal fees 1.3 1.3 1 Corporate transaction costs 9.8 9.8 Fair value movements on derivative financial instruments 7.2 7.2 9.9 9.9 Amortisation of acquired intangibles 5.1 5.1 6.4 6.4 337.1 2.1 335.0 19.6 16.3 35.9 Non-operating Investment income on redeemable convertible preference shares 5.5 5.5 3.2 3.2 5.5 5.5 3.2 3.2 Total exceptional items and adjustments before tax 337.1 7.6 329.5 19.6 13.1 32.7 Tax on exceptional items and adjustments 8.3 1.1 9.4 2.5 0.5 3.0 Exceptional tax items Total exceptional items and adjustments 328.8 8.7 320.1 17.1 12.6 29.7 1 During 2016, the Group incurred material costs relating to M&A activity, reflecting two proposed corporate transactions.
These costs were presented as exceptional, since they were material in size, one-off in nature and would otherwise have distorted an understanding of our underlying cost base.
Indirect taxation The Group has accrued for certain indirect taxes that it now expects to pay following a clarification on tax interpretations.
The retrospective element has been presented as exceptional within Cost of sales in light of the material scale and one-off nature of the charge.
Restructuring costs This is a continuation of the substantial corporate restructurings the Group commenced in 2016, referred to as the transformation programme in the Strategic Report, encompassing cost optimisation and business model initiatives.
This is part of a Group-wide programme, which is expected to complete in 2019.
This programme, whose costs include fees for external advisers, provisions for onerous property leases and the cost of staff redundancies, are substantial in scope and impact and do not form part of recurring operational or management activities that the directors would consider part of our underlying performance.
For these reasons, the directors judge the directly attributable cost impact to be exceptional.
William Hill PLC 120 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 3.
Exceptional items and adjustments continued Portfolio shop closures During 2017, as part of the ongoing Group-wide transformation programme, the Group performed a full strategic review of the shop estate.
This review led to the closure of 25 shops with a provision made for onerous leases and other costs of closure.
This strategic review was a one-off exercise leading to a material expense and, therefore, the directors judge the cost to be exceptional.
A further 14 shops were closed during the period in the normal course of business upon expiry of their leases and their costs are not included within this exceptional item.
Impairment of Australia goodwill Given the adverse regulatory changes and the strategic review of the Australian business currently being undertaken, management have recognised an impairment of goodwill in the Australia CGU see note 12.
This has been presented as an exceptional item due to both its material scale and one-off nature.
Onerous contract The Group has recognised the costs of a specific contract where a change in strategy due to the transformation programme meant that the contract was considered onerous with no economic benefits expected to be received.
This has been presented as exceptional given it is material and related to a specific one-off contract.
Compliance fines The Group has entered into a regulatory settlement with the UK Gambling Commission and, as a result, the Group has agreed to pay a total package of 6.2m, including a sum of 1.2m to be returned to affected parties.
This has been presented as exceptional given the settlement is a one-off material transaction.
Disposal of Stadia operations On 31 July 2017, the Group sold its Greyhound Stadia operations to Arena Racing Company.
The Group recognised a loss on disposal of 2.5m, including costs to sell of 0.7m see note 17.
This has been classified as exceptional as it is a one-off transaction and is material in the context of the Other segment.
Legal fees These represent our fees in respect of legal action following the 2012 acquisition of businesses in Nevada, USA.
These have been classified as exceptional given they are material in the context of the US segment and due to the potential of damages and fees being awarded to the Group which would be treated as an exceptional gain due to their material scale and one-off nature.

The effective tax rate in respect of statutory results was minus 11.5% 52 weeks ended 27 December 2016: 9.3%.
The current periods charge was lower than the UK statutory rate of19.25% mainly due to adjustments in respect of prior periods uncertain tax positions, lower tax rates on overseas profits and timing differences not recognised in deferred tax, partially offset by non-deductible expenditure.

Tax on loss profit on ordinary activities continued Non-deductible expenditure includes exceptional costs that are non-revenue related.
The deduction for tax rates in overseas territories reflects the lower effective tax rate on profits earned in Gibraltar, partially offset by a higher tax rate on US profits.
The tax credit in respect of prior periods reflects the routine closure of prior period tax returns with tax authorities and the net release of provisions previously held for specific uncertain tax positions of 14.0m.
The effective tax rate in 2018 is expected to be c14% and should remain at around this level whilst the business operates in the same territories and at the same scale.

In line with the requirements of IAS 10 Events after the Reporting Period, this dividend has not been recognised within these results.
The Group estimates that approximately 859 million shares will qualify for the final dividend.
Under an agreement signed in November 2002, The WilliamHill Holdings 2001 Employee Benefit Trust agreed to waive alldividends.
Shares held in treasury also do not qualify for dividends.
Details ofshares held by the WilliamHill Holdings 2001 Employee Benefit Trust and held in treasury are given in note28.
Loss earnings per share The loss earnings per share figures for the respective periods are as follows: 52 weeks ended 26 December 2017 52 weeks ended 27 December 2016 Potentially Potentially dilutive dilutive share share Basic options Diluted Basic options Diluted Loss profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the parent for the financialperiod m 83.2 83.2 164.5 164.5 Adjusted profit after tax for the financial period m 236.9 236.9 194.2 194.2 Weighted average number of shares million 856.9 4.8 861.7 871.8 3.0 874.8 Loss earnings per share pence 9.7 9.7 18.9 0.1 18.8 Earnings per share adjusted pence 27.6 0.1 27.5 22.3 0.1 22.2 An adjusted earnings per share, based on adjusted profits as described in note 3, has been presented in order tohighlight the underlying performance of the Group.
The basic weighted average number of shares excludes shares held by The WilliamHill Holdings 2001 Employee Benefit Trustand those shares held in treasury as such shares do not qualify for dividends.
The effect of this was to reduce the average number of shares by 30.4 million 52 weeks ended 27 December 2016: 14.4 million.
The diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share as the potentially dilutive share options are considered antidilutive as they would reduce the loss per share and therefore they are disregarded in the calculation.
William Hill PLC 124 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 12.
The directors consider that the Groups licences have an indefinite life owing to: the fact that the Group is a significant operator in awellestablished market: the proven and sustained demand for bookmaking services: and the Groups track record of successfully renewing itsbetting permits and licences.
Brands, trade names and customer relationships This category of assets includes brands, trade names and customer relationships recognised in business combinations.
These include the following significant items: i US assets In 2012, the Group acquired three US businesses.
Brands and other assets of 13.1m were recognised and are being amortised over lives ofbetween three and ten years.
Certain assets were fully amortised in the current period.
ii Sportingbet assets In March 2013, the Group acquired businesses and assets from the Sportingbet group, including operations under the Centrebet brand.
Brand and customer relationship assets were recognised of 163.1m and these are being amortised over lives ranging up to12 years.
iii Grand Parade assets In 2016, the Group acquired Grand Parade Limited.
Customer relationships and brand assets of 2.8m were recognised on acquisition and are being amortised over a life of 18 months.
Impairment reviews The Group performs an annual impairment review for goodwill andother intangible assets with indefinite lives, by comparing the carrying amount of these assets with their recoverable amount.
This is an area where the directors exercise judgement and estimation, as noted on page 115.
The most recent test was conducted at 26 December 2017.
Testing is carried out by allocating the carrying value of these assets to cashgenerating units CGUs and determining the recoverable amounts of those CGUs through value in use calculations.
Where the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the assets, the assets are considered as not impaired.
Value in use calculations are based upon estimates of future cash flows derived from the Groups longrange adjusted operating profit forecasts by division.
Adjusted operating profit forecasts are derived from the Groups annual strategic planning or similarly scoped exercise.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements William Hill PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 125 12.
Intangible assets continued These are forecasts, looking four years ahead, with separate extrapolation of net revenue and expenses by division based on a combination of recently observable trends, management expectations and known future events.
For the purposes of the value in use calculation, the longrange operating forecast is extended to cover a fiveyear period.
Year one of the longrange adjusted operating profit forecast is replaced immediately prior to use if an annual budget for that year has been subsequently approved.
This is done to ensure that year one of the test reflects the latest detailed planning for that period.
The implications, if any, of a materially different adjusted operating profit outcome for annual budget versus the relevant year of the long range forecast are also considered at that point.
Cash flows beyond that fiveyear period are extrapolated using long term growth rates as estimated for each CGU separately.
Both the following years budget and the longrange adjusted operating profit forecasts are approved by the Board.
Discount rates are applied to each CGUs cash flows that reflect both the time value of money and the risks that apply to the cash flows of that CGU.
Discount rates are calculated using the weighted average cost of capital formula based on the CGUs leveraged beta.
The leverage beta is determined by management as the median unleveraged beta of listed gaming and betting companies, withsamples chosen where applicable from comparable markets or territories as the CGU, leveraged to the CGUs and Groups capital structure.
Further risk premia and discounts are applied, ifappropriate, to this rate to reflect the risk profile of the specific CGU relative to the market in which it operates.
Our discount rates are calculated on a pretax basis and the calculations incorporate estimates of the tax rates that will apply to the future cash flows of the applicableCGU.
The principal assumptions underlying our cash flow forecasts are as follows: we assume that the underlying business model will continue to operate on a comparable basis, as adjusted for key sporting events, known regulatory or tax changes and planned business initiatives: our forecasts anticipate the continuation of recent growth or decline trends in staking, gaming net revenues and expenses, as adjusted for changes in our business model or expected changes in the wider industry or economy: we assume that we will achieve our target sports betting gross win margins as set for each territory, which we base upon our experience of the outturn of sports results over the long term, given the tendency for sports results to vary in the short term but revert to a norm over alonger term: and in our annual budget process, expenses incorporate a bottomup estimation of our cost base.
For employee remuneration, this takes into account staffing numbers and models by division, while other costs are assessed separately by category, with principal assumptions including an extrapolation of recent cost inflation trends and the expectation that we will incur costs in line with agreed contractual rates.
The other significant assumptions incorporated into our impairment reviews are those relating to discount rates and longterm growth assumptions, as noted below separately for each CGU.
CGUs Longterm Discount rate growth rate Cashgenerating unit % % Retail 9.1 0.0 Online 8.3 2.6 US 12.2 3.0 Australia 11.5 2.6 Australia CGU recognised an impairment of 238.3m in Other operating expenses as an exceptional item note 3.
The impairment reflects the changes in regulation in Australia, both the ban on credit betting and the Point of Consumption Tax POCT, as well as the strategic review being undertaken by management due to the regulation changes.
During the year the South Australia State Government introduced a POCT on betting at 15% of gross win.
The Western Australia State Government have also announced a POCT of 15% commencing on 1 January 2019.
The cash flow forecasts incorporate the impact from these tax changes as they are known.
They also include probability weighted cash flows of POCT being enacted by other states.
No impairment was identified in any of the other CGUs tested.
The CGUs are defined as their segment, which we describe in note 2.
The carrying value of each CGUs goodwill and indefinite lives intangible assets is as below: Indefinite life Goodwill intangibles Total Cashgenerating unit m m m Retail 680.7 484.3 1,165.0 Online 193.3 193.3 US 22.4 22.4 Australia 62.7 62.7 Sensitivity of impairment reviews For CGUs reviewed at 26 December 2017, no impairment would occur under any reasonable possible changes in assumptions upon which the recoverable amount was estimated, other than a 20% decrease in future cash flows would lead to a 110.9m impairment for the Retail CGU.
The recoverable amount of the Retail CGU exceeds the carrying amount by 207.7m.
A decrease in forecast operating cash flows of 13.0% would lead to the recoverable amount of the Retail CGU equalling the carrying amount.
William Hill PLC 126 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 12.
Intangible assets continued The Triennial Review of Stakes and Prizes is currently ongoing and the timing of recommendations from the UK Government remains unclear.
Although the result of the Triennial Review is not yet known, based on the impairment review conducted for the Retail CGU, a 30% fall in future cash flows, with all other things being equal, would lead to an impairment of 270.3m: a 40% fall in future cash flows would lead to an impairment of 429.6m and a 50% fall would lead to an impairment of 588.9m.
In Australia, the impairment review performed incorporates probability weighted cash flows of POCT being enacted by additional states.

Consequently, the investments have beenstated at cost and have not been accounted for under the equity method, which would normally be appropriate for an associated undertaking.
A dividend of 0.4m was received from 49s Limited which was recognised within share of results of associates note 4.
Investments The Group has longterm commercial agreements and investments with NYX Gaming Group Limited NYX.
On 20 September 2017 Scientific Games Corporation SGC and NYX announced SGCs agreed proposal to acquire NYX and all outstanding NYX shares.
The agreed price was $2.40 CAD per share.
On 7 December 2017, the Group reached an agreement with SGC to unconditionally support SGCs proposed acquisition of NYX.
In connection with the proposed acquisition, SGC agreed to acquire the Groups convertible preference shares for 87.9m and the ordinary shares at the acquisition price of $2.40 CAD per share 9.6m.
The transfer of the investments, and receipt of consideration, was completed on 5 January 2018.
As such, it was assessed the Group still held the risk and rewards of ownership of these investments at the period end.
Details of the Groups investments in NYX are shown below.
Convertible Notes On 4 April 2016, in connection with a commercial agreement, the Group invested 80.0m into redeemable convertible preference shares issued by NYX.
The convertible preference shares were convertible into NYX ordinary shares or redeemable in cash, with an implied interest coupon of 6% payable in kind at the term of ten years.
As the redeemable convertible preference shares were akin to convertible notes they were therefore accounted for as such Convertible Notes.
The embedded derivative element was bifurcated from the loan element and accounted for separately.
The Group has agreed consideration of 87.9m for the disposal of the convertible preference shares in January 2018.
The loan element was recognised as a loans and receivables financial asset at an initial value of 37.5m.
This was accounted for on an amortised cost basis at an effective interest rate of 13.6%.
Interest of 5.5m was recognised in the period 27 December 2016: 3.2m, which is classified as investment income in the Income Statement as an adjustment, as defined by note 3.
The convertible element was recognised as a derivative financial asset at fair value through profit or loss, at an initial fair value of 44.1m, with movements recognised in the Income Statement as an adjustment, as defined by note 3, within other operating expenses.
The fair value at 26 December 2017 was 41.7m.
Fair value of the derivative at period end was determined as the agreed convertible preference share disposal consideration of 87.9m, less the carrying value of the loan element.
A fair value gain of 7.2m was recognised in the period 27 December 2016: 9.6m loss.

Investments continued Ordinary Shares On 20 April 2016, an investment of CAD $18.8m 10.3m was made into ordinary equity of NYX, representing 6.8 million ordinary shares Ordinary Shares, valued at 9.7m, and 1.7 million warrants Warrants, valued at 0.6m.
The ordinary shares were recognised as an availableforsale financial asset and therefore revalued to fair value at each period end with any movements recognised in other comprehensive income.
At 26 December 2017, the fair value of the shares was 9.3m based on a share price of CAD $2.40 per share.
The fair value gain recognised in the period was 4.0m 27 December 2016: 4.4m loss.
Warrants The Warrants are a derivative and are therefore categorised as fair value through profit or loss.
These are revalued to fair value at each period end with any movements recognised in the Income Statement, as an adjustment as defined by note 3, within operating expenses.
At 26 December 2017 the Warrants were valued at 0.3m and held within noncurrent derivative financial instruments.
No fair value changes were recognised in the period 27 December 2017: 0.3m loss.
Loan On 27 May 2016, the Group agreed to loan 3.2m to NYX.
The loan was interestfree and due for repayment in June 2020.
As part of the Groups unconditional support of SGCs proposed acquisition, NYX agreed to pay this loan in full earlier than the repayment due date.
The loan was repaid in full on 5 January 2018.

Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks.
Financial risk management is primarily carried out by the Group Treasurer under risk management policies approved by the Board of directors and supervised by the CFO.
The Board approves written principles for risk management, as described in the Strategic Report on page 45.
The principal financial risks faced by the Group comprise liquidity risk, financing risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, currency risk and pensions risk.
These risks are managed as described below.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group has insufficient funds available to settle its liabilities as they fall due.
The Groups business generates strong operating cash flows and the Group aims to maintain sufficient cash balances to meet its anticipated working capital requirements based on regularly updated cash flow forecasts.
Liquidity requirements that cannot be met from operational cash flow or existing cash resources are satisfied by drawings under the Groups RCF.
The Group maintains adequate committed but undrawn facilities to meet such requirements.
Details of the Groups borrowing arrangements are provided in note 22.
The table below details the Groups expected maturity for its derivative and non-derivative financial liabilities.
The table hasbeen drawn up on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the financial instruments including interest that will be receivable or payable on them.
Where applicable, interest payments in respect of the floating rate liabilities are estimated based on the one month sterling LIBOR rate at the period enddate.

William Hill PLC 136 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 23.
Financial risk management continued Capital management and financing risk The Group seeks to maintain an appropriate capital structure which enables it to continue as a going concern, supports its business strategy and takes into account the wider economic environment.
The Groups capital comprises equity and debt finance and these elements are managed to balance the requirements of the business and the interests of shareholders and debt stakeholders.
The Group manages its capital structure through cash flows from operations, returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, theraising or repayment ofdebt and the raising of equity capital from investors.
Financing risk is the risk that the Group is unable to access sufficient finance to refinance its debt obligations as they fall due.
The Group manages this risk by maintaining a balance between different funding sources including equity and debt.
It seeks tomitigate its debt financing risk by diversifying its sources of loan finance.
The bank loan and corporate bond markets are currently used for this purpose.
The Board also seeks to mitigate the Groups refinancing risk by having an appropriately balanced debt maturity profile.
Net debt to EBITDA ratio The Group assesses its debt capital structure primarily through use of the net debt to EBITDA ratio.
As one of the financial covenants under its bank loan facility, the Group must ensure that its net debt to rolling 12-month EBITDA does not exceed 3.5 times.
Based on current forecasts, the Group expects to operate within these covenant limits throughout the lifetime of the facility.
Net debt for covenant purposes and EBITDA for covenant purposes are not statutory measures and may differ from loan covenant measures asused by other companies.
The net debt to EBITDA ratio was: 26 December 27 December 2017 2016 m m Nominal value of bank loans Nominal value of corporate bonds 725.0 725.0 Counter indemnity obligations under bank guarantees 3.7 4.1 Cash excluding customer balances and other restricted cash note 19 213.5 111.0 Net debt for covenant purposes 515.2 618.1 EBITDA for covenant purposes see table below 379.0 347.8 Net debt to EBITDA ratio 1.4 1.8 EBITDA for covenant purposes is adjusted profit before depreciation, amortisation, interest, tax and share-based payments and is calculated as follows: 26 December 27 December 2017 2016 m m Adjusted profit before interest and tax 291.3 261.5 Depreciation 30.1 31.6 Amortisation of intangible assets 52.4 48.6 Share-based payments 5.2 6.1 EBITDA for covenant purposes 379.0 347.8 Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk from counterparties defaulting on their obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
It arises in relation to transactions with commercial counterparties and to transactions with financial institutions with which theGroup deposits its surplus funds and from counterparties with which the Group has entered into derivative financial transactions for hedging purposes.
Italso arises from customers who have been granted credit with which to bet with theGroup.
The Group manages its financial counterparty credit risk by limiting or otherwise closely monitoring the amount that can be deposited with any one institution andbyrestricting the counterparties with which it will deposit funds to institutions with specified minimum credit ratings or which meet specified criteria.
The Groups policy is to mitigate its credit risk with respect to derivative transactions by using a number of different counterparties for material transactions.
As at 26 December 2017, the Group had no derivative contracts for currency hedging purposes 27 December 2016: nil.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements William Hill PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 137 23.
Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from the Groups borrowings.
The Group has a policy which aims to maintain a balance between fixed and floating rate debt exposures appropriate to the expected performance of the business, the Groups debt burden and the wider economic environment.
At 26 December 2017, all of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates.
The Group also earns investment income from deposits held at financial institutions.
Based on the current level of variable interest bearing deposits and borrowing facilities, a 100 basis points change in interest rates would have the following impact on the Group financialstatements: Increase of Decrease of 100 basis 100 basis points points m m Increase decrease in profit 3.2 0.9 Increase decrease in equity reserves 3.2 0.9 The directors have used a 100 basis points change in interest rates as we assess that this best illustrates the impact of plausible changes in interest rates on the Groups performance and financial position.
Currency risk The Group earns revenues in foreign currencies, primarily Australian Dollars, Euros and US Dollars, which exposes it to foreign exchange risk.
The Group mitigates this risk by incurring costs in currencies matching its revenues.
Any remaining transactional foreign currency exposure is not considered to be material and is not hedged.
Material individual foreign currency transaction exposures are considered for hedging on an adhoc basis.
The Group is also exposed to foreign currency accounting translation risk on the earnings and net assets of its overseas operations which are denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group does not hedge such translation risk.
Revenue by currency Revenue by currency is analysed below.
52 weeks 52 weeks ended ended 26 December 27 December 2017 2016 % % Sterling 81.6 82.3 Australian dollar 7.2 7.2 Euro 6.0 5.7 US dollar 4.3 3.8 Other currencies 0.9 1.0 Total 100.0 100.0 Pensions risk The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes for its employees.
Pensions risk arises inrespect of thedefinedbenefit scheme where the cost of funding retirement benefits ultimately falls upon the Group.
The last triennial actuarial valuation asat30September 2016 showed a funding surplus on the defined benefit scheme of 1.5m.
The Group has agreed to pay 8.8m per annum towards ongoing funding requirements until December 2019.
In addition it contributes 1.9m per annum towards the cost of insured death benefits and other administrative expenses of running the scheme.
The Group seeks to manage the cash flow impact arising from pensions risk.
Accordingly, the defined benefit scheme was closed to newentrants in 2002 and was restricted as to future accrual from April 2011.
The Group attempts to further manage its exposure by agreeing with thePension Scheme Trustees the assumptions to be used to calculate the scheme liabilities, the investment strategy tobefollowed and any cash contributions to be made by the Group.

Derivative financial instruments Details of the Groups derivative financial instruments are given below.
NYX Convertible element of Convertible Notes The embedded derivative Convertible element of Convertible Notes was recognised at an initial fair value at acquisition of 44.1m.
This has been valued at fair value of 41.7m determined as the agreed convertible preference share disposal consideration of 87.9m, less 46.2m carrying value of the Loan element of Convertible Notes note 16.
Ante post bets Ante post bets are a liability arising from an open position at the period end date in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for derivative financial instruments.
Ante post bets at the period end totalled 14.1m 27 December 2016: 14.0m and are classified as currentliabilities.
Ante post bet liabilities are valued using methods and inputs that are not based upon observable market data and all fair value movements on the balance are recognised in revenue in the Income Statement.
There are no reasonably possible changes toassumptions or inputs that would lead to material changes in the fair value determined, although the final value will be determined by future sporting results.
The principal assumptions relate to anticipated gross win margins on unsettled bets.

The 21% future rate of US corporation tax was enacted in December 2017.
The Group has recognised 12.7m of deferred tax assets, including 0.7m of losses, which have been recognised as the losses are in companies which are anticipated to make future profits.
The Group has no material unrecognised deferred tax assets.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in the above analysis.

Further to the shareholders resolution of the Company passed at the AGM held on 9 May 2017, the Company did not purchase any of its own shares during the period 27 December 2016: 29,573,675.
The reason that no shares were purchased was the completion of the Companys share repurchase programme in December 2016.
The shares previously acquired under the share repurchase programme are all held in treasury with no shares cancelled in the period.
The Company has the authority, under the shareholders resolution passed on 9 May 2017, to purchase up to a maximum of 85,774,500 shares of the Company.
The minimum price exclusive of all expenses which may be paid for an ordinary share is 10p being the nominal value of the ordinary share.
The maximum price exclusive of all expenses which may be paid for an ordinary share is an amount equal to the higher of: 105% of the average of the middle market quotations for an ordinary share as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five business days immediately preceding the day on which that ordinary share is purchased: and the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest independent current bid on the London Stock Exchange at the time the purchase is carried out.
The authority conferred, unless varied, revoked or renewed prior to such time, expires at the earlier of the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company or on 30 June 2018.

EBMS shares are partly deferred shares conditional on continued employment of the individual at the date of vesting and partly share awards dependent on the Groups EPS growth as well as continued employment at the date of vesting.
EBMS awards must be exercised within one month from their vesting date, which is three years after their grant date.
If PSP options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options lapse.
The RSP and RA are deferred grants of shares contingent upon continued employment.
The PSP, EBMS, RSP and RA are conditional awards of shares and the recipients do not have to pay an exercise price.
Theweighted average share price at the date of exercise for share awards exercised during the period was 2.60 52 weeks ended 27 December 2016: 3.72.

William Hill PLC 144 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 32.
Retirement benefit schemes The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
The UK schemes are operated under asingle trust and the assets of all the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
The respective costs ofthese schemes are as follows: 52 weeks 52 weeks ended ended 26 December 27 December 2017 2016 m m Defined contribution schemes charged to profit before interest and tax 11.9 11.9 Defined benefit scheme charged to profit before interest and tax 1.8 2.0 Defined benefit scheme credited to finance costs 0.5 1.0 Defined benefit scheme credited charged to other comprehensive income 33.0 17.8 19.8 30.7 Defined contribution schemes The defined contribution schemes, to which both the Group and employees contribute to fund the benefits, are available for all eligible employees.
The only obligation of the Group with respect to these schemes is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income in respect of these schemes represents contributions payable to the schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the respective schemes.
At 26 December 2017, contributions of 0.8m 27 December 2016: 1.1m duein respect ofthecurrent reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit scheme The Group also operates a defined benefit scheme in the UK for eligible employees which closed to new members in 2002.
Under the scheme, employees are entitled to retirement benefits varying between 1.67% and 3.33% of final pensionable pay for each year of service on attainment of a retirement age of 63.
With effect from 1 April 2011, the defined benefit scheme was closed to future accrual but maintains the link for benefits accrued up to 31 March 2011 with future salary increases up to a maximum of 5% per annum.
Employed members of this scheme were automatically transferred into one of the defined contribution schemes.
The Group makes a contribution towards the costs of administering the scheme.
For the purposes of preparing the information disclosed in these accounts, a full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 30September 2016 and updated to 26 December 2017 by a qualified independent actuary.
The present values of the defined benefit obligation and the related current service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
Funding valuation The general principles adopted by the Trustees for the purposes of this funding valuation are that the assumptions used, taken as a whole, will be sufficiently prudent for pensions already in payment to continue to be paid and to reflect the commitments which will arise from members accrued pension rights.
The Group has agreed to pay 8.8m to the scheme towards ongoing funding requirements during 2018 plus a 1.9m contribution towards the cost of life assurance and costs of running the scheme.
The IAS 19 position of the plan, as reflected in our Statement of Financial Position, is generally expected to differ from that of the triennial funding valuation assessment.
The principal reasons for this difference are the requirements for prudence in the funding valuation which contrasts with the IAS 19 best estimate principle and the application of a prudent estimate of asset returns in the funding valuation which contrasts with the IAS 19 requirement to use a discount rate derived from high quality corporate bonds.
We have concluded, following professional advice, that no adjustment is required to our accounting to reflect either the recovery of the current IAS 19 surplus or a minimum funding requirement: this reflects that the Group has an unconditional right to recover that surplus in the future.
Disclosure of principal assumptions The financial assumptions used by the actuary in determining the present value of the defined benefit schemes liabilities were: 26 December 27 December 2017 2016 Rate of increase of salaries 2.0% 3.3% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.0% 3.1% Rate of increase for deferred benefits 2.2% 2.3% Discount rate 2.4% 2.7% Rate of RPI inflation 3.2% 3.3% Rate of CPI inflation 2.2% 2.3% Strategic report Governance Financial statements William Hill PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 145 32.
Retirement benefit schemes continued In accordance with the relevant accounting standard, the discount rate has been determined by reference to market yields at the period end date on high-quality fixed income investments at a term consistent with the expected duration of the liabilities.
Price inflation is determined by the difference between the yields on fixed and index-linked Government bonds with an adjustment to allow for differences in the demand for these bonds, which can distort this figure.
The Bank of England target inflation rate has also been considered in setting this assumption.
Theexpected rate of salary growth and pension increases are set with reference to the expected rate of inflation.
No change has been made to the basis of inflation applied to pension increases in the scheme.
The mortality assumption is kept under review and has been updated.
The current life expectancies for a member underlying the value ofthe accrued liabilities are: 26 December 27 December 2017 2016 Life expectancy at age 65 years years Male retiring now 21.8 22.5 Male retiring in 25 years time 24.1 24.7 Female retiring now 24.2 25.3 Female retiring in 25 years time 26.5 27.6 The assets in the scheme are set out in the table below.

The illustrations consider the single change shown, with the other assumptions assumed to be unchanged.
In practice, changes in one assumption may be accompanied by offsetting changes in another assumption although this is not always the case.
In addition, changes in the assumptions may occur at the same time as changes in the market value of the scheme assets, which may or may not offset the change in assumptions.
Assumption Changes in assumption Impact on defined benefit liabilities Discount rate Decrease by 0.25% p. a.
Increase of 17.2m Rate of increase in inflation Increase by 0.25% p. a.
Increase of 10.3m Life expectancy Members assumed to live oneyearlonger Increase of 16.6m If the change in assumptions were in the opposite direction to that shown above, the impact on the defined benefit liabilities would be ofasimilar magnitude, but in the opposite direction.

Retirement benefit schemes continued Nature and extent of the risks arising from financial instruments held by the defined benefit scheme Pension assets and liabilities pre-tax of 450.7m and 392.0m respectively were held on the Groups Statementof Financial Position at 26 December 2017 27 December 2016: 430.5m and 415.0m respectively.
Through the scheme the Group is exposed toa number ofpotential risks as described below: asset volatility: the schemes defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: however, in addition to corporate bonds, the scheme invests in asset classes other than corporate bonds which may out or underperform corporate bonds in the long term but provide volatility and risk in the short term: changes in bond yields: the risk of a decrease in bond yields, which increases the value of the scheme liabilities, is partially offset by the upside benefit of an increase in the value of the schemes bondholdings: inflation risk: a significant proportion of the schemes defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation and therefore higher inflation would result in a higher defined benefit liability.
Although a proportion of the schemes investments are in inflation-linked securities which should compensate for any changes in inflation, the balance of the schemes assets is either unaffected by inflation or only loosely correlated with inflation and therefore an increase in inflation would also increase deficit: and life expectancy: if the schemes members live longer than expected, the schemes benefits will need to be paid for longer, increasing the defined benefit obligation longevity risk.
The Trustees and the Company manage the investment risk asset volatility in the scheme by investing c90% of the schemes investments in Liability Driven Investments LDI strategies which aim to invest in assets whose values move broadly in tandem with changes in liability values arising from market movements.
The Company accepts and indemnifies the other residual risks in the scheme including longevity risk.
Funding Alongside the risk assessment above, the Group has agreed an ongoing funding requirement with the Trustees, as described in note 23.
The weighted average duration of the schemes defined benefit obligation as at 26 December 2017 is 18 years 27 December 2016: 20 years.

Contingent liabilities As an international business the Group is exposed to uncertain tax positions and changes in legislation in the jurisdictions in which it operates.
The Groups uncertain tax positions principally include cross border transfer pricing and the interpretation of complex tax legislation.
The Group is also monitoring developments in relation to EU State Aid investigations including the EU Commissions announcements that it will be opening a State Aid investigation into the UKs Controlled Foreign Company regime announced on 26 October 2017 and into certain aspects of the Gibraltar corporate tax regimes announced on 16 October 2013 and 1 October 2014.
The Group does not currently consider any provision is required in relation to EU State Aid.
The assessment of uncertain tax positions is subjective and significant management judgement is required.
This judgement is based on interpretation of legislation, management experience and professional advice.
