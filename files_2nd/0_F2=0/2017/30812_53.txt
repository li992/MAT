As part of the transition, and to ensure shareholders receive the equivalent amount of total cash payments in 2018 as they would have under the previous payment policy, an additional interim dividend of 43.6 pence per share was announced on 5 December 2017 which was paid on 8 February 2018.
The dividend declared in 2017 for payment on 8 February 2018 was 1,000 million and is estimated based on the number of shares and the proportion of dividends to be paid in foreign currency using the exchange rate at year end.
This second interim dividend takes the total dividends declared in respect of 2017 to 4,465 million 2016: 3,155 million: 2015: 2,851 million representing 218.2 pence per share 2016: 169.4 pence per share: 2015: 154.0 pence per share.

The costs of internally developed assets include capitalised expenses of employees working full time on software development projects, third party consultants, as well as software licence fees from third party suppliers.
The Group has 16 million future contractual commitments 2016: nil million related to intangible assets.

Trademarks and similar intangibles with indefinite lives Included in the net book value of trademarks and similar intangibles are trademarks relating to the acquisition of RAI with indefinite lives amounting to 69,562 million.
The trademarks and similar intangibles have been tested for impairment in line with the methodology outlined below.
Impairment testing for intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill Goodwill of 44,147 million 2016: 11,023 million is included in intangible assets in the balance sheet of which the following are the significant acquisitions: RAI 33,062 million 2016: nil million : Rothmans Group 4,834 million 2016: 4,809 million : Imperial Tobacco Canada 2,367 million 2016: 2,420 million : ETI Italy 1,462 million 2016: 1,406 million and ST principally Scandinavia 1,102 million 2016: 1,061 million.
The principal allocations of goodwill in the Rothmans acquisition are to the cash-generating units of Eastern Europe, Western Europe and South Africa, with the remainder mainly relating to operations in the domestic and export markets in the United Kingdom and operations in Asia-Pacific.
Due to the integrated nature of the activities, the goodwill arising from the TDR acquisition principally Croatia has been transferred to the Western Europe cash-generating unit with effect from 1 January 2017.

The key assumptions for the recoverable amounts of all units are the budgeted volumes, operating margins and long-term growth rates, which directly impact the cash flows, and the discount rates used in the calculation.
The long-term growth rate used is purely for the impairment testing of goodwill under IAS 36 and does not reflect long-term planning assumptions used by the Group for investment proposals or for any other assessments.
Pre-tax discount rates of between 6.6% and 19.2% 2016: 7.2% and 20.0% were used, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the cost of capital and borrowings, to which specific market-related premium adjustments are made.
These adjustments are derived from external sources and are based on the spread between bonds or credit default swaps, or similar indicators issued by the US or comparable governments and by the local government, adjusted for the Groups own credit market risk.
For ease of use and consistency in application, these results are periodically calibrated into bands based on internationally recognised credit ratings.
The long-term growth rates and discount rates have been applied to the budgeted cash flows of each cash-generating unit.
These cash flows have been determined by local management based on experience, specific market and brand trends, pricing expectations and costs, and have been endorsed by Group management as part of the consolidated Group budget.
The value-in-use calculations use cash flows based on detailed financial budgets prepared by management covering a one-year period extrapolated over a 10-year horizon with growth of 5% in year two.
Cash flows for years three to 10 are extrapolated from year two cash flows for each relevant operating unit at 4% 2016: 4% per annum, including 1% inflation 2016: 1% inflation, where after a total growth rate of 2% 2016: 2% has been assumed.
A 10-year horizon is considered appropriate based on the Groups history of profit and cash growth, its well balanced portfolio of brands and the industry in which it operates.
In some instances, such as recent acquisitions, start-up ventures or in other specific cases, the valuation is expanded to reflect the medium-term plan of the country or market management, spanning five years or beyond.
If discounted cash flows for cash-generating units should fall by 10%, or the discount rate was increased at a post-tax rate of 1%, there would be no impairment.
