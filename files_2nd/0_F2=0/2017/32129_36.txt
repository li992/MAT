139 111 Financial Statements Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Accounts continued Notes to the Accounts continued 2 Earnings per ordinary share Basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share are calculated using the weighted average of 378,685,730 shares in issue during the year net of shares purchased by the Company and held as Own shares 2016: 378,412,359.
There are no dilutive or potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
Adjusted earnings are calculated as earnings from continuing operations excluding the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets: acquisition items: restructuring costs: profit or loss on disposal of operations: and the associated taxation thereon.
The Directors consider that adjusted earnings, which constitute a non-GAAP measure, represent a more consistent measure of underlying performance.
A reconciliation of earnings and the effect on basic and diluted earnings per share figures is as follows: Per ordinary share 52 weeks to 53 weeks to 52 weeks to 53 weeks to 1 April 2 April 1 April 2 April 2017 2016 2017 2016 000 000 pence pence Earnings from continuing operations 129,689 108,841 34.25 28.76 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets after tax 21,452 16,102 5.66 4.26 Impairment of acquired intangible assets after tax 9,322 2.46 Acquisition transaction costs after tax 240 2,941 0.06 0.78 Release of fair value adjustments to inventory after tax 569 998 0.15 0.26 Adjustments to contingent consideration after tax 10,650 1,315 2.81 0.35 Disposal of operations and restructuring after tax 1,648 556 0.44 0.15 Adjusted earnings 152,270 129,641 40.21 34.26 3 Non-GAAP measures The Board uses certain non-GAAP measures to help it effectively monitor the performance of the Group.

3 Includes goodwill amortised prior to 3 April 2004 and goodwill taken to reserves.
Comparatives have been restated as described in note 24.
Organic growth Organic growth measures the change in revenue and profit from continuing Group operations.
This measure equalises the effect of acquisitions by: i. removing from the year of acquisition their entire revenue and profit before taxation, and ii.
in the following year, removing the revenue and profit for the number of months equivalent to the pre-acquisition period in the prior year.
The resultant effect is that the acquisitions are removed from organic results for one full year of ownership.
The results of disposals are removed from the prior period reported revenue and profit before taxation.
The effects of currency changes are removed through restating the current year revenue and profit before taxation at the prior year exchange rates.
Organic growth at constant currency has been calculated for the Group as follows: Adjusted profit Group Revenue before taxation 52 weeks 53 weeks 52 weeks 53 weeks to 1 April to 2 April to 1 April to 2 April 2017 2016 2017 2016 000 000 % growth 000 000 % growth Continuing operations 961,662 807,805 194,004 166,014 Acquired and disposed revenue profit 40,303 4,544 Organic growth 921,359 807,805 14.1% 189,460 14.1% 166,014 Constant currency adjustment 78,982 17,427 Organic growth at constant currency 842,377 807,805 4.3% 172,033 166,014 3.6% 141 113 Financial Statements Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Accounts continued Notes to the Accounts continued 3 Non-GAAP measures continued Sector Organic growth at constant currency Organic growth at constant currency is calculated for each segment using the same method as described above.

The Groups future Effective Tax Rate ETR will mainly depend on the geographic mix of profits and whether there are any changes to tax legislation in the Groups most significant countries of operations.
Phased reductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 2020 have been substantively enacted which we would expect to impact the ETR in due course.
In the US, proposed tax reform measures include a reduction in the US corporate income tax rate from 35% to as low as 15%.
The US rate change is a proposal only at this stage and the Group is actively monitoring developments to evaluate its potential impact.
No reliable estimate of the impact of these tax reform proposals can be made at this time.
The Group does not expect the future rate to be materially impacted by the changes to the international tax landscape resulting from the package of measures developed under the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project and the investigations and proposals of the European Commission.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Before recognition of any impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to CGU groups as follows: Restated 1 April 2 April 2017 2016 000 000 Process Safety Gas Detection Bursting Discs 9,251 8,157 Safety Interlocks and Corrosion Monitoring 60,975 54,147 70,226 62,304 Infrastructure Safety Fire 53,664 48,919 Doors, Security and Elevators 71,859 67,609 125,523 116,528 Medical Health Optics 172,923 157,358 Fluid Technology 41,333 37,368 Sensor Technologies 73,857 65,118 288,113 259,844 Environmental & Analysis Water 30,405 28,757 Photonics 74,430 61,565 Environmental Monitoring 14,856 13,099 119,691 103,421 Total Group 603,553 542,097 Comparatives have been restated, as required by IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations, for material changes arising on the provisional accounting for prior period acquisitions.
Goodwill values have been tested for impairment by comparing them against the value in use in perpetuity of the relevant CGU group.
The value in use calculations were based on projected cash flows, derived from the latest budget approved by the Board, discounted at CGU specific, risk adjusted, discount rates to calculate their net present value.
149 121 Financial Statements Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Accounts continued Notes to the Accounts continued 11 Goodwill continued Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following assumptions: CGU specific operating assumptions that are reflected in the budget period for the financial year to March 2018: Discount rates: and Growth rates used to extrapolate risk adjusted cash flows beyond the budget period.
CGU specific operating assumptions are applicable to the budgeted cash flows for the year to March 2018 and relate to revenue forecasts, expected project outcomes and forecast operating margins in each of the operating companies.
The relative value ascribed to each assumption will vary between CGUs as the budgets are built up from the underlying operating companies within each CGU group.
A short-term growth rate is applied to the March 2018 budget to derive the cash flows arising in the years to March 2019 and March 2020.
A long-term rate is applied to these values for the year to March 2021 and onwards.
Short-term growth rates for years 2019 and 2020 for all CGU groups, with the exception of Sensor Technologies, are based on sector strategic plans.
Long-term growth rates are capped at the weighted average GDP growth rates of the markets that the Group sells into.
Short-term growth rates for Sensor Technologies are applied out to 2022, based on CGU specific revenue growth rates and margins which reflect the acquisition case updated for latest expectations of performance.
These CGU specific growth rates reflect the rapid growth potential of this early stage life-cycle, technology-based business through further penetration into the USA, internationally and, in the longer term, through new applications in other sectors.
Long-term growth rates thereafter are capped at the weighted average GDP growth rates of the markets that the Group sells into.
Discount rates are based on estimations of the assumptions that market participants operating in similar sectors to Halma would make, using the Groups economic profile as a starting point and adjusting appropriately.
The Directors do not currently expect any significant change in the present base discount rate of 9.04% 2016: 10.79%.
The base discount rate, which is pre-tax and is based on short-term variables, may differ from the Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC.
Discount rates are adjusted for economic risks that are not already captured in the specific operating assumptions for each CGU group.
This results in the impairment testing using discount rates ranging from 8.75% to 12.50% 2016: 9.86% to 14.00% across the CGU groups.
CGU groups to which 10% or more of the total goodwill balance is allocated are deemed to be significant.
The assumptions used to determine value in use for these CGU groups are: Risk adjusted Short-term Long-term discount rate growth rates growth rates 1 April 2 April 1 April 2 April 1 April 2 April Significant CGU groups 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 Safety Interlocks and Corrosion Monitoring 11.15% 12.29% 8.23% 8.25% 2.60% 2.33% Doors, Security and Elevators 11.08% 12.95% 6.93% 7.32% 1.98% 1.92% Health Optics 12.50% 14.00% 5.15% 7.00% 2.14% 2.06% Sensor Technologies 12.46% 12.93% 20.00% 13.70% 2.00% 2.31% Photonics 9.67% 11.26% 19.29% 14.57% 1.85% 1.86% Sensitivity to changes in assumptions In Sensor Technologies, if future growth was not as currently forecast this could result in the value in use of goodwill falling below its carrying value.
For this to happen, forecast revenue growth to 2022 would have to fall to 6% and to 2% thereafter.
For all other CGU groups, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any unit to exceed its recoverable amount.

155 127 Financial Statements Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Accounts continued Notes to the Accounts continued 16 Trade and other receivables continued The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows: 1 April 2 April 2017 2016 000 000 At beginning of the year 4,238 2,802 Net impairment loss recognised 1,045 1,494 Amounts recovered against trade receivables previously written down 371 828 649 Recognition of provisions for businesses acquired 46 Exchange adjustments 233 121 At end of the year 5,099 4,238 Impairment charges are recorded against the trade receivables which the Group believes may not be recoverable.
In the case of trade receivables that are past due, management makes an assessment of the risk of non-collection, taking into account factors such as previous default experience, any disputes or other factors delaying payment and the risk of bankruptcy or other failure of the customer to meet their obligations.
For trade receivables that are not past due, taking into account good historical collection experience, management records an impairment charge only where there is a specific risk of non-collection.
The fair value of trade and other receivables approximates to book value due to the short-term maturities associated with these items.
There is no impairment risk identified with regards to prepayments and accrued income or other receivables where no amounts are past due.

157 129 Financial Statements Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Accounts continued Notes to the Accounts continued 19 Provisions continued Contingent purchase consideration The provision at the beginning of the year comprised 84,000 falling due within one year relating to the previous acquisition of ASL and 16,991,000 falling due after one year, mainly relating to the acquisition of Visiometrics.
The 9,407,000 addition arising on acquisition relates to the acquisition of FluxData Inc. during the year.
The amount utilised during the year relates mainly to amounts owed by the Visiometrics vendors on agreement of the closing net tangible asset adjustment at acquisition totalling 272,000 which was recorded against the deferred contingent consideration payable as the balance is to be settled net.
70,000 was also paid as final settlement of the payable due for ASL.
The 10,457,000 release of provision relates to revisions to the estimates of the earn outs for Visiometrics, VAS and ASL by 10,087,000, 356,000 and 14,000 respectively.
The Visiometrics earn out comprises a Royalty and Core element.
The Royalty element which is payable based on gross margin on sales to one particular customer has been revised downwards to nil as at the year end as a result of a change of strategic focus by that customer.
The associated customer relationship intangible was also impaired in full as discussed in note 12.
The Core element which is payable on a multiple of EBITDA for each calendar year to December 2018 has been revised downwards based on current estimates of future trading.
2,700,000 of the 9,000,000 6,558,000 payment made into escrow on acquisition was released to the vendors during the year following the company successfully meeting the 2,000,000 EBITDA Reserve Goal at the end of December 2016.
The balance is to be released to the vendors subject to collection of all related outstanding debtors no later than 30 June 2017.
Of the closing total provision of 16,444,000, 427,000 payable for the acquisition of VAS was settled in April 2017: 287,000 336,000 was paid, representing the first year Royalty earn out for Visiometrics on sales made prior to the change in focus by the customer, offset by the 272,000 net tangible asset receivable: and 321,000 was settled in May 2017 for the first FluxData earn out covering the three month period to March 2017.
As discussed above, there is nothing further expected to be paid under the Royalty element of the Visiometrics earn out.
The balance due after more than one year comprises 4,703,000 payable for the year to March 2018 for the acquisition of FluxData and 10,693,000 payable for the year to March 2019 for FluxData and for the core earn out element of Visiometrics.
Dilapidations and empty property Dilapidations and empty property provisions exist where the Group has lease contracts under which the unavoidable costs of meeting its obligations under the contracts exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under them.
The provisions comprise the Directors best estimates of future payments: a to restore the fabric of buildings to their original condition where it is a condition of the leases prior to return of the properties: and b on vacant properties, the rental costs of which are not expected to be recoverable from subleasing the properties.
These commitments cover the period from 2017 to 2028 though they predominantly fall due within five years.
Product warranty Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business and included within the Group companies standard terms and conditions.
Warranty commitments cover a period of between one and five years and typically apply for a 12-month period.
The provision represents the Directors best estimate of the Groups liability based on past experience.
Legal, contractual and other Legal, contractual and other provisions comprise mainly amounts reserved against open legal and contractual disputes.
The Company has on occasion been required to take legal or other actions to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties.
Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent Directors best estimate of the likely outcome.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is frequently uncertain reflecting the complexity of issues and the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations.
Contractual and other provisions represent the Directors best estimate of the cost of settling future obligations.
Unless specific evidence exists to the contrary, these reserves are shown as current.
However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties against Group companies unless the Directors, taking into account professional advice received, assess that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful.

Phased reductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and 17% effective from 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted in the UK Finance No.

It is likely that the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries would qualify for the UK dividend exemption such that no UK tax would be due upon remitting those earnings to the UK.
However, 35,788,000 2016: 29,155,000 of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of the dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
These tax liabilities are not expected to exceed 3,595,000 2016: 3,192,000 of which only 801,000 has been provided as the Group is able to control the timing of the dividends.
It is not expected that further amounts will crystallise in the foreseeable future.
Temporary timing differences in connection with the interest in associate are insignificant.

24 Acquisitions In accounting for acquisitions, adjustments are made to the book values of the net assets of the companies acquired to reflect their fair values to the Group.
Acquired inventories are valued at fair value adopting Group bases and any liabilities for warranties relating to past trading are recognised.
Other previously unrecognised assets and liabilities at acquisition are included and accounting policies are aligned with those of the Group where appropriate.
Below are summaries of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the purchase consideration of: a the total of FluxData Inc. and adjustments to prior year acquisitions: b FluxData Inc. on a stand-alone basis: c the adjustments to prior year acquisitions, on a stand-alone basis: and d the total of FluxData Inc. and adjustments to prior year acquisitions, allocated between restated and not restated.
Due to their contractual dates, the fair value of receivables acquired shown below approximate to the gross contractual amounts receivable.
The amount of gross contractual receivables not expected to be recovered is immaterial.
There are no material contingent liabilities recognised in accordance with paragraph 23 of IFRS 3 revised.
The combined fair value adjustments made for the acquisition of FluxData and for prior year acquisitions within the goodwill measurement window under IFRS 3, excluding acquired intangible assets recognised and deferred tax thereon, resulted in net adjustments to goodwill of negative 541,000.
As at the date of approval of the financial statements, the acquisition accounting for all prior year acquisitions is complete.
The accounting for FluxData is provisional: relating to finalisation of the valuation of acquired intangibles and the initial consideration, which is subject to agreement of the net tangible asset adjustment.

The Group acquired the entire share capital of FluxData Inc. on 6 January 2017 for an initial cash consideration of US$12,000,000 9,878,000.
The maximum contingent consideration payable is US$15,500,000 12,759,000.
The current provision of US$11,428,000 9,407,000 represents the fair value of the estimated payable based on performance to date and the expectation of future cash flows.
The earn out is payable on gross margin in excess of a target threshold for the period ending March 2017 and then annually until March 2019.
FluxData designs and manufactures advanced multispectral and digital imaging systems across multiple sectors including industrial and medical applications.
Based in New York State, USA, it has become part of the Environmental & Analysis sector, building on the existing multispectral imaging capabilities within those companies.
Existing management will remain in place.
The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the assets acquired is represented by customer related intangibles of 7,240,000: and technology related intangibles of 6,250,000: with residual goodwill arising of 4,942,000.
The goodwill represents: a the technical expertise of the acquired workforce: b the ability to exploit the Groups existing customer base: and c the opportunity to leverage the technical expertise across Halmas businesses and through new products.
The FluxData acquisition contributed 1,017,000 of revenue and 213,000 of profit after tax for the year ended 1 April 2017.
If this acquisition had been held since the start of the financial year, it is estimated that the Groups reported revenue and profit after tax would have been 3,518,000 and 928,000 higher respectively.
Acquisition costs totalling 264,000 were recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement.
17,798,000 of goodwill arising on the FluxData acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

The provisional accounting was updated for the external valuation of the acquired intangibles of CenTrak which was incomplete at the prior year end, for changes to certain provisions and inventory valuations across all three acquisitions, and for adjustments to the related deferred tax balances.
The initial consideration for CenTrak was also adjusted following the finalisation of the working capital adjustment payable.
The combined adjustments made for each acquisition resulted in a net adjustment to goodwill of 1,803,000.
The net increase of 3,851,000 in intangible assets arising on the acquisition of CenTrak included a decrease in the technology asset by 7,198,000 and an increase in the customer relationship asset and trademark asset by 4,851,000 and 6,198,000 respectively.
All adjustments to the provisional accounting were made within the goodwill measurement period, relevant to each acquisition, as defined by IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations.
As required by IFRS 3, comparatives have been restated to reflect the changes to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for CenTrak, which, totalling a net adjustment to goodwill of negative 2,134,000, are considered material, as if theyd occurred at the date of acquisition.
The comparatives have not been restated for the non-material changes to Firetrace and Visiometrics, totalling a net adjustment to goodwill of 331,000.
The table overleaf sets out the total assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising on current acquisitions and adjustments to prior year acquisitions split between those which have been treated as current year adjustments and those as prior year for which comparatives have been restated.

26 Financial instruments Policy The Groups treasury policies seek to minimise financial risks and to ensure sufficient liquidity for the Groups operations and strategic plans.
No complex derivative financial instruments are used, and no trading or speculative transactions in financial instruments are undertaken.
Where the Group does use financial instruments these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal operations and its financing.
Operations are financed mainly through retained profits and, in certain geographic locations, bank borrowings.
Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group in the area of financial instruments.
It is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these policies are summarised below.
The Groups policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the financial year.
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the bases of recognition of income and expenses for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in the Accounting Policies note.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 18 to the Accounts, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
168 140 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 26 Financial instruments continued Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk as a consequence of both trading with foreign companies and owning subsidiaries located in foreign countries.
The Group earns a significant proportion of its profit in currencies other than Sterling.
This gives rise to translational currency risk, where the Sterling value of profits earned by the Groups foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with the strength of Sterling relative to their operating or functional currencies.
The Group does not hedge this risk, so its reported profit is sensitive to the strength of Sterling, particularly against the US Dollar and Euro.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures.
These arise on sales or purchases by operating companies in currencies other than the companies operating or functional currency.
Significant sales and purchases are matched where possible and a proportion of the net exposure is hedged by means of forward foreign currency contracts.
The Group has significant investments in overseas operations in the USA and EU, with further investments in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, China and India.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
Where significant and appropriate, currency denominated net assets are hedged by currency borrowings.
These currency exposures are reviewed regularly.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and cash deposits.
Where bank borrowings are used to finance operations they tend to be short term with floating interest rates.
Longer-term funding is provided by the Groups bank loan facilities which are at floating rates, or by the Groups fixed rate United States Private Placement completed in November 2015.
Surplus funds are placed on short-term fixed rate deposit or in floating rate deposit accounts.
Credit risk Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
Credit ratings are supplied by independent agencies where available, and if not available, the Group uses other publicly available financial information and its own trading records to rate its major customers.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed regularly.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographic areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The carrying amount of trade, tax and other receivables, derivative financial instruments and cash of 261,486,000 2016 restated : 223,362,000 represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other credit enhancements are held.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
Comparatives have been restated, as required by IFRS revised Business Combinations, for material changes arising on the provisional accounting for prior period acquisitions.
Liquidity risk The Group has a syndicated multi-currency revolving credit facility RCF which was refinanced on 4 November 2016 and increased from 360,000,000 to 550,000,000.
The facility, in Sterling, US Dollar, Euro, and Swiss Franc, runs to October 2021 with the potential for a further two years extension with the agreement of the syndicate of banks.
In addition, in November 2015 the Group completed a United States Private Placement and issued US$250,000,000 of loan notes in January 2016, repayable at five, seven and ten year intervals.
These facilities are the main sources of longterm funding for the Group.
The Group has a strong cash flow and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally based on geographic location.
Funds are placed on deposit with secure, highly-rated banks.
For short-term working capital purposes, most operating companies utilise local bank overdrafts.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
Because of the nature of their use, the facilities are typically on demand and as such uncommitted.
Overdraft facilities are typically renewed annually.
169 141 Financial Statements Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Accounts continued Notes to the Accounts continued 26 Financial instruments continued Currency exposures Translational exposures It is estimated, by reference to the Groups US Dollar and Euro denominated profits, that a one per cent change in the value of the US Dollar relative to Sterling would have had a 823,000 2016: 673,000 impact on the Groups reported profit before tax: and a one per cent change in the value of the Euro relative to Sterling would have had a 286,000 2016: 196,000 impact on the Groups profit before tax for the year ended 1 April 2017.
Transactional exposures The Group has net foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that are assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the underlying company.
These comprise cash and overdrafts as well as certain trade receivable and payable balances.
These foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as a result of movement in exchange rates.
The exposures are predominantly US Dollar and Euro.
Group policy is for a significant portion of foreign currency exposures, including sales and purchases, to be hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts in the company in which the transaction is recorded.
Interest rate risk profile The Groups financial assets which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise interest bearing cash equivalents which totalled 2,974,000 at 1 April 2017 2016: 3,318,000.
These comprised Sterling denominated deposits of 187,000 2016: 115,000, and Euro, US Dollar and Renminbi deposits of 2,787,000 2016: 3,203,000 which are placed on local money markets and earn interest at market rates.
Cash balances of 63,853,000 2016: 50,620,000 earn interest at local market rates.
The financial liabilities which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise bank loans, bank overdrafts, and certain unsecured loans, which totalled 81,951,000 at 1 April 2017 2016: 128,208,000.
All bank loans bear interest at floating rates where the fixed period is typically no more than three months.
Interest rates are based on the LIBOR of the currency in which the liabilities arise plus a small margin.
Bank overdrafts bear interest at local base rates.
The loan notes related to the acquisition of Advanced Electronics Limited outstanding at 1 April 2017 attract interest at a fixed rate of 1%.
The loan notes related to the United States Private Placement attract interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 2.5%.

171 143 Financial Statements Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Accounts continued Notes to the Accounts continued 26 Financial instruments continued Borrowing facilities The Groups principal sources of long-term funding are its unsecured five-year 550,000,000 revolving credit facility.
The revolving credit facility was refinanced in November 2016 and runs to October 2021 with the potential for a further two years extension with the agreement of the syndicate of banks.
A United States Private Placement of US$250,000,000 completed in November 2015.
The unsecured loan notes under the United States Private Placement were drawn on 6 January 2016 as 82,000,000, 56,000,000 and US$64,000,000 at a weighted average fixed interest rate of 2.5%.
The loan notes mature at five, seven and ten year intervals.
Interest is payable half yearly.
The Group has additional short-term unsecured and committed US bank facilities of 19,968,000, which mature in November 2018 and were undrawn at 1 April 2017.
Other short-term operational funding is provided by cash generated from operations and by local bank overdrafts.
These overdraft facilities are uncommitted and are generally renewed on an annual or ongoing basis and hence the facilities expire within one year or less.
The Groups undrawn committed facilities available at 1 April 2017 were 469,239,000 2016: 253,810,000 of which nil 2016: nil matures within one year and 469,239,000 2016: 253,810,000 between two and five years.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities As at 1 April 2017, with the exception of the Groups fixed rate loan notes, there were no significant differences between the book value and fair value as determined by market value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
As at 2 April 2016, there were no significant differences.
The fair value of floating borrowings approximates to the carrying value because interest rates are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
The fair value of the Groups fixed rate loan notes arising from the United States Private Placement completed in January 2016 is estimated to be 182,936,000.
The fair value is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow using readily available market data and represents a level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using readily available market data, and represents a level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.
The fair value of deferred contingent consideration arising on acquisitions is estimated by discounting the possible future cash flows using probability adjusted forecasts for the acquired company, and represents a level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.
The fair value is sensitive to the weighting assigned to the expected future cash flows.
A change in weighting of 10 percentage points towards the higher expectations would result in an increase in the undiscounted estimate of future cash flows of 1,110,000 for Visiometrics S. L. Attributing more weighting to a downside expectation would result in a decrease in the estimate of future cash flows of US$1,628,000 for FluxData Inc.
Hedging As explained previously, the Groups policy is to hedge significant sales and purchases denominated in foreign currency using forward currency contracts.
These instruments are initially recognised at fair value, which is typically nil, and subsequent changes in fair value are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement, unless hedge accounted.
The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts outstanding as at the year end, which mostly mature within one year and therefore the cash flows and resulting effect on profit and loss are expected to occur within the next 12 months: 172 144 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 26 Financial instruments continued Hedging continued Average exchange rate Foreign currency Contract value Fair value 1 April 2 April 1 April 2 April 1 April 2 April 1 April 2 April 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 000 000 000 000 000 000 Forward contracts not in a designated cash flow hedge US Dollars 1.24 1.43 600 3,100 484 2,169 4 15 Euros 1.17 1.29 3,040 2,608 10 11 450 349 Other currencies 13,413 4,877 123 4 16,505 7,395 129 30 Forward contracts in a designated cash flow hedge US Dollars 1.26 1.50 11,869 7,665 9,433 5,126 20 202 Euros 1.14 1.33 25,244 18,213 22,078 13,714 424 790 Other currencies 420 3,069 8 43 31,931 21,909 412 1,035 Total forward contracts US Dollars 1.26 1.48 12,469 10,765 9,917 7,295 16 217 Euros 1.15 1.33 28,284 18,663 24,686 14,063 414 801 Other currencies 13,833 7,946 115 47 48,436 29,304 283 1,065 Amounts recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement 177 328 Amounts recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure 460 737 283 1,065 The fair values of the forward contracts are disclosed as a 598,000 2016: 1,131,000 asset and 315,000 2016: 2,196,000 liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

173 145 Financial Statements Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Accounts continued Notes to the Accounts continued 26 Financial instruments continued Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk, including: forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the export of goods to and from the USA, Mainland Europe and the UK: and foreign exchange loans to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Groups investment in foreign operations which have the Euro, US Dollar and Swiss Franc as their functional currencies.
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis as described below.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to market risks or in the manner in which these risks are managed and measured.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to the currency of the USA US Dollar and the currency of Mainland Europe Euro.
The carrying amount of the Groups US Dollar and Euro denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Assets Liabilities 1 April 2 April 1 April 2 April 2017 2016 2017 2016 000 000 000 000 US Dollar 750,301 666,035 263,247 237,877 Euro 183,415 175,148 72,956 66,820 If Sterling increased by 10% against the US Dollar and the Euro, profits before taxation and other equity would decrease as follows: US Dollar Euro 1 April 2 April 1 April 2 April 2017 2016 2017 2016 000 000 000 000 Profit 7,557 6,183 2,622 1,796 Other equity 44,278 38,923 10,042 9,848 The profit sensitivity arises mainly from the translation of overseas profits earned during the year.
10% is the sensitivity rate which management assesses to be a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups profit sensitivity has increased against the US Dollar and Euro because more of the Groups profits are earned in these currencies.

Commitments under operating leases The Group has entered into commercial leases on properties and other equipment.
The former expire between April 2017 and November 2028 and the latter between April 2017 and July 2022.
Only certain property agreements contain an option for renewal at rental prices based on market prices at the time of exercise.

The Halma Group Pension Plan and the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan both UK have defined benefit sections with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Both of these sections had already closed to new entrants in 2002 03 and closed to future benefit accruals for 2014 15.
From that date, the former defined benefit members joined the existing defined contribution section within the Halma Group Pension Plan.
Overseas subsidiaries have adopted mainly defined contribution plans, with the exception of two small defined benefit plans in the Swiss entities of Medicel AG, and Robutec AG.
A third scheme belonging to Robutec GmbH was merged into that of Robutec AG during the prior year.
Total pension costs of 9,864,000 2016: 8,213,000 recognised in employee costs note 7, comprise 9,463,000 2016: 7,901,000 related to defined contribution plans and 401,000 2016: 312,000 related to defined benefit plans.
Defined contribution plans The amount charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of defined contribution plans was 9,463,000 2016: 7,901,000 and represents contributions payable to these plans by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
The assets of the plans are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the plans prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the ancillary contributions payable by the Group may be reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.
Defined benefit plans The Groups significant defined benefit plans are for qualifying employees of its UK subsidiaries.
Under the plans, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits of up to two thirds of final pensionable salary on attainment of a retirement age of 60, for members of the Executive Board, and 65, for all other qualifying employees.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The plans are funded plans.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Halma Group Pension Plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation was carried out at 1 December 2014 by Mr. Adrian Gibbons, Fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, was measured using the projected unit credit method.
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the plan liabilities make allowance for projected earnings.
Mr. Gibbons also carried out the 1 April 2015 actuarial valuation of the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan on the same basis.
175 147 Financial Statements Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Accounts continued Notes to the Accounts continued 28 Retirement benefits continued An alternative to the projected unit credit method is a valuation on a solvency basis, often estimated using the cost of buying out benefits at the balance sheet date with a suitable insurance company.
This amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the plan liabilities at the balance sheet date rather than the Group continuing to fund the ongoing liabilities of the plan.

In conjunction with the trustees, the Group conducts asset-liability reviews for its defined benefit pension plan.
The results of these reviews are used to assist the trustees and the Group to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the structure of the liabilities of the plan.
They are also used to assist the trustees in managing the volatility in the underlying investment performance and risk of a significant increase in the defined benefit deficit by providing information used to determine the plans investment strategy.
As a consequence, the Group is progressively giving more emphasis to a closer return matching of plan assets and liabilities, both to ensure the long-term security of its defined benefit commitment and to reduce earnings and balance sheet volatility.
