Financial Statements Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 122 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies The Company Rolls-Royce Holdings plc the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2017 consist of the consolidation of the Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and include the Groups interest in jointly controlled and associated entities.
Basis of preparation and statement of compliance In accordance with European Union EU regulations, these Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, as adopted for use in the EU effective at 31 December 2017 Adopted IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its individual Company Financial Statements under FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.
They are set out on pages 172 to 174 and the accounting policies in respect of Company Financial Statements are set out on page 173.
These Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except where Adopted IFRS requires the revaluation of financial instruments to fair value and certain other assets and liabilities on an alternative basis most significantly post-retirement scheme obligations are valued on the basis required by IAS 19 Employee Benefits and on a going concern basis as described on page 63.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling which is the Companys functional currency.
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with Adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Key areas of judgement Introduction The Group generates a significant portion of its revenue and profit on aftermarket arrangements arising from the installed original equipment OE fleet.
As a consequence, the Group will often agree contractual prices for OE deliveries that take into account the anticipated aftermarket arrangements.
Accounting policies reflect this aspect of the business model, in particular thepolicies for the recognition of contractual aftermarket rights and the linkage of OE and actual aftermarket arrangements.
When a civil large engine is sold, the economic benefits received usually far exceed the cash receivable under the contract, due to the rightsto valuable aftermarket spare parts business.
However, because the value of this right cannot be estimated with enough precision, accounting standards require that the revenue recognised in the accounts on sale of the engine is restricted to a total amount that results in a break even position.
The amount of the revenue recognised in excess of cash receivable is recognised as an intangible asset, which is called a contractual aftermarket right CAR.
There is only one circumstance where accounting standards require the recognition of more of the value of the aftermarket rights whenanengine is sold.
This occurs where a long-term aftermarket contract generally a TotalCare agreement TCA and an engine salecontract have been negotiated together.
In this circumstance, the part of the aftermarket rights covered by the TCA can be valued much more precisely and is recognised at the time of the engine sale through accounting for the engine sale and TCA as a single contract.
Nevertheless, the accounting profit recognised is still less than the economic benefits on the sale as there will be other valuable aftermarket rights for instance for the period beyond the TCA term or for the sale of parts which are outside the scope of the TCA whichcannot be recognised.
The Group enters into arrangements with long-term suppliers to share the risks and rewards of major programmes risk and revenue sharing arrangements RRSAs.
The accounting policy for these arrangements has been chosen, consistent with Adopted IFRS, to reflect their commercial effect.
The key judgements in determining these accounting policies are described below.
Contractual aftermarket rights On delivery of Civil Aerospace engines, the Group has contractual rights to supply aftermarket parts to the customers and its intellectual rights, warranty arrangements and, where relevant, statutory airworthiness or other regulatory requirements provide reasonable control over this supply.
The Directors consider that these rights meet the definition of an intangible asset in IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
However, the Directors do not consider that it is possible to determine a reliable fair value for this intangible asset.
Accordingly, an intangible asset CAR is only recognised on the occasions where the contractual price of the engine is below the cost of manufacture and then only to the extent of this deficit, as this amount is reliably measurable.
An equal amount of revenue is recognised at the same point.
Where a long-term aftermarket contract is linked to the OE contract see page 123, the contractual price of the engine including amounts allocated from the aftermarket contract is above its cost of manufacture: consequently no CAR is recognised.
Measure of performance on long-term aftermarket contracts A large proportion of the Groups activities relate to long-term aftermarket contracts, in particular TotalCare and similar arrangements in Civil Aerospace.
Under these contracts, the Groups primary obligation is to maintain customers equipment in an operational condition and it achieves this by undertaking various activities, such as engine monitoring, line maintenance and repair and overhaul, over the FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial Statements Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 123 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies continued period of the contract.
In general, the Directors consider that the stage of performance of the contract should be by reference to the obligation to maintain an operational fleet and that this is best measured by the operation of the fleet.
Accordingly, stage of performance is measured by reference to flying hours of each fleet under contract.
Consistent with the above, the Directors also consider that, in general, all costs incurred to meet the primary obligation should be included in the accounting for these contracts, even if these costs had not been originally anticipated.
This includes the additional costs being incurred to address the Trent 1000 and Trent 900 in-service issues.
In contrast, provision is made when additional costs on non long-term contract arrangements are identified.
Linkage of OE and long-term aftermarket contracts Where the key terms of a long-term aftermarket contract are substantively agreed e. g. in a term sheet at the same time as an OE contract with the operator, the Directors consider these to be linked for accounting purposes and they are treated as a single contract, as this best reflects the overall commercial effect.
Where the OE contract is not with the operator e. g. where it is with an OE manufacturer or a lessor the contracts are not linked as they were not negotiated on a unified basis.
Sales of spare engines to joint ventures Whether the sales price reflects fair value when the Group sells spare engines to a joint venture company.
Risk and revenue sharing arrangements RRSAs with key suppliers workshare partners are a feature of our Civil Aerospace business.
Under these contractual arrangements, the key commercial objectives are that: i during the development phase the workshare partner shares in the risks of developing an engine by performing its own development work, providing development parts and paying a non-refundable cash entry fee: and ii during the production phase it supplies components in return for a share of the programme revenue as a life of type supplier i. e. as long as the engine remains in service.
The share of development costs borne by the workshare partner and of the revenue it receives reflect the partners proportionate cost of providing its production parts compared to the overall manufacturing cost of the engine.
The share is based on a jointly-agreed forecast at the commencement of the arrangement.
These arrangements are complex and have features that could be indicative of: a collaboration agreement, including sharing of risk and cost in a development programme: a long-term supply agreement: sharing of intellectual property: or a combination of these.
In summary, and as described below, the Directors view is that the development and production phases of the contract should be considered separately in accounting for the RRSA, which results in the entry fee being matched against the non-recurring costs incurred by the Group.
Having considered the features above, the Directors consider that there is no directly applicable IFRS to determine an accounting policy for the recognition of entry fees of this nature in the income statement.
Consequently, in developing an accounting treatment for such entry fees that best reflects the commercial objectives of the contractual arrangement, the Directors have analysed these features in the context of relevant accounting pronouncements including those of other standard setters where these do not conflict with IFRS and have weighed the importance of each feature in faithfully representing the overall commercial effect.
The most important considerations that need to be balanced are: the transfer of development risk: the workshare partner receiving little standalone value from the payment of the entry fee: and the overall effect being collaboration between the parties which falls short of being a joint venture as the Group controls the programme.
Also important in the analysis is the fact that, whilst the Group and the workshare partner share risks and rewards through the life of the contract, these risks and rewards are very different during the development and production phases.
In this context, the entry fee might be considered to represent: an amount paid as an equalisation of development costs: a payment to secure a long-term supply arrangement: a purchase of intellectual property: or some combination thereof.
The accounting under these different scenarios could include: recognition of the entry fee to match the associated costs in the income statement: being spread over the life of the programme as a reduction in the cost of supply during production: or being spread over the time period of the access to the intellectual property by the workshare partner.
The Directors consider that the most important features of the arrangement are the risk sharing and that the entry fee represents a contribution to the development costs that the Group incurs in excess of its proportionate programme share.
The key judgements taken in reaching this view are: the entry fee is determined by the parties on that basis and the contract specifies that, in the event that a derivative engine is to be developed, additional entry fees will also be calculated on this basis: the workshare partners describe the entry fee in this way: although the workshare partner receives little stand-alone value from paying the entry fee, the entry fee together with its own development activities represent its aggregate investment in the collaboration: the amount of the entry fee does not include any amount in excess of that necessary to equalise forecast development costs: the Group is not on risk for the full development costs it incurs but for that amount less the entry fees received.
The resulting accounting policy described on page 126 represents the commercial effect of the contractual arrangements in that the Group recognises only those development costs to which it is exposed and thus reflects the significant transfer of development risk to the workshare partner and the costs of supply of parts during the production phase is measured at the workshare partners share of programme revenue which we consider to be a commercial fair value.
The Directors do not consider that accounting which would result in entry fees only being recognised in the production phase would appropriately reflect the sharing of development risk.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that the policy adopted best reflects the commercial objectives of the arrangements, the nature of the relationship with the workshare partner and is in accordance with Adopted IFRS.
Financial Statements Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 124 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies continued As described in the 2013 Annual Report, an alternative view is that the RRSA contract cannot be divided into separate development and production phases, as the fees and development components received by the Group during the development phase are exchanged for the obligation to pay the supplier a predetermined share of any sales receipts during the production phase.
On this basis, the entry fees received would be deferred in their entirety and recognised over the period of production.
The size of the difference between the two approaches is monitored and is not currently expected to become material in the foreseeable future.
The impact of the different approaches on profit before tax and net assets, which is not considered to be material, is as follows: 2017 2016 Reported Underlying profit Reported Underlying profit profit before tax before tax Net assets profit before tax before tax Net assets m m m m m m Adopted policy 4,897 1,071 6,170 4,636 813 1,864 Difference 23 23 423 2 2 442 1 Alternative policy 4,920 1,094 5,747 4,638 811 1,422 1 If the alternative policy were adopted, the difference would be included in operating profit, which would change from 1,287m as reported to 1,310m 2016: 44m to 42m.
As part of our assessment of accounting policies under IFRS 15 see page 131, we have concluded that the way we account for the entry fees received from RRSAs should be aligned with how we account for participation fees we pay to airframers which will change on adoption of IFRS 15.
This will result in an accounting policy similar to the alternative view set out above.
Internally-generated development costs IAS 38 requires that internally generated development costs should only be capitalised if strict criteria are met, in particular relating to technical feasibility and generation of future economic benefits.
The Group incurs significant research and development expenditure in respect of various development programmes, most notably in Civil Aerospace.
Determining when capitalisation should commence and cease is a critical judgement as is the determination of when subsequent expenditure on the programme assets should be capitalised.
Within the Group there is an established Product Introduction and Lifecycle Management process PILM process in place.
This is a gated process which assesses both the technical feasibility and commercial viability of programmes.
A multi-functional team is involved in the assessment ensuring the technical and operational aspects of the programme have been assessed together with the financial assessment.
Until the programme has obtained sign off on the criteria set out under Research and development costs on page 128, all expenditure is expensed as incurred.
Subsequent expenditure which enhances the performance of the engine and the economic benefits to the Group is capitalised.
This expenditure is referred to as enhanced performance and is governed by the PILM process referred to above.
Expenditure on sustaining engineering is expensed as incurred.
Following a review of progress on Civil Aerospace programmes during 2017, the point at which the relevant criteria are met has been moved one gate earlier than in the past.
This has resulted in an additional 83m of development costs being capitalised than otherwise would have been.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty In applying the accounting policies, estimates are made in many areas: the actual outcome may differ from that calculated.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are set out below.
The estimation of the relevant assets and liabilities involves the combination ofanumber of assumptions.
Sensitivities are disclosed in the relevant notes where this is appropriate and practicable.
Forecasts and discount rates The carrying values of a number of items on the balance sheet are dependent on the estimates of future cash flows arising from the Groups operations, in particular: The assessment of whether the goodwill carrying value at 31 December 2017: 1,545m, 31 December 2016:1,537m, arising on the consolidation of acquired businesses, is impaired is dependent on the present value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the business.
Sensitivities to impairment risk on Marine goodwill are shown in note 9.
The assessment as to whether there are any indications of impairment of development, participation, certification, customer relationships andcontractual aftermarket rights recognised as intangible assets carrying values at 31 December 2017: 4,687m, 31 December 2016: 2,846m is dependent on estimates of cash flows generated by the relevant assets and the discount rate used to calculate a present value.
These estimates include the performance of long-term contractual arrangements as described below, as well as estimates for future market share, pricing and unit cost for uncontracted business.
The risk of impairment is generally higher for newer programmes and for customer-specific intangible assets CARs for launch customers and typically reduces as programmes become more established.
Assessment of long-term contractual arrangements The Group has long-term contracts that fall into different accounting periods and which can extend over significant periods the most significant of these are long-term service arrangements in the Civil Aerospace business.
The estimated revenue and costs are inherently imprecise and significant estimates are required to assess: engine flying hours, time on wing and other operating parameters: the pattern of future maintenance activity including the in-service fleet issues and the costs to be incurred: lifecycle cost improvements over the FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial Statements Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 125 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies continued term of the contracts and escalation of revenue and costs.
The estimates take account of the inherent uncertainties and the risk of non-recovery of any resulting contract balances.
In addition, many of the revenues and costs are denominated in currencies other than that of the relevant Group undertaking.
These are translated at an estimated long-term exchange rate, based on historical trends.
In 2016, the US dollar long-term exchange rate was reduced by five cents, resulting in a one-off benefit to profit before tax of 35m.
Post-retirement benefits The Groups defined benefit pension schemes and similar arrangements are assessed annually in accordance with IAS 19.
The accounting valuation, which is based on assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice, resulted in a net surplus of 738m before deferred taxation being recognised on the balance sheet at 31 December 2017 31 December 2016: net deficit 29m.
The size of the net surplus deficit is sensitive to the market value of the assets held by the schemes and to actuarial assumptions, which include price inflation, pension and salary increases, the discount rate used in assessing actuarial liabilities, mortality and other demographic assumptions and the levels of contributions.
Further details and sensitivities are included in note 19.
Provisions As described in the accounting policy on page 129, the Group measures provisions carrying value at 31 December 2017: 883m, 31December 2016: 759m at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
These estimates take account of information available and different possible outcomes.
Taxation The tax payable on profits is determined based on tax laws and regulations that apply in each of the numerous jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
Where the precise impact of these laws and regulations is unclear, or uncertain, then reasonable estimates may be used todetermine the tax charge included in the Financial Statements.
The main area of uncertainty is in relation to cross-border transactions, entered into in the normal course of business, as the amount of income or profit taxable in each country involved can be subjective and therefore open to interpretation by the relevant tax authorities.
This can result in disputes and possibly litigation.
Tax provisions require management to make judgements and estimates of exposures in relation to tax audit issues and other areas of uncertainty.
Contingent liabilities in respect of any tax disputes or litigation, are covered in note 23.
Allprovisions are in current liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available, against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised, based on managements assumptions relating to the amounts and timing of future taxable profits.
Further details on the Groups tax position can be found on page 196.
Significant accounting policies The Groups significant accounting policies are set out below.
These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements and by all Group entities.
Basis of consolidation The Group Consolidated Financial Statements include the Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings together with the Groups share of the results of joint arrangements and associates made up to 31 December.
In line with common practice in Germany, a small number of immaterial subsidiaries of Rolls-Royce Power Systems are not consolidated and are carried at cost in other investments.
As set out in note 25, ITP Aero was acquired on 19 December 2017.
It has been assumed that ITP Aero did not have any significant trading activity between the acquisition date and 31 December 2017.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has power over an entity, exposure to variable returns from its involvement with an entity and the ability to use its power over an entity so as to affect the Companys returns.
A joint arrangement is an entity in which the Group holds a long-term interest and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other venturers under a contractual arrangement.
Joint arrangements may be either joint ventures or joint operations.
An associate is an entity, being neither a subsidiary nor a joint arrangement, in which the Group holds a long-term interest and where the Group has a significant influence.
The results of joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Joint operations are accounted for using proportionate accounting.
Any subsidiary undertaking, joint arrangement or associate sold or acquired during the year are included up to, or from, the date ofchange of control.
Transactions with non-controlling interests are recorded directly in equity.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Adjustments are made to eliminate the profitor loss arising on transactions with joint arrangements and associates to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
Financial Statements Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 126 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Revenue comprises sales to outside customers after discounts, excluding value added taxes.
Sales of products both OE and spare parts are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods aretransferred to the customer, the sales price agreed and the receipt of payment can be assured this is generally on delivery.
On occasion, theGroup may participate in the financing of OE, most commonly by the provision of guarantees as described in note 18.
In such circumstances, the contingent obligations arising under these arrangements are taken into account in assessing when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer.
As described on page 122, a sale of OE at a contractual price below its cost of manufacture isconsidered to give rise to revenue to the extent that an intangible asset contractual aftermarket right is recognised at the same time.
Sales of services are recognised by reference to the stage of completion based on services performed to date.
As described on page 122, the assessment of the stage of completion is dependent on the nature of the contract, but will generally be based on: flying hours or equivalent for long-term aftermarket arrangements where the service is provided on a continuous basis: costs incurred to the extent these relate to services performed up to the reporting date: or achievement of contractual milestones where relevant.
As described on page 123, sales of products and services are treated as though they are a single contract where these components have been negotiated as a single commercial package and are so closely interrelated that they do not operate independently of each other and are considered to form a single transaction with an overall profit margin.
The total revenue is allocated between the two components such that the total agreed discount to list prices is allocated to revenue for each of the two components pro rata, based on list prices.
The revenue is then recognised for each component on this basis as the products are delivered and services provided, as described above.
Where the contractual price of the OE component is below the revenue allocated from the combined arrangement, this will give rise toanasset included in amounts recoverable on contracts.
This asset reduces as services are provided, increases as costs are incurred, andreduces to zero by the end of the contract.
Where the balance is a liability, it is recognised in accruals and deferred income.
Provided that the outcome of construction contracts can be assessed with reasonable certainty, the revenue and costs on such contracts are recognised based on stage of completion and the overall contract profitability.
Full provision is made for any estimated losses to completion ofcontracts, having regard to the overall substance of the arrangements.
Progress payments received, when greater than recorded revenue, are deducted from the value of work in progress except to the extent that payments on account exceed the value of work in progress on any contract where the excess is included in accruals and deferred income within trade and other payables.
The amount by which recorded revenue of long-term contracts is in excess of payments on account is classified as amounts recoverable on contracts and is separately disclosed within trade and other receivables.
TotalCare arrangements As described above, these are accounted for on a stage of completion basis, with the stage of completion based on the proportion of flying hours completed compared to the total estimated under the contract.
In making the assessment of future revenue, costs and the level of profit recognised the Group takes account of: i the forecast utilisation of the engines by the operator: ii the forecast costs to maintain the engines in accordance with the contractual requirements the principal variables being the time between shop visits and the cost of each shop visit: and iii the recoverability of any contract asset arising.
The Group benchmarks the forecast costs against previous programmes, recognising that the reliability of the forecasts will improve as operational experience of the engine increases.
To the extent that actual costs differ from forecast costs or that forecast costs change, the cumulative impact is recognised in the period.
An allowance is made against forecast contract revenue given the potential for reduced engine flying hours based on historical forecasting accuracy, the risk of aircraft being parked by the customer and the customers creditworthiness.
Again, changes in this allowance are recognised in the period.
Risk and revenue sharing arrangements As described on page 123, the Group enters into arrangements with certain workshare partners under which these suppliers: i contribute to the forecast costs of developing an engine by performing their own development work, providing development parts and paying a non-refundable cash entry fee: and ii supply components for the production phase for which they receive consideration, which isan agreed proportion of the total programme revenue.
Both the suppliers contributions to the forecast non-recurring development costs and their consideration are determined by reference to their proportionate forecast scopes of supply relative to that of the engine overall.
Once the forecast costs and the scopes of supply have been agreed at the inception of the contract, each party is then accountable for its own incurred costs.
No accounting entries are recorded when the suppliers undertake development work or when development components are supplied.
Cash sums received are recognised in the income statement, as a reduction in research and development costs incurred, to match the expensing of the Groups related costs where the cash sums are received in advance of the related costs being expensed or where the related costs are capitalised as intangible assets, the recognition of the cash received is deferred in accruals and deferred income to match the recognition of the related expense or the amortisation of the related intangible asset respectively.
The payments to suppliers of their shares of the programme revenue for their production components are charged to cost of sales as programme revenue arise.
The Group has arrangements with partners who do not undertake development work or supply parts.
Such arrangements are considered to be financial instruments as defined by IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are accounted for using the amortised costmethod.
Government investment Where a government or similar body has previously invested in a development programme, the Group treats payments to that body as royalty payments, which are matched to related sales.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial Statements Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 127 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies continued Government grants Government grants are recognised in the income statement so as to match them with the related expenses that they are intended to compensate.
Where grants are received in advance of the related expenses, they are included in the balance sheet as deferred income.
Non-monetary grants are recognised at fair value.
Interest Interest receivable payable is credited charged to the income statement using the effective interest method.
Where borrowing costs are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, such costs are capitalised as part of the specific asset.
Taxation The tax charge credit on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax: Current tax is the expected tax payable for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and anyadjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts ofthe assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes and is calculated using the enacted or substantively enacted rates that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled.
Tax is charged or credited in the income statement or other comprehensive income OCI as appropriate, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is not recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill or for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised.
Foreign currency translation Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting Group undertaking are translated into thefunctional currency at the exchange rates ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the rate ruling at the year end.
Exchange differences arising on foreign exchange transactions and the retranslation of assets and liabilities into functional currencies at the rate ruling at the year end are taken into account in determining profit before taxation.
The trading results of Group undertakings are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the year.
The assets and liabilities of overseas undertakings, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the year end.
Exchange adjustments arising from the retranslation of the opening net investments, and from the translation of the profits or losses ataverage rates, are recognised in OCI.
The cumulative amount of exchange adjustments was, on transition to IFRS in 2004, deemed to be nil.
Financial instruments IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement requires the classification of financial instruments into separate categories forwhich the accounting requirement is different.
The Group has classified its financial instruments as follows: Short-term investments are generally classified as available for sale.
Short-term deposits principally comprising funds held with banks and other financial institutions, trade receivables and short-term investments not designated as available for sale are classified as loans and receivables.
Borrowings, trade payables, financial RRSAs, and C Shares are classified as other liabilities.
Derivatives, comprising foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity contracts are classified as fair value through profit or loss.
Financial instruments are recognised at the contract date and initially measured at fair value.
Their subsequent measurement depends ontheir classification: Available for sale assets are held at fair value.
Changes in fair value arising from changes in exchange rates are included in the income statement.
All other changes in fair value are taken to equity.
On disposal, the accumulated changes in value recorded in equity are included in the gain or loss recorded in the income statement.
Loans and receivables and other liabilities are held at amortised cost and not revalued except for changes in exchange rates and forecast contractual cash flows, which are included in the income statement unless they are included in a fair value hedge accounting relationship.
Where such a hedging relationship exists, the instruments are revalued in respect of the risk being hedged, with the change in value included in the income statement.
Fair value through profit or loss items are held at fair value.
Changes in fair value are included in the income statement unless the instrument is included in a cash flow hedge.
If the instruments are included in an effective cash flow hedging relationship, changes invalue are taken to equity.
When the hedged forecast transaction occurs, amounts previously recorded in equity are recognised intheincome statement.
Financial instruments are derecognised on expiry or when all contractual rights and obligations are transferred.
Financial Statements Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 128 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies continued Hedge accounting The Group does not generally apply hedge accounting in respect of forward foreign exchange contracts or commodity swaps held to manage the cash flow exposures of forecast transactions denominated in foreign currencies or in commodities respectively.
The Group applies hedge accounting in respect of transactions entered into to manage the fair value and cash flow exposures of its borrowings.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are held to manage the fair value exposures of borrowings denominated in foreign currencies and are designated as fair value hedges.
Interest rate swaps are held to manage the interest rate exposures and are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges of fixed and floating rate borrowings respectively.
Changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and changes in fair value of the related hedged item are recognised directly in the income statement.
Changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges and are effective are recognised directly in equity.
Any ineffectiveness in the hedging relationships is included in the income statement.
The amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement to match the recognition of the hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, for cash flow hedges and if the forecast transaction remains probable, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
The portion of a gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in the translation reserve will be recycled to profit when the foreign operation is sold.
Business combinations and goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Where fair values of acquired contingent liabilities cannot be measured reliably, the assumed contingent liability is not recognised but is disclosed in the same manner as other .
Goodwill recognised represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value to the Group of the net of theidentifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
On transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004, business combinations were not retrospectively adjusted to comply with Adopted IFRS and goodwill was recognised based on the carrying value under the previous accounting policies.
Goodwill in respect of the acquisition of a subsidiary is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint arrangements and associates is included in the carrying value of the investment.
Certification costs and participation fees Costs incurred in respect of meeting regulatory certification requirements for new civil aero engine aircraft combinations including payments made to airframe manufacturers for this and participation fees are carried forward in intangible assets to the extent that they can be recovered out of future sales and are charged to the income statement over the programme life on a straight-line basis, up to a maximum of 15 years from the entry into service of the product.
Research and development In accordance with IAS 38, expenditure incurred on research and development is distinguished as relating either to a research phase or to a development phase.
All research phase expenditure is charged to the income statement.
Development expenditure which predominantly relates to Civil Aerospace engine programmes is capitalised as an internally generated intangible asset programme asset only if it meets strict criteria, relating in particular to technical feasibility and generation of future economic benefits.
More specifically, development costs are capitalised from the point at which the following conditions have been met: the technical feasibility of completing the programme and the intention and ability availability of technical, financial and other resources to complete the programme asset and use or sell it: the probability that future economic benefits will flow from the programme asset: and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the programme asset during its development.
Capitalisation continues until the point at which the programme asset meets its originally contracted technical specification defined internally as the point at which the asset is capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised where it enhances the functionality of the programme asset and demonstrably generates an enhanced economic benefit to the Group.
All other subsequent expenditure on programme assets is expensed as incurred.
Development expenditure capitalised is amortised on a straight-line basis up to a maximum of 15 years from the entry into service of the programme asset.
In accordance with IAS 38, we assess the basis on which we amortise programme assets annually.
At the end of 2017, we confirmed that we will commence amortisation of programme assets on a 15 year straight-line basis pro rata over the estimated number of units produced.
We will apply this approach prospectively from 1 January 2018.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial Statements Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 129 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies continued Contractual aftermarket rights As described under key judgements on page 122, the Group may sell OE to customers at a price below its cost, on the basis that it also receives valuable aftermarket rights.
Such a sale is considered to give rise to an intangible asset which is recognised, in accordance with IAS 38, at the same time as the revenue at an amount equal to the cash deficit and is amortised on a straight-line basis over the period that highly probable aftermarket sales are expected to be earned.
Customer relationships The fair value of customer relationships recognised as a result of a business combination relate to the acquired companys established relationships with its existing customers that result in repeat purchases and customer loyalty.
Amortisation occurs on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, up to a maximum of 15 years.
Software The cost of acquiring software that is not specific to an item of property, plant and equipment is classified as an intangible asset and amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, up to a maximum of five years.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the estimated residual value, of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives.
No depreciation is provided on assets in the course of construction.
Estimated useful lives are as follows: Land and buildings, as advised by the Groups professional advisers: freehold buildings five to 45 years average 26 years : leasehold buildings lower of advisers estimates or period of lease: and no depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Plant and equipment five to 25 years average 12 years.
Aircraft and engines five to 20 years average 13 years.
Where the Group obtains effective control of customers installed engines as a result of a TotalCare Flex arrangement, the fair value of these engines is recognised as an addition shown separately in note 10.
The corresponding liability is recognised either as deferred revenue or a financial liability depending on the precise nature of the arrangement.
Operating leases Payments made and rentals received under operating lease arrangements are charged credited to the income statement on a straight-linebasis.
Impairment of non-current assets Impairment of non-current assets is considered in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent of other assets, impairment is considered for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually.
Other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investments are assessed for any indications of impairment annually.
If any indication of impairment is identified, an impairment test is performed to estimate the recoverable amount.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be below the carrying value, the carrying value is reduced to the recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised as an expense.
The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use or fair value less costs to sell, if this is readily available.
The value in use is the present value of future cash flows using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset.
Inventories Inventories and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads, including depreciation of property, plant and equipment, that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling prices less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand, investments in money-market funds and short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less on inception.
The Group considers overdrafts repayable on demand to be an integral part of its cash management activities and these are included in cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the cash flow statement.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Financial Statements Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 130 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies continued Post-retirement benefits Pensions and similar benefits principally healthcare are accounted for under IAS 19.
For defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present value, using a discount rate derived from high-quality corporate bonds denominated in the currency of the plan, whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value.
Surpluses in schemes are recognised as assets only if they represent economic benefits available to the Group in the future.
A liability is recognised to the extent that the minimum funding requirements in respect of past service will give rise to an unrecognisable surplus.
The service and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement: current service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees: past service costs and settlements are recognised immediately: and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses and movements in unrecognised surpluses and minimum funding liabilities are recognised immediately in OCI.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payments The Group provides share-based payment arrangements to certain employees.
These are principally equity-settled arrangements and are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares or options that will vest, except where additional shares vest as a result of the total shareholder return TSR performance condition in the Performance Share Plan PSP.
Cash-settled share options grants in the International Sharesave plan are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
The Group recognises a liability at the balance sheet date based on these fair values, taking into account the estimated number of options that will actually vest and the relative completion of the vesting period.
Changes in the value of this liability are recognised in the income statement for the year.
The cost of shares of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc held by the Group for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of employee share plans is deducted from equity in the consolidated balance sheet.
See note 21 for a further description of the share-based payment plans.
Customer financing support In connection with the sale of its products, the Group will, on occasion, provide financing support for its customers.
These arrangements fall into two categories: credit-based guarantees and asset-value guarantees.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 39 and IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, credit-based guarantees are treated as insurance contracts.
The Group considers asset-value guarantees to be non-financial liabilities and accordingly these are also treated as insurance contracts.
As described on page 158, the Directors consider the likelihood of crystallisation in assessing whether provision is required for any contingent liabilities.
The Groups contingent liabilities relating to financing arrangements are spread over many years and relate to a number of customers and a broad product portfolio, and are reported on a discounted basis.
Revisions to Adopted IFRS in 2017 There were no changes to accounting standards that had a material impact on the 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements.
Revisions to IFRS not applicable in 2017 Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB are only applicable if endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 effective for the year beginning 1 January 2018 relates to the accounting for financial instruments and covers: classification and measurement: impairment: and hedge accounting.
Except for hedge accounting, retrospective application is required with any adjustment being made to reserves on 1 January 2018.
The Group is not required to restate 2017 comparative information and is analysing the impact of adoption on its Financial Statements.
This is not expected to be material.
The Group can sell its trade receivables from certain customers before their due date.
The trade receivables of these customers that are not sold will be classified and disclosed as fair value through other comprehensive income from 2018.
This will not have a significant impact on the income statement.
The Group will adopt the simplified approach to provide for losses on receivables and contract assets resulting from transactions within the scope of IFRS 15.
The Group has performed a preliminary assessment of the adoption of the standard on the basis of average default risk of customers and will continue to analyse the impact during 2018.
We do not anticipate that this will have a significant impact on the income statement.
The Group has determined that all existing effective hedging relationship will continue to qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9.
We will continue not to hedge account for forecast foreign exchange transactions.
This will not have an impact on the Financial Statements.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial Statements Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 131 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies continued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 provides a single, principles based five-step model to be applied to all sales contracts.
It is based on the transfer of control of goods and services to customers and replaces the separate models for goods, services and construction contracts currently included in IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IAS 18 Revenue.
There are three broad implications: linked accounting will cease to exist so all OE sales will be treated on the same basis: OE engine cash deficits will no longer be capitalised and recorded as contractual aftermarket rights, they will instead be recognised on delivery: and revenue and profits for aftermarket services will be recognised on an activity basis as costs are incurred.
The Group will adopt IFRS 15 on 1 January 2018 using the full retrospective approach.
The Group has undertaken significant analysis on the impact of IFRS 15 and the most significant accounting judgements, estimates and policies are set out below.
Work will continue during 2018 to review and refine policies and procedures required to implement IFRS 15.
As a result it is possible that there may be some changes to the impact reported.
Key areas of judgement: Determining the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations: Where the performance obligation is the supply of goods principally OE and spare parts which is satisfied at the point in time that those goods are transferred to the customer, the Group will recognise revenue at that point in time.
The Group generates a significant proportion of its revenue and profit from aftermarket arrangements arising from the use of the installed OE.
These aftermarket contracts, such as TotalCare and CorporateCare agreements in Civil Aerospace, cover a range of services and generally have contractual terms covering more than one year.
Under these contracts, the Groups primary obligation is to maintain customers equipment in an operational condition and this is achieved by undertaking various activities, such as repair, overhaul and engine monitoring over the period of the contract.
Revenue on these contracts is recognised over the period of the contract and the measure of performance is a matter of judgement.
In general, the Directors consider that the stage of performance of the contract is best measured by using the actual costs incurred to date compared to the estimated costs to complete the performance obligations.
The assessment of stage of completion is generally measured for each contract.
However, in certain cases, such as for CorporateCare agreements where there are many contracts covering aftermarket services, each for a small number of engines, the Group will apply the practical expedient offered by IFRS 15 to account for a portfolio of contracts together as it expects that the effects on the Financial Statements would not differ materially from applying the standard to the individual contracts in the portfolio.
The Group has paid participation fees to airframe manufacturers, its customers for OE on certain programmes.
Amounts paid are initially treated as contract assets and subsequently charged as a reduction to the OE revenue when it is transferred to the customer.
The number of units over which the asset will be charged is a matter of judgement as the orders will grow over the course of the programme.
In assessing the accounting for the participation fee payments we make to our OE customers, we have also assessed the accounting for up-front payments we sometimes receive from the Groups suppliers under RRSAs to allow them to participate in an engine programme.
We have concluded that, consistent with changes to how we will account for participation fees noted above, these receipts should be deferred and recognised against cost of sales over the period of supply.
This will also require judgement as to the number of units over which the receipts will be allocated.
The Group has elected to use the practical expedient to expense as incurred any incremental costs of obtaining or fulfilling a contract if the amortisation period of an asset created would have been one year or less.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty: Assessment of long-term contractual arrangements.
The estimated revenue and costs under such agreements are inherently imprecise and significant estimates are required to take into account uncertainties relating to: i the forecast utilisation of the engines by the operator and related pricing: ii the frequency of engine overhauls where the principal variables are the operating parameters of the engine and operational lives of components: and iii the forecast costs to maintain the engines in accordance with the contractual requirements where the cost of each overhaul is dependent on the required work-scope and the cost of parts and labour at the time.
An allowance is made against the risk of non-recovery of resulting contract balances from reduced utilisation e. g. engine flying hours, based on historical forecasting experience, the risk of aircraft being parked by the customer and the customers creditworthiness.
A significant amount of revenue and cost is denominated in currencies other than that of the relevant Group undertaking.
These are translated at estimated long-term exchange rates.
Significant accounting policies: Revenue recognition comprises sales to outside customers after discounts and amounts payable to customers and excludes value added taxes.
The Group has elected to use the practical expedient not to adjust revenue for the effect of financing components where the expectation is that the period between the transfer of goods and services to customers and the receipt of payment is less than a year.
Sales of services are recognised by reference to the progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation provided the outcome of contracts can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
Full provision is made for any estimated losses to completion of contracts, having regard to the overall substance of the arrangements.
Financial Statements Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 132 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies continued TotalCare and similar long-term aftermarket service arrangements are accounted for on a stage of completion basis.
A contract liability will be created where payment is received ahead of the costs incurred to meet performance obligations.
In making the assessment of future revenue, costs and the level of profit recognised, the Group takes account of the inherent uncertainties and the risk of nonrecovery of any resulting contract balances.
To the extent that actual revenue and costs differ from forecast or that forecasts change, the cumulative impact is recognised in the period.
When accounting for a portfolio of long-term service arrangements, such as CorporateCare agreements, the Group uses estimates and assumptions that reflect the size and composition of the portfolio.
The new standard has no impact on the timing of the reported cash flows.
The comparative 2017 results to be included in the 2018 Financial Statements will be restated.
Certain tables from note 2, have been prepared on the IFRS 15 basis set out above and are shown in note 27.
Overall, the adoption of IFRS 15 is expected to result in a reduction in 2017 underlying revenue and operating profit of 1,408m and 854m respectively and a reduction of net assets of 5.2bn at 31 December 2017.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 effective for the year beginning 1 January 2019 will require all leases to be recognised on the balance sheet.
Currently, IAS 17 Leases only requires leases categorised as finance leases to be recognised on the balance sheet.
The Group is progressing well in its analysis of how IFRS 16 should be implemented and is developing the data-set, systems and processes that will be required.
The most significant leases, by value, relate to property and aircraft engines.
The Group expects to apply the standard retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initial application recognised on 1 January 2019.
Under this approach the Group will not restate comparative periods.
In broad terms the impact of the standard will be to: recognise an additional lease liability equivalent to the present value of the lease commitments at the date of transition.
Further work is required to validate the contracts which will represent leases under IFRS 16, including ongoing consideration of some supply chain contracts.
The Group is also considering whether there are any re-assessments of lease term required, and the discount rate to be applied.
Under the expected transition option, payments will be discounted using incremental borrowing rates at 1 January 2019.
The Group holds some leases in non-functional currencies where the value of the lease liability will be dependent on spot exchange rates on transition: and recognise a right-of-use asset measured either: as if the standard had applied since commencement of the lease: or at an amount equal to the lease liability on transition.
The Group does not consider that any other standards, amendments or interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet applicable will have a significant impact on the Financial Statements.
2 Segmental analysis The analysis by business segment is presented in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, on the basis of those segments whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Board the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined by IFRS 8, as follows: Civil Aerospace development, manufacture, marketing and sales of commercial aero engines and aftermarket services.
Defence Aerospace development, manufacture, marketing and sales of military aero engines and aftermarket services.
Power Systems development, manufacture, marketing and sales of reciprocating engines and power systems.

The operating results are reviewed by the Board and are prepared on an underlying basis, which the Board considers reflects better the economic substance of the Groups trading during the year and provides financial measures that, together with the results prepared in accordance with Adopted IFRS, allow better analysis of the factors affecting the years results compared to the prior year.
This approach has been applied consistently.
The principles adopted to determine underlying results are: Underlying revenue and cost of sales Where revenue and costs are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group undertaking and the Group hedges the net exposure, these reflect the achieved exchange rates arising on derivative contracts settled to cover the net exposure.
This reflects the economic hedging that the Group undertakes.
These achieved exchange rates are applied to all relevant revenue and costs, including those for which there is a natural offsetting position, rather than translating the offsetting transactions at spot rates.
The underlying profits would be the same under both approaches, but the Board considers that the approach taken provides a better indication of trends over time.
Underlying profit before financing In addition to the impact of exchange rates on revenue and costs above, adjustments have been made to exclude one-off past service costs or credits on post-retirement schemes, exceptional restructuring costs associated with the substantial closure or exit of a site, facility or line of business or other major transformation activities, the effect of acquisition accounting including in 2017, the gains arising on the acquisition of ITP Aero so that all segments are measured on a consistent basis, the effect of business disposals, the impairment of goodwill and similar items, and in 2016 financial penalties from agreements with investigating bodies.

Taxation The tax effect of the adjustments above are excluded from the underlying tax charge.
In addition, changes in the amount ofrecoverable advance corporation tax recognised and the impact of changes in tax rates are also excluded.

Financial Statements Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 140 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 5 Taxation continued Deferred taxation assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets include 285m 2016: 326m relating to tax losses in the UK and 163m 2016: nil relating to advance corporation tax.
In both cases, a recoverability assessment has been undertaken, taking account of deferred tax liabilities against which the reversal of the deferred tax asset can be offset and using latest UK forecasts to assess the level of future taxable profits.
The assessment takes into account new tax laws that are effective from 1 April 2017 restricting the offset of tax losses, and the fact that neither asset time expires.
The forecasts show the UK business, which is mainly Civil Aerospace and Defence Aerospace, continues to generate sufficient future taxable profits to support the continued recognition of the deferred tax asset relating to tax losses even though the new tax laws extend the period over which the losses are expected to be used.
This is aligned to the business outlook, in particular Civil Aerospace with its growth in original equipment revenue from large engines and engine unit cost improvements.
Prior to the new tax laws, advance corporation tax would not be utilised until after all the UK tax losses had been used.
One of the consequences of the change in tax laws is that UK tax payments will be accelerated.
Advance corporation tax can be offset against such payments.
This is reflected in the forecasts that show it now being used over a similar period to the losses.
As a result the advance corporation tax has been recognised as a deferred tax asset in 2017.
The resulting credit to the income statement has been excluded from underlying profit.
The US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on 22 December 2017.
This reduces the Federal tax rate in the US from 35% to 21% with effect from 1 January 2018.
As the reduction has been enacted prior to the year end, the closing deferred tax assets and liabilities of US companies within the Group have been calculated at this rate.
The resulting charges or credits have been recognised in the income statement except to the extent that they relate to items previously charged or credited to OCI or equity.
Accordingly in 2017, 25m has been charged to the income statement and 45m has been charged to OCI.
The Budget 2016 announced that the UK tax rate will reduce to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.
The rate reduction to 17% was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities of UK companies within the Group have therefore been calculated at 17%.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised, aggregate to 188m 2016: 276m.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the potential withholding tax due on the remittance of undistributed profits as the Group is able to control the timing of such remittances and it is probable that consent will not be given in the foreseeable future.
6 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share EPS are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares held under trust, which have been treated as if they had beencancelled.
Diluted EPS are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year for the bonus element ofshare options.

Goodwill In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill as follows: Cash-generating unit CGU or group of CGUs Primary reporting 2017 2016 segment m m Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG Power Systems 868 871 Marine arising from the acquisitions of Vinters Limited, Scandinavian Electric Holding AS and ODIM ASA Marine 410 401 Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG Civil Aerospace 244 236 Other Various 23 29 1,545 1,537 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial Statements Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 143 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 9 Intangible assets continued Goodwill has been tested for impairment during 2017 on the following basis: The carrying values of goodwill have been assessed by reference to value in use.
These have been estimated using cash flows from the most recent forecasts prepared by management, which are consistent with past experience and external sources of information on market conditions.
These forecasts cover the next five years.
Growth rates for the period not covered by the forecasts are based on a range of growth rates that reflect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU or group of CGUs operate.
The key assumptions for the impairment tests are the discount rate and, in the cash flow projections, the programme assumptions, the growth rates and the impact of foreign exchange rates on the relationship between selling prices and costs.
Impairment tests are performed using prevailing exchange rates.
The principal value in use assumptions for goodwill balances considered to be individually significant are: Marine Trading assumptions e. g. volume of equipment deliveries, capture of aftermarket and cost escalation are based on current and known future programmes, estimates of customers fleet requirements and long-term economic forecasts, in particular the cyclical recovery of the commercial marine market.
Cash flows beyond the five-year forecasts are assumed to grow at 2.5% 2016: 2.5%.
The estimate of value in use is approximately 50m higher than the carrying value and deterioration of key assumptions could result in an impairment.
For example, the value in use would reduce by approximately 50m if alternative trading assumptions resulted in forecast cash flows reducing by 10%, by approximately 60m if the discount rate increased by 1% and by approximately 100m if the market recovery were delayed by one year compared to that assumed.
On 17 January 2018, the Group announced a strategic review of commercial marine.
Until the review is sufficiently advanced, it is not possible to determine reliably the full financial impact.
Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG Trading assumptions e. g. volume of equipment deliveries, pricing achieved and cost escalation are based on current and known future programmes, estimates of capture of market share and long-term economic forecasts.
Cash flows beyond the five-year forecasts are assumed to grow at 1.8% 2016: 2%.
The Directors do not consider that any reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would cause the value in use of the goodwill to fall below its carrying value.
Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG Trading assumptions e. g. volume of engine deliveries, flying hours of installed fleet and cost escalation are based on current and known future programmes, estimates of customers fleet requirements and long-term economic forecasts.
Other intangible assets Certification costs and participation fees, development costs and contractual aftermarket rights have been reviewed for impairment inaccordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Where an impairment test was considered necessary, it has been performed on the following basis: The carrying values have been assessed by reference to value in use.
These have been estimated using cash flows from the most recent forecasts prepared by management, which are consistent with past experience and external sources of information on market conditions over the lives of the respective programmes.
The key assumptions underlying cash flow projections are assumed market share, programme timings, unit cost assumptions, discount rates, and foreign exchange rates.
The pre-tax cash flow projections have been discounted at 913% 2016: 9-13%, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for the estimated programme risk, for example taking account of whether or not the forecast cash flows arise from contracted business.
No impairment is required on this basis.
However, a combination of adverse changes in assumptions e. g. market size and share, unit costs and programme delays and other variables e. g. discount rate and foreign exchange rates, could result in impairment in future years.
In making this assessment, the Directors noted that the adoption of IFRS 15 on 1 January 2018 would result in the derecognition of contractual aftermarket rights of 873m, which will itself significantly reduce the risk of impairment on other intangible assets.

Fair values have been determined with reference to available market information at the balance sheet date, using the methodologies described below.
A These primarily comprise unconsolidated companies where fair value approximates to the book value.
B Fair values are assumed to approximate to cost either due to the short-term maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate of the investments is reset after periods not exceeding six months.
C Fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash ows using prevailing interest rate curves.
Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
These financial instruments are included on the balance sheet at fair value, derived from observable market prices Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
D Borrowings are carried at amortised cost.
The fair value of borrowings is estimated by discounting contractual future cash flows.
E The fair values of RRSAs and TotalCare Flex liabilities are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows.
The contractual cash flows are based on future trading activity, which is estimated based on latest forecasts Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial Statements Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 151 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 17 Financial instruments continued Derivative financial instruments The Group uses various financial instruments to manage its exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates.
Where the effectiveness ofa hedging relationship in a cash flow hedge is demonstrated, changes in the fair value that are deemed effective are included in the cash flow hedge reserve and released to match actual payments on the hedged item.
The Group uses commodity swaps to manage its exposure to movements in the price of commodities jet fuel and base metals.
To hedge the currency risk associated with a borrowing denominated in US dollars, the Group has currency derivatives designated as part of fair value hedges.
The Group uses interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage its exposure to movements in interest rates.
Movements in the fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities were as follows: Foreign exchange instruments Commodity instruments Interest rate instruments Total 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m m m m m m m At 1 January 5,551 1,640 56 104 358 13 5,249 1,731 Currency options at 1 inception 33 33 Acquisition of business 7 2 9 Movements in fair value 2 hedges 131 345 131 345 Movements in other 3 derivativecontracts 2,611 4,436 37 16 2,648 4,420 Contracts settled 621 558 18 32 639 590 At 31 December 2,312 5,551 1 56 227 358 2,084 5,249 1 The Group wrote currency options to sell USD and buy GBP as part of a commercial agreement.

Financial risk and revenue sharing arrangements and other financial liabilities The Group has financial liabilities arising from financial RRSAs.
These financial liabilities are valued at each reporting date using the amortised cost method.
This involves calculating the present value of the forecast cash flows of the arrangements using the internal rate of return at the inception of the arrangements as the discount rate.

Financial Statements Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 152 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 17 Financial instruments continued Risk management policies and hedging activities The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are: foreign currency exchange rate risk: liquidity risk: credit risk: interest rate risk: and commodity price risk.
The Board has approved policies for the management of these risks.
Foreign currency exchange rate risk The Group has significant cash flows most significantly US dollars, followed by the euro denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant trading entity.
To manage its exposures to changes in values of future foreign currency cash flows, so as to maintain relatively stable long-term foreign exchange rates on settled transactions, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign currency transactions.
For accounting purposes, these derivative contracts are generally not designated as hedging instruments.
The Group also has exposures to the fair values of non-derivative financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies.
To manage the risk of changes in these fair values, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign exchange contracts, which are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes.
The Group regards its interests in overseas subsidiary companies as long-term investments.
The Group aims to match its translational exposures by matching the currencies of assets and liabilities.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to hold financial investments and maintain undrawn committed facilities at a level sufficient to ensure that the Group has available funds to meet its medium-term capital and funding obligations and to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
The Group holds cash and short-term investments, which together with the undrawn committed facilities, enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments.
The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk is a key component of the Groups risk management activities.
The Group has credit policies covering both trading and financial exposures.
Credit risks arising from treasury activities are managed by a central treasury function in accordance with the Group credit policy.
The objective of the policy is to diversify and minimise the Groups exposure to credit risk from its treasury activities by ensuring the Group transacts strictly with BBB or higher-rated financial institutions based on pre-established limits per financial institution.
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk to individual customers or counterparties.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings fair value risk, floating rate borrowings and cash and cash equivalents cash flow risk.
Interest rate derivatives are used to manage the overall interest rate profile within the Group policy, which is to maintain a higher proportion of net funds at floating rates of interest as a natural hedge to the net cash position.
These are designated as either fair value or cash flow hedges as appropriate.
Commodity risk The Group has exposures to the price of jet fuel and base metals arising from business operations.
To minimise its cash flow exposures to changes in commodity prices, the Group enters into derivative commodity transactions.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial Statements Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 157 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 17 Financial instruments continued Some of the Groups borrowings are subject to the Group meeting certain obligations, including customary financial covenants.
If the Group fails to meet its obligations these arrangements give rights to the lenders, upon agreement, to accelerate repayment of the facilities.
There are no rating triggers contained in any of the Groups facilities that could require the Group to accelerate or repay any facility for a given movement in the Groups credit rating.
In addition, the Group has 2,106m 2016: 2,280m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities of which 2,000m is available for at least the next two years.

The main interest rate sensitivity for the Group arises as a result of the gross up of net cash and this is mitigated as described under the interest rate risk management policies on page 152.
C Shares and payments to shareholders The Company issues non-cumulative redeemable preference shares C Shares as an alternative to paying a cash dividend.
C Shares in respect of a year are issued in the following year.
Shareholders are able to redeem any number of their C Shares for cash.
Any C Shares retained attract a dividend of 75% of LIBOR on the 0.1p nominal value of each share, paid on a twice-yearly basis, and have limited voting rights.
The Company has the option to compulsorily redeem the C Shares, at any time, if the aggregate number of C Shares in issue is less than 10% of the aggregate number of C Shares issued, or on the acquisition or capital restructuring of the Company.
Movements in issued and fully paid C Shares during the year were as follows: 2017 2016 Nominal Nominal value value Millions m Millions m At 1 January 28,125 28 28,960 29 Issued 215,235 215 300,993 301 Redeemed 214,931 215 301,828 302 At 31 December 28,429 28 28,125 28 Payments to shareholders in respect of the year represent the value of C Shares to be issued in respect of the results for the year.

Prior year figures have not been restated.
Provisions for warranties and guarantees primarily relate to products sold and generally cover a period of up to three years.
Provisions for contract loss and restructuring are generally expected to be utilised within two years.
In connection with the sale of its products the Group will, on some occasions, provide financing support for its customers generally inrespect of civil aircraft.
The Groups commitments relating to these financing arrangements are spread over many years, relate toanumber of customers and a broad product portfolio and are generally secured on the asset subject to the financing.
These include commitments of US$3.3bn 2016:US$3.2bn on a discounted basis to provide borrowing facilities to enable customers to purchase aircraft of which approximately US$390m on a discounted basis could be called during 2018.
These facilities may only be used if the customer is unable to obtain financing elsewhere and are priced at a premium to the market rate.
Consequently the Directors do not consider that there is a significant exposure arising from the provision ofthese facilities.
Customer financing provisions cover guarantees provided for asset value and or financing.
It is estimated that the provision will be utilised as follows: 2017 2016 m m Potential claims with specific claim dates: In one year or less 11 2 In more than one year but less than five years 5 12 In more than five years 5 5 21 19 Commitments on delivered aircraft in excess of the amounts provided are shown in the table below.
These are reported on a discounted basis at the Groups borrowing rate to reflect better the time span over which these exposures could arise.
These amounts do not represent values that are expected to crystallise.
The commitments are denominated in US dollars.
As the Group does not generally adopt cash flow hedge accounting for future foreign exchange transactions, this amount is reported, together with the sterling equivalent at the reporting date spot rate.
The values of aircraft providing security are based on advice from a specialist aircraft appraiser.

The Groups captive insurance company retains a portion of the exposures it insures on behalf of the remainder of the Group.
Significant delays occur in the notification and settlement of claims and judgement is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost and timing of which cannot be known with certainty at the balance sheet date.
The insurance provisions are based on information currently available, however it is inherent in the nature of the business that ultimate liabilities may vary.
Provisions for outstanding claims are established to cover the outstanding expected liability as well as claims incurred but not yet reported.
Other provisions comprise a number of liabilities with varying expected utilisation rates.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial Statements Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 159 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 19 Post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes: The UK defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
Employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on either their final or career-average salaries and length of service.
Overseas defined benefit schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded plans and provide benefits in line with local practice.
Additionally, in the US, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, the Groups employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired employees.
The valuations of the defined benefit schemes are based on the most recent funding valuations, where relevant, updated by the scheme actuaries to 31 December 2017.
The defined benefit schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity, interest rate, inflation and investment risks.
In the UK, and in the principal US and Canadian pension schemes, the Group has adopted investment policies to mitigate some of these risks.
This involves investing a significant proportion of the schemes assets in Liability Driven Investment portfolios, which hold investments designed to offset interest rate and inflation rate risks.
In addition, in the UK, the scheme has invested in a longevity swap, which is designed to offset longevity risks in respect of approximately two thirds of current pensioners.
Following the buy-out of the liabilities of the Vickers Group Pension Scheme in 2016, the scheme returned its remaining surplus of 5m net of tax to the Group in the year.
This scheme is expected to be formally wound up in early 2018.

The Consumer Price Index is assumed to be 1.1% lower.
Discount rates are determined by reference to the market yields on AA rated corporate bonds.
The rate is determined by using the profile of forecast benefit payments to derive a weighted average discount rate from the yield curve.
The inflation assumption is determined by the market implied assumption based on the yields on long-term indexed linked government securities and increases in salaries are based on actual experience, allowing for promotion, of the real increase above inflation.
The mortality assumptions adopted for the UK pension schemes are derived from the SAPS 2 All actuarial tables, with future improvements in line with the CMI 2016 core projections and long-term improvements of 1.25%.
Where appropriate, these are adjusted to take account of the relevant schemes actual experience.
Other assumptions have been set on advice from the relevant actuary, having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and the assumptions used in the most recent funding valuation.

3 Under the longevity swap, the Rolls-Royce UK Pension fund has agreed an average life expectancy of pensioners with a counterparty.
If pensioners live longer than expected the counterparty will make payments to the fund to offset the additional cost of paying pensioners.
If the reverse applies the cost of paying pensioners will be reduced but the scheme will be required to make payments to the counterparty.
The longevity swap is valued at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13 Level 3.
4 A portfolio of swap contracts designed to provide investment returns in line with global equity markets.
The notional value of the portfolio was $84m 2016 $125m.
The investment strategy for the UK scheme is controlled by the Trustee in consultation with the Group.
The scheme assets do not directly include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.
At 31 December 2017, there was an indirect holding of 1m of the Groups financial instruments.
The longevity swap is valued by the scheme actuaries based on the difference between the agreed longevity assumptions at inception and actual longevity experience.
All other fair values are provided by the fund managers.
Where available, the fair values are quoted prices e. g. listed equity, sovereign debt and corporate bonds.
Unlisted investments private equity are included at values provided by the fund manager in accordance with relevant guidance.
Other significant assets are valued based on observable inputs such as yield curves.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial Statements Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 163 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 19 Post-retirement benefits continued Future contributions The Group expects to contribute approximately 230m to its defined benefit schemes in respect of 2018 UK: 145m, Overseas: 85m.
In the UK, the funding is based on a statutory triennial funding valuation process.
This includes a negotiation between the Group and the Trustee on actuarial assumptions used to value obligations Technical Provisions which may differ from those used for accounting set out above.
The assumptions used to value Technical Provisions must be prudent rather than a best estimate of the liability.
Most notably, the Technical Provision discount rate is currently based upon UK Government yields plus 0.5% rather than being based on yields of AA corporate bonds.
Following the triennial valuation process, a Schedule of Contributions SoC must be agreed which sets out the required contribution for current service cost and any contributions from the employer to eliminate a deficit.
The most recent valuation, as at 31 March 2017, agreed by the Trustee in December 2017, showed that the UK scheme was estimated to be 112% funded on the Technical Provisions basis.
Employer contributions inclusive of employee contributions paid by a salary sacrifice arrangement will subsequently be paid at a rate of 27% in 2018 19 and 28.5% in 2020 2017: 31.6%.
The SoC includes an arrangement for a potential increase in contributions during 2021 to 2023 capped at 48.3m a year if the Technical Provisions funding position is below 107% at 31 March 2020.
As at 31 December 2017 the Technical Provisions funding position was estimated to be 114%.
Sensitivities The calculations of the defined benefit obligations are sensitive to the assumptions set out above.
The following table summarises how the estimated impact of a change in a significant assumption would affect the UK defined benefit surplus at 31 December 2017, while holding all other assumptions constant.
This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
For the most significant funded schemes, the investment strategies hedge the risks from interest rates and inflation measured on a proxy solvency basis.
For the UK scheme, the interest rate and inflation hedging is currently based on UK Government bond yields without any adjustment for any credit spread.
The longevity risk of approximately two thirds of UK pensioner liabilities is also hedged.
Where appropriate, the table also includes the corresponding movement in the value of the plan assets.

Fair values of share-based payment plans The weighted average fair value per share of equity-settled share-based payment plans granted during the year, estimated at the date ofgrant, are as follows: 2017 2016 PSP 25% TSR uplift CEO n a 714p PSP 30% TSR uplift Board n a 731p PSP 50% TSR uplift ELT n a 795p LTIP 739p 613p PSP CFO 882p n a LTIP ELT and Board 714p n a Sharesave three-year grant 244p n a Sharesave five-year grant 260p n a APRA 773p n a PSP LTIP The fair value of shares awarded are calculated using a pricing model that takes account of the non-entitlement to dividends orequivalent during the vesting period and the market-based performance condition based on expectations about volatility and the correlation of share price returns in the group of FTSE 100 companies and which incorporates into the valuation the interdependency between share price performance and TSR vesting.
This adjustment increases the fair value of the award relative to the share price at the date of grant.
Sharesave The fair value of the options granted under the Sharesave plan is calculated using a binomial pricing model that assumes that participants will exercise their options at the beginning of the six-month window if the share price is greater than the exercise price.
Otherwise it assumes that options are held until the expiration of their contractual term.
This results in an expected life that falls somewhere between the start and end of the exercise window.
APRA The fair value of shares awarded under APRA is calculated as the share price on the date of the award, excluding expected dividends orequivalent.

In January 2017, after full cooperation, the Company concluded deferred prosecution agreements with the SFO and the US Department of Justice and a leniency agreement with the MPF, the Brazilian federal prosecutors.
Prosecutions of individuals may follow and other investigations or enforcement action may be taken by other authorities.
In addition, we could still be affected by actions from customers and customers financiers.
The Directors are not currently aware of any matters that are likely to lead to a financial loss, but cannot anticipate all the possible actions that may be taken or their potential consequences.
Contingent liabilities exist in respect of guarantees provided by the Group in the ordinary course of business for product delivery, performance and reliability.
The Group has, in the normal course of business, entered into arrangements in respect of export finance, performance bonds, countertrade obligations and minor miscellaneous items.
Various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which are for substantial amounts.
As a consequence of the insolvency of an insurer as previously reported, the Group is no longer fully insured against known and potential claims from employees who worked for certain of the Groups UK based businesses for a period prior to the acquisition of those businesses by the Group.
While the outcome of some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, the Directors do not expect any of these arrangements, legal actions or claims, after allowing for provisions already made, to result in significant loss to the Group.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial Statements Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 167 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 25 Acquisitions Acquisitions On 19 December 2017, the Group completed the acquisition of the 53.1% of the shares of Industria fide Turbo Propulsores SA ITP Aero owned by SENER Grupo fide Ingenieria SA SENER which it did not already own.
The consideration of 718m is payable in eight quarterly instalments, commencing on 15 January 2018.
At the Groups election, each instalment may be settled in either cash or Rolls-Royce Holdings plc shares.
If the consideration is in shares, a 3% premium is applied.
Interest is accrued on the outstanding balance based on LIBOR 1.5%.
The fair value of the previous joint venture investment in ITP Aero of 204m was re-measured using a discounted cash flow methodology using judgement in estimating future cash flows, assessing the discount rate and establishing a non-controlling interest discount.
This gave rise to a gain of 553m.
Given the proximity of the acquisition to the year end, and as permitted by IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the fair value of acquired identifiable assets and liabilities have been presented on a provisional basis.
Fair values were determined on the basis of an initial assessment performed by an independent professional expert prior to the acquisition date.
Measurement techniques and estimation of future cash flows have been used to assess the value of the intangible assets at the date of acquisition.
The total fair value of acquired identifiable assets and liabilities is 1,650m of which a significant value was allocated to intangible assets.
The valuation indicated a bargain purchase of 245m, which has been recognised in the income statement.
The acquisition of the controlling interest in ITP Aero on 19 December 2017 did not have a significant impact on the Groups underlying results for the year.
