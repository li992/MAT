DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Accounting Policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements.
a Basis of preparation The Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland FRS 102.
The Company has adopted the following disclosure exemptions permitted by FRS 102 1.12 b, c and e : The requirement to present a statement of cash flows: the requirement to disclose the terms and conditions of long term debt: and the requirement to disclose key management personnel compensation in total.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the Company has not been presented.
The Companys loss for the year after taxation was 3,230,000 2016 1,685,000. b Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings comprise shares in, and loans to, those undertakings and are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
c Financial instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all financial liabilities.
Basic financial instruments i Trade and other creditors Trade and other creditors are recognised initially at transaction price less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
If the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, for example if payment is deferred beyond normal business terms, then it is measured at the present value of future payments discounted at a market rate for a similar debt instrument.
ii Loans and borrowings Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently recorded at amortised cost.
Transaction costs are deducted from the fair value at recognition and any differences between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk arising from operational and financing activities.
As these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, they are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised, and subsequently recorded, at fair value.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would recover or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the credit worthiness of the swap Page 80 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 counterparties.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
d Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided on timing differences which arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is not recognised on permanent differences arising because certain types of income or expenses are non-taxable or are disallowable for tax or because certain tax charges or allowances are greater or smaller than the corresponding income or expense.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate that is expected to apply to the reversal of the related difference, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
e Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction and gains and losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.

Profit and Loss Reserve Some years ago, the Company sold its shareholdings in certain subsidiary undertakings to intermediate holding companies.
As a result of that transaction, the parent company transferred 645.1 million of revaluation gains relating to these investments to the profit and loss reserve.
As the transfer of these revaluation gains arose as a result of a sale of assets within the Group, it is unlikely that the Company will seek to treat the profit and loss reserve thus arising as distributable.
Under the articles of association of certain Group investment undertakings, realised capital surpluses are not available for distribution as dividends.
