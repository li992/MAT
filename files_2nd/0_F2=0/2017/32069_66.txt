The permanent contribution to capital relates to a cash payment of 50,000 to the Company on 8 February 2007 under a deed of capital contribution.
The capital redemption reserve arose on the redemption of the Company's redeemable preference shares of 10p each at par on 2 March 2007.
The own shares and treasury reserves represent the cost of shares in Sports Direct International plc purchased in the market and held by Sports Direct International plc Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy options under the Group's share scheme.
The Company announced on 28 April 2017 that it has instructed Citigroup Global Markets Limited in relation to an irrevocable nondiscretionary share buyback programme to purchase the Companys shares during the closed period commencing on 30 April 2017 and ending on 20 July 2017.
In line with IAS32 the Company recognised the full redemption amount of 163.5m which is considered to be immaterially different to the present value at year end.
If the contract expires without full delivery, the amount of the financial liability attributable to the undelivered shares is reclassified to equity reversing the original recognition.
As at 18 July 2017, 94.1m of shares have been repurchased under the closed period share buyback programme.
