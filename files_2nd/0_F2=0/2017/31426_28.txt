Section 5: Capital structure and financial policy continued 5.3 Borrowings continued $365m bridge facility due 2018 The Group entered into a $365m bridge facility agreement in December 2016 to part fund the acquisition of Allworld Exhibitions.
The bridge was fully drawn and incurred interest at US LIBOR plus 0.7% until 19 June 2017 when the Group repaid the facility in full using the US Private Placement Loan Note proceeds.
The facility was cancelled on 19 June 2017.
$350m 5.75% dollar bonds due 2020 The Group issued $350m fixed rate dollar bonds at 98.295% of par.
The bonds pay a 5.75% coupon on a semi annual basis on 3 May and 3 November until maturity in 2020.
The effective interest rate is 6.17%.
The coupon of 5.75% would be increased in the event the Groups long term credit rating was to be reduced below investment grade by either Standard and Poors below BBBor Moodys below Baa3.
The increase to the coupon would be 0.25% per ratings notch per agency.
The Group entered into interest rate swaps for $100m whereby it receives 5.75% and pays a floating rate of US LIBOR plus 2.65% semi-annually.
400m syndicated revolving credit facility due 2022 On 7 April 2017, the Group extended the term of the variable rate multi-currency facility by one year to mature on 22 April 2022.
The 400m facility bears interest of LIBOR plus 0.6% whilst the Groups rating is BBBBaa3 UBMs current ratings.
The future interest rate is dependent on the credit rating of the Group: the rate will be revised to LIBOR plus 0.9% for any downgrade to BB Ba1: LIBOR plus 1.3% for downgrade to BB Ba2 or lower: LIBOR plus 0.5% for an upgrade to BBB Baa2: or LIBOR plus 0.4% for an upgrade to BBB Baa1 or higher.
In addition, when 33% or less of the facility is utilised, an additional fee of 0.1% on the total amount drawn is payable: this increases to 0.2% when in excess of 33% of the facility is utilised and increases to 0.3% when in excess of 66% of the facility is utilised.
Drawings under the facility at 31 December 2017 amount to 57.5m.
The undrawn portion of this facility is 342.5m.
The Group paid arrangement fees of 2.0m in respect of the 400m syndicated revolving credit facility.
These fees are allocated to the income statement over the term of the facility using the effective interest method.
$370m US Private Placement Loan Notes To replace the $365m bridge facility, $370m US Private Placement Loan Notes were issued on 15 June 2017 in three tranches: $45m of 5 year notes with a floating rate coupon of US LIBOR plus 1.65%, $175m of 7 year notes with a fixed rate coupon of 4.45% and $150m of 10 year notes with a fixed rate coupon of 4.68%.
Interest is paid semi-annually in arrears.
The Group entered into a 7 year interest rate swap for $78m, whereby it receives a fixed rate of 4.45% and pays a floating rate of US LIBOR plus 2.09% semiannually in arrears, commencing 15 June 2017.
5.4 Net financing expense This note details the interest income generated on the Groups financial assets and the interest expense incurred on borrowings and other financial assets and liabilities.
In reporting adjusted earnings the Group adjusts net financing income expense to exclude foreign exchange gains losses on forward contracts, ineffectiveness on hedges, other fair value movements and exceptional items.
Foreign exchange and fair value movements reflect the value of these instruments at a point in time, resulting in a variable impact on profit and loss.
Accounting policy Interest expense and interest income are calculated under the effective interest method.
As no interest is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to prepare for its intended use or, all interest expense is recognised as finance expense when incurred.

The ineffective portion on fair value hedges in 2016 represented the difference between the fair value movement of the interest rate swaps designated as hedge instruments and the fair value movement of the hedged portions of the $350m 5.75% dollar bonds and the 250m 6.5% sterling bonds which matured in November 2016.
The exceptional financing income on the fair value movement on put options over non-controlling interests is a result of a downward revision of future performance in the related businesses using updated forecast financial information.
5.5 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Accounting policy Hedging activities The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge risks and accounts for them as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction: or as a hedge of net investment in foreign operations.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine whether they have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated.
For fair value hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any fair value gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted for the change in the fair value of the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2017 129 Section 5: Capital structure and financial policy continued 5.5 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities continued Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of forecast transactions are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified into profit or loss and out of other comprehensive income in the same period in which the hedged firm commitments or forecast transactions are recognised in profit or loss.
Foreign currency borrowings and forward exchange contracts are used as net investment hedges.
All foreign exchange gains or losses arising on translation of net investments are recognised in other comprehensive income and included in cumulative translation differences.
Foreign currency borrowings used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation are measured using the exchange rate at the reporting date.
The resulting gains or losses are taken to other comprehensive income to the extent that they are effective, with any ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss.
Forward exchange contracts used to hedge a net investment hedge are measured at fair value at the reporting date.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point, any cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income are retained until the forecast transaction occurs, when they are transferred to profit or loss.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in profit or loss.

This hedge was assessed to be highly effective during the year with the small ineffective portion of the hedging contracts transferred to financing expense Note 5.4.

Under this swap, the Group receives a rate of 4.45% and pays a floating rate of US LIBOR plus 2.09% semiannually in arrears.
Interest rate swaps at 31 December 2017 and 2016 also relate to the floating rate swaps for $100m matched against $100m of the $350m 5.75% dollar bonds due 2020.
Under these swaps, the Group received 5.75% to match the bond coupons and pays six month US LIBOR plus an average of 2.65%.
The interest rate swaps are used to increase the Groups exposure to interest rates to maintain a balance of fixed and floating interest rate cost.
These hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 31 December 2017 and 2016 with the small ineffective portions of the hedging contracts included in financing income.
5.6 Fair values and fair value hierarchy Valuation techniques Valuation techniques use observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
The fair values of interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts are measured using discounted cash flows.
Future cash flows are based on forward interest exchange rates from observable yield curves forward exchange rates at the end of the reporting period and contract interest forward rates, discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk of the counterparties.
The fair value portion of the $350m 5.75% dollar bonds due 2020 and the $370m US Private Placement Loan Notes have been measured at the present value of future cash flows discounted using market rates of interest.
"Part of the consideration received in respect of the sale of PRN in 2016 was Class A Limited Partnership Units partnership units in GTCR Canyon Holdings Canyon, L. P, ""Canyon"", the parent of the PRN purchaser, Cision."
These partnership units had a par value of $40m and an interest coupon of 8%.
On 29 June 2017, Cision merged with Capitol Acquisition Holding Company Ltd, who is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
As a result of the merger, Canyon owns 68% of the ordinary shares of the listed entity, now called Cision Ltd.
The partnership units in Canyon were valued at $43.4m representing the par value and accrued interest to 29 June 2017.
The investment continues to be reported as an available-for-sale asset on the balance sheet.
At 31 December 2017, the partnership units are valued at $51.5m.
The partnership units are measured at fair value based on the quoted share price of Cision Ltd, with movements in fair value taken to other comprehensive income.
The fair values of put options over non-controlling interests including exercise price and contingent and deferred consideration on acquisitions are measured using discounted cash flows models with inputs derived from the projected financial performance in relation to the specific contingent consideration criteria for each acquisition, as no observable market data is available.
The fair values are most sensitive to the projected financial performance of each acquisition: management makes a best estimate of these projections at each financial reporting date and regularly assesses a range of reasonably possible alternatives for those inputs and determines their impact on the total fair value.
An increase of 20% to the projected financial performance used in the put option measurements would increase the aggregate liability by 2.2m.
The fair value of the contingent and deferred consideration on acquisitions is not significantly sensitive to a reasonable change in the forecast performance.
The potential undiscounted amount for all future payments that the Group could be required to make under the contingent consideration arrangements for all acquisitions is 23.3m.

Fair value hierarchy The fair value measurements at the reporting date are classified according to the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
The level in the hierarchy within which the fair value is categorised is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
Level 1: quo ted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: i nputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly e. g. prices or indirectly e. g. derived from prices.
Level 3: i nputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data.
For financial assets and financial liabilities that are recognised at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period or the date when an event or change in circumstances caused the transfer.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
