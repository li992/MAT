Directors responsibilities The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts and the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent Company financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law they are required to prepare both the Group and the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant and prudent: state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU: assess the Group and Parent Companys ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and the Parent Companys transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Parent Company and enable them to ensure that their financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulations.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and Parent Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors and Corporate Governance Report, Directors Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Companys website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
