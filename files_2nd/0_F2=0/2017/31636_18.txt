Strategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements | Additional Information Notes For the 52 weeks ended 30 September 2017 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation These consolidated fnancial statements for the 52 weeks ended 30 September 2017 2016: 52 weeks ended 1 October 2016 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC and Standing Interpretations Committee interpretations adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The fnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modifed by the revaluation of certain items, principally land and buildings, derivative fnancial instruments, retirement benefts and share-based payments.
In the prior period provisions for other liabilities and charges were originally presented wholly within non-current liabilities in the balance sheet.
Amounts due within one year have now been represented within current liabilities to better refect the timing of the amounts falling due and to be consistent with the current period presentation.
In the prior period the net interest on the net defned beneft asset liability was presented within underlying items.
This has now been represented within non-underlying items to better refect the nature of this item and to be consistent with the current period presentation.
At the time of approving the fnancial statements, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the fnancial statements.
New standards and interpretations The International Accounting Standards Board IASB and IFRS IC have issued the following new or revised standards and interpretations with an effective date for fnancial periods beginning on or after the dates disclosed below.
These standards and interpretations have not yet been adopted by the Group.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment Amendments to clarify the classifcation and measurement of share-based payment transactions 1 January 2018 IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts Amendments regarding the interaction of IFRS 4 and IFRS 9 1 January 2018 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments New accounting standard 1 January 2018 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements Amendments regarding the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture Date deferred IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers New accounting standard 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases New accounting standard 1 January 2019 IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts New accounting standard 1 January 2021 IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows Amendments as a result of the disclosure initiative 1 January 2017 IAS 12 Income Taxes Amendments regarding the recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses 1 January 2017 IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Amendments regarding the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture Date deferred Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures Amendments to IAS 28 1 January 2019 IAS 40 Investment Property Amendments to clarify transfers of property to, or from, investment property 1 January 2018 IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration 1 January 2018 The IASB have also issued a number of minor amendments to standards as part of their Annual Improvements to IFRS.
The Directors are considering the impact of the adoption of the above new standards, interpretations and amendments on the Group.
In particular, the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases is expected to have a signifcant impact on both the Groups balance sheet and income statement.
For leases where it is the lessee the Group will be required to recognise assets and liabilities in the balance sheet in the majority of cases and recognise depreciation and fnance costs in the income statement.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated fnancial statements incorporate the fnancial statements of Marstons PLC and all of its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of new subsidiary undertakings are included in the Group accounts from the date on which control transferred to the Group or, in the case of disposals, up to the effective date of disposal.
Transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
The Group has applied the purchase method in accounting for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the consideration paid and deferred.
Identifable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Groups share of the identifable net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The consolidated fnancial statements incorporate the results of Marstons Issuer PLC and its parent company, Marstons Issuer Parent Limited.
Marstons Issuer PLC was set up with the sole purpose of issuing debt secured on assets owned by the Group.
Wilmington Trust SP Services London Limited holds the shares of Marstons Issuer Parent Limited under a declaration of trust for charitable purposes.
The rights provided to the Group through the securitisation give the Group power over these companies and the ability to use that power to affect its exposure to variable returns from them.
As such the Directors of Marstons PLC consider that these companies are controlled by the Group, as defned in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, and hence for the purpose of the consolidated fnancial statements they have been treated as subsidiary undertakings.
Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 79 Notes continued For the 52 weeks ended 30 September 2017 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Revenue and other operating income Revenue represents the value of goods principally drink and food and services principally accommodation, gaming machines and third party brewing, packaging and distribution supplied to customers, and rent receivable from licensed properties.
Revenue from drink, food, accommodation, brewing, packaging and distribution is recognised at the point at which the goods or services are provided.
Gaming machine income is recognised as earned.
Rental income is recognised in the period to which it relates.
Revenue is recorded net of discounts, intra group transactions, VAT and excise duty relating to the brewing and packaging of certain products.
It is considered that, in respect of its franchised arrangements, the Group has exposure to the signifcant risks and rewards associated with the sale of goods and rendering of services and as such the total income from franchised pubs i. e. from gaming machines, accommodation and the sale of food and drink is included within the Groups revenue.
Other operating income mainly comprises rent receivable from unlicensed properties, which is recognised in the period to which it relates.
Operating segments For segment reporting purposes the Group is considered to have fve distinguishable operating segments, being Destination and Premium, Taverns, Leased, Brewing and Group Services.
This mirrors the Groups internal reporting structure, and refects the different distribution channels, customer profles and nature of products and services provided within each segment.
An element of Group Services costs is allocated to each of the trading segments.
The operating segments set out in note 2 are consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker.
For the purposes of IFRS 8 Operating Segments the chief operating decision maker has been identifed as the Executive Directors.
Acquired businesses are treated as separate reporting segments, where material, until they have been fully integrated with the Groups operating segments.
Non-underlying items In order to illustrate the underlying trading performance of the Group, presentation has been made of performance measures excluding those items which it is considered would distort the comparability of the Groups results.
These non-underlying items comprise exceptional items and other adjusting items.
Exceptional items are defned as those items that, by virtue of their nature, size or expected frequency, warrant separate additional disclosure in the fnancial statements in order to fully understand the underlying performance of the Group.
As management of the freehold and leasehold property estate is an essential and signifcant area of the business, the threshold for classifcation of property related items as exceptional is higher than other items.
Other adjusting items comprise the revenue and expenses in respect of the ongoing management of the remainder of the portfolio of pubs disposed of in the period ended 4 October 2014.
The pubs subject to the management agreement no longer form part of the Groups core activities and the Group does not have the ability to make strategic decisions in respect of them.
As such it is considered appropriate to exclude the results of these pubs from the Groups underlying results.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.
Intangible assets arising on an acquisition are recognised separately from goodwill if the fair value of these assets can be identifed separately and measured reliably.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset.
Where the useful life of the asset is considered to be indefnite no annual amortisation is provided but the asset is subject to annual impairment reviews.
Impairment reviews are carried out more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be impaired.
Any impairment of carrying value is charged to the income statement.
The useful lives of the Groups intangible assets are: Acquired brands Indefnite Lease premiums Life of the lease Computer software 3 to 15 years Development costs 10 years Research and development expenditure All expenditure on the research phase of an internal project is expensed as incurred.
Development costs are recognised as an intangible asset when the following conditions are met: It is technically feasible to complete the intangible asset so that it will be available for use: Management intends to complete the asset and use or sell it: There is an ability to use or sell the asset: It can be demonstrated how the asset will generate probable future economic benefts: Adequate technical, fnancial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset are available: and The expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be reliably measured.
Other development expenditure that does not meet these criteria is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
80 | Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements | Additional Information 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifable net assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is not amortised but instead is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units that are consistent with the Groups operating segments.
Property, plant and equipment Freehold and leasehold properties are initially stated at cost and subsequently at valuation.
Plant and machinery and fxtures, fttings, tools and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis to provide for the cost of the assets less their residual values over their useful lives.
Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to their residual values over 50 years.
Short leasehold properties are depreciated over the life of the lease.
Plant and machinery and fxtures, fttings, tools and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from 3 to 15 years.
Own labour and interest costs directly attributable to capital projects are capitalised.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Properties are revalued by qualifed valuers on a suffciently regular basis using open market value so that the carrying value of an asset does not differ signifcantly from its fair value at the balance sheet date.
Substantially all of the Groups properties have been externally valued in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Red Book.
These valuations are performed directly by reference to observable prices in an active market or recent market transactions on arms length terms.
Internal valuations are performed on the same basis.
The estate is reviewed for indication of impairment at each reporting date, using a process focusing on areas of risk and business performance throughout the portfolio to identify any exposure.
Impairment losses are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that a previous gain has been recorded, and thereafter to the income statement.
Surpluses on revaluation are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except to the extent that they reverse previously charged impairment losses, in which case the reversal is recorded in the income statement.
Disposals of property, plant and equipment Proft loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment represents net sale proceeds less the carrying value of the assets.
Any element of the revaluation reserve relating to the property disposed of is transferred to retained earnings at the date of sale.
Impairment If there are indications of impairment or reversal of impairment, an assessment is made of the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of assets, including goodwill.
The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
Where there is an indication that any previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased, a reversal of the loss is made if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amounts since the last impairment loss was recognised.
The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount only up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods.
The reversal is recognised in the income statement unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount.
The reversal of an impairment loss on a revalued asset is recognised in other comprehensive income and increases the revaluation surplus for that asset.
However, to the extent that an impairment loss on the same revalued asset was previously recognised in the income statement, the reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
The depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets revised carrying value, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
There is no reversal of impairment losses relating to goodwill.
Acquired brands are reviewed for impairment on a portfolio basis.
Leases Leases are classifed as fnance leases if the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classifed as operating leases.
The cost of assets held under fnance leases is included within property, plant and equipment and depreciation is charged in accordance with the accounting policy for each class of asset concerned.
The corresponding capital obligations under these leases are shown as liabilities.
The fnance charge element of rentals is charged to the income statement and classifed within fnance costs as incurred.
Rental costs under operating leases, including lease incentives, are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Similarly, income receivable under operating leases is credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Obligations arising from sale and leaseback arrangements with repurchase options that do not fall within the scope of IAS 17 Leases are classifed as other lease related borrowings and accounted for in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 81 Notes continued For the 52 weeks ended 30 September 2017 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Raw materials are valued on a frst in, frst out basis, with the exception of hops which are valued at average cost.
Finished goods and work in progress include direct materials, labour and a proportion of attributable overheads.
Assets held for sale Assets, typically properties and related fxtures and fttings, are categorised as held for sale when the value of the asset will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than continuing use.
This condition is met when the sale is highly probable, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and is being actively marketed.
In addition, the Group must be committed to the sale and completion should be expected to occur within one year from the date of classifcation.
Assets held for sale are valued at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.
Financial instruments The Group classifes its fnancial assets in one of the following two categories: at fair value through proft or loss and loans and receivables.
The Group classifes its fnancial liabilities in one of the following two categories: at fair value through proft or loss and other fnancial liabilities.
The classifcation depends on the purpose for which the fnancial instruments were acquired.
Management determines the classifcation of the Groups fnancial instruments at initial recognition.
Financial instruments at fair value through proft or loss Derivatives are categorised as fnancial instruments at fair value through proft or loss unless they are designated as part of a hedging relationship.
The Group holds no other fnancial instruments at fair value through proft or loss.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative fnancial assets with fxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade receivables, other receivables, trade loans, other cash deposits and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Other fnancial liabilities Non-derivative fnancial liabilities are classifed as other fnancial liabilities.
The Groups other fnancial liabilities comprise borrowings, trade payables and other payables.
Other fnancial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash fows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
The Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a fnancial asset is impaired at each balance sheet date.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in fnancial instruments shall be undertaken.
Derivative fnancial instruments The only derivative fnancial instruments that the Group enters into are interest rate swaps.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate risk arising from the Groups operations and its sources of fnance.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash fow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within exceptional fnance income or costs.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives which are not designated as part of a hedging relationship are presented in the income statement within exceptional fnance income or costs in the period in which they arise.
The fair value of a hedging derivative is classifed as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
The fair values of derivatives which are not designated as part of a hedging relationship are classifed as current assets or liabilities.
Accrued interest is recognised separately in current assets or liabilities as appropriate.
At the inception of a hedging transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash fows of hedged items.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement within exceptional fnance income or costs.
Amounts that have been recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of cash fow hedges are reclassifed from equity to proft or loss as a reclassifcation adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast cash fow affects proft or loss.
82 | Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements | Additional Information 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Trade receivables and other receivables Trade receivables and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables and other receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Signifcant fnancial diffculties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or fnancial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade or other receivable is impaired.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the estimated future cash fows.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within other net operating charges.
When a trade or other receivable is uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade or other receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against other net operating charges in the income statement.
Trade loans In common with other major brewers, the Group makes trade loans to publicans who purchase the Groups beer.
These trade loans are classifed as other non-current assets in the balance sheet and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost less provision for impairment.
Signifcant trade loans are secured against the property of the loan recipient.
Other cash deposits Cash held on deposit with banks with a maturity of more than three months at the date of acquisition is classifed within other cash deposits.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits on call with banks.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
For the purpose of the cash fow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defned above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Preference shares are classifed as liabilities.
The dividends on these preference shares are recognised in the income statement as fnance costs.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, except for interest costs incurred on the fnancing of major projects, which are capitalised until the time that the projects are available for use.
Trade payables and other payables Trade payables and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Employee benefts Pension costs for the Groups defned beneft pension plan are determined by the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial calculations being carried out at each period end date.
Costs are recognised in the income statement within operating expenses and net fnance costs.
The current service cost, past service cost and gains or losses arising from settlements are included within operating expenses.
The net interest on the net defned beneft asset liability is included within exceptional fnance costs income and the administrative expenses paid from plan assets are included within fnance costs.
Actuarial gains or losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of comprehensive income.
The return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in the net interest on the net defned beneft asset liability, is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
The asset liability recognised in the balance sheet for the defned beneft pension plan is the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defned beneft obligation.
Where the fair value of plan assets exceeds the present value of the defned beneft obligation, the Group recognises an asset at the lower of the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defned beneft obligation, and the present value of any economic benefts available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
In the event that contributions payable under a minimum funding requirement are not available as a refund or reduction in future contributions after they are paid into the plan, a liability would be recognised to this extent when the obligation arises.
Pension costs for the Groups defned contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Post-retirement medical benefts are accounted for in an identical way to the Groups defned beneft pension plan.
Key management personnel Key management personnel are those who have authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group.
In the case of Marstons PLC, the Directors of the Group are considered to be the only key management personnel.
Current and deferred tax The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date, and which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future.
Differences are defned as the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proft will be available against which the assets can be utilised.
Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 83 Notes continued For the 52 weeks ended 30 September 2017 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Provisions Provisions are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outfow of economic benefts will be required to settle the obligation.
When valuations of leasehold properties based on future estimated income streams give rise to a defcit as a result of onerous lease conditions they are recognised as provisions.
These provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that refects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifc to the obligation.
The key assumptions used in the discounted cash fow calculations are the discount and infation rates and the market rents, vacant periods and future trading income of the properties.
Other contractual property costs are also recorded as provisions as appropriate.
Share-based payments The fair value of share-based remuneration at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award.
The charge to the income statement takes account of the estimated number of shares that will vest.
Non-vesting conditions are taken into account when determining the fair value of the Groups share-based payments, and all cancellations of share-based payments, whether by the Group or by employees, are accounted for in an identical manner with any costs unrecognised at the date of cancellation being immediately accelerated.
Own shares Own shares comprise treasury shares, and shares held on trust for employee share schemes, which are used for the issuing of shares to applicable employees.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders equity.
Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds and the original cost being taken to equity.
No income or expense is recognised in the performance statements on own share transactions.
Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board but unpaid at the period end are recognised in the fnancial statements when they have been approved by the shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Transactions and balance sheet items in a foreign currency Transactions in a foreign currency are translated to sterling using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Monetary receivables and payables are remeasured at closing day rates at each balance sheet date.
Exchange gains or losses that arise from such remeasurement and on settlement of the transaction are recognised in the income statement.
Translation differences for non-monetary assets valued at fair value through proft or loss are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.
Gains or losses on disposal of non-monetary assets are recognised in the income statement.
Key assumptions and signifcant judgements IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The Groups key assumptions and signifcant judgements are in respect of property, plant and equipment, retirement benefts, lease classifcation, non-underlying items, impairment, fnancial instruments and property lease provisions.
Details of these assumptions and judgements are provided in the relevant accounting policy and detailed note to the fnancial statements as set out below.
The following judgements apart from those involving estimates have had the most signifcant effect on amounts recognised in the fnancial statements.
Property, plant and equipment Valuation of properties see accounting policy.
Retirement benefts Recognition of a retirement beneft surplus see accounting policy.
Lease classifcation Judgements in respect of whether a lease has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, in particular whether the present value of the minimum lease payments amounts to at least substantially all of the fair value of the leased asset and whether the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the asset see accounting policy.
Non-underlying items Determination of items to be classed as non-underlying see accounting policy.
The following estimates and assumptions have a signifcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
Property, plant and equipment Assets useful lives and residual values see accounting policy.
84 | Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements | Additional Information 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Impairment Assumptions made in the value in use calculation, in particular the pre-tax discount rate applied to cash fow projections and the growth rate used to extrapolate projected cash fows beyond one year budgets notes 10 and 11.

Reorganisation, relocation and integration costs During the current period the Group incurred reorganisation and integration costs of 4.6 million as a result of the acquisition of the beer business of Charles Wells.
A head offce restructuring exercise was also undertaken in the current period incurring costs of 0.9 million.
During the prior period the redevelopment of the Groups head offce building in Wolverhampton was completed along with a reorganisation of certain head offce functions.
Costs of 0.5 million were incurred in the prior period in respect of temporarily relocating to alternative premises nearby during the period of redevelopment and in undertaking the reorganisation.
The Group also incurred reorganisation and integration costs of 3.3 million in the prior period as a result of the acquisition of the trading operations of Daniel Thwaites PLCs beer division in the period ended 3 October 2015.
Portfolio disposal of pubs During the period ended 4 October 2014 the Group disposed of a portfolio of 202 pubs and subsequently entered into a four year lease and fve year management agreement in respect thereof.
A number of the pubs have since been removed from these arrangements by the purchaser.
During the current period the Group has entered into new 15 year leases in respect of 22 of the properties and these have also been removed from the management agreement.
The Group no longer has strategic control of the pubs still subject to the management agreement and they do not form part of its core activities.
As such the results in respect of the ongoing operation and management of these pubs post disposal have been classifed as a non-underlying item, comprised as follows: 2017 2016 m m Revenue 19.1 31.5 Operating expenses 19.3 31.4 0.2 0.1 Net interest on net defned beneft asset liability The net interest on the net defned beneft asset liability in respect of the Groups defned beneft pension plan was a charge of 0.7 million 2016: credit of 0.7 million note 26.
Write-off of unamortised fnance costs During the current period the Group entered into a new bank facility.
As such the unamortised fnance costs relating to the previous facility have been written off.
Movement in fair value of interest rate swaps The Groups interest rate swaps are revalued to fair value at each balance sheet date.
The movement in fair value of interest rate swaps which are not designated as part of a hedging relationship, and the ineffective portion of the movement in fair value of interest rate swaps which are accounted for as hedging instruments are both recognised in the income statement.
The net gain of 6.4 million 2016: loss of 8.4 million is shown as an exceptional item.

The deferred tax charge relating to the above non-underlying items amounts to 0.9 million 2016: credit of 1.4 million.
In addition, there is a non-underlying deferred tax credit of nil 2016: 2.4 million in relation to the change in corporation tax rate note 7.
During the prior period the Group agreed the tax treatment of certain items with HM Revenue & Customs.
The tax credit of 4.1 million in respect of the additional tax relief claimed for previous periods was classifed as a non-underlying item along with the associated advisory fees of 0.5 million.
Prior period non-underlying items During the period ended 5 October 2013 the Group commenced a restructuring of its pub estate and operating segments.
Costs in respect of this restructuring were incurred in the prior period.
During the prior period the Group sold a parcel of surplus land for residential development for 9.5 million realising a proft of 1.5 million on disposal.

As such the Groups profts for the current period have been taxed at an effective rate of 19.5%.
The March 2016 Budget announced that the standard rate of corporation tax would change from 19% to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.
This change was substantively enacted in the Finance Act 2016 in September 2016.
As such a nonunderlying deferred tax credit of 2.4 million was recognised in the income statement in the prior period.
Finance Bill 2017-19 includes draft legislation to restrict the deductibility of net interest costs from 1 April 2017.
As the proposed changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, their effects are not included in these fnancial statements.
If the legislation had been substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, it is likely that the overall effect on these fnancial statements would not have been material.

9 EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the proft attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding treasury shares and those held on trust for employee share schemes.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the weighted average market price of the Companys shares during the period.
Underlying earnings per share fgures are presented to exclude the effect of exceptional and other adjusting items.
The Directors consider that the supplementary fgures are a useful indicator of performance.

Recoverable amounts are determined based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill has been allocated to operating segments based on the extent to which the benefts of acquisitions fow to that segment, as follows: 2017 2016 m m Destination and Premium 87.5 87.5 Taverns 86.6 86.6 Leased 26.5 26.5 Brewing 29.7 26.9 230.3 227.5 The key assumptions used in determining value in use are the pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash fow projections of 6% 2016: 6% and the growth rate used to extrapolate the projected cash fows beyond the one year budgets of 2% 2016: 2% in line with an expected long-term growth rate which is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
Risk factors are considered to be similar in each of the Groups operating segments.
Other commercial assumptions relate to market growth, market share and net selling prices.
These assumptions are based on historic trends adjusted for management estimates of future prospects.
These estimates take account of economic forecasts, marketing plans, political factors and assessments of competitors strategy.
The discount rate used is the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted to refect market conditions.
The above impairment tests demonstrated that the Group had substantial levels of headroom and as such no impairment of goodwill was required in the current or prior period.

The recoverable amount of each brand is determined based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
The fair value of each brand is determined by applying an appropriate earnings multiple to the anticipated future income generated by that brand.
The key assumptions used in determining the value in use of each brand are a pre-tax discount rate of 6% 2016: 6% and a long-term growth rate used to extrapolate cash fows beyond the cash fow projection period of one year of 2% 2016: 2% in line with an expected long-term growth rate which is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
These assumptions are based on historic trends adjusted for management estimates of future prospects, and take account of economic forecasts, marketing plans, political factors and assessments of competitors strategy.
The above impairment tests demonstrated that the Group had suffcient levels of headroom and as such no impairment of acquired brands was required in the current or prior period.

Revaluation impairment During the current and prior period various properties were reviewed for impairment and or material changes in value.
These valuation adjustments were recognised in the revaluation reserve or the income statement as appropriate.
The impact of the revaluations impairments described above is as follows: 2017 2016 m m Income statement: Impairment 3.8 3.8 Revaluation reserve: Unrealised revaluation surplus 2.3 2.0 Reversal of past revaluation surplus 0.8 1.5 2.0 Net decrease increase in shareholders equity property, plant and equipment 2.3 2.0 Fair value of land and buildings IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that refects the signifcance of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels: Level 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The table below shows the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurements of land and buildings have been categorised: 2017 2016 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Recurring fair value measurements m m m m m m m m Land and buildings: Specialised brewery properties 45.5 45.5 25.3 25.3 Other land and buildings 2,100.6 2,100.6 1,989.0 1,989.0 2,100.6 45.5 2,146.1 1,989.0 25.3 2,014.3 There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 fair value measurements during the current or prior period.
The Level 2 fair values of land and buildings have been obtained using a market approach, primarily using earnings multiples derived from prices in observed transactions involving comparable businesses.
Whilst there are two inputs to the fair value measurement of the public house assets, being the fair maintainable trade and the multiplier applied, it is considered that the most signifcant input relates to the multiplier which, being indirectly observable, is a Level 2 input.
Thus it has been concluded that since the most signifcant infuence on the valuation is observable indirectly Level 2 is the most appropriate categorisation for these fair value measurements.
The Level 3 fair values of the specialised brewery properties have been obtained using a cost approach.
These breweries represent properties that are rarely, if ever, sold in the market, except by way of a sale of the business of which they are part, due to the uniqueness arising from their specialised nature, design and confguration.
As such the valuation of these properties has been performed using the depreciated replacement cost approach, which values the properties at the current cost of replacing them with their modern equivalents less deductions for physical deterioration and all relevant forms of obsolescence and optimisation.
The signifcant unobservable inputs to the Level 3 fair value measurements are: Sensitivity of fair value to unobservable inputs Current cost of modern equivalent asset The higher the cost the higher the fair value Amount of adjustment for physical deterioration obsolescence The higher the adjustment the lower the fair value 94 | Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements | Additional Information 12 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CONTINUED 2017 2016 Level 3 recurring fair value measurements m m At beginning of the period 25.3 25.0 Additions 0.8 0.6 Acquisitions 19.6 Depreciation charge for the period 0.2 0.3 At end of the period 45.5 25.3 The Groups properties are revalued by external independent qualifed valuers at least once in each rolling three year period.
The last external valuation of the Groups freehold and leasehold properties was performed as at 1 February 2015.
The Group has an internal team of qualifed valuers and at each reporting date the estate is reviewed for any indication of signifcant changes in value.
Where this is the case internal valuations are performed on a basis consistent with those performed externally.

A signifcant proportion of this balance is greater than 60 days old.
All of the Groups trade receivables are denominated in pounds sterling.
Included within trade receivables are balances which are past due at the balance sheet date but have not been provided for, as these are considered to be recoverable.
These balances relate to established customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
Trade receivables that are less than three months past due are not generally considered impaired unless there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.

20 SECURITISED DEBT On 9 August 2005 805.0 million of secured loan notes were issued in connection with the securitisation of 1,592 of the Groups pubs held in Marstons Pubs Limited.
On 22 November 2007, a further 330.0 million of secured loan notes tranches A4 and AB1 were issued in connection with the securitisation of an additional 437 of the Groups pubs, also held in Marstons Pubs Limited.
The loan notes are secured over the properties and their future income streams and were issued by Marstons Issuer PLC, a special purpose entity.
On 15 January 2014 all of the AB1 notes were repurchased by the Group at par and immediately cancelled.
During the period ended 30 September 2017, 32 2016: 49 of the securitised pubs were sold to third parties, one pub 2016: none was sold to other members of the Group and no pubs 2016: 4 were acquired from third parties.
The carrying amount of the securitised pubs at 30 September 2017 was 1,269.8 million 2016: 1,251.8 million.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Marstons Pubs Limited.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on the ability to move cash to other companies within the Group.

IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that refects the signifcance of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels: Level 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
The table below shows the level in the fair value hierarchy into which fair value measurements have been categorised: 2017 2016 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Liabilities as per the balance sheet m m m m m m m m Derivative fnancial instruments 187.9 187.9 240.7 240.7 100 | Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements | Additional Information 25 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 fair value measurements during the current or prior period.
The Level 2 fair values of derivative fnancial instruments have been obtained using a market approach and refect the estimated amount the Group would expect to pay or receive on termination of the instruments.
The Group utilises valuations from counterparties who use a variety of assumptions based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The fair values of all non-derivative fnancial instruments are equal to their book values, with the exception of borrowings note 19.
The carrying amount less impairment provision of trade receivables, other receivables and trade loans, and the carrying amount of trade payables and other payables, are assumed to approximate their fair values.
Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of fnancial risks: market risk including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, counterparty risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of fnancial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups fnancial performance.
The Group uses derivative fnancial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury identifes, evaluates and hedges fnancial risks.
The Board provides principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specifc areas, such as interest rate risk, credit risk, investment of excess liquidity and use of derivative and non-derivative fnancial instruments.
Interest rate risk: The Groups income and operating cash fows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates, and as such the Groups interest rate risk arises from its borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash fow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fxed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis.
Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration refnancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative fnancing and hedging.
Based on these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on the income statement of a defned interest rate shift.
The scenarios are run only for liabilities that represent the major interest-bearing positions.
The Group manages its cash fow interest rate risk by using foating-to-fxed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from foating rates to fxed rates.
Generally, the Group raises borrowings at foating rates and often swaps them into fxed rates that are lower than those available if the Group borrowed at fxed rates directly.
Under the interest rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specifed intervals, the difference between fxed contract and foating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher lower during the period ended 30 September 2017, with all other variables held constant, post-tax proft for the period would have been 0.7 million 2016: 0.6 million lower higher as a result of higher lower interest expense.
Interest rate swaps designated as part of a hedging arrangement The Group uses interest rate swaps to fx the interest rate payable on the foating rate tranches of its securitised debt note 20.
The notional principal amounts of these interest rate swap contracts at 30 September 2017 totalled 242.1 million 2016: 270.5 million.
These interest rate swaps, including borrowing margins, fx interest at 6.2% and 6.1%.
The movement in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income in the period was a gain of 46.4 million 2016: loss of 39.6 million.
The movement in fair value recognised in the income statement in the period was a loss of 2.9 million 2016: gain of 3.9 million.
Interest rate swaps not designated as part of a hedging arrangement On 22 March 2012 the Group entered into two forward starting interest rate swaps of 60.0 million each to fx the interest rate payable on the Groups unsecured bank borrowings.
These interest rate swaps previously fxed interest at 3.0% until 28 April 2016 and at 4.5% thereafter and were due toterminate on 28 April 2023.
In the prior period the termination date of the swaps was extended to 30 April 2025 and the terms were amended to fx interest at 3.0% until 30 April 2018 and 4.5% and 4.6% thereafter.
In total, the fair value of the two swaps at inception was 18.9 million.
Themovement in fair value recognised in the income statement in the period was a gain of 9.3 million 2016: loss of 12.3 million.
The interest rate risk profle, after taking account of derivative fnancial instruments, is as follows: 2017 2016 Floating rate Fixed rate Floating rate Fixed rate fnancial fnancial fnancial fnancial liabilities liabilities Total liabilities liabilities Total m m m m m m Borrowings 601.5 931.2 1,532.7 519.4 959.6 1,479.0 The weighted average interest rate of the fxed rate borrowings was 5.2% 2016: 5.3% and the weighted average period for which the rate is fxed was 12 years 2016: 13 years.
Foreign currency risk: The Group buys and sells goods denominated in non-sterling currencies, principally US dollars and euros.
As a result, movements in exchange rates can affect the value of the Groups income and expenditure.
The Groups exposure in this area is not considered to be signifcant.
Counterparty risk: The Groups counterparty risk in respect of its cash and cash equivalents and other cash deposits is mitigated by the use of various banking institutions for its deposits.
There is no signifcant concentration of counterparty risk in respect of the Groups pension assets, as these are held with a range of institutions.
Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 101 Notes continued For the 52 weeks ended 30 September 2017 25 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Credit risk: Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from credit exposure to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
If customers are independently rated, these ratings are used.
Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, an assessment is made of the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its fnancial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual credit limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the Board.
The utilisation of and adherence to credit limits is regularly monitored.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables, other receivables and trade loans has been estimated by management and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date after taking into account collateral held in the form of cash deposits and fxtures and fttings.
Receivables are written off against the provision for impairment when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
The Group has no signifcant concentration of credit risk in respect of its customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable.
Liquidity risk: The Group applies a prudent liquidity risk management policy, which involves maintaining suffcient cash, ensuring the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and having the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group Treasury maintains the availability of committed credit lines to ensure that the Group has fexibility in funding.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve comprising undrawn borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash fow.
In addition, the Groups liquidity management policy involves maintaining debt fnancing plans, projecting cash fows and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these, and monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios against internal and external regulatory requirements.
The Groups borrowing covenants are subject to regular review.
The tables below analyse the Groups fnancial liabilities and non-settled derivative fnancial instruments into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.

Defned contribution plans Pension costs for defned contribution plans are as follows: 2017 2016 m m Defned contribution plans 7.4 6.8 Defned beneft plan The Marstons PLC Pension and Life Assurance Scheme is a fnal salary pension plan which provides benefts to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The plan closed to future accrual on 30 September 2014 and the link to future salary increases was also removed.
The plan operates under the UK regulatory framework and is governed by a board of Trustees composed of plan participants and representatives of the Group.
The Trustees make investment decisions and set the required contribution rates based on independent actuarial advice.

An updated actuarial valuation of the plan was performed by Mercer as at 30 September 2017 for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee Benefts.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries were: 2017 2016 Discount rate 2.7% 2.3% Rate of increase in pensions 5% LPI 3.1% 2.9% Rate of increase in pensions 2.5% LPI 2.2% 2.1% Infation assumption RPI 3.1% 2.9% Infation assumption CPI 2.1% 1.9% Employed deferred revaluation 2.1% 1.9% Life expectancy for deferred members from age 65 years Male 23.5 23.4 Female 26.0 25.9 Life expectancy for current pensioners from age 65 years Male 21.7 21.7 Female 24.1 24.0 Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables adjusted for plan experience and with an allowance for future improvement in life expectancy.
The sensitivity of the defned beneft obligation to changes in the principal actuarial assumptions is: Change in assumption Increase in assumption Decrease in assumption Discount rate 0.25% Decrease by 4.2% Increase by 4.5% Infation assumption 0.25% Increase by 2.3% Decrease by 2.3% Life expectancy One year Increase by 3.8% Decrease by 3.7% The above sensitivity analyses have been determined by changing one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
This is unlikely to be the case in practice as changes in some of the assumptions could be correlated.
When calculating the above sensitivities the same method has been applied as when calculating the net defned beneft asset liability in the balance sheet i. e. the present value of the defned beneft obligation calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
Plan assets are comprised as follows: 2017 2016 m m Equities Properties 131.8 149.5 Bonds Gilts 189.8 201.8 Cash Other 6.4 13.0 Buy-in policy matching annuities 204.4 179.1 532.4 543.4 Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 103 Notes continued For the 52 weeks ended 30 September 2017 26 RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED The actual return on plan assets was a gain of 7.1 million 2016: 76.8 million.
A proportion of the defned beneft obligation has been secured by a buy-in policy and as such this proportion of liabilities is matched by annuities.
The Trustees of the plan hold a range of assets and are aiming to better align the cash fows from these to those of the plan.
They are also working with the Group to fide-risk their portfolio further.
To this end changes to the allocation of assets have occurred during the current period.
The Group is aiming to eliminate the plans funding defcit in the medium term.
A schedule of contributions was agreed as part of the 30 September 2014 triennial valuation and contributions of 0.5 million per month are payable until 30 September 2018 as well as contributions in respect of the plans expenses.
These contributions may continue until 2030 depending on the plans funding position.
The Group has also agreed to pledge additional security for six years from 2015.
The next triennial valuation will be performed as at 30 September 2017.
The employer contributions expected to be paid during the fnancial period ending 29 September 2018 amount to 7.8 million.
The weighted average duration of the defned beneft obligation is 17 years.
Post-retirement medical benefts A gain of nil 2016: 0.1 million in respect of the remeasurement of post-retirement medical benefts has been included in the statement of comprehensive income.
27 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS During the period there were three classes of equity-settled employee share incentive plans outstanding: a Sav e As You Earn SAYE.
Under this scheme employees enter into a savings contract for a period of three to seven years and options are granted on commencement of the contract, exercisable using the amount saved under the contract at the time it terminates.
Options under the scheme are granted at a discount of 20% to the market price of the shares at the time of the invitation and are not subject to performance conditions.
Exercise of options is subject to continued employment.
Under this scheme nil cost options are granted to eligible employees in lieu of a cash bonus.
c Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
Under this scheme nil cost options are granted that will only vest provided the participant satisfes the minimum shareholding requirement and performance conditions relating to earnings per share, return on capital, free cash fow and relative total shareholder return, as set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 59 are met.
In 2010, HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved an Approved Performance Share Plan APSP to enable participants in the LTIP to beneft from UK tax effciencies.
As such, awards made in 2010 and subsequent years may comprise an HMRC approved option in respect of the frst 30,000 worth of an award and an unapproved LTIP award for amounts in excess of this HMRC limit.
A further share award a linked award is also provided to enable participants to fund the exercise of the approved option.
This linked award is satisfed by way of shares held on trust but these additional shares are not generally delivered to the participant.
Under these rules the LTIP options are still issued at nil cost to the employee.
The tables below summarise the outstanding share options.

The fair values of the SAYE, deferred bonus and LTIP rights are calculated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The signifcant inputs into the model for all schemes unless otherwise stated were: 2017 2016 Dividend yield % 5.5 to 5.6 4.4 to 4.7 Expected volatility % 19.7 to 20.5 19.4 to 20.2 Risk-free interest rate % 0.2 to 0.4 0.6 to 0.8 Expected life of rights SAYE 3 to 5 years 3 to 5 years Deferred bonus 1 year 1 year LTIP 3 years 3 years The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the expected life of the rights.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the period in relation to the SAYE was 9.5p 2016: 15.6p.
The fair value of options granted during the period in relation to the deferred bonus scheme was 113.0p 2016: 143.3p.
The fair value of options granted during the period in relation to the LTIP was 105.7p 2016: 128.9p.
The weighted average share price for options exercised over the period was 120.5p 2016: 158.7p.
The total charge for the period relating to employee share-based payment plans was 0.9 million 2016: 0.4 million, all of which related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
After tax, the total charge was 0.9 million 2016: 0.3 million.

The net proceeds were 75.5 million and as the share issue qualifed for merger relief under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006, the excess of the net proceeds over the nominal value of the shares issued has been credited to a merger reserve rather than the share premium account note 29.
29 OTHER COMPONENTS OF EQUITY The merger reserve of 71.2 million 2016: nil arose on the issue of ordinary shares in the current period and represents the difference between the nominal value of the shares issued and the net proceeds received note 28.
The capital redemption reserve of 6.8 million 2016: 6.8 million arose on share buybacks.
Own shares represent the carrying value of the investment in treasury shares and shares held on trust for employee share schemes including executive share option schemes as set out in the table below.

Dividends on own shares have been waived.
Capital management The Group considers its capital to comprise total equity as disclosed on the face of the Group balance sheet and net debt note 30.
In managing its capital the primary objective is to ensure that the Group is able to continue to operate as a going concern and to maximise return to shareholders through a combination of capital growth and distributions.
The Group seeks to maintain a ratio of debt to equity that both balances risks and returns at an acceptable level and retains suffcient funds to comply with lending covenants, achieve working capital targets and meet investment requirements.
The Board reviews the Groups dividend policy and funding requirements at least once a year.

32 OPERATING LEASES The Group as lessee The Group leases various properties and equipment under non-cancellable operating leases.
The leases have various terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
Future minimum lease rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2017 2016 Land and Land and buildings Other buildings Other Due: m m m m Within one year 19.2 0.6 25.3 0.4 In more than one year but less than fve years 70.6 0.6 64.4 0.3 In more than fve years 331.0 273.9 420.8 1.2 363.6 0.7 The Group as lessor The Group leases a proportion of its licensed estate and other unlicensed properties to tenants.
The majority of lease agreements have terms of 21 years or less and are classifed as operating leases.
Future minimum lease rentals receivable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2017 2016 Land and Land and buildings Other buildings Other Due: m m m m Within one year 18.5 21.1 In more than one year but less than fve years 58.9 67.7 In more than fve years 77.8 92.7 155.2 181.5 Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 107 Notes continued For the 52 weeks ended 30 September 2017 33 FINANCE LEASES The Group leases a number of properties under fnance leases.

This would arise in the event of Marstons Pubs Limited being sold outside the Group, within six years of the relevant asset transfer date for CGT purposes, and within three years of the relevant asset transfer date for SDLT purposes.
Due to the passage of time and changes in the statutory rate of corporation tax, the total potential fide-grouping liability now stands at 2.3 million 2016: 3.6 million, of which 2.3 million 2016: 3.1 million relates to CGT and nil 2016: 0.5 million relates to SDLT.
The Group has issued a letter of credit in favour of Royal Sun Alliance Insurance totalling 0.5 million 2016: 0.6 million and a letter of credit in favour of Aviva totalling 1.4 million 2016: 1.5 million to secure reinsurance contracts.
The letters of credit are secured on fxed deposits for the same amount.
The Group has also entered into a Deed of Guarantee with the Trustees of the Marstons PLC Pension and Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme whereby it guarantees to the Trustees the ongoing obligations of the Group to contribute to the Scheme, and the obligations of the Group to contribute to the Scheme in the event of a debt becoming due under section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995 on the occurrence of either a Group company entering liquidation or the Scheme winding up.
35 CHARLES WELLS ACQUISITION On 2 June 2017, the Group acquired Bedford Canning Company Limited, containing the beer business of Charles Wells.
The business incorporates a portfolio of well-known brands including Bombardier, Youngs and McEwans.
The acquisition is consistent with the Groups strategy of focussing on premium beer brands with local provenance, and provides further opportunities for growth in the developing free trade market.
Additionally, the acquisition further strengthens the Groups presence in London and the South East and presents a platform to expand into Scotland.
The table below summarises the consideration paid, the provisional fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the resulting goodwill.
2017 m Brands 30.0 Property, plant and equipment 25.5 Trade loans 0.6 Inventories 8.5 Trade and other receivables 27.3 Trade and other payables 2.8 Deferred tax 1.4 Goodwill 2.8 Cash consideration 90.5 None of the goodwill arising is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Acquisition related costs of 0.6 million have been recognised within other net operating charges.
If the acquisition date had been the beginning of the current period then the underlying revenue and proft of the Group for the current period would have been 1,070.9 million and 87.3 million respectively.
Since acquisition the Group has integrated the operations of the acquired business into the Groups existing operations.
As a result it is impractical to isolate the revenue and proft of the acquired business that has been included in the Group statement of comprehensive income since the acquisition date.
