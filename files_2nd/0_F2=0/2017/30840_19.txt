The new standard will require the value of inventory expected to be returned, which currently forms part of the customer returns provision, to be reclassified from other payables to currentassets in the balance sheet.

The exceptional items consist of the following: 12.0m of property, redundancy and other costs associated with the closure of 46 branches 19.1m of costs arising from the separation and rationalisation of the Plumbing & Heating supply chain.
The costs comprised property-related costs, redundancy and reorganisation costs and inventory write-downs 9.8m of central and divisional costs including people-related, consultancy and other restructuring costs.

6. BUSINESS AND GEOGRAPHICAL SEGMENTS As required by IFRS 8, operating segments are identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to assess their performance.
All four divisions sell building materials to a wide range of customers, none of which are dominant, and operate almost exclusively in the United Kingdom and consequently no geographical information is presented.
The operating segments of the Group are aggregated into four divisions, the reportable segments of the Group, based on shared economic characteristics and similarities in their customers and products.
Segment result represents the profit earned by each segment without allocation of certain central costs, finance income and costs and income tax expense.
Unallocated segment assets and liabilities comprise financial instruments, current and deferred taxation, cash and borrowings and pension scheme assets and liabilities.
Unallocated segment assets and liabilities comprise the following: 2017 2016 Assets m m Interest in associates 20.3 11.5 Financial instruments - 1.7 Tangible fixed assets 0.2 0.7 Investments 9.5 9.1 Cash and cash equivalents 276.8 250.5 Unallocated corporate assets 19.9 21.1 326.7 294.6 Liabilities Financial instruments 4.9 - Tax liabilities 44.5 43.8 Deferred tax liabilities 61.0 45.8 Retirement benefit obligations 28.3 127.3 Interest bearing loans, borrowings and loan notes 618.3 628.0 Unallocated corporate liabilities 38.1 40.6 795.1 885.5 115 Travis Perkins plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Travis Perkins plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Financial Statements Financial Statements 7.

As a result the 2016 disclosure has been increased by 2,583. b.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to calculate the fair value of the options and the amount to be expensed.
The probability of the performance conditions being achieved was included in the fair value calculations.
The inputs into the model for options granted in the year expressed as weighted averages are as follows: 2017 2016 Executive Nil price Executive Nil price options SAYE options options SAYE options Share price at grant date pence 1,487 1,434 1,487 1,785 1,569 1,797 Option exercise price pence 1,488 1,185 - 1,847 1,342 - Volatility % 29.2% 28.4% 31.0% 23.4% 28.2% 23.7% Option life years 3.0 3.3 2.9 3.0 3.4 2.9 Risk-free interest rate % 0.1% 0.1% 0.2% 0.5% 0.1% 0.5% Expected dividends as a dividend yield % 2.9% 3.1% 2.9% 2.3% 2.6% 2.3% Volatility is based on historic share prices over a period equal to the vesting period.
Option life used in the model has been based on options being exercised in accordance with historical patterns.
For executive share options the vesting period is 3 years.
If options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, these options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before options vest.
SAYE options vest after 3 or 5 years and expire 3 or 5 years after the date of grant.
The risk-free interest rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds on a term consistent with the vesting period.
Dividends used are based on actual dividends where data is known and future dividends estimated using a dividend cover of three times within the Boards target range.
The expected life of options used in the model has been adjusted, based upon managements best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
A description of the share schemes operated by the Group is contained in the remuneration report on pages 64 to 81.

The recoverable amounts of the goodwill and other non-monetary assets with indefinite useful lives are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and like-for-like market volume changes which impact sales and therefore cash flow projections and maintenance capital expenditure.
Management estimates pre-tax discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU groupings that are not reflected in the cash flow projections.
At the beginning and end of the financial year the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in all segments was in excess of their book value.
In the absence of a binding agreement to sell the assets and active reference market on which fair value can be determined the recoverable amount of the goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives was determined according to value in use.
The Directors calculations have shown that no impairments have occurred other than detailed in the table opposite.
The key variables applied to the value in use calculations were: Cash flow forecasts are risk-adjusted and were derived from the most recent board approved corporate plan updated for changes in current trading conditions The sales market volume assumptions underlying the cash flow forecasts are the Directors estimates of likely future changes based on historic performance excluding future investment and enhancements and the current outlook for both the UK economy and the UK building materials industry.
This is viewed as the key operating assumption because the state of the building materials market determines the Directors approach to margin and cost maintenance.
A pre-tax discount rate is calculated by reference to the weighted average cost of capital WACC of the Group.
For2017, the pre-tax discount rate ranged between 8.3% and 8.6% 2016: 9.6% to 11.1%, which is not significantly different for any individual CGU or CGU grouping.
That is because each CGU operates in the same market, selling the same product types therefore the risk profiles are not dissimilar.
The reduction in pre-tax discount rates in 2017 is the result of share price volatility having been elevated in 2016 following the Brexitvote.
For 2017, cash flows beyond the corporate plan 2021 and beyond have been determined using a growth rate of 2.0%, which is the average long-term forecast GDP growth outlined in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook report produced by the Office for Budget Responsibility.
TheDirectors believe this is the most appropriate indicator of long-term growth rates that is available 2016 growth rate:2.1%.
Sensitivity of results to changes in assumptions Whilst management believe the assumptions are realistic, it is possible that a further impairment would be identified if any of the above key assumptions were changed significantly.
For instance factors which could cause an impairment are: Significant underperformance relative to the forecast results Changes to the way the assets are used or changes to the strategy for the business A deterioration in the UK economy 127 Travis Perkins plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Travis Perkins plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Financial Statements Financial Statements 13.
GOODWILL continued The impairment review calculations are based upon anticipated discounted future cash flows.
For most of the CGU groupings, given the prudence already built into the Groups corporate plan and the level of headroom they show, the Directors do not envisage reasonably possible changes to the key operating assumptions that are sufficient to generate a different outcome to the impairment calculations undertaken.
However, for the CGU groupings listed in the table below this is not the case as the Directors consider that reasonably possible changes in key assumptions could result in discounted future cash flows being insufficient to allow full recovery of the carrying value of the CGUs goodwill and other intangible assets.
Following changes in City Plumbing Supplies in 2017, the CGU is no longer sensitive to impairment.
The Directors have conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine the specific value for each assumption, all other assumptions remaining the same, that would result in the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets equalling their recoverable amounts and these are shown in the following tables.
The sole market value adjustment is the average annual change incorporated in the corporate plan of each CGU grouping.

In 2016 the Group recognised an impairment charge in respect of goodwill and other intangible assets of 231.3m and 4.1m in respect of tangible fixed assets.

Accordingly for Toolstation, PlumbNation, Primaflow, Underfloor Heating and certain product related brands the Directors have decided it is appropriate to amortise their brand costs over their estimated useful lives.
The useful lives of those brands being amortised range from 10 to 20 years with the remaining lives ranging from 1 to 11 years.
The Directors consider that the other brands, which are also all leading brands in their sectors with significant histories and significant growth prospects, have an indefinite useful life.
They are reviewed annually for impairment: details of impairment testing and the impairments recognised in 2016 are shown in note 13.
Acquired customer relationships are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which range from 5to 15 years.
The remaining lives of amortised customer relationships range from 1 to 7 years.
The Company has no intangible assets.
Assets under construction consist of software being developed for use by the Group, which is not yet ready to be used.
No amortisation is charged on assets under construction.

The Directors consider the only class of asset containing significant credit risk is trade receivables.
The average credit term taken for sales of goods is 57 days 2016: 57 days.
The allowance for doubtful debts is estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The Directors consider the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair values.
The business has provided fully for all receivables outstanding for more than 90 days beyond agreed terms.
Trade receivables which have been outstanding for less than 90 days and that are not considered recoverable are specifically provided for.
No interest is charged on the trade receivable from the date of the invoice until the date the invoice is classified as overdue according to the trading terms agreed between the Group and the customer.
Thereafter, the Group retains the right to charge interest at between 2% to 4% per annum above the clearing bank base rate on the outstanding balance.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that no further credit provision is required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors unprovided against with a carrying amount of 46.2m 2016: 44.3m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not identified a significant change in credit quality and as such, the Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable and therefore there is no allowance for doubtful debts.
Except for some instances of personal guarantees the Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Group has considered the impact of credit risk on its financial instruments and because the counterparties are banks with strong credit ratings considers its impact to be immaterial.
c. Fair value of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities designated as FVTPL comprise foreign currency forward contracts and are measured using quoted forward exchange rates.
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs 139 Travis Perkins plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Travis Perkins plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Financial Statements Financial Statements 23.

The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts and forward interest rate contracts when appropriate.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
At 31 December 2017 no interest rate risks were hedged 2016: none.
e. Currency forward contracts The Group acquires goods for sale from overseas, which when not denominated in sterling are paid for principally in US dollars.
The Group has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts all of which are less than one year in duration to buy US dollars to hedge the exchange risk arising from these anticipated future purchases.
At the balance sheet date the total notional value of contracts to which the Group was committed was US$75.8 m 2016: US$63.0m.
The fair value of these derivatives was 1.2m liability 2016: 1.7m asset.
These contracts are not designated cash flow hedges and accordingly the fair value movement has been reflected in the incomestatement.
140 Financial Statements Travis Perkins plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Financial Statements f. Liquidity analysis The following table details the Groups liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments and other financial liabilities.
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash flows on the derivative instruments that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross cash flows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.
When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest and foreign currency rates as illustrated by the yield curves existing at the reportingdate.

Interest rate sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1.0% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel.
At the 31 December 2017 the Group had no floating rate liabilities.
There was 215m on short term deposit at 31 December 2017.
A 1.0% increase decrease in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would have the following impact on: Profit before taxation for the year ended 31 December 2017 would have increased decreased by 2.2m 2016: increased decreased by 1.8m due to the short term deposits: Net equity would have increased decreased by 1.8m 2016: increased decreased by 1.5m 141 Travis Perkins plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Travis Perkins plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Financial Statements Financial Statements 24.

As set out in note 5, in 2017 the Group recognised an exceptional charge relating to the transformation of its Plumbing & Heating division.
The exceptional provision relates to the exceptional charge, excluding property and inventory amounts.
In 2016, theGroup established exceptional provisions as a result of reorganising parts of its branch and distributionnetworks.
Should a provision ultimately prove to be unnecessary then it is credited back into the income statement.
Where the provision was originally established as an exceptional item, any release is shown as an exceptional credit.
It is Group policy to insure itself using policies with a high excess against claims arising in respect of damage to assets, or due to employers or public liability claims.
The nature of insurance claims means they may take some time to be settled.
The insurance claims provision represents managements best estimate, based upon external advice of the value of outstanding claims against it where the final settlement date is uncertain.

PENSION ARRANGEMENTS Defined benefit schemes The Group operates four final salary schemes being The Travis Perkins Pensions and Dependants Benefit Scheme the TP DB scheme and the immaterial Platinum pension scheme the TP Schemes and the BSS Schemes being the BSS Defined Benefit Scheme the BSS DB Scheme and the immaterial BSS Ireland Defined Benefit Scheme.
All defined benefit schemes are closed to new members.
The TP scheme is for the majority of members a 1 60th scheme.
The assets of the TP DB schemes are held separately from those of the Group under the control of the schemes trustees.
Employees are entitled to start drawing a pension, based on their membership of a scheme, on their normal retirement date.
If employees choose to retire early and draw their pension, or late and defer drawing their pension, then the amount they receive is scaled down or up accordingly.
The TP schemes are funded by contributions from Group companies and employees.
Contributions are paid to the Trustees on the basis of advice from an independent professionally qualified actuary who carries out a valuation every three years.
A full actuarial valuation of the TP DB scheme was carried out on 30 September 2014.
The IAS 19 valuation has been based upon the results of the 30 September 2014 valuation, and then updated to 31 December 2017 by a qualified actuary.
The present values of the defined benefit obligations, the related current service costs and the past service costs for the scheme were measured using the projected unit method.
The assets of the BSS schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the schemes trustees.
Themost recent actuarial valuations of the BSS schemes assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligations were carried out at 30 September 2014.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit method with a control period equal to the future working lifetime of the active members.
In June 2010, an agreement was reached with the Trustees of the TP DB scheme to fund 34.7m of the funding deficit using a Group-controlled special purpose vehicle SPV.
The pension scheme is entitled to receive the income of the SPV for aperiod of up to 20 years, subject to funding levels.
This income is backed by the security of 16 Travis Perkins freehold properties.
AstheSPV is consolidated into the Travis Perkins plc Group accounts, advantage has been taken of Regulation 7 of The Partnership Accounts Regulations 2008 and accounts for the SPV will neither be audited or filed.
The TP schemes and the BSS schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk.
A summary of the risks and the management of those risks is given below.
Investment risk The present value of the defined benefit liabilities of the schemes is calculated using a discount rate predetermined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields.
If the return on scheme assets is below this rate it may create a plan deficit.
Following a review of the investment strategy, a derisking exercise is currently being undertaken with a higher proportion of the largest two pension schemes assets being invested in gilts and corporate bonds liability driven investments.
Currently the schemes have investments in equity securities, secured finance assets, bonds, debt instruments and real estate.
Due to the long term nature of the scheme liabilities the trustees of the pension funds previously considered it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the scheme assets should be invested in equities.
Interest risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the schemes liabilities, but the effect will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the schemes bond and gilt assets.
Longevity risk The present value of the liabilities of the schemes is calculated by reference to the best estimate of mortality of pension scheme members both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of the schemes members will increase the schemes liabilities.
Salary risk The present value of the defined benefit schemes liabilities is calculated by reference to the future salaries of scheme members.
As such an increase in salaries of scheme members will increase the schemes liabilities.
The investment strategy for the UK scheme is controlled by the Trustee in consultation with the Company.
The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments.
All fair values are provided by the fund managers.
Where available, the fair values are quoted prices e. g. listed equity, sovereign debt and corporate bonds.
Unlisted investments e. g. private equity are included at values provided by the fund manager in accordance with relevant guidance.
Other significant assets are valued based on observable inputs such as yield curves.
The liability driven investments, which comprise fixed interest and index-linked gilts, futures, interest and inflation rate swaps, repurchase agreements and liquidity funds, are all daily priced and traded.

Major assumptions used by the schemes actuaries at the balance sheet date: At 31 December At 31 December 2017 2016 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 2.50% 2.65% Rate of increase of pensions in payment post 2006 2.20% 2.25% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 1997 - 2006 3.15% 3.30% Discount rate 2.55% 2.65% Inflation assumption - RPI 3.25% 3.40% Inflation assumption - CPI 2.25% 2.40% The methodology for setting the discount rate has been revised to better reflect the credit risk of the defined benefit schemes.
Theyield curve, which includes bonds with an average AA rating, now excludes bonds which are sub-sovereign or issued by universities.
We estimate that the change in methodology increased the discount rate by 0.1%.
The sensitivity of the defined benefit schemes to changes in the discount rate are disclosed in note 27 k. In respect of longevity, the valuation adopts the S2PA year of birth tables with improvements in life expectancy to continue in the medium term, with base year appropriate to the members date of birth.
This results in the following life expectancies at illustrative ages: Weighted average life expectancy for mortality tables used to determine pension liabilities at 31 December 2017: Male Female Years Years Member age 65 current life expectancy - TP Schemes 22.0 24.7 Member age 45 life expectancy on reaching age 65 - TP Schemes 23.3 26.2 Member age 65 current life expectancy - BSS Schemes 22.0 23.8 Member age 45 life expectancy on reaching age 65 - BSS Schemes 23.3 25.3 b.

In addition the Company has agreed to pay voluntary excess contribution of 1.5m to the BSS schemes and 2.3m to the TP DB schemes.
These contributions can be stopped at any time with one months notice at the Companys sole discretion.
In addition, the triennial valuation of the BSS DB Scheme and TP DB Scheme, as at 30 September 2017 are currently being undertaken and will be finalised in 2018.
This could change contribution rates, but in the absence of any change in 2018, the excess of funding over the on-going service contributions is expected to be between 10.0m and 13.8m in total for theGroup.

ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES On 13 October 2017 the Group acquired 75% of the issued share capital of National Shower Spares Limited, a leading online retailer of shower spares, for total cash consideration of 2.7m.
On 28 April 2017 the Group acquired 77.5% of the issued share capital of TFS Holdings Limited, an air conditioning and refrigeration distributor, for total cash consideration of 7.8m.
All acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
The net assets acquired totalled 2.8m and 10.9m of goodwill and a non-controlling interest of 3.2m have been recognised.
The goodwill represents the benefits from forecast growth and the assembled workforces.
A non-current liability of 4.9m has been recognised in respect of put options on the non-controlling interests.
For the period from acquisition the combined revenue and operating profit for the above acquisitions total 12.6m and 1.4m respectively.
If the acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the year, group revenue would have been 6,443.5m and group operating profit would have been 327.8m.
In 2016 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of W. Gaunt Limited and T&T Sussex Plant Hire Limited for total consideration of 3.2m, all satisfied by cash.
The net assets acquired totalled 1.3m and goodwill of 1.9m was recognised as a result of these transactions.

OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS The Group has entered into a significant number of property operating leases for its trading sites, the commercial terms for which tend to vary.
The leases, at inception, are typically 25 years in duration, although some have lessee only break clauses of between 10 and 15 years.
No leases place any commercial restriction on the Groups ability to conduct its business in the manner it sees fit for instance restrictions on dividends, debt levels or further leases.
No lease has clauses that link rental payments to performance, for instance turnover leases and no lease contains contingent rent clauses.
All leases include rent escalation clauses setting out the basis for future rent reviews.
Typically these are based on open market conditions or are linked to RPI or CPI.
The Group has a small number of leases that are subject to fixed reviews, but these are notmaterial.
There are no significant pre-emption rights in any of the Groups leases.
