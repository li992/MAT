The Group has a policy of only dealing with creditworthy tenants and obtaining sufficient rental cash deposits or third party guarantees asameans of mitigating financial loss from defaults.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the large and diverse tenant base.
Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of rent deposits obtained.
Details of the Groups receivables are summarised in note 15 of the financial statements.
The Groups cash deposits are placed with a diversied range of banks and strict counterparty limits ensure the Groups exposure to bank failure is minimised.
Capital risk The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns and as such it aims to maintain an appropriate mix of debt and equity nancing.
The current capital structure of the Group consists of a mix of equity and debt.
Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group statement of changes in equity.
Debt comprises long-term debenture stock, private placement notes, convertible bonds and drawings against committed revolving credit facilities from banks.
The Group operates solely in the United Kingdom, and its operating profits and net assets are sterling denominated.
As a result, the Groups policy is to have no unhedged assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
The currency risk on overseas transactions isfully hedged through foreign currency derivatives to create a synthetic sterling exposure.
Financial statements Annual Report 2017 158 Great Portland Estates Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 17 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Group operates a framework for the management of its short-, mediumand long-term funding requirements.
Cash ow and funding needs are regularly monitored to ensure sufficient undrawn facilities are in place.
The Groups funding sources are diversied across a range of bank and bond markets and strict counterparty limits are operated on deposits.
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through the utilisation of its revolving credit facility.
The availability of this facility depends on the Group complying with a number of key financial covenants: these covenants and the Groups compliance with them are set out in the table below: March 2017 Key covenants Covenant actuals Group Net debt net equity 1.25x 0.18x Inner borrowing unencumbered asset value unsecured borrowings 1.66x 5.36x Interest cover 1.35x n a Due to the treatment of capitalised interest under our Group covenants, there is no net interest charge in the year applicable for the purposes of calculating the interest cover ratio.
The Group has undrawn credit facilities of 342.0 million and has substantial headroom above all of its key covenants.
As a result, thedirectors consider the Group to have adequate liquidity to be able to fund the ongoing operations of the business.
The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity on its financial instruments and have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash ows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group is required to pay and conditions existing atthe balance sheet date: Carrying Contractual Less than One to Two to More than amount cash ows one year two years five years five years At 31 March 2017 m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities 5 142.9 million 5 % debenture stock 2029 143.9 237.9 8.0 8.0 24.1 197.8 8 450.0 million revolving credit facility 107.0 113.1 1.6 1.6 109.9 Private placement notes 127.4 142.6 5.2 5.3 106.4 25.7 150.0 million 1.00% convertible bonds 2018 159.4 152.1 1.5 150.6 Derivative financial instruments Cross currency swaps note 14 28.0 0.7 0.3 0.2 0.2 Interest rate oor note 14 0.5 1.0 1.0 509.2 645.4 15.6 165.7 240.6 223.5 Carrying Contractual Less than One to Two to More than amount cash ows one year two years five years five years At 31 March 2016 m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities 5 142.9 million 5 % debenture stock 2029 144.0 245.9 8.0 8.0 24.1 205.8 8 450.0 million revolving credit facility Private placement notes 286.7 332.8 13.0 13.1 230.5 76.2 150.0 million 1.00% convertible bonds 2018 169.5 153.6 1.5 1.5 150.6 Derivative financial instruments Cross currency swaps note 14 22.3 1.7 0.5 0.5 0.6 0.1 Interest rate oor note 14 2.0 2.1 1.3 0.8 575.9 731.9 21.7 22.3 405.8 282.1 Annual Report 2017 Great Portland Estates 159 17 Financial instruments continued Market risk Interest rate risk arises from the Groups use of interest-bearing financial instruments.
It is the risk that future cash ows arising from a financial instrument will uctuate due to changes in interest rates.
It is the Groups policy to reduce interest rate risk in respect of the cash ows arising from its debt finance either through the use of xed rate debt or through the use of interest rate derivatives such as swaps, caps and oors.
It is the Groups usual policy to maintain the proportion of oating interest rate exposure to between 20%40% of forecast total debt.
However, this target is exible, and may not be adhered to at all times depending on, for example, the Groups view of future interest rate movements.
Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps in the joint ventures enable the Group to exchange its oating rate interest payments on its bank debt for xed rate payments on a notional value.
Such contracts allow the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the cash ow exposures on its variable rate bank loans by locking in a xed rate on a proportion of its debt.
Interest rate oors Under the terms of an interest rate oor, one party the seller makes a payment to the other party the buyer if an underlying interest rate is below a specified rate.
The Group has bought an interest rate oor, which, when combined with xed rate debt, gives rise to the same economic effect as purchasing an interest rate cap in respect ofoating rate debt.
Cross currency swaps Cross currency swaps enable the Group to exchange receipts or payments denominated in currencies other than sterling for receipts or payments denominated in sterling.
Such contracts allow the Group to eliminate foreign exchange risk arising from uctuating exchange rates between sterling and other currencies.
