a Carrying amount The liability for investment contracts gross of reinsurance at 31 December comprised: 2017 2016 m m Long-term business Participating contracts 87,654 89,739 Non-participating contracts at fair value 124,995 114,531 Total 212,649 204,270 Less: Amounts classified as held for sale 8,663 7,175 203,986 197,095 b Long-term business investment liabilities Investment contracts are those that do not transfer significant insurance risk from the contract holder to the issuer, and are therefore treated as financial instruments under IFRS.
Many investment contracts contain a discretionary participation feature in which the contract holder has a contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits.
These are referred to as participating contracts and are measured according to the methodology and Group practice for long-term business liabilities as described in note 40.
They are not measured at fair value as there is currently no agreed definition of fair valuation for discretionary participation features under IFRS.
In the absence of such a definition, it is not possible to provide a range of estimates within which a fair value is likely to fall.
The IASB deferred consideration of participating contracts to Phase II of its insurance contracts project.
This is addressed in the insurance contract standard i. e. IFRS 17.
For participating business, the discretionary participation feature is recognised separately from the guaranteed element and is classified as a liability, referred to as unallocated divisible surplus.
Guarantees on long-term investment products are discussed in note 42.
Investment contracts that do not contain a discretionary participation feature are referred to as non-participating contracts and the liability is measured at either fair value or amortised cost.
We currently have no non-participating investment contracts measured at amortised cost.
Of the non-participating investment contracts measured at fair value, 123,916 million in 2017 are unit-linked in structure and the fair value liability is equal to the current unit fund value, including any unfunded units, plus if required, additional non-unit reserves based on a discounted cash flow analysis.
These contracts are generally classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, as the unit reserve is calculated as the publicly quoted unit price multiplied by the number of units in issue, and any non-unit reserve is insignificant.
For unit-linked business, a deferred acquisition cost asset and deferred income reserve liability are recognised in respect of transaction costs and front-end fees respectively, that relate to the provision of investment management services, and which are amortised on a systematic basis over the contract term.
The amount of the related deferred acquisition cost asset is shown in note 28 and the deferred income liability is shown in note 51.
For non-participating investment contracts acquired in a business combination, an acquired value of in-force business asset is recognised in respect of the fair value of the investment management services component of the contracts, which is amortised on a systematic basis over the useful lifetime of the related contracts.
The amount of the acquired value of in-force business asset is shown in note 17, which relates primarily to the acquisition of Friends Life in 2015.
For non-participating investment contracts, deposits collected and amounts withdrawn are not shown on the income statement, but are accounted for directly through the statement of financial position as an adjustment to the gross liabilities for investment contracts.
The associated change in investment contract provisions shown on the income statement consists of the attributed investment return.
Participating investment contracts are treated consistently with insurance contracts with the change in investment contract provisions primarily consisting of the movement in participating investment contract liabilities net of reinsurance over the reporting period.
