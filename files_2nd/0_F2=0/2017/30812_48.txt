Facility fees principally relate to the Groups central banking facilities.
b Adjusting items included in net finance costs income Adjusting items are significant items in net finance costs income which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, are relevant to an understanding of the Groups underlying financial performance.
The following adjusting items have been recognised: i the Group incurred 153 million of financing costs related to the acquisition of the shares not already owned by the Group in RAI: ii the Group incurred interest on adjusting tax payables of 43 million, including interest of25 million 2016: 25 million: 2015: 8 million in relation to the Franked Investment Income Group Litigation Order FII GLO see note 6 b : and iii the Group experienced significant hedge ineffectiveness, driven by market volatility following the Brexit referendum.
The gain in 2016 of 18 million was deemed to be adjusting as it is not representative of the underlying performance of the business and so the partial reversal of 9 million in 2017 has also been deemed as an adjusting item.
In 2016, the following adjusting items have been recognised: iv the Group redeemed a US$700 million bond, prior to its original maturity date of 15 November 2018.
This led to a loss of US$130 million 101 million, which has been treated as an adjusting item.
In 2015, the following adjusting items have been recognised: v costs of 104 million in relation to financing activities, which includes costs on the acquisition of the non-controlling interests in the Groups Brazilian subsidiary, Souza Cruz S. A. and the Groups activities to maintain the then current ownership in RAI following its acquisition of Lorillard, Inc. : and vi the Groups investment of US$4.7 billion in cash of RAI has realised a deemed gain of US$931 million 601 million.
The deemed gain reflects the difference between the fixed price paid by the Group to RAI and the market value of RAI shares on the day of the transaction see note 24 d. 124 BAT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2017
