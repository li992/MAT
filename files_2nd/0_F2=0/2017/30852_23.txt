2 Alternative performance measures The Group uses a number of alternative non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice non-GAAP performance measures which are not defined within IFRS.
The Directors use these measures in order to assess the underlying operational performance of the Group and, as such, these measures are important and should be considered alongside the IFRS measures.
The adjustments are separately disclosed and are usually items that are significant in size or non-recurring in nature.
The following non-GAAP measures are referred to in this Annual Report and Accounts.
2.1 Underlying operating profit and underlying profit before taxation Underlying operating profit is defined as operating profit before amortisation or impairment of acquired intangible assets, acquisition expenses, adjustments to deferred consideration together referred to as, acquisition related income and expense, the costs of a material restructuring, asset impairment or rationalisation of operations and the profit or loss relating to the sale of businesses.
Amortisation of acquired intangible assets and acquisition expenses are recurring in nature where business combinations are part of a groups strategy.
As acquisition expenses fluctuate with activity and to provide a better comparison to businesses that are not acquisitive, the Directors consider that both of these items should be separately disclosed to give a better understanding of operating performance.
The Directors believe that the underlying operating profit is an important measure of the operational performance of the Group.
Underlying profit before taxation is defined as underlying operating profit less net finance expense.
2.2 Underlying earnings per share Underlying earnings per share EPS is calculated as the total of underlying profit before tax, less income tax, but excluding the tax impact on separately disclosed items included in the calculation of underlying profit less profit attributable to non-controlling interests, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The Directors believe that underlying EPS provides an important measure of the underlying earnings capability of the Group.
Underlying earnings per share is set out in note 10.
2.3 Capital employed and Return on Capital Employed ROCE Capital employed is defined as net assets less cash and short-term deposits and after adding back borrowings.
Average capital employed is adjusted for the timing of businesses acquired and after adding back cumulative amortisation of customer relationships.
Segmental ROCE is defined as the underlying operating profit, divided by average capital employed.
The key performance indicator, Group post-tax ROCE, is defined as underlying operating profit, less notional tax, calculated by multiplying the effective tax rate by the underlying operating profit, divided by average capital employed.
2.4 Cash conversion Cash conversion is defined as the ratio of operating cash flow to underlying operating profit.
Operating cash flow comprises cash generated from operations plus dividends from joint venture undertakings.
2.5 Underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation Ebitda Underlying Ebitda is defined as the underlying operating profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
2.6 Underlying dividend cover Underlying dividend cover is the ratio of underlying diluted earnings per share to the total dividend per share.

Inter-segmental sales are made using prices determined on an arms length basis.
Sector assets exclude cash and short-term deposits and corporate assets that cannot reasonably be allocated to operating segments.
Sector liabilities exclude borrowings, retirement benefit obligations and corporate liabilities that cannot reasonably be allocated to operating liabilities.

The tax on the Groups profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the rate applicable under UK corporation tax rules as follows: 2017 2016 m m Profit before tax 49.0 44.9 Tax arising from interests in joint ventures 0.2 0.2 49.2 45.1 Tax on profit at UK statutory tax rate of 19.25% 2016: 20% 9.5 9.0 Tonnage tax relief on vessel activities 1.0 1.0 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 0.2 0.4 Over provision in previous years Current tax 0.6 0.7 Deferred tax 0.2 Higher tax rates on overseas income 0.8 0.4 Research and development relief 0.3 0.2 Non-taxable income 0.3 1.0 Impact of change of rate 0.1 0.7 Losses not recognised 0.8 0.5 Other 0.7 0.5 8.5 7.0 The effective rate on profit before income tax from continuing operations is 16.9% 2016: 15.1%.
The effective income tax rate on the underlying profit before tax is 17.2% 2016: 15.4%.
Over provision in previous years arose due to the timing in which certain transactions have been accounted for, rather than any correction.
At 31 December 2017 the Group had unrecognised tax losses of 10.2m 2016: 8.4m.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses due to the uncertainty relating to their future recovery.

No deferred income tax liability has been recognised in respect of this temporary timing difference due to the foreign profits exemption, the availability of double taxation relief and the ability to control the remittance of earnings.
Deferred tax credited to the income statement in the year ended 31 December 2017 relates to the following: The gross movement on the deferred income tax account is as follows: Group 2017 2016 m m Deferred tax assets 0.1 1.4 Deferred tax liabilities: Property, plant and equipment 0.5 0.5 Intangible assets 0.2 0.3 Other items 0.2 2.1 Deferred income tax credit 1.0 0.1 10 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, after excluding 27,620 2016: 45,368 ordinary shares held by the James Fisher and Sons plc Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT, as treasury shares.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
At 31 December 2017, 105,840 options 2016: 112,108 were excluded from the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares calculation as their effect would be anti-dilutive.
The average market value of the Companys shares for the purposes of calculating the dilutive effect of share options was based on quoted market prices for the period during which the options were outstanding.

The recoverable amount of these units has been assessed based on value in use calculations using cash projections based on 3 year plans approved by the Board together with projections derived from those plans for the following 2 years.
A terminal value of cash flows beyond that date has been calculated at a growth rate in line with managements long-term expectations for the relevant market.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations include gross margin, discount rate, inflation of overheads and payroll and growth rates.
For presentation purposes the CGUs are grouped into the appropriate division.
Growth estimates are based on the levels achieved in the current and historic periods adjusted for management expectations of the impact of management actions and the future development of the relevant market.
Short-term growth rates for turnover are based on the 3 year plan.
These growth rates vary depending on the market conditions in which the CGU operates.
Direct costs are expected to increase in line with turnover.
76 JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 12 Goodwill continued Discount rates applied to cash projections reflect managements estimate of the return required from the business to reflect the cost of funds plus an appropriate risk premium.
This has been determined with reference to the CGUs weighted average cost of capital WACC adjusted for risks specific to each CGUs cash flows.
The range of pre-tax discount rates used was 6.1% to 7.1% 2016: 7.0% to 7.5%.
Effective tax rates of between nil% and 30% 2016: 16.5% depending on which jurisdiction the operations are forecast to take place in have been assumed as estimated long-term rates.
Based on the value in use calculations set out above no impairment of the goodwill of the CGUs was identified.
Sensitivity to impairment The Directors have carried out sensitivity analysis to determine the impact on the carrying value of goodwill of a change in discount rate, revenue growth and terminal value growth and identified that movements of 1% would not give rise to an impairment to goodwill in any of the CGUs.

21 Retirement benefit obligations The Group and Company defined benefit pension scheme obligations relate to the James Fisher and Sons plc Pension Fund for Shore Staff Shore staff, the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund MNOPF and the Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund MNRPF.
The financial statements incorporate the latest full actuarial valuations of the schemes which have been updated to 31 December 2017 by qualified actuaries using assumptions set out in the table below.
The Groups obligations in respect of its pension schemes at 31 December 2017 were as follows: Group Company 2017 2017 2016 2016 m m m m Shore staff 10.1 10.1 5.8 5.8 MNOPF 6.8 8.5 5.0 6.3 MNRPF 7.2 8.2 2.9 3.2 19.8 26.8 13.7 19.6 81 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 21 Retirement benefit obligations continued Shore staff The assets of this scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered account and do not include any of the Groups assets.
The scheme was closed to new members in October 2001 and closed to future accrual on 31 December 2010.
The most recent actuarial valuation was as at 31 July 2016.
It is valued every three years following which deficit contributions and the repayment period are subject to agreement between the Company and the Trustees.
Estimated contributions to this scheme in 2018 are 1.6m.
MNOPF The MNOPF is an industry-wide pension scheme which is accounted for as a defined benefit scheme.
It is valued every three years and deficits have typically been funded over a ten year period.
The most recent triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme was as at 31 March 2015 and no additional deficit funding was requested by the Trustees.
The respective share of the Group and Company in the net retirement benefit obligation of the MNOPF are 3.2% 2016: 3.0% and 1.6% 2016: 1.4% respectively.
Disclosures relating to this scheme are based on these allocations.
The liability recognised represents the discounted value of committed cash flows.
Information supplied by the trustees of the MNOPF has been reviewed by the Companys actuaries.
The principal assumption in the review is the discount rate on the schemes liabilities which was 2.50% 2016: 2.75%.
The disclosures below relate to the Groups share of the assets and liabilities within the MNOPF.
Estimated contributions to this scheme in 2018 are 1.9m.
MNRPF The MNRPF is an industry-wide pension scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the MNRPF was at 31 March 2017 and the Group and Company have recognised a liability based on the discounted value of expected cash contributions.
The share of the Group and the Company in the net retirement benefit obligation of the MNRPF are 2.46% and 0.89% respectively.
The principal assumption in the MNRPF valuation is the discount rate on the schemes liabilities which was 2.50% 2016: 2.75%.
Subject to any changes arising out of the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2017, estimated contributions to this scheme in 2018 are 5.3m.
Actuarial assumptions The schemes assets are stated at their market values on the respective balance sheet dates.
The overall expected rates of return on assets reflect the risk-free rate of return plus an appropriate risk premium based on the nature of the relevant asset category.
The principal assumptions used in updating the latest valuations for each of the schemes were: 2017 2016 Inflation % 3.15 3.25 Rate of increase of pensions in payment Shore staff % 3.05 3.10 Discount rate for scheme liabilities % 2.50 2.75 Expected rates of return on assets % 2.50 2.75 Post-retirement mortality: years Shore staff scheme Current pensioner at 65 male 20.9 21.1 Current pensioner at 65 female 22.7 23.1 Future pensioner at 65 male 21.9 22.7 Future pensioner at 65 female 24.0 24.9 The post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for the expected increase in longevity.
The current disclosures above relate to assumptions based on longevity in years following retirement at the balance sheet date, with future being that relating to a member who is currently 45 years old.
Sensitivities The key sensitivities on the major schemes may be summarised as follows: Shore staff scheme Change in assumption Change in deficit Key measure Decrease of 0.25% Increase by 3.2% Discount rate Increase by 0.25% Increase by 1.6% Rate of inflation Increase in life Increase by 4.2% Rate of mortality expectancy of 1 year MNOPF Key measure Change in assumption Change in deficit Discount rate Decrease of 0.25% Increase by 0.7% MNRPF Key measure Change in assumption Change in deficit Discount rate Decrease of 0.25% Increase by 0.2% 82 JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 21 Retirement benefit obligations continued In determining the discount rate, assumptions have been made in relation to corporate bond yields and the expected term of liabilities.
As noted above, a change in discount rate applied has a significant impact on the value of liabilities.

The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through operating cash flows, with borrowings in place to fund acquisitions and capital expenditure.
At 31 December 2017 the Group had 71.8m 2016: 49.7m of undrawn committed facilities none of which expire within twelve months.
The Group is required under the terms of its loan agreements to maintain covenant ratios in respect of net debt to Ebitda and net interest costs to earnings before interest Ebit.
The Group met its covenant ratios for the year ended 31 December 2017.
The Directors have prepared forecasts of the cash flows for the subsequent eighteen-month period which indicate that, taking into account the factors noted above, the Group will meet its covenant requirements for this period.
The total amount that it is able to borrow under existing revolving credit facilities is limited to a maximum of 200m 2016: 175m.
The Group manages its capital structure so as to maintain investor, supplier and market confidence and to provide returns to shareholders that will support the future development of the business.
Capital is monitored by measuring the gearing ratio which is net debt divided by capital.
Net debt comprises interest bearing loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Capital represents net equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
Return on capital employed is also monitored.
The Groups dividend policy is based on the expected growth in sustainable income streams after making provision for the retention of capital to invest in growth and acquisitions.
In evaluating growth investment opportunities, the Group has a target of a 15% pre-tax return on the capital invested.
2017 2016 m m 152.7 Interest bearing loans and borrowings 127.5 20.3 Less cash and cash equivalents 21.9 Net debt 132.4 105.6 285.0 Equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent 257.3 46.5% Gearing ratio 41.0% The Group has exposure to the following financial risks: a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
These arise principally from the Groups receivables from customers and from cash balances held with financial institutions.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer and the industry and country in which each customer operates.
The Group has a number of large customers including Government agencies in the UK and overseas, major oil companies and other multinational corporations.
The ten largest customers of the Group accounted for approximately 20% of Group revenue 2016: 24%.
No customer accounted for more than 3% 2016: 4% of Group revenue.
New customers are subject to creditworthiness checks and credit limits are subject to approval by senior management.
Goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses so that in the event of non-payment the Group may have a secured claim.

Based on historic default rates, the Group believes that, apart from the amounts included in the table above, no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables.
b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group manages its cash resources and borrowings to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities as they fall due but in a manner designed to maximise the benefit of those resources whilst ensuring the security of investment resources.
The Group forecasts the profile of its cash requirements on a monthly basis and ensures that sufficient facilities are available to meet peak requirements which occur at predictable times in the year.
The Group manages the maturity profile of its borrowings by maintaining a regular dialogue with its lenders and ensuring that it commences the renegotiation of facilities sufficiently early to allow a comprehensive review of its requirements before completion.
The Groups revolving credit facilities extend over several accounting periods and fall due for renewal in different accounting periods ensuring that the Group negotiations with individual lenders follow an orderly process which does not expose the Group to the possibility of a significant reduction in available facilities in any single period.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had 71.8m 2016: 49.7m of undrawn committed bank facilities.

These transactional exposures are mainly to movement in the US Dollar and the Euro.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its transactional exposures.
Most forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
Forward exchange contracts which qualify as effective cash flow hedges are stated at fair value.
The principal translation exposures relate to the Norwegian Kroner.
The following table shows the impact on earnings of a 5% strengthening in the exchange rate in the Groups key currencies against Sterling.
The obverse movements would be of the same magnitude.
These amounts have been calculated by applying changes in exchange rates to the Groups foreign currency profits and losses and to financial instruments denominated in foreign currency.

The fair value of the financial assets has been assessed by the Directors with reference to the current prospects of the investments and risks associated with those prospects.
Fair value hierarchy The Group classifies fair value measurement using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs used in making measurements of fair value.
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: a Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: b Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and c Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

Company The Company has entered into transactions with its subsidiary undertakings primarily in respect of the provision of accounting services, finance and the provision of share options to employees of subsidiaries.
The amount outstanding from subsidiary undertakings to the Company at 31 December 2017 was 237.3m 2016: 196.7m.
Amounts owed to subsidiary undertakings by the Company at 31 December 2017 totalled 5.9m 2016: 15.0m.

30 Post balance sheet event On 19 February 2018, the Group acquired Cowan Manufacturing Pty Limited, based in New South Wales, Australia for 1.5m.
The business designs and sells portable hyperbaric chambers.
31 Significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year, are set out below.
31.1 Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements The results of subsidiaries are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control has passed.
Control exists when the Company controls an investee when the investor is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investees and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting from the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is passed to the Group.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Parent Company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Payment for the future services from employees or former owners are expensed.
Any payments to employees or former owners in respect of the acquisition of the business are capitalised.
This is carefully managed during the acquisition process so that former owners and or employees do not receive any incentive payments during an earn-out period.
Joint arrangements A joint arrangement is an arrangement over which the Group and one or more third parties have joint control.
These joint arrangements are in turn classified as: Joint ventures whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities: and Joint operations whereby the Group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement.
Any investment in joint ventures is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus the Groups post acquisition share in the change in net assets of the joint ventures, less any impairment provision.
The income statement reflects the Groups share of the post-tax result of the joint ventures.
The Groups share of any changes recognised by the joint venture in other comprehensive income are also recognised in other comprehensive income.
Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests represent the proportion of profit or loss and net assets not held by the Group and are presented separately in the income statement and in the consolidated statement of financial position.
On the acquisition of non-controlling interests, the difference between the consideration paid and the fair value of the share of net assets acquired is recognised in equity.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the noncontrolling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
98 JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 31 Significant accounting policies continued Company investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures In its separate financial statements the Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at cost.
Income is recognised from these investments when its right to receive the dividend is established.
31.2 Foreign currency Group The financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are prepared in their functional currency which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity are translated into UK Sterling, which is the Groups presentational currency.
i Foreign currency transactions in functional currency Transactions in currencies other than the entities functional currency are initially recorded at rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction.
At each subsequent balance sheet date: i Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at rates prevailing on the balance sheet date and any exchange differences recognised in the income statement: ii Non-monetary items measured at historical cost are not retranslated: and iii Non-monetary items measured at fair value are retranslated using exchange rates at the date the fair value was determined.
Where a gain or loss is recognised directly in equity, any exchange component is also recognised in equity and conversely where a gain or loss is recognised in the income statement, any exchange component is recognised in the income statement.
ii Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising on monetary items forming part of the Groups net investment in overseas subsidiary undertakings which are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary undertaking are taken directly to the translation reserve and subsequently recognised in the consolidated income statement on disposal of the net investment.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to provide an effective hedge against Group equity investments in foreign currency are taken directly to the translation reserve.
iii Translation from functional currency to presentational currency The assets and liabilities of operations, where the functional currency is different from the Groups presentational currency are translated at the period end exchange rates.
Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the reporting period.
All other exchange differences on transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Resulting exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income.
Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences included in the reserve are also dealt with in the translation reserve.
Company Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on settlement of monetary items or on the retranslation of monetary items at rates different from those at which they were initially recognised are taken to the income statement.
All exchange differences on assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are taken to the income statement, other than investments in foreign operations and foreign currency borrowings used to hedge those investments, where exchange differences are taken to the translation reserve.
31.3 Financial instruments a Loans and receivables These comprise non-derivative financial assets such as trade receivables, with fixed or determinable payments, that are not quoted in an active market.
Such assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, if the time value of money has a significant impact on their value, less any impairment losses.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans or receivables are derecognised, impaired or amortised.
If in a subsequent period the factors which indicated the original decision to impair the asset cease to exist, then the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed subject to the revised carrying value of the asset not exceeding its amortised cost at the date the impairment is reversed.
Any reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
b Available for sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are included as non-current assets unless intended to be disposed of within twelve months of the balance sheet date.
After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value with gains and losses being recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income until the investment is derecognised or deemed to be impaired, at which point the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the income statement in the period in which it arises.
Any impairment loss in respect of an available for sale asset is transferred from other comprehensive income to the income statement and any reversal of impairment loss is not recognised in the income statement.
Where investments are held in unlisted equity shares where there is no active market the investment is held at cost and is subject to an annual impairment review.
99 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 31 Significant accounting policies continued c Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments.
Assets are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement unless designated as a hedging instrument.
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from currency exposures, primarily relating to the US Dollar, Euro and Norwegian Krone.
It is also exposed to the risk of interest rate changes in its borrowings.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage risk, in the form of foreign currency contracts, to manage foreign exchange risk and interest rate swaps to reduce exposure to interest rate movements.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
All derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date that the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date.
Fair value is calculated by reference to current forward exchange contracts with similar maturity profiles, and for interest rate swaps determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
The recognition of the gains or losses arising on these movements in fair value depends on whether a derivative is designated as a hedge and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group recognises two classes of hedges for derivative financial instruments: Hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or recognised assets or liabilities cash flow hedge : and Hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or an unrecognised firm commitment fair value hedge.
i Cash flow hedges Cash flow hedges can include forward foreign currency contracts if the instrument is related to a foreign currency risk of a firm commitment, it involves the same currency as the hedged item, and it reduces the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Groups operations.
Cash flow hedges may also include interest rate swaps where the instrument is related to a recognised asset or a liability and it changes the character of the interest rate by converting a variable rate to a fixed rate.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges are recognised in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income.
Gains or losses arising on any portion deemed to be ineffective are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where the hedge relates to a firm commitment or forecast transaction which subsequently results in the recognition of an asset or liability, the cumulative gain or loss relating to that item is removed from equity and included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
Otherwise, the cumulative amount is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the related movements on the hedged transaction.
When the term of the hedging instrument expires or it is sold, or where the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss included in other comprehensive income is retained in equity until either the related forecast transaction occurs, in which case it is recognised in accordance with the policy stated above, or if the hedged transaction is not expected to take place, it is recognised immediately in the income statement.
ii Fair value hedges Where a derivative is designated as a hedge of the variability in the fair value of an asset or liability it is designated as a fair value hedge.
Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in the income statement at the same time as the related movements in the hedged asset or liability.
iii Interest-bearing loans and other borrowings All interest-bearing loans and other borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, which represents the fair value of the consideration received net of any issue costs associated with other borrowings.
Finance charges, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption of debt instruments including preference shares and the direct costs of issue, are accounted for on an amortised cost basis in the income statement.
Charges are calculated using the effective interest method, and are recognised in the income statement over the term of such instruments at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
iv Other Changes in the fair value of any derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting under any of the criteria outlined above are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using assumptions based on market conditions at the balance sheet date or discounted cash flow techniques.
d Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits included in the statement of financial position comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less from the original acquisition date.
Cash and cash equivalents included in the cash flow statement comprise cash and short-term deposits, net of bank overdrafts.
31.4 Intangible assets Intangible assets, excluding goodwill arising on a business combination, are stated at cost or fair value less any provision for impairment.
Intangible assets assessed as having finite lives are amortised over their estimated useful economic life and are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that they are impaired.
Amortisation charges are on a straight-line basis and recognised in the income statement.
Estimated useful lives are as follows: Development costs 5 years or over the expected period of product sales, if less Intellectual property 3 to 20 years Patents and licences 5 years or over the period of the licence, if less Other intangibles 5 years 100 JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 31 Significant accounting policies continued a Goodwill arising on a business combination Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary represents the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration over the aggregate fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is initially recognised at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Costs related to an acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities incurred in connection with a business combination, are expensed to the income statement.
The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment but more regularly if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired.
When an impairment loss is recognised it is not reversed in a subsequent accounting period, even if the circumstances which led to the impairment cease to exist.
b Acquired intangible assets Intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination including but not limited to customer relationships, supplier lists, patents and technology and that can be separately measured at fair value on a reliable basis are recorded initially at fair value and amortised over their expected useful life.
Amortisation is expensed to the consolidated income statement.
31.5 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment losses.
Refit costs relating to vessels are capitalised when incurred and amortised over their estimated useful economic life of 30 months.
Cost comprises expenditure incurred during construction, delivery and modification.
Where a substantial period of time is required to bring an asset into use, attributable finance costs are capitalised and included in the cost of the relevant asset.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment to their residual value in equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Freehold property 40 years Leasehold improvements 25 years or the period of the lease, if shorter Plant and equipment Between 5 and 20 years Vessels Between 10 and 25 years No depreciation is charged on assets under construction.
Residual values of vessels are set initially at 20% of purchase cost or fair value at acquisition, which the Directors believe to be an approximation of current residual values.
Residual values and estimated remaining lives are reviewed annually by the Directors and adjusted if appropriate to reflect the relevant market conditions and expectations, obsolescence and normal wear and tear.
31.6 Impairment of tangible and intangible assets At each reporting date the Group assesses whether there are any indications that an asset has been impaired.
If any indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the asset is made which is determined as the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
These calculations are determined for an individual asset unless that asset does not generate cash inflows independently from other assets, in which case its value is determined as part of that group of assets.
To assess the value in use, estimated future cash flows relating to the asset are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset.
Where the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
a Impairment of goodwill Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated against the appropriate combination of business units deemed to obtain advantage from the benefits acquired with the goodwill.
These are designated as cash generating units CGU.
Impairment is then assessed by comparing the recoverable amount of the relevant CGU with the carrying value of the CGUs goodwill.
Recoverable amount is measured as the higher of the CGUs fair value less cost to sell and the value in use.
Where the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
b Impairment of tangible and other intangible assets If any indication of a potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount is estimated to determine the extent of any impairment loss.
Assets are grouped together for this purpose at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
c Research and development costs Research expenditure is expensed in the income statement as incurred.
Expenditure on development which represents the application of research to the development of new products or processes is capitalised provided that specific projects are identifiable, technically feasible, and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The useful life of projects meeting the criteria for capitalisation is determined on a project by project basis.
Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost and amortised over its expected useful life on a straight-line basis.
Other development costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
If an event occurs after the recognition of an impairment that leads to a decrease in the amount of the impairment loss previously recognised the impairment loss is reversed.
The reversal is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
101 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 31 Significant accounting policies continued 31.7 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition.
Raw materials, consumables stores and finished goods for sale are stated at purchase cost on a first in first out basis.
Work in progress and finished goods are stated at the cost of direct materials and labour plus attributable overheads allocated on a systematic basis based on a normal level of activity.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less the estimated costs of completion and sale or disposal.
31.8 Taxation Corporation tax is provided on taxable profits from activities not qualifying for tonnage tax relief and is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected corporation tax payable or receivable in respect of the taxable profit for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, less any adjustments to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities included in the financial statements and the amounts used for tax purposes, that will result in an obligation to pay more, a right to pay less or to receive more tax, with the following exceptions: No provision is made where a deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affect neither accounting nor taxable profit: and No provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is probable that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences and unused tax losses and credits can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is expected to be realised or liability settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax arising on actuarial gains and losses relating to defined benefit pension funds is recorded in other comprehensive income.
Where the cash contributions made to the schemes exceed the service costs recognised in the income statement the current tax arising is recorded in other comprehensive income.
31.9 Leases A lease arrangement under which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership rest with the lessee are classified as finance leases and capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the related item or the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and a reduction in the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are expensed to the income statement.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful life of the asset.
All other leases are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
In preparation for the adoption of IFRS 16, Leases, in the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2019, management are in the process of assessing the potential impact.
31.10 Pension plans i Defined contribution schemes Pre-determined contributions paid to a separate privately administered pension plan are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Other than this contribution the Group has no further legal or constructive obligation to make further contributions to the scheme.
ii Defined benefit schemes A defined benefit scheme is a pension plan under which the amount of pension benefit that an employee receives on retirement is defined by reference to factors including age, years of service and compensation.
The schemes are funded by payments determined by periodic actuarial calculations agreed between the Group and the trustees of trustee-administered funds.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period current service cost and to current and prior periods to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
Current service costs are recognised in the income statement in the current year.
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement immediately.
When a settlement which eliminates all obligations for benefits already accrued or a curtailment which reduces future obligations as a result of a reduction in future entitlement occurs, the obligation and related plan assets are re-measured using current actuarial assumptions and any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
The interest element of the defined benefit charge is determined by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability at the start of the period and is recognised in the income statement.
A liability is recognised in the statement of financial position which represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of the scheme assets and is calculated separately for each scheme.
The defined benefit obligations represent the estimated amount of future benefits that employees have earned in return for their services in current and prior periods, discounted at a rate representing the yield on a high quality corporate bond at the balance sheet date, denominated in the same currency as the obligations, and having the same terms to maturity as the related pension liability, applied to the estimated future cash outflows arising from these obligations.
When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of economic benefits available from any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
102 JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 31 Significant accounting policies continued When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit related to past service by employees is recognised in profit or loss on a straightline basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses on experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income.
31.11 Share based payments Executive savings related share option schemes are operated under which options are granted to employees of the Group.
An expense is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding credit to equity in respect of the fair value of employee services rendered in exchange for options granted, which is determined by the fair value of the option at the date of grant.
The amount is expensed over a specified period until the options can be exercised the vesting period.
The fair value of an option is determined by the use of mathematical modelling techniques, including the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the Binomial model.
Non-market vesting conditions such as profitability and growth targets are excluded from the fair value calculation but included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
An estimate is made of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable at each balance sheet date.
Any adjustments to the original estimates are recognised in the income statement and equity over the remaining vesting period with any element of any adjustments relating to prior periods recognised in the current period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition such as total shareholder return of the Group relative to an index.
These are treated as vested irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
In addition to failure by the employee to exercise an option in accordance with the exercise period allowed by the scheme, an award made to an employee under a share option scheme is deemed to lapse when either the scheme is cancelled by the Company, or when an employee, who continues to qualify for membership of a scheme, ceases to pay contributions to that scheme.
In these circumstances the full remaining unexpired cost of the award is expensed in the period in which the option lapses.
Where the exercise of options is satisfied by the issue of shares by the Company the nominal value of any shares issued from the exercise of options is credited to share capital with the balance of the proceeds received, net of transaction costs, credited to share premium.
31.12 Short-term employee benefits The Group recognises a liability and an expense for short-term employee benefits, including bonuses, only when contractually or constructively obliged.
31.13 Share capital and reserves Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Costs attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted from equity from the proceeds.
a Treasury shares Shares issued by the Company which are held by the Company or its subsidiary entities including the Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT, are designated as treasury shares.
The cost of these shares is deducted from equity.
No gains or losses are recognised on the purchase, sale, cancellation or issue of treasury shares.
Consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity.
b Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP Company shares are held in an ESOP.
The finance costs and administration costs relating to the ESOP are charged to the income statement.
Dividend income arising on own shares is excluded in arriving at profit before taxation and deducted from aggregate dividends paid.
The Group maintains the following reserves: Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of operations whose financial statements are denominated in foreign currencies as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Companys net investment in a foreign subsidiary.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
31.14 Revenue recognition Revenue, after excluding trade discounts and value added tax, represents the provision of goods and services by the Group in the normal course of business and is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer.
The transfer of risks and rewards is assumed to pass to the customer on delivery of the goods or completion of the provision of the relevant services.
When the Group acts as a lessor for short-term spot rentals, revenue is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the hire.
a Construction contracts i General Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs relating to it are recognised in accordance with the stage of completion of the contract, in the period in which the work is performed.
To assess a construction contract at the outset, total contract costs are established by using supplier quotes for third party costs, internal hours based on experience, the nature of the project and the time taken for similar projects in the past, to which current labour rates are applied.
The stage of completion is assessed by reference to an output measure, such as deliverables completed or an input measure, such as physical progress, attributable man hours and costs incurred measured against the expected outcome depending on which is the most appropriate method for the specific type of contract.
Construction contract costs are monitored on a monthly basis and total expected costs incurred costs to date and expected costs to complete are reviewed against the original cost budget.
Progress made is reviewed to assess whether the long-term project is progressing in accordance with the planned level of completion on a regular basis.
Any cost overruns resulting in an expected total cost in excess of original budget results in a reduced margin being accounted for on the revenue recognised to date.
Revenue from the contract is under the percentage of completion method by reference to the assessed stage of completion of the contract.
Pre-determined ratios or percentages are not used in the estimation process.
103 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 31 Significant accounting policies continued In determining whether the outcome of a construction contract can be assessed reliably, the Group considers the nature of each contract, the experience of the project manager with this type of contract, whether it is similar to contracts delivered in the past, the customer, the time period over which the contract runs and forms a view of the likely risk in estimating the project outcome.
Contract costs incurred that relate to future activity are deferred and recognised as inventory.
When a loss is expected to be incurred on a construction contract it is recognised as an expense immediately in the income statement.
When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably no profit is recognised.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that costs incurred will be recovered.
Where the Group has a contract to design and assemble an asset followed by a long-term service contract to operate and maintain that asset, the revenue is recognised separately on the respective parts of the contract.
ii Bid costs All bid costs incurred relating to contracts for the design, manufacture or operation of assets or the provision of services to third parties are expensed to the income statement as incurred, except for those costs incurred after the point at which the contract award is virtually certain.
Directly attributable costs incurred subsequent to this point are included within contract costs and amortised over the life of the initial period of the contract to which they relate.
b Warranty costs Provision is made for warranties offered with products where it is probable that an obligation to transfer economic benefits to the customer in future will arise.
This provision is based on managements assessment of the previous history of claims and probability of future obligations arising on a product by product basis.
Provisions for warranty costs are set out in note 20.
31.15 Non-current assets held for sale On classification as held for sale, non-current assets are recognised at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale are included in profit or loss, as are any gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement.
31.16 Intra-group financial instruments Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
32 Significant accounting judgements and estimates In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Groups accounting policies and the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
The outcome may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed and revised on an on-going basis.
a Judgements Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements is included below: Financial and business risks The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial and business risks.
Where possible the Group seeks to minimise these risks through its risk management policies.
Impairment of goodwill Goodwill, which is set out in note 12, of 174.6m 2016: 165.0m is tested annually for any permanent impairment in accordance with the accounting policy in note 31.6.
The value in use of the Groups cash generating units CGU requires assumptions about future levels of demand, gross margins and cost inflation.
Inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting future cash flows is a key area of judgement.
If indicators of impairment exist the carrying value of goodwill is compared to its recoverable amount which represents the higher of the net present value of the CGUs forecast cash flow and its carrying value.
The assessment also includes sensitivity analysis to identify the range of outcomes and the validity of underlying assumptions.
Business combinations Business combinations are set out in note 23 and the Group makes an assessment of the fair values of the assets and liabilities arising in a business combination and of any related contingent consideration.
Judgement is applied in assessing appropriate fair values of the assets and liabilities required, identifying any intangible assets of the acquired business and in estimating the likelihood of contingent targets being achieved during the relevant period.
The outcome of contingent consideration arrangements depends on a number of factors outside the control of the business including, but not limited to competition, general economic conditions and the availability of resources within the business to meet its obligations to its customers.
The Group regularly assesses the likelihood of the targets being achieved during the performance period and makes appropriate adjustments to the provision for contingent consideration through the income statement.
The Group uses a discounted cash flow analysis to assess the value of contingent consideration.
Revenue Revenue is set out in notes 4 and 31.14.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and recovery of the consideration is probable.
The timing of the transfer of risks and rewards will vary depending on the terms of the sales agreement, the evaluation of the specific risks associated with the performance of the contract for example design, construction and testing or generally accepted practice where there are no specific arrangements in the contract.
Areas of judgement relate to construction contract accounting and specifically estimating the stage of completion and forecast outturn of the contract.
104 JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 32 Significant accounting judgements and estimates continued Income taxes Taxation is set out in notes 8, 9 and 31.8.
The Group is subject to income taxes in several jurisdictions.
Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax risk issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such difference will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
The Group has entered the UK tonnage tax regime under which tax on its ship owning and operating activities is based on the net tonnage of vessels operated.
Income and profits outside this regime are taxed under normal tax rules.
This means that it is necessary to make estimates of the allocation of some income and expenses between tonnage and non-tonnage tax activities.
These estimates are subject to agreement with the relevant tax authorities and may be revised in future periods.
Operating in overseas jurisdictions The Group operates in emerging markets which increases contractual, operational and financial risk with potentially uncertain or changing regulatory and political environments.
This is referred to in the Groups principal risks and uncertainties on page 21 and in note 26.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements the management form a judgement about the risk of exchange control regulations, political stability, potential changes to tax regions and operating environments.
b Assumptions and estimation uncertainties Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material misstatement to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the year ending 31 December 2018 is included in the following notes: Note 9 recognition of deferred tax assets, and the availability of future taxable profit against which tax losses carried forward can be used: Notes 12 and 13 impairment test of intangible assets and goodwill: key assumptions underlying recoverable amounts, including the recoverability of development costs: and Note 23 Business combinations.
33 Standards issued but not yet effective IFRS 15 and 16 are expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised.
It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance including IAS 18 Revenue, and IAS 11 Construction Contracts.
Sale of goods Revenue is currently recognised when the significant risk and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer which is assumed to pass on delivery of the goods.
Revenue is recognised at this point provided that the revenue and costs can be measured reliably, the recovery of the consideration is probable and there is no continuing management involvement with the goods.
Under IFRS 15, revenue will be recognised when a customer obtains control of the goods.
Rendering of Services The Group is involved in providing a range of services including submarine rescue services.
The transfer of risks and rewards is assumed to pass to the customer on delivery of the goods or stage of completion of the provision of the relevant services.
Under IFRS 15, the total consideration in the service contracts will be allocated to individual performance obligations as identified within the contract.
The stand-alone selling prices will be determined based on the list prices at which the Group sells such services in separate transactions.
The estimated negative impact on retained earnings at 1 January 2017 as a result of these changes in accounting for contracts that have not been completed at that date is 0.6m.
Construction Contracts Contract revenue and costs currently are recognised in accordance with the stage of completion of the contract, where the outcome can be estimated reliably, in the period in which the work is performed.
Under IFRS 15 performance obligations in contracts with customers are identified and the total contract value is allocated to each of the performance obligations identified.
Revenue is recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied.
For some of the goods that the Group provides, the customer controls all of the work in progress as the products are manufactured, or the goods manufactured are of a specialised nature.
The revenue from these contracts will be recognised as the products are manufactured in line with the performance over time criteria set out in IFRS 15.
Where the identification of IFRS 15 performance obligations gives rise to more or less recognition criteria than previous contracts is estimated to be an impact on revenue recognised.
The estimated negative impact on retained earnings at 1 January 2017 as a result of these changes in accounting for contracts that have not been completed at that date is approximately 4.5m.
Bid Costs Currently, all bid costs incurred relating to the design, manufacture or operation of assets or the provision of services to third parties are expensed, except for those incurred after the point at which the contract award is virtually certain that would not have arisen if the contract was not secured.
Under IFRS 15 management do not expect any significant changes to arise.
The Groups assessment indicates that this will result in a reduction of the opening retained earnings of 0.4m at 1 January 2017.
The Group will continue to work to finalise the impact of the new requirements of IFRS 15, including its subsidiaries and joint ventures.
As a result of this on-going work, it is possible that there may be changes to the impact outlined below.
However, these are not expected to be significant.
105 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 33 Standards issued but not yet effective continued Transition The Group plans to adopt IFRS 15 using the full retrospective method, utilising the practical expedients available.
As a result, the Group will apply the requirements of IFRS 15 to the comparative period presented together with its financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2018.
The expedients available are: Expedient 1 Contracts started and completed in the same annual reporting period.
An entity need not restate completed contracts that begin and end in the same annual reporting period: Expedient 1A Further, an entity can elect not to restate contracts that are completed contracts at the beginning of the earliest period presented: Expedient 2 That allows an entity to use the transaction price at the date on which the contract was completed, rather than estimating the variable consideration amounts in each comparative reporting period: Expedient 3 An entity need not separately evaluate the effect of contract modifications before the start of the earliest reporting period presented: and Expedient 4 An entity does not need to disclose for reporting periods presented before the date of initial application January 2018 : Amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations: and An explanation of when it expects to recognise the revenue The Groups assessment indicates that the adoption of these expedients will not result in a significantly different outcome.
Estimated impact of the adoption of IFRS 15 The Group is required to adopt IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers from 1 January 2018.
The Group has assessed the estimated impact that the initial application of IFRS 15 will have on its consolidated financial statements.
The estimated impact of the adoption of this standard on the Groups equity as at 1 January 2017 is based on assessments undertaken to date and is summarised below.
The actual impacts of adopting the standards as at 1 January 2018 may change because the new accounting policies are subject to change until the Group presents its first financial statements that include the date of initial application.
Estimates to 1 January may also change due to the adoption of the retrospective transition option.
Estimated adjustments Balance at 31 due to adoption Balance at 1 m December 2016 of IFRS 15 January 2017 Equity Retained earnings 217.0 5.0 212.0 The total estimated adjustment, net of tax, to the opening balance of the Groups equity at 1 January 2017 is 5.0m.
The estimated impact on the consolidated income statement in 2017 is to reduce revenue by approximately 6.0m and to reduce profit before taxation by 0.7m - 1.5m.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance including IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 requires lessees to reflect all leases on their balance sheet.
A lessee will recognise a right-of-use asset reflecting its right to use the asset and a lease liability recognising its obligation to make lease payments.
There are exceptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value items.
IFRS 16 replaces the straight-line operating lease expense with a depreciation charge for the right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities.
The Group has completed an initial assessment of the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements.
The actual impact of applying IFRS 16 on the financials statements in the period of initial application will depend on future economic conditions, including the Groups borrowing rate at 1 January 2019, the composition of the Groups lease portfolio at that date, the Groups latest assessment of whether it will exercise any renewal options and the extent to which the Group chooses to use the practical expedients and recognition exemptions.
The most significant impact is that the Group will recognise an asset and liability for its operating leases of vessels.
As at 31 December 2017, the Groups future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases of vessels amounted to 12.8m, on an undiscounted basis see note 28.
As part of its assessment the Group will determine whether it is appropriate to restate comparative information, or adopt a modified retrospective approach.
