RESTRUCTURING COSTS CONTINUED The cost optimisation programme Phase I announced in 2013 and Phase II announced in November 2016 is part of the Groups change in strategic direction to achieve a unique, non-recurring and fundamental transformation of the business.
The costs of factory closures and implementation of a standardised operating model are considered to be one off as they are a permanent scaling down of capacity and a once in a generation transformational change respectively.
The cost optimisation programme is a discrete project which, given its scale, will be delivered over a number of years and once delivered the associated restructuring costs will cease.
Costs of implementing cost savings that do not arise from the change in strategic direction are excluded from restructuring costs.
Cost optimisation programme costs of 383 million 2016: 222 million comprise 278 million incurred in restructuring our product manufacturing activities including France, Morocco, Russia and the US and 105 million in respect of restructuring overheads mainly by implementing a standardised operating model.
Of the remaining 8 million 2016: 85 million, 4 million 2016: 49 million of acquisition integration costs were in respect of the assets acquired from Lorillard in 2015 and 4 million 2016: 36 million of other restructuring activity was in respect of pre-2013 restructuring.
The cost optimisation programme Phase I is expected to have a cash implementation cost in the region of 600 million and generate savings of 300 million by 2018, and Phase II is expected to have a cash implementation cost in the region of 750 million, generating savings of a further 300 million by 2020.
In 2017 the cash cost of Phase I of the programme was 42 million 2016: 123 million, including cash impact of 1 above and 132 million 2016: nil for Phase II, bringing the cumulative net cash cost of the programme to 610 million Phase I 478 million, Phase II 132 million.

TAX CONTINUED FACTORS AFFECTING THE TAX CHARGE FOR THE YEAR The tax on the Groups profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the average of the enacted UK corporation tax rates for the year of 19.5 per cent 2016: 20.0 per cent as follows: million 2017 2016 Profit before tax 1,861 907 Tax at the UK corporation tax rate 363 181 Tax effects of: Differences in effective tax rates on overseas earnings 47 90 Movement in provision for uncertain tax positions 22 43 Remeasurement of deferred tax balances 4 101 Remeasurement of deferred tax balances arising from changes in tax rates 93 Deferred tax on unremitted earnings 42 Permanent differences 120 170 Adjustments in respect of prior years 3 35 Total tax charged to the consolidated income statement 414 238 Differences in effective tax rates on overseas earnings represents the impact of worldwide profits being taxed at rates different from 19.5 per cent.
The effective tax rate benefits from internal financing arrangements between group subsidiaries in different countries which are subject to differing tax rates and legislation and the application of double taxation treaties.
The movement between 2016 and 2017 is largely driven by changes in UK legislation enacted during 2017 which restrict the Groups ability to deduct interest in the UK.
Remeasurement of deferred tax balances of 101 million in 2016 mainly represented the recognition of deferred tax assets previously not recognised in relation to the Groups Spanish business, 89 million related to tax deductible amortisation and the balance of 12 million related to losses and other deferred tax assets.
The Groups assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on a review of underlying performance of subsidiaries, changes in tax legislation and the interpretation thereof and changes in the group structure.
Remeasurement of deferred tax balances arising from changes in tax rates of 93 million 2016: nil mainly represents the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities on French assets following the enactment of a future tax rate reduction which will be effective for the Group with effect from 1 October 2019.
During the year the Group has provided for deferred tax on unremitted earnings of 42 million 2016: nil.
The tax will arise on the distribution of profits through the Group and on planned group simplification.
Permanent differences include 10 million in respect of non-deductible exchange losses 2016: 79 million, 29 million 2016: 31 million in respect of non-deductible interest expense and 57 million 2016: nil in respect of taxable disposal of assets intra group.
MOVEMENT ON THE CURRENT TAX ACCOUNT million 2017 2016 At 1 October 239 111 Charged to the consolidated income statement 464 500 Credited charged to equity 3 6 Cash paid 570 401 Exchange movements 2 24 Other movements 5 1 At 30 September 123 239 The cash tax paid in the year is 106 million higher 2016: 99 million lower than the current tax charge.
This arises as a result of timing differences between the accrual of income taxes and the actual payment of cash and the movement in the provision for uncertain tax positions.

The Groups uncertain tax positions principally include cross border transfer pricing, interpretation of new or complex tax legislation and tax arising on the valuation of assets.
The Group is also monitoring developments in relation to EU State Aid investigations including the EU Commissions announcement on 26 October 2017 that it will be opening a State Aid investigation into the UKs Controlled Foreign Company regime.
The Group does not currently consider any provision is required in relation to EU State Aid.
The assessment of uncertain tax positions is subjective and significant management judgement is required.
This judgement is based on interpretation of legislation, management experience and professional advice.
Provisions arising from uncertain tax positions taken in the calculation of tax assets and liabilities are included within current tax liabilities.
At 30 September 2017 the total value of these provisions, including foreign exchange movements, was 190 million 2016: 165 million.
It is possible that amounts paid will be different from the amounts provided.
Management have assessed the Groups provision for uncertain tax positions and have concluded that apart from the French matter referred to below, the provisions in place are not material individually or in aggregate, and that a reasonably possible change in the next financial year would not have a material impact on the results of the Group.
In November 2015 the Group received a challenge from the French tax authorities that could lead to additional tax liabilities of up to 253 million.
The challenge concerns the valuation placed on the shares of Altadis Distribution France now known as Logista France following an intra-group transfer of the shares in October 2012 and the tax consequences flowing from a potentially higher value that is argued for by the tax authorities.
Based on professional advice, an amount of 42 million 2016: 41 million is included in the provision for uncertain tax positions.
On 29 March 2017 the UK notified the European Council in accordance with Article 50 2 of the Treaty on European Union of the UKs intention to withdraw from the European Union.
As an international business the Group is monitoring developments but does not currently consider any provision is required.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED The revenue for the period from the acquisition date to 30 September 2017 was 1.4 million, and net assets at 30 September 2017 were 1.2 million.
Intellectual property mainly comprises brands acquired in the USA in 2015 and through the purchases of Altadis in 2008 and Commonwealth Brands in 2007.
Supply agreements include Logistics customer relationships and exclusive supply arrangements in Cuba.
All were acquired as part of the Altadis purchase.
Intangible amortisation and impairment are included within administrative and other expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Amortisation and impairment in respect of intangible assets other than software and internally generated intellectual property are treated as reconciling items between reported operating profit and adjusted operating profit.
GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT REVIEW Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
For the Tobacco business CGUs are based on the markets where the business operates and are grouped in line with the divisional structure in operation during the year.
The groupings represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
A summary of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives is set out below.
2017 2016 Intangible Intangible assets with assets with million Goodwill indefinite lives Goodwill indefinite lives Returns Markets North 4,471 200 4,360 196 Returns Markets South 1,685 105 1,648 103 Growth 2,022 295 1,974 295 USA 2,351 2,427 Tobacco 10,529 600 10,409 594 Logistics 1,736 1,689 12,265 600 12,098 594 Goodwill has arisen principally on the acquisitions of Reemtsma in 2002 all CGU groupings, Commonwealth Brands in 2007 USA, Altadis in 2008 all CGU groupings and ITG Brands in 2015 USA.
The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that impairment may have arisen.
The value of a CGU, or group of CGUs as appropriate, is based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections derived from financial plans which are based on detailed bottom-up market-by-market forecasts of projected sales volumes for each product line.
These forecasts reflect, on an individual market basis, numerous assumptions and estimates regarding anticipated changes in market size, prices and duty regimes, consumer uptrading and downtrading, consumer preferences and other changes in product mix, based on long-term market trends, market data, anticipated regulatory developments, and management experience and expectations.
We consider that pricing, market size, market shares and cost inflation are the key assumptions used in our plans.
GROWTH RATES AND DISCOUNT RATES USED The compound annual growth rates implicit in these value-in-use calculations are shown below.
2017 Pre-tax Initial growth Long-term % discount rate rate growth rate Returns Markets North 9.1 0.3 1.8 Returns Markets South 10.3 2.1 1.8 1 Growth Markets 9.2-20.0 9.0 -113 1.2-4.0 USA 9.9 0.7 2.5 Logistics 9.1 17.8 1.8 1.
Initial growth rate for the Russian CGU is calculated for years 2 to 5 of the initial five year forecast period.
100 Imperial Brands|Annual Report and Accounts 2017 OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS Cash flows from the business plan period are extrapolated out to year five using the implicit growth rate, shown in the table on the previous page as the initial growth rate.
Estimated long-term weighted average compound growth rates of between 1.2 per cent and 4.0 per cent are used beyond year five.
Long-term growth rates are based on managements long-term expectations, taking account of industry specific factors such as the nature of our products, the role of excise in government fiscal policy, and relatively stable and predictable long-term macro trends in the Tobacco industry.
Discount rates used are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the different risk profiles of the CGUs.
Our impairment projections are prepared under the basis set out in IAS 36 which can differ from our internal plans.
In particular, the restrictions of IAS 36 mean that the impairment assessment prepared in relation to Drive Growth does not include the expected contribution from our next generation products NGP portfolio in any of those territories where we plan to launch these products but have not yet done so.
Accordingly, we anticipate that we will generate additional cash flows over the forecast period.
GROWTH MARKETS Within our Growth Markets reporting segment, there are a number of CGU groupings based on our operating segments, including Drive Growth and Other Premium Cigar.
The Drive Growth CGU grouping includes our markets in Russia, Italy, Japan and Turkey.
Our impairment test for this CGU grouping indicated headroom of 33 million and that an impairment would result in the event of relatively small changes in an individual assumption or assumptions.
The major market in this CGU grouping is Russia.
During the period, a strategic investment programme was initiated in a number of our priority markets, including Russia, in order to enhance the growth opportunity for our business.
This investment included initiatives to build long-term improvement in our market share and support a consistent pricing strategy.
The actions involved in this programme reflect our confidence in the ongoing opportunity for sustainable growth offered by the Russian market despite it being a very competitive market.
The consequence of these actions reduced net cash flows in the current period, but is expected to deliver significantly higher growth and profitability in future years.
The Russian market experienced a period of intense competition in 2017 and this, coupled with the cost of our strategic investment programme, has had a significant negative impact on cash flows in the year.
We have subsequently reassessed our forecasts for the next five years which are based on the expectation that, consistent with recent market trends, a steady market recovery will occur.
The combination of an improving market and the benefit of our strategic investment in Russia means that we expect a return to profit in 2018 and then to achieve a compound annual growth rate of 113 per cent over the subsequent four years which would see the business return to profit levels equivalent to those achieved in 2015 and 2016.
This is based on a 10.3 per cent per annum increase in net revenue over the same period.
In addition, the impairment test assumed a 100 basis point reduction in the post-tax discount rate, from 13.5 per cent to 12.5 per cent for the Russian market reflecting the improved macro-economic factors.
The long-term growth rate of 4.0 per cent has remained consistent with the prior year.
Any one or combination of the following changes in assumptions in the Russian CGU could represent a reasonably possible scenario: 100 basis point increase in the post-tax Russian discount rate impact of 49 million 10 per cent reduction in Russian cash flows impact of 46 million 10 per cent devaluation of the Russian rouble impact of 42 million The inclusion of NGP cash flows would lead to a further increase in headroom.
Our impairment testing confirms that there are sufficient future cash flows to support the current carrying values.
Taking account of all of these factors, we have concluded that the carrying value for the Drive Growth CGU grouping included in our 30 September 2017 balance sheet is appropriate, but remains highly sensitive to adverse movements in any individual assumption or assumptions.
OTHER CGU GROUPINGS For the rest of the Group, any reasonable movement in the assumptions used in the impairment tests would not result in an impairment.

FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW In the normal course of business, the Group is exposed to financial risks including, but not limited to, market, credit and liquidity risk.
This note explains the Groups exposure to these risks, how they are measured and assessed, and summarises the policies and processes used to manage them, including those related to the management of capital.
The Group operates a centralised treasury function which is responsible for the management of the financial risks of the Group, together with its financing and liquidity requirements.
Financial risks comprise, but are not limited to, exposures to funding and liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and counterparty credit risk.
The treasury function is also responsible for the financial risk management of the Groups global defined benefit pension schemes and management of Group-wide insurance programmes.
The treasury function does not operate as a profit centre, nor does it enter into speculative transactions.
106 Imperial Brands|Annual Report and Accounts 2017 OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS The Groups treasury activities are overseen by the Treasury Committee, which meets regularly throughout the year when needed and comprises the Chief Financial Officer, the Company Secretary, the Deputy Chief Financial Officer and other senior management from finance and treasury.
The Treasury Committee operates in accordance with the terms of reference set out by the Board and a framework the Treasury Committee framework which sets out the expectations and boundaries to assist in the effective oversight of treasury activities.
The Director of Treasury reports on a regular basis to the Treasury Committee.
The Board reviews and approves all major treasury decisions.
The Groups management of financial risks cover the following: A MARKET RISK PRICE RISK The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk other than assets held by its pension funds disclosed in note 22.
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in that there may be fluctuations in the price of tobacco leaf.
As with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf tends to be cyclical as supply and demand considerations influence tobacco plantings in those countries where tobacco is grown.
Also, different regions may experience variations in weather patterns that may affect crop quality or supply and so lead to changes in price.
The Group seeks to reduce this price risk by sourcing tobacco leaf from a number of different countries and counterparties and by varying the levels of tobacco leaf held.
Currently, these techniques reduce the expected exposure to this risk over the short to medium term to levels considered not material and accordingly, no sensitivity analysis has been presented.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates due to its commercial trading transactions and profits denominated in foreign currencies, as well as the translation of cash, borrowings and derivatives held in non-functional currencies.
The Groups financial results are principally exposed to fluctuations in euro and US dollar exchange rates.
Management of the Groups foreign exchange transaction and translation risk is addressed below.
TRANSACTION RISK The Groups material transaction exposures arise on costs denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of subsidiaries, including the purchase of tobacco leaf, which is sourced from various countries but purchased principally in US dollars, and packaging materials which are sourced from various countries and purchased in a number of currencies.
The Group is also exposed to transaction foreign exchange risk on the conversion of foreign subsidiary earnings into sterling to fund the external dividends to shareholders.
This is managed by selling euros and US dollars monthly throughout the year.
Other foreign currency flows are matched where possible and remaining foreign currency transaction exposures are not hedged.
TRANSLATION RISK The Group seeks to broadly match the currency of borrowings to the currency of its underlying investments in overseas subsidiaries, which are primarily euros and US dollars.
The Group issues debt in the most appropriate market or markets at the time of raising new finance and has a policy of using derivative financial instruments, cross-currency swaps, to change the currency of debt as required.
Borrowings denominated in, or swapped into foreign currencies to match the Groups investments in overseas subsidiaries are treated as a hedge against the net investment where appropriate.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rate movements, which impacts the translation of monetary items held by subsidiary companies in currencies other than their functional currencies, is illustrated on an indicative basis below.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that net debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain constant, and that there is no change to the net investment hedge designations in place at 30 September 2017.
The sensitivity analysis does not reflect any change to revenue or non-finance costs that may result from changing exchange rates, and ignores any taxation implications and offsetting effects of movements in the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
2017 2016 Increase in Increase in million income income Income statement impact of non-functional currency foreign exchange exposures: 10% appreciation of euro 2016: 10% 491 458 10% appreciation of US dollar 2016: 10% 111 46 An equivalent depreciation in the above currencies would cause a decrease in income of 600 million and 136 million for euro and US dollar exchange rates respectively 2016: 560 million and 57 million.

FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS CONTINUED Movements in equity in the table below relate to hedging instruments designated as net investment hedges in hedging the Groups euro denominated assets.
2017 2016 Change in Change in million equity equity Equity impact of non-functional currency foreign exchange exposures: 10% appreciation of euro 2016: 10% 484 494 10% appreciation of US dollar 2016: 10% 20 83 An equivalent depreciation in the above currencies would result in a change in equity of -591 million and -24 million for euro and US dollar exchange rates respectively 2016: -604 million and -102 million.
At 30 September 2017, after the effect of derivative financial instruments, approximately -1 per cent 2016: -1 per cent of the Groups net debt was denominated in sterling, 62 per cent in euro 2016: 58 per cent, 42 per cent in US dollars 2016: 43 per cent, and -3 per cent in other currencies 2016: nil per cent.
INTEREST RATE RISK The Groups interest rate risk arises from its borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents, with the primary exposures arising from fluctuations in euro and US dollar interest rates.
Borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group manages its exposure to interest rate risk on its borrowings by entering into derivative financial instruments, interest rate swaps, to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt in accordance with the Treasury Committee framework and Treasury Committee discussions.
As at 30 September 2017, after adjusting for the effect of derivative financial instruments detailed in note 20, approximately 75 per cent 2016: 71 per cent of net debt was at fixed rates of interest and 25 per cent 2016: 29 per cent was at floating rates of interest.
INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The Groups sensitivity to interest rates on its euro and US dollar monetary items which are primarily external borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, is illustrated on an indicative basis below.
The impact in the Groups Income Statement reflects the effect on net finance costs in respect of the Groups net debt and the fixed to floating rate debt ratio prevailing at 30 September 2017, ignoring any taxation implications and offsetting effects of movements in the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that net debt and the derivatives portfolio remain constant and that there is no net impact on other comprehensive income 2016: nil.
The movement in interest rates is considered reasonable for the purpose of this analysis and the estimated effect assumes a lower limit of zero for interest rates where relevant.
2017 2016 Change in Change in million income income Income statement impact of interest rate movements: - 1% increase in euro interest rates 2016: 1% 12 17 - 1% increase in US dollar interest rates 2016: 1% 20 23 B CREDIT RISK The Group is primarily exposed to credit risk arising from trade receivables due from its customers, cash deposits and other amounts due from external financial counterparties on other financial instruments.
The maximum aggregate credit risk to these sources was considered to be 3,633 million at 30 September 2017 2016: 4,860 million.
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES The Group has some significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
In order to manage its exposure to customer credit risk, policies have been implemented to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history, with non-recourse factoring arrangements and credit support guarantees being used and obtained where appropriate.
Analysis of trade and other receivables is provided in note 15.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS In order to manage its credit risk to any one counterparty, the Group places cash deposits and enters into derivative financial instruments with a diversified group of financial institutions carrying suitable credit ratings in line with the Treasury Committee framework.
Utilisation of counterparty credit limits is regularly monitored by treasury and ISDA agreements are in place to permit the net settlement of assets and liabilities in certain circumstances.
In a few historical cases, collateral has been deposited against derivative financial liabilities and supported by an ISDA Credit Support Annex.
The table overleaf summarises the Groups largest exposures to financial counterparties as at 30 September 2017.
At the balance sheet date management does not expect these counterparties to default on their current obligations.
The impact of the Groups own credit risk on the fair value of derivatives and other obligations held at fair value is not considered to be material.

To manage this risk the Group has a policy of actively maintaining a mixture of short, medium and long-term committed facilities that are structured to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds to meet the forecast requirements of the Group over the short to medium term.
To prevent over-reliance on individual sources of liquidity, funding is provided across a range of instruments including debt capital market issuance, bank term loans, bank revolving credit facilities and European commercial paper.
The Group primarily borrows centrally in order to meet forecast funding requirements, and the treasury function is in regular dialogue with subsidiary companies to ensure their liquidity needs are met.
Subsidiary companies are funded by a combination of share capital and retained earnings, intercompany loans, and in very limited cases through external local borrowings.
Cash pooling processes are used to centralise surplus cash held by subsidiaries where possible in order to minimise external borrowing requirements and interest costs.
Treasury invests surplus cash in bank deposits and uses foreign exchange contracts to manage short-term liquidity requirements in line with short-term cash flow forecasts.
As at 30 September 2017, the Group held liquid assets of 624 million 2016: 1,274 million.
The table below summarises the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities by maturity based on their contractual cash flows as at 30 September 2017.
The amounts disclosed are undiscounted cash flows calculated using spot rates of exchange prevailing at the relevant balance sheet date.

Besides the minimum capitalisation rules that may apply to subsidiaries in different countries, the Groups only external imposed capital requirements are interest cover and gearing covenants contained within its core external bank debt facilities, with which the Group was fully compliant during the current and prior periods and expects to be so going forward.
The Group continues to target an investment grade credit rating which it monitors by reference to a number of key financial ratios, including ongoing consideration of the return of capital to shareholders via regular dividend payments and in ongoing discussions with the relevant ratings agencies.
As at 30 September 2017 the Group was rated Baa3 stable outlook by Moodys Investor Service Ltd, BBB stable outlook by Standard and Poors Credit Market Services Europe Limited and BBB stable outlook by Fitch Ratings Limited.

As a result, and as permitted under IAS 39, the Group has decided not to apply cash flow or fair value hedge accounting in respect of these transactions.
The Group does apply hedge accounting in respect of certain net investments in foreign operations where appropriate.
The hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is a hedge of the translation foreign currency risk arising on the foreign operation.
As at 30 September 2017 the Group had made net investment hedge designations in foreign operations in respect of external euro borrowings with a carrying value of 4,250 million 2016: 4,387 million, US dollar borrowings with a carrying value of $7,050 million 2016: $7,950 million, and cross-currency swaps with a notional value of 4,164 million 2016: 3,871 million.
The Group also treats certain permanent intragroup loans that meet relevant qualifying criteria under IAS 21 as part of its net investment in foreign operations where appropriate.
Intragroup loans with a notional value of 2,381 million 2016: 1,943 million and US dollar loans with a notional value of $6,761 million 2016: $6,761 million were treated as part of the Groups net investment in foreign operations at the balance sheet date.
FAIR VALUE ESTIMATION AND HIERARCHY All financial assets and liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at amortised cost, other than derivative financial instruments which are carried at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data such as yield curves and foreign exchange rates as at the balance sheet date Level 2 classification hierarchy per IFRS 7 as detailed in note 20.
There were no changes to the valuation methods or transfers between hierarchies during the year.
With the exception of capital market issuance, the fair value of all financial assets and financial liabilities is considered approximate to their carrying amount as outlined in note 18.
NETTING ARRANGEMENTS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The following tables set out the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities that are subject to netting and set-off arrangements.
Financial assets and liabilities that are subject to set-off arrangements and disclosed on a net basis in the Groups Balance Sheet primarily relate to cash pooling arrangements and collateral in respect of derivative financial instruments under ISDA Credit Support Annex.
Amounts which do not meet the criteria for offsetting on the balance sheet but could be settled net in certain circumstances principally relate to derivative transactions executed under ISDA agreements where each party has the option to settle amounts on a net basis in the event of default of the other party.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED MATURITY OF OBLIGATIONS UNDER DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Derivative financial instruments have been classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current on an undiscounted contractual basis based on spot rates as at the balance sheet date.
Some of the Groups derivative financial instruments contain early termination options.
For the purposes of the above and following analysis, maturity dates have been based on the likelihood of an option being exercised with consideration to counterparty expectations and market conditions prevailing as at 30 September 2017.
Any collateral transferred to counterparties in respect of derivative financial liabilities has been classified consistently with the related underlying derivative.
The table below summarises the Groups derivative financial instruments by maturity based on their remaining contractual cash flows as at 30 September 2017.
The amounts disclosed are the undiscounted cash flows calculated using spot rates of exchange prevailing at the relevant balance sheet date.

Foreign exchange contracts are used to manage the Groups short-term liquidity requirements in line with cash flow forecasts as appropriate.
The Group does not apply cash flow or fair value hedge accounting, as permitted under IAS 39, which results in fair value gains and losses attributable to derivative financial instruments being recognised in net finance costs unless they are designated as hedges of a net investment in foreign operations, in which case they are recognised in other comprehensive income.
INTEREST RATE SWAPS To manage interest rate risk on its borrowings, the Group issues debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance with regard to currency, interest denomination or duration and then uses interest rate swaps to re-base the debt into the appropriate proportions of fixed and floating interest rates where necessary.
Interest rate swaps are also transacted to manage and re-profile the Groups interest rate risk over the short, medium and long term in accordance with the Treasury Committee framework and Treasury Committee discussions.
Fair value movements are recognised in net finance costs in the relevant reporting period.

As at the balance sheet date, deferred tax assets of 106 million 2016: 125 million have not been recognised due to the potential uncertainty of the utilisation of the underlying tax losses in certain jurisdictions.
Of these unrecognised deferred tax assets 7million are expected to expire in 2018, nil 2016: 9 million are expected to expire within five years and nil 2016: nil are expected to expire between 2023 and 2028.
Also within other temporary differences, deferred tax assets of 33 million 2016: 15 million are recognised for tax credits carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the tax related benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
Deferred tax assets of143 million 2016: 159 million have not been recognised due to the potential uncertainty of the utilisation of the credits.
Of these unrecognised deferred tax assets 44 million 2016: 63 million are expected to expire between 2022 and 2028.
We have reviewed the recoverability of deferred tax assets in overseas territories in the light of forecast business performance.
In2016 we recognised deferred tax assets of 118 million previously not recognised on the basis that it is more likely than not that these are recoverable.
No material movement has arisen in 2017.
A deferred tax liability of 89 million 2016: 50 million is recognised in respect of taxation expected to arise on the future distribution of unremitted earnings totalling 8 billion 2016: 1.6 billion.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 140 million 2016: 5 billion.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
2 Act 2015 and the Finance Bill 2016 have the reduced the UK corporation tax rate to 19 per cent from 1 April 2017 and to 17 per cent from 1 April 2020.
These proposed changes are reflected in the deferred tax balances.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES The Group operates a number of retirement benefit schemes for its employees, including both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
The Groups three principal schemes are defined benefit schemes and are operated by Imperial Tobacco Limited in the UK, Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH in Germany and ITG Brands in the USA: these schemes represent 64 per cent, 11 per cent and 8 per cent of the Groups total defined benefit obligations and 44 per cent, 23 per cent and 8 per cent of the current service cost respectively.
IMPERIAL TOBACCO PENSION FUND The UK scheme, the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund or ITPF, is a voluntary final salary pension scheme with a normal retirement age of 60 for most members.
The ITPF was offered to employees who joined the Company before 1 October 2010 and has a weighted average maturity of 18 years.
The population comprises 65 per cent in respect of pensioners, 32 per cent in respect of deferred members and 3 per cent in respect of current employees.
New employees in the UK are now offered a defined contribution scheme.
Should surplus funds arise in the defined benefit section they may be used to finance defined contribution section contributions on the Companys behalf with company contributions reduced accordingly.
The ITPF operates under trust law and is managed and administered by the Trustees on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation.
The ITPFs assets are held by the trust.
Annual increases in benefits in payment are dependent on inflation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable under the ITPF are future inflation levels including the impact of inflation on future salary increases and any salary increases above inflation and the actual longevity of the membership.
The contributions paid to the ITPF are set by the ITPF Scheme Actuary every three years.
The Scheme Actuary is an external consultant, appointed by the Trustees.
Principal factors that the Scheme Actuary will have regard to include the covenant offered by the Group, the level of risk in the ITPF, the expected returns on the ITPFs assets, the results of the funding assessment on an ongoing basis and the expected cost of securing benefits if the fund were to be wound up.
The latest valuation of the ITPF was carried out as at 31 March 2016 when the market value of the invested assets was 3,302 million.
Based on the ongoing funding target the total assets were sufficient to cover 96 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members for past service, after allowing for expected future pay increases.
The total assets were sufficient to cover 90 per cent of the total benefits that had accrued to members for past service and future service benefits for current members.
In compliance with the Pensions Act 2004, Imperial Tobacco Limited and the Trustee agreed a scheme-specific funding target, a statement of funding principles and a schedule of contributions accordingly.
Following the valuation, the level of employers contributions to the scheme was increased from 65 million per year.
The Company paid 75 million in the year to 31 March 2017 and agreed to pay 80 million in the year to 31 March 2018 and 85 million each year for the subsequent 13 years.
Further contributions were agreed to be paid by the Company in the event of a downgrade of the Groups credit rating to non-investment grade by either Standard & Poors or Moodys.
In addition, surety guarantees with a total value of 600 million and a parental guarantee with Imperial Brands PLC have been put in place.
The Scheme Actuary prepares an annual update of the funding position as at 31 March each year.
The latest annual update on an ongoing basis was carried out as at 31 March 2016 and showed a deficit of 382 million in relation to past service accrued benefits.
The main risk for the Group in respect of the ITPF is that additional contributions are required if the investment returns are not sufficient to pay for the benefits which will be influenced by the factors noted above.
The level of equity returns will be a key determinant of overall investment return.
The investment portfolio is also subject to a range of other risks typical of the asset classes held, in particular exposure to equity markets, credit risk on bonds and exposure to the property market.
The IAS 19 liability measurement of the defined benefit obligation DBO and the current service cost are sensitive to the assumptions made about future inflation and salary growth levels, as well as the assumptions made about life expectation.
They are also sensitive to the discount rate, which depends on market yields on sterling denominated AA corporate bonds.
The main differences between the funding and IAS 19 assumptions are a more prudent longevity assumption for funding and a different approach to setting the discount rate.
A consequence of the ITPFs investment strategy, with a significant proportion of the assets invested in equities and other return-seeking assets, is that the difference between the market value of the assets and the IAS 19 liabilities may be relatively volatile.
A past service credit of 81 million has been recognised during the year as a result of the introduction of a pension cap effective from 1 September 2017.
The past service cost has been calculated using assumptions based on the market conditions as at 31 August 2017, to reflect the date around which the agreed changes were communicated to members following a consultation period.
THE REEMTSMA CIGARETTENFABRIKEN PENSION PLAN The German scheme, the Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken Pension Plan RCPP, is primarily a career average pension plan that is open to new entrants, though a small closed group of members has final salary benefits.
It has a weighted average maturity of 18 years.
The scheme population comprises 52 per cent in respect of pensioners, 16 per cent in respect of deferred members and 32 per cent inrespect of current employees.
com 115 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 22.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES CONTINUED The plan is unfunded and the company pays benefits as they arise.
The plans obligations arise under a works council agreement and are subject to standard German legal requirements around such matters as the benefits to be provided to employees who leave service, and pension increases in payment.
Over the next year Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH expects to pay 23 million in respect of benefits.
Annual increases in benefits in payment are dependent on inflation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable under the plan are future inflation levels and the actual longevity of the membership.
The IAS 19 liability measurement of the DBO and the current service cost are sensitive to the assumptions made about the above variables, as well as the discount rate, which depends on market yields on euro denominated AA corporate bonds.
ITG BRANDS HOURLY PENSION PLAN The main USA pension scheme, the ITG Brands Hourly Pension Plan ITGBH, is a defined benefit pension plan that is open to new entrants.
It has a weighted average maturity of 11 years.
The population comprises 71 per cent in respect of pensioners, 10 per cent inrespect of deferred members and 19 per cent in respect of current employees.
The plan is funded and benefits are paid from the plan assets.
Contributions to the plan are determined based on US regulatory requirements and ITG Brands is not expected to make any contributions in the next year.
Annual benefits in payment are assumed not to increase from current levels.
The main uncertainty affecting the level of benefits payable under the plan is the actual longevity of the membership.
Other key uncertainties impacting the plan include investment risk and potential past service benefit changes from future negotiations.
The IAS 19 liability measurement of the DBO and the service cost are sensitive to the assumptions made about the above variables, aswell as the discount rate, which depends on market yields on US dollar denominated AA corporate bonds.
OTHER PLANS Other plans of the Group include various pension plans, other post-employment and long-term employee benefit plans in several countries of operation.
Many of the plans are funded, with assets backing the obligations held in separate legal vehicles such as trusts, others are operated on an unfunded basis.
The benefits provided, the approach to funding and the legal basis of the plans reflect their local territories.
IAS 19 requires that the discount rate for calculating the DBO and service cost is set according to the level of relevant market yields on corporate bonds where the market is considered deep, or government bonds where it is not.
The results of the most recent available actuarial valuations for the various plans have been updated to 30 September 2017 in order to determine the amounts to be included in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The aggregate IAS 19 position is as follows: 116 Imperial Brands|Annual Report and Accounts 2017 OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS 2017 2016 million DBO Assets Total DBO Assets Total At 1 October 6,099 4,620 1,479 4,790 3,973 817 Consolidated income statement expense Current service cost 64 64 57 57 Past service credit Spanish free tobacco settlement 32 32 Past service credits 91 91 16 16 Cost of termination benefits 10 10 7 7 Net interest expense income on net defined benefit liability asset 132 107 25 162 143 19 Administration costs paid from plan assets 3 3 3 3 Cost recognised in the income statement 11 38 Remeasurements Actuarial gain due to liability experience 204 204 52 52 Actuarial gain loss due to financial assumption changes 299 299 1,160 1,160 Actuarial gain loss due to demographic assumption changes 25 25 10 10 Return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net interest expense income above 121 121 494 494 Remeasurement effects recognised in other comprehensive income 649 604 Cash Employer contributions 140 140 127 127 Employee contributions 1 1 1 1 Benefits paid directly by the company 46 46 43 43 Benefits paid from plan assets 205 205 202 202 Net cash 140 127 Other Obligations and assets of acquired operations 1 Spanish free tobacco settlement 27 13 14 Exchange movements 12 3 15 304 143 161 Total other 15 147 At 30 September 5,448 4,732 716 6,099 4,620 1,479 1.
During the year ended 30 September 2016 we reached agreements in Spain with both current employees and a proportion of pensioners who would have received or had previously received payments in respect of former entitlements to free cigarettes to accept one-off cash payments in full settlement.
Payments to current employees were disbursed during the year.
The cash settlement to pensioners was paid in October 2016 and the liability was recognised in the balance sheet at 30 September 2016 in other liabilities.
Termination benefits in the year ended 30 September 2017 mainly relate to restructuring activity in Germany.
The past service credit arises as a result of the implementation of a salary cap on the UK pension fund.

SHARE SCHEMES The Group operates four types of share-based incentive programmes, designed to incentivise staff and to encourage them to build a stake in the Group.
SHARE MATCHING SCHEME Awards are made to eligible employees who are invited to invest a proportion of their eligible bonus in shares for a period of three years, after which matching shares are awarded on a 1:1 ratio, plus dividend equivalents.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN LTIP Awards of shares under the LTIP are made to the Executive Directors and senior executives at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
They vest three years after grant and are subject to performance criteria.
Dividend equivalents accrue on vested shares.
SHARESAVE PLAN Options are granted to eligible employees who participate in a designated savings scheme for a three year period.
Historically there were also granted for a five year period.
DISCRETIONARY SHARE AWARDS PLAN DSAP Under the DSAP, one-off conditional awards are made to individuals to recognise exceptional contributions within the business.
Awards, which are not subject to performance conditions and under which vested shares do not attract dividend roll-up, will normally vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant subject to the participants continued employment.
The limit of an award under the DSAP is capped at 25 per cent of the participants salary at the date of grant.
Shares used to settle awards under the DSAP will be market purchased.
Further details of the schemes including additional criteria applying to Directors and some senior executives are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES BASIS OF PREPARATION AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH FRS 101 These financial statements were prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101 and applicable accounting standards.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
As permitted by section 408 3 of the Companies Act 2006, no separate profit and loss account has been presented for the Company.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available in the preparation of the financial statements, as detailed below: Paragraph 38 of IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements comparative information requirements in respect of: i paragraph 79 a iv of IAS 1: ii paragraph 118 e of IAS 38 Intangible assets reconciliations between the carrying amount at the beginning and end of the period: The following paragraphs of IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements: i 10 d statement of cash flows: ii 10 f a statement of financial position as at the beginning of the preceding period when an entity applied an accounting policy retrospectively or makes a retrospective restatement of items in its financial statements, or when it reclassifies items in its financial statements: iii 16 statement of compliance with all IFRS: iv 38A requirement for minimum of two primary statements, including cash flow statements: v 38B-D additional comparative information: vi 40A-D requirements for a third statement of financial position: vii 111 cash flow information: and viii 134-136 capital management disclosures: IAS 7 Statement of cash flows: Paragraph 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors requirement for the disclosure of information when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has been issued but is not yet effective: Paragraph 17 of IAS 24 Related party disclosures key management compensation: The requirements in IAS 24 Related party disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: and Paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13 Fair value measurement disclosure of valuation techniques and inputs used for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities.
The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, are set out below.
INVESTMENTS Investments held as fixed assets comprise the Companys investment in subsidiaries and are shown at historic purchase cost less any provision for impairment.
Investments are tested for impairment annually to ensure that the carrying value of the investment is supported by their recoverable amount.
DIVIDENDS Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders, whereas interim dividends are recognised in the period in which the dividends are paid.
Dividends receivable are recognised as an asset when they are approved.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument.
Financial assets are fide-recognised when the rights to receive benefits have expired or been transferred, and the Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial liabilities are fide-recognised when the obligation is extinguished.
Non-derivative financial assets are classified as loans and receivables.
Receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, subject to reduction for allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
A provision for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of those receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, and is recognised in the income statement.
For interest-bearing assets, the carrying value includes accrued interest receivable.
com 127 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF IMPERIAL BRANDS PLC continued I.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as loans and payables.
Payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
For borrowings, the carrying value includes accrued interest payable.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held on call, together with other short-term highly liquid investments.
TREASURY SHARES When the Company purchases its own equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity until the shares are reissued or disposed of.
When such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, increases shareholders funds.

GUARANTEES Imperial Brands PLC has guaranteed various borrowings and liabilities of certain UK and overseas subsidiary undertakings, including various Dutch and Irish subsidiaries.
At 30 September 2017, the contingent liability totalled 16,981 million 2016: 18,138 million.
The guarantees include the Dutch subsidiaries, all of which are included in the consolidated financial statements as at 30 September 2017 and which, in accordance with Book 2, Article 403 of The Netherlands Civil Code, do not file separate financial statements with the Chamber of Commerce.
Under the same article, Imperial Brands PLC has issued declarations to assume any and all liabilities for any and all debts of the Dutch subsidiaries.
The guarantees also cover the Irish subsidiaries, all of which are included in the consolidated financial statements as at 30 September 2017.
The Irish companies, namely John Player & Sons Limited and Imperial Tobacco Mullingar, have therefore availed themselves of the exemption provided by section 17 of the Irish Companies Amendment Act 1986 in respect of documents required to be attached to the annual returns for such companies.
The Company has also provided a parental guarantee over the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund.
The Directors have assessed the fair value of the above guarantees and do not consider them to be material.
They have therefore not been recognised on the balance sheet.
RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURES Details of Directors emoluments and interests are provided within the Directors Remuneration Report.
